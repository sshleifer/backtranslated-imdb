The first movie at the Fangoria festival in Vegas and the most challenging. It's not a movie for everyone. A number of the films that followed used predictable classic horror formulas to tell predictable stories. This picture was determined to do his own thing. <br /> <br /> Tom Savini showed a couple of comics as the top villain. He dominated every scene he was in, and turned his cape to play like Leslie Neilson Dracula. It was great to hear his explanation to the movie. He had such a good sense of humor about the role. <br /> <br /> I was glad I didn't have too many assumptions because the movie offered many surprises. The story was funny and ominous and unusual. There was a lot of love for the look. Most importantly, it had a strange benefit to it. Unlike many of the movies that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror style, it was a movie that used its appearance for a purpose. <br /> <br /> There were many movies at the Fangoria festival with bigger budgets, but no one dared to be different.
