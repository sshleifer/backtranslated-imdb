A large bed owned by a demon eats people among others. I don't make it up. <br /> <br /> Complete in 1977 and not officially released until it comes to the DVD in 2003, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is a movie whose plot is impossible to describe. You probably know it, thanks to Patton Oswalt's excellent piece of it, as well as Stephen Throwers' essential book Nightmare USA. As you watch it, you wonder the following <br /> <br /> Who's George Berry, and what drugs has he been smoking / injecting / snoring before writing and directing this movie? <br /> <br /> a horror comedy? A combination of a horror flick and an art movie? A strange prank is drawn to the audience? <br /> <br /> What is the hell I look at? <br /> <br /> "Death Bed" is really an explanation. I know the term is overused, but it can't be warmer if it's here. This really beggars description. It's a horror comedy as well as art movie / horror hybrid. But the whole thing is so surreal, it has to be seen. The score sounds like the electronic bits of an old Candlemass album, the play is horrible and disconnected from everything, the direction is surprisingly proficient, and the movie sometimes feels like a Jesus Franco movie, that is, if its films intentionally was funny. <br /> <br /> In the end, there's really no good way to describe this movie. Lord knows I've tried, but really, little movies are as strange, unique or sensible as it is. See it ... but you're warned. It's also the only movie George Berry ever did. He definitely left his mark on the exploitation genre with this, I'll tell you so much.
