Michael Haneke is known for his disturbing movies like "Funny Games". This time he adopted Elfriede Jelineks "The Piano Spinner", which is probably her best work so far. Jelinek always writes about the abuse of families, and especially the oppression of women in a patriarchal society. <br /> <br /> Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) works as a piano teacher at the Vienna Conservatory. She still lives with her mother (Annie Giradot), they even sleep in the same bed (already a hint of something strange). Erika insults her students in the same way as she is being harassed by her mother and watches porn movies secretly and plays sadomasochistic games with herself. A student, Walter (Benoit Magimel), falls in love with her, but she simply refuses to sleep with him. She wants to play her games with him, but he is disgusting. He is reluctantly following her rules, which mean a disaster to them. <br /> <br /> Haneke has a very clear picture language, everything is filmed in an almost spartan way, so the complex characters and story are enhanced. /> <br /> People who do not know Austria well cannot realize how important the environment is to the story. Jelinek (as well as other great Austrian writers such as Thomas Bernhard) suffer from the cold and comfort of Austrian families and society. East Africans (at least Viennese people) are often unable to articulate their pain, wish, they suppress their emotions. So there is often not enough love, love and closeness in their families. In a society where it is important to show a perfect facade for society (even if it means protecting crimes within families, as Erika and her mother protect Walters's rape of Erika to avoid a scandal) than to dealing with your emotional problems, it is probably not surprising that Sigmund Freud founded the psychoanalysis in Vienna. Erika has a cold and relationships with her mother, they only have time to share, emotions are very violent and do not love. Erika replaces her hidden emotions with wishes for violence so that she can finally release some feelings. But she has no one who really wants to talk about her emotions, and eventually she has to relieve herself of pain. <br /> <br /> Isabelle Huppert shows her best performance of her career (as well as most other actresses). With an indifferent face, you often see just a hint of emotion in her face, a quick smile, a look with her eyes. And in the end her pain was masterfully displayed without a single tear. <br /> <br /> Benoit Magimel and Annie Giradot also turn in powerful shows, but the movie belongs to Huppert.
