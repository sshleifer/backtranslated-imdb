This is one of my favorite Disney movies. It has everything you can hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, good songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where aristocrat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the mistress's refugee butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realizes that if he even has a chance to claim the fortune, the cats will get away. An excellent, often forgotten, 1970s masterpiece - a time when the Disney studio made a few animations - which would like songs like "The Aristocats" as well as "Ev'rybody to be a Cat" It captivates viewers young and old with its enduring jazziness.
