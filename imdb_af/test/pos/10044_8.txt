George Armstrong Custer is known throughout history as an unknown general. He led his government to the death of Little Big Horn until their death. "They died with their boots," another picture of General Custer. In this movie he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose mistakes and crimes are mostly his love of adventure. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays George Armstrong Custer who meets us first as an over-insured site at West Point. Custer quickly distinguishes himself from other cadets as a poor student who always seems to be in trouble. Somehow it never seems as if Custer is bothering it and it just seems to confuse him if he really doesn't know how to get into such trouble. In spite of his poor status, he eventually graduated and became an officer in the US Army. By mistake, Custer receives a promotion in rank. Before it can be rectified, he leads a Union regiment in the battle against the Confederate. His campaign is successful and Custer becomes an unlikely national hero. Custer returns to his hometown, marries his darling, Libby, played by Olivia De Havilland. Libby is a very supportive concept woman, who keeps him on the sidelines and follows him in the border, as he accepts the seventh regiment of the Cavalry. Custer becomes a man of honor who strives to maintain peace with the Native Americans. To prove his intentions, he entered into a treaty with Crazy Horse, the leader of the Sioux. When the treaty is endangered by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold in the Black Hills, Custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the deaths of thousands of innocent settlers. /> <br /> Domroline dominates every scene in which he appears. He illustrates Custer successfully as flamboyant, arrogant, romantic and funny, depending on the scene of the scene. Olivia De Havilland's portrayal of Libby Bacon Custer as the love of his life shows us his soft, softer side. The chemistry between DeHavilland and Flynn, who worked in several other movies, is so smooth and it makes the viewer feel like they are playing and not the parts of Custer and his wife. The other actors depicting their characters really enhance the performances of Flynn and De Havilland. Anthony Quinn as Crazy Horse, Sidney Green Street as General Winfield Scott, Arthur Kennedy as Edward Sharp, is one of the other actors whose roles entertained this film. <br /> <br /> The reviewer will review this 4 star movie. While it is not historically accurate, it is very entertaining. The movie has a bit of everything. It has adventure, comedy and romance, so it speaks to a great variety of audiences. The casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give credible actions that make you forget. It is mainly based on fiction rather than fact. The reviewer especially likes Native Americans not showing the bad guys, but just showing them to protect their holy land. <br /> <br />
