I own all the family boys seasons so far and I have to say Vol. 6 is the biggest disappointment of all of them. There is still much laughter to be found here, but I think Vol. 6 like the last few volumes are slowing down more and less. At least for me. <br /> <br /> The biggest annoyance I had with Vol. 6 it is very heavy in left-wing politics. I am a great believer if you can laugh at other people, you have to laugh yourself, but this Volume really seems to shift their political views into your throat and I think it takes a lot away from the show. Insinuated All Conservative Sates Are Terrible Places, Insinuating We Should Control More Gun, Insinuated School Is Under Funded, Insinuated Religious People Are Crazy, Bush Are Friends With The Devil. I can go on and it's just the first three episodes. br /> <br /> Sure, some of it was funny, but there's a point when you're not making a comedy, and you're really just chasing your political views on other people.
