This is one of the best TV productions of a musical ever. I heard the Merman album, the Angela Lansbury album, I saw Tyne Daly, and I saw the Rosalind Russell movie many times. I think Bette is not the best, then tied with the best. She not only catches the bravura, but also the Mama Rose's pathos. I was never a fan of Natalie Wood, so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb, probably her best role. Everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful. The three strippers, led by the ever reliable Christine Ebersole, are hard to beat. There was a TV production from Mame a few years ago, with Cher, but I think Bette will be the best bet for Aunt Mame.
