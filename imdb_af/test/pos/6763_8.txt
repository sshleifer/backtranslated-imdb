It's a great movie about people. Strangers. The characters in the movie all have a very tragic past, so they all have their problems. Their problems evolve in a way that makes the movie's plot very absurd; but it doesn't make the movie worse, just better, because it's shot in a sort of fantasy-like way, so nothing really is. This review may sound a bit strange, but then the movie is not quite normal. It is also often a hilarious movie. If you haven't seen it, see it. Enjoy it!
