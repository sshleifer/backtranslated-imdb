I remember driving with my parent and sister. I was in grade 5, and still a kid, and the ride closed 4 years later, but the movie is still in my memory. An adult movie that finds a child entertaining. It is a brand of excellence. Hoffman is one of Hollywood's best actors, and this film proves it. I like the Billy sitting down the ice scene, and I remember the SCTV version there in the movie I factory myself. Remember Joe Flairty crying. Please email me if you like the SCTV shit. Not a bad movie, it's a story about a father and his son. Touch and maintain, I love the part where Hoffman talks about Killroy, and how the streets change. Appreciate a second watch. 10/07
