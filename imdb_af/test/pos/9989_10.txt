I thought this movie was incredible. I absolutely loved it, even though my brothers weren't so much. The special effects were outstanding, and this movie is about my favorite sport; Golf. The only thing disappointing about this amazing movie is that it's hard to watch twice or more in a row. This movie is absolutely tops everything I've ever seen. That was all I would expect from a movie. I just loved it. Also, it was pretty kid friendly. This movie helped me realize that anything is possible if you think about it. I would give it a pure 10/10! It was better than The Legend of Baggar Vants, and the two Pirates of the Caribbean movies combined. Absolutely incredible. Was crazy about it.
