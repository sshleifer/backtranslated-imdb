I loved it. It starts out as a fairly normal, slightly distressed French art film and then suddenly, halfway through, it is turned on. This section is brilliant, as you realize you haven't looked at 2 plots. Unfortunately, the end doesn't make much sense, it's a great shame. Oh yes, and it is brilliantly filmed.
