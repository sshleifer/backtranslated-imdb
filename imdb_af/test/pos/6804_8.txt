During the 13 years of schooling I came to high school at the kindergarten, and there was only one day my course. When I went to school, I went to school, from 8:30 to 3:30 and completed trips were not taken. But for some reason I couldn't recall at this advanced age, and we went to see a movie - National Velvet. I don't remember the movie, so on the eve of my 57th year I decided to see it again. <br /> <br /> It's a movie over a time that no longer exists. A time when people trusted others and their homes did not close. A time when people received the benefit of the doubt. It was a time when the family was the most important. This movie shows it all and more. It shows love and trust and caring and the goodness of people. <br /> <br /> It won't be a bad thing for every family to see this movie once and discuss the message. <br /> <br /> It was a surprise to see young Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney at its best, the Oscar-winning show by Anne Revere, Angela Lansbury for Murder, She Wrote and Donald Crisp, who for almost sixty years. /> <br /> What a movie!
