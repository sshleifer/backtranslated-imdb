Wonderful family movie to be a staple on Christmas. It's a mystery to me why it's not. A true lost movie I met for the first time flickered on my old 19 "black and white RCA, when the Million Dollar Movie was still aware of Channel 9 in New York. Everybody's Christmas tree established, but it has never been released on the home video, too much, I think I watched it on AMC a few years ago before they cut many of their older movies out of the rotation. recording and playing at Easter or Christmas Any movie with Santa, Auntie Bee, the Hostess Cupcake Lady, and an actor with the name King, cannot be bad, Ann Blyth as "Sally" is a bundle of energy. She ran over to the chapel to pray for St. Ann to help and guide her mixed and financially determined family, and as she graduated, she placed a statue of St. Ann in her own bedroom. At some point, the entire O'Moyne home is being moved to a different address. making a neighborly dispute between the O'Moynes and the turbulent fellowman next door. Blyth is cute as a button. Edmund Gwen can play the retired grandfather in his sleep. All-in-all, it's a satisfying movie experience.
