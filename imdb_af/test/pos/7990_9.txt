As a child I grew up with the TV series of the chintzy 60 (and I'm not that old? POW!). But when director Tim Burton put his new vision on the silver screen, I simply went straight away and never backed to benefit his installments over the latest additions (Batman Begins and The Dark Knight). for which I don't really care. Even if they are approaching a much more legitimate approach, does Bruce Wayne / Batman want to explore psyche further? but in honesty I don't think there is so much to type in. I had fun with a dark stripe and in my eyes it was what Burton had conveyed, and that is why I could watch them over and over. <br /> <br /> Following the dedication of audiences with the 1989 "Batman", thanks to the gaudy-Gothic art scene and Jack Nicholson, the prisoners' performance takes place from the camp, but a psychotic Joker. Burton would return three years later for the sequel and favorite of the Batman movies so far; 'Batman Returns'. Camp, but done well. In what would be fair to be even more expansive, harder, drier and nihilistic and has two shameful enemies for the price of one. Enter the grotesque penguin (with Danny DeVito going out on a limb) and the surprising Catwoman (a steamy Michelle Pfeiffer who fills the suit perfectly) comes to Gotham's festival. Again, Batman (a pleasant brother Michael Keaton, is equally laudable and looks very impressive in that bat suit, looks at the eyes) plays a second violin for the bad guys, but I always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman who made him " given a dishonest somber mysticism. but also a psychological complexity that never had the need to force nutrition. And his turn from Bruce Wayne was also well served. Burton's illustrative atmospheric direction begins with his sleek Gothic-style engraving, a carnival cartoon world that is filtered with a beautiful array of characters and vibrant costumes. The amusing narrative (in what is probably a bit too long) is more symbolic in its progress, but rather shows its spontaneous offensive and excessive set pieces and sharply etched art direction with shade and gray / blue neon lighting a winter-like background. The magnetic free-flowing camera work takes flight and Danny Elfman's stately spacious score balances the playfulness with gloomy with a very hypnotic trait. The rest of the performances can be overshadowed, but Christopher Walken digs in his teeth in a narrow gleaming role of a two-face businessman Max Shreck. Pat Hingle is back but gets very little to do as Commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough are wonderful as Alfred. In solid support are Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryniarski, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens also a cameo look.
