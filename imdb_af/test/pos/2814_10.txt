At first thought the concept of this show was a joke and a gag, just for Stan Lee's entertainment. I didn't expect anything more than a messy, animated version of Barb Wire with low production values, like the short crap you see on Adult Swim for short-term entertainment, but can never be taken too seriously. Boy was I wrong! <br /> <br /> Stripperella has even better production values ​​than similar Marvel Toons. The animation is very good and they seem to have taken this series very seriously and made a full effort to make it a professional production. <br /> <br /> The humor is also good, on the sexy, suggestive and sloppy side. It's very similar if it's not exactly like the Simpsons style. You can experience clicks and very predictable humor, but it's still fun. If it were today, I would see it regularly. This is surprisingly one of the better sounds ever made.
