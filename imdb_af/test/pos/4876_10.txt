I also attended the RI International Horror Film Festival and I can easily see why this movie has won the best of the show. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST is a wild hull of Horror, Comedy and beautiful scenery. Looking back into the story of strange things. A widely spread disease with an overwhelmingly annoying side effect of people's heads explodes, bringing a young professor's apprentice; Stefan, to investigate. Along his journey, he decides to take a short detour and, once again, ask for his long-term love of marriage, to send packs of her very stubborn father again? Along the road "out of town" he comes across a sick girl in the road and delivers her to dr. Maitland, (brilliantly played and comes Vincent Price as actor: Edward X Young.) Who fills Stefan on the evil one foot. Only the dr. Is insulted that he called in the professor and only received a boy in training. However, Stefan is far more than a common bystander. Horror icon; Tom Savini portrays the ultimate religious tormentor; Priests John. Scream Queen; Ingrid Pitt comes out of pension to give a star performance as Anna. Many beautiful and talented supporting actors kept the story seamlessly and helped to move it effectively to the climax. <br /> <br /> Dark Religion and top, but fun and sometimes very original, gore scenes play heavily in this Hammer tribute flick. This stylish movie goes back and forth between flashbacks, surreal worlds, dreams and character's reality. <br /> <br /> Horror and Gore aside; It's also a very funny movie! Slapstick, tongue and cheek humor and dark comedy raise their heads under the dark story line. As others have said; It's really like three big movies in one. Very Entertaining and Original.
