If you've ever seen Open Water, it's the same kind of dirty, edgy, indie-style movie. I like the action, tension. the slow build of it all, "I just hope they don't do this one they did to Open Water, with that successor .. but anyway, the one thing I didn't like was the annoying younger sister, I've been rooting for the crock all the time. The movie is almost like it should "pack children for a trip," they hire a guide that left secretly for 5 minutes before they arrived, so I think his assistant takes the two sisters, and the boyfriend on the water, think it's the second day of their adventure, curiously enough, the first day they keep guessing, a crocodile farm .. so they are out there and everything is fine for a while, then beat, crocodile time ... very intense, you know something in this movie, you do not see the crocodile, a whole lot of many, but if you do, it is very terrible, i love the crocus snout and eyes, and the roof covering that the crocodile endures every time he gets up above the water very creepy, but well, overall it is a good movie, if you can come next to the annoying little sister.
