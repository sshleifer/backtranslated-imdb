I think this movie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I think Debbie Reynolds is hilarious and the chemistry between her and Glenn Ford is perfect. There isn't a dull moment in the movie and Debbie looks nice as always. <br /> <br /> The story is about a showgirl Maggie (Debbie Reynolds) who meets a one-day soldier Joe (Glenn Ford). She picked him up immediately, but after he accidentally tore her dress, he returned it to her, provided she went with him on one date. They ended up getting married the night after they had only one kiss. Joe and Maggie move to Spain and find that they have nothing in common, but physical attraction. Maggie suggests that they live for one month, but not as husband and wife, which means that Joe can't kiss or sleep Maggie until Joe's frustration A Hilarious plot and a wonderful movie. Not to be missed.
