8/2008. When I originally wrote my comments shortly after I watched the film, I had a critical view and felt that Lemmon and Matthau had basically started their performances, which they did in a way they did a few times before , mated. br /> <br /> But after seeing it again, it was different, especially since neither of the two main mega stars lived much longer after the release. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Spiner, all eight principals are artists with great experience, and inevitably a lot of "longer in tooth" than we saw in many of their other movies and television. work. But isn't it nearly everyone? <br /> <br /> See it again, while it certainly won't be considered a "classis" in any of their careers, it's a fun movie, with very interesting scenery <br /> <br / > From my point of view, I remember many movies, plays, etc. often from a very critical point of view, or rather looking at the lighter side, without a movie another "Citizen Kane," "Casablance," or (in terms of the two), another original "Odd Couple." It will also provide a sustained piece of nostalgia for Lemmon and Matthau, as well as the others in the film.
