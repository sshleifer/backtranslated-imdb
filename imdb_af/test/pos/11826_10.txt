And I don't understand why the performance is so much to beat. In my opinion, this display is really excellent. Well, the first two episodes were not that good, but it picks up a load of momentum at the third episode. What appears to be typical for a Steve Moffat sitcom. I would rate it as one of the best sitcoms Britain has ever produced. <br /> <br /> The show itself is a farce at its best, it's not in the line of Fawlty Towers, but you can definitely do it as high as a Black Adder, Link, or the Boy! I look at the first season, and all I can say is that I'm happy to buy the DVD! <br /> <br /> The problem is probably with this display, and why it has become so hard, according to the Internet, that the original press release compared it to Fawlty Towers, and everyone was disappointed that it wasn't! Well, even Green Wing is closer to Fawlty Towers than this show, all I can say is your mind from every bias, giving the show at least a run (including episode 3) and then decide for yourself! <br /> <br /> All I can say is thank you Steve Moffat for writing it and thanking the entire staff for breaking it down!
