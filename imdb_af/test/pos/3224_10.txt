I've been linked to "GG" since the middle of 2001-2002 (2nd season), when I agreed to see "Smallville" 10 minutes early. Thanks to "Beginnings" I now have only 2 episodes on tape, up to last night (Ep. 4.9). I'm a middle-aged straight male, and that's the only TV show I just watch. <br /> <br /> I love this series because: a) Lauren Graham is a beautiful, beautiful woman and funny and smart to start; b) the dialogue is written extremely well; c) It is flat, hilarious, to shame overshadowed garbage like "Everybody Loves Raymond". Many current TV comedies are heavily influenced by the highly successful and very despicable clever well-known as "Married to children", where the viewer is encouraged to make the characters feel and feel better. In "GG" the characters have errors, but we can see our own foibles in them, and laugh with them, not with them. It stimulates TV, where writers challenge us to keep pace with rapid changes and pop culture / literature / current references. I get great pleasure watching these episodes over and over again, capturing all the one-liners and references to previous episodes. Stars Hollow is his own small world, one that I will happily visit as long as the series runs.
