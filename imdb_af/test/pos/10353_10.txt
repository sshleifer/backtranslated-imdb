Completely disgusting and cheap bawdy humor. I loved it !!! It is the most disgusting and utterly horrified film, except for Nicolas Read, who plays an undamaged Court Jester, for comic glory. But if so, I laughed so much and I had to hand it over to the filmmakers, it was by no means pretentious or ordinary. Hit, fight, vomit zombies on their victims of rape. What other movie does it have? Not for the quesy, but with a pizza, a bong and a six pack of beer, you made it, if you have a cast iron stomach and a juvenile sense of humor like me.
