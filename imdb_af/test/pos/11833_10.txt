I just watched this movie for the first time, and just loved it ... Yeah, it's simple in his story, the sweetest love story and how any woman can't fall in love with Callum Blue ... <br / > <br /> The scenery in Italy was as you would expect. Beautiful, the bad things that were eventually lost, and that the two love birds would be reunited at the end, were wonderful, but that scene where some Italian hid the confetti after Eric and Wanda's wedding, perfection! <br /> <br /> Have a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie, yes, better, have a tissue ready and be surprised, I know I was and hope to get it on DVD soon. All the actors played their parts perfectly, it was a WW2 movie that you can believe because it was so realistic and without going over like in other movies ...
