A sign of what to expect in this film came when I found it to be the first (and probably the last) film to have a "Vomit Technician" in its credits. <br /> <br /> In what is a few hours silly gags, hilarious violence and excellent slapstick humor. <br /> <br /> This movie was just what you expected from the bottom boys and it's great to see them again in their best shape after Rik Mayall's life. threatening accident. <br /> <br /> Richie (Mayall) and Eddie (Edmondson) are too similar to their Bottom characters, if we can have any criticism, and Edmondson also does a surprisingly good job of directing the movie. <br /> <br /> This film has already captured the predictable comparisons to Fawlty Towers not only there, and the Guest House Paradiso itself is hardly Torquay! <br /> <br /> Look out for some great manufacturing dialogue between all the violence and chaos. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Bottom, you'll probably hate it - but I love it.
