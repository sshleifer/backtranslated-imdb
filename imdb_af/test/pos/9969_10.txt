It's a risky business to film such a cute production of "The Merchant of Venice". It can be a bumpy, woody piece, or it can be ridiculous for its excess. This version is also not. While not being sold entirely by Al Pancino's highly-equipped Shylock, he gives a capable and honorable performance. Jeremy Iron's Antonio, as always, sounds his tortured self-roles. Some of the smaller roles were a bit too much in the spirit of boisterous fun, a boy's own adventure story of the Venicians, but the central plot is efficient and moving forward sympathetically through the movie. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that the location shots, costumes and interiors were breathtaking, almost to the distraction. <br /> <br /> One thing I don't want to comment on is the anti-Semitic content of the play. The film is so sympathetic to the trouble of the Jews as possible, while Shylock is still portrayed as the instrument of his own self-destruction. It is a sad note that the director of this movie was needed four years later to comment on his recent performance before the first show at the Toronto Film Festival. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie, and I'm looking forward to several views.
