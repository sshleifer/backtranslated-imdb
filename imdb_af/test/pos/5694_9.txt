WARNING: I recommend someone who hasn't seen the movie yet, not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> This movie was on the shelf at a movie store and since I saw a handful of very funny horror movies, I had very low expectations for this one. Well, I put it in, and almost immediately I'm sucked straight. While I was watching, I came deeper and deeper into the story and I was almost in full interest. This movie is amazingly spectacular and I loved every second. The story is about a boat trip along a river in Australia. It seems safe enough until their boat is caught by a crocus ready for food. Looking at the back of the case, I thought this movie would have visual effects like in Lake Placid 2 and many others, but when I first saw the crocodile, it looked incredibly real! Don't laugh when I say it, because I'm serious, but it's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. It really knew how to build nail bites and tensions with his intense situation, I mean, think about it; Your fasting, in a tree, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide with a hungry predator in the depths of the water below. You can't tell me, it doesn't just make you a little bit. It even managed to give me a few chills in my arms, such as when Adam was taken by the crocodile and Grace and Lee were stunned. It's a very attractive movie. There might have been 1 or 2 parts where I hardly found myself unattractive, but otherwise, I'd say this is my favorite animal attack movie I've seen.
