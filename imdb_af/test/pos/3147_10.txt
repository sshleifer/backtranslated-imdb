I saw The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal place to see anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well-intentioned and it was clear that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But that was the story and it's the delivery that made the shortest shine. Duncan Rogers's tight scrip was just needed for "shorts" tonight. It did not fall, as did several offerings or preach to us. The reader was a simple story that told in its best form, well thrown by Rogers and acted beautifully. Duncan Rogers is, of course, a director with the ability to put all the pieces together, I'm looking forward to his next completed project. K.
