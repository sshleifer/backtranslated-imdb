The Priest, in deep love and suffering, did not show the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has a high sweet beauty of man (or vampire?). http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/ <br /> <br /> And the love of Femme fatale is not notorious, but nice to take responsible death as a vampire. She did not fall deep into the lost paradise, but decided to leave man alone. Fragile but sweet femme fatale! This film made me think of suffering between man and vampire, which is far above priest and salvation. I also thought of love. Adam was not so responsible for Eve, but this Adam (priest), sacrificial and responsible to pick up Eve from Paradise-lost, vampire's world. Another symphonic poem by Adam & Eve, Paradise Lost.
