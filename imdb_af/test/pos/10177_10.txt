This movie was so heartwarming. A true will for an actors real life every day on and off. It was truly a wonderful experience to share the passion of the actor on film and respect for what it had to take from the screen. This movie is a reminder to everyone to go there dreaming! Never give up! Hurray for The Stand -in !!!
