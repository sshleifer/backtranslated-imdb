For the inquisitive, this episode is based on the theme of Pirandello's play, "Six characters in the search for a writer" and Jean-Paul Sartre's play, "No Exit" (apparently, of course, by his title), but of course with A sterling turn. <br /> <br /> Five very different individuals find themselves in a round room without any idea who they are other than the indication of their clothes. A bell rang intermittently (perhaps also a Hemmingway allure?), Which increases the pain of their incarceration. The newcomer to the group, a master, is determined to escape, while the other is thanked for their fate. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pirandello, these characters don't even have a story. They have nothing but the experience of the room in their consciousness, and no one to write their non-existent story, so their position is even more hopeless than the characters in Pirandello's piece. Unlike both Pirandello and Sartre, there is no relationship between the characters and therefore no real conflict between them, although the theme of personal responsibility towards apathy in this story is prominent. <br /> <br /> Although it is quite different from the story of the authors mentioned in the title, themes of Sartre and Pirandello (and many other authors of the twentieth century) are quite clear. This is, of course, a piece that addresses postmodernist perspective in the context of the Cold War era. There is also emphasis on issues of personal negligence. <br /> <br /> It's easily one of the best episodes I've seen, and still extremely relevant to current experience (such as Sartre and Pirandello). Exactly what makes a good piece of writing into a classic.
