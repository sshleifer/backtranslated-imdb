I can't believe I've never added my two cents to this movie! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies of all time. Many critics and filmmakers speak of John Carpenter's "Halloween" to set trends and "be his best work". These people did not see this version of "The Thing" because it is right there with "Halloween". <br /> <br /> John Carpenter's work shines in this movie. He made a movie that was already made and instead of making the movie, he made the book the first movie was based on! Brilliant. <br /> <br /> The decisive thing of every man was wonderful, the tension between them was real, it screamed me, scared me, made me guess, let me laugh, asked me to this day "Who go there? " in that movie. This movie didn't have a Hollywood candy or a funny ending, and what a risky move didn't have in 1982. Another brilliant move. <br /> <br /> I was on the show for this movie when I was on vacation in Southern California. The audience at the show has become wild! For years I had the memories, it was so much fun! We all thought there was no way to be on God's green earth, this movie is not going to be a hit. But through cash receipts it was a dud because of "ET, The Extra Terrestrial" and "Poltergeist". Two very good family-oriented films took the box in 1982 when this film came out. <br /> <br /> This movie was what I as a horror movie adult buff was looking for, a horror / thriller with a mature script, and true adult actors. Not kids playing adults. Not a little Miss. "Big chest" screaming queen of the day running to scream for titulation BUT true guys with real problems that some of the best monologues you will ever hear will deliver. Heck, a feminist, I don't even have MISS women in this movie! And good for Mr. Carpenter by not putting one in there would not really make sense! (Unless, "The Thing" was actually female! Something to think!) <br /> <br /> I saw special effects of the time I have never seen before, I saw makeup that made me sit down. This is what the horror / thrillers of today are missing. Today, the board is shouting. Today, the studios wimp out. Too much CGI and not enough faith, too much CGI and not enough story, not enough imagination. You leave the theater and in a week - or less - you forget about the movie and move to the next big movie opening. This one stays with you. This is one of the points of an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> In many reviews I wrote how to pay $ 10 for a movie now, it's terrible. For movies like this one, you pay it and don't feel light. This movie is NOT for everyone. <br /> <br /> I find it horrible that they make this movie a "cult" movie. I find that the audience is wider than many of you would believe to be and although it wasn't a commercial success in 1982, it's an example of how the release of a darn good movie on the wrong date " a darn good movie can make bad. After John Carpenter's film many people copied many techniques, makeup, special effects and story lines from this version of The Thing. <br /> <br /> Now I'm excited to go on record and say that this movie is one of the best movies of all time, well below value. Please see it indescribably, please see it in mailbox and hear it digitally. You will talk about it for years.
