First of all, I must say that this film is much less pretentious than the Da Vinci code. Sure, you have the religion vs. science problem, but it doesn't try to make a big statement about it. it is basically an action thriller that moves very well from one scene to another. One scene in particular (it involves fire) I did very well. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the changes from book to movie. Although when I followed the film's development, I complained about changing some characters and completely removing others, I have to admit that I was wrong. It was refreshing that the film did not follow the book exactly as it did in Da Vinci. If you're a purist of the book, some of them might upset you. But the BIG TWIST is still there, don't worry about it. Eventually, I was glad that they had removed some silly subplots and didn't even try to tap into the possibility that Langdon and Vittoria would come together. <br /> <br /> The performances are really good, but nothing out of the ordinary. It's good for a movie like this. <br /> <br /> I want to give it 9/10, especially because it delivers what it promises, entertainment, pure entertainment
