It's an exceptional movie. It's part-comedy, drama, bias. The dialogue is beautiful. Most of the actors and actresses were well known in their time and for good reason. You will probably recognize someone, even if you don't usually watch older movies. They are also each in a role that suits their talents in particular. <br /> <br /> One correction to comment on another user's comment is that two people, not one, are killed in the accident. Perhaps the unfortunate two are a reflection of what the writer considers important in life. The movie is too interesting to worry about who it is until it happens. <br /> <br /> The story is ahead of its time, but it doesn't lose the quality of an older movie. Time and effort has been spent improving the camera's view and soundtrack, which is something modern filmmakers tend to forget.
