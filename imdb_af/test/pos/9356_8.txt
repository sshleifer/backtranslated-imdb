A man named Joseph Samuels is brutally murdered in his apartment. It appears that Samuels had been visited by a group of drunken soldiers the previous night, and apparently missing one of them, the evidence is definitely involving the missing soldier. But if Detective Finlay goes deeper into the matter, he finds that they can bark the wrong tree, and that this crime goes with desperate sadness and dirty anti-Semitism. <br /> <br /> Crossfire was born of the novel written by Richard Brooks, adapted by John Paxton and directed by the elaborate, excellent Edward Dmtryk, Crossfire (original title Cradle Of Fear) is a tough and gripping picture that brave anti-Semitism approach. The makers had to be forced to hide the story from the original source. The novel is about homosexual hate as opposed to anti-Semitism. What remains, mainly due to RKO supremo Dore Schary and producer Adrian Scott, is a kind of awkward discomfort that Noirish style drops. <br /> <br /> The movie features three Bob's, Young, Mitchum and Ryan, with Noir's darling Gloria Grahame adding the emotional female heart. The only third photographed, it's Robert Ryan's picture entirely, his portrayal of the bully, Montgomery's fine profile is the top draw and shows the talent he had in abundance. Ryan has good reason to give Montgomery the best of his job because he served Richard Brooks himself in the Marine. Both men discussed the possibility that if the novel were to be made in a movie, then Ryan wanted to play Montgomery, so the rise of Ryan's career as weasel types was born! Gloria Grahame is also a wonderful and sincere turn, which is all the more remarkable because she was harassed by her abused man at the time. Stanley Clements was known to be violent towards her, and his ongoing presence around the set cast others into action, but Grahame, probably the real emotion, became the character of Ginny and also shone very brightly. Both Bob Mitchum and Bob Young also come up with flying colors to really seal the deal about what a smartly activated Crossfire photo really is. <br /> <br /> Tho Crossfire was released before the other 1947 anti-Semitic picture, Gentleman's Agreement, and climbed into the box in over a million and a quarter dollars, some of his thunder was stolen by the Oscar award from Fox Studio. The best film, best supporting actress {Grahame}, best director and best script, won nothing, but critics of the time considered it a brilliant move in the American movie. Today, it stands tall, proud and dark as a daring and excellent piece of work. 8.5 / 10
