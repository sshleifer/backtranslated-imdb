Before you see this movie - clean your ears, take off your eyes and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you. She doesn't have to. This photo gives you both warmth enough to keep your relationship long enough. If you are Jewish / Russian / Ukrainian / Immigrants - yes, what popular movie minority so ever - lies within your memories. If you are something else or whatever you are - laugh at the bittersweetness of the importance of friendship and family. It this movie, nothing will look strange how funny it seems. Still, I'm afraid that few people will see this movie because it's not the type of picture people watch when they go to movies. But please, do it for humanity, and don't forget to get the soundtrack for fun.
