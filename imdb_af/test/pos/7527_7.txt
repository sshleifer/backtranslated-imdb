And so the most amore skunk was born to grace the silver screen. While the plot has an abused cat painting itself as a skunk and accidentally Pepe Le Pew (called Henry), Pepe definitely steals the show. No doubt Chuck Jones realized that this loving-looking member of the genus Mephitis needed that special something to be a star in his own right, and so he put Pepe in "For Spiritual Reasons" four years later. Presence on screens everywhere. <br /> <br /> So, while "Fragrance-Able Kitty" might be another placeholder, I try to look at it for the first time in 1945. Can anyone guess that this supportive character will soon join the ranks of Bugs, Daffy, Porky and the rest? Whether someone did this, Pepe remains one of the best characters to this day. C'est l'amour!
