I found parts of this movie quite slow, especially the first part; The second part looks much faster, but it's not quite clear to me why one part was faster than the other. I managed to find it nice. The acting was good, the writing was good (but vulgar). There was also a good side: it was easier to understand than the Godfather movies. You knew who was on whose side, etc. All in all, the movie wasn't half bad.
