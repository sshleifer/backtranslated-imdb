This game is not exactly the best N64 game ever. Sure, that's good, but only when there are 4 players. Without 4 players, the only fun thing to do is take away mines and see how many people you can kill. But half of this game is levels where you have to save Natalya, so you have to limit your use of remote mines at those levels, and it gets rather boring. The graphics do not reach exactly the level of Super Mario 64 or Mario Kart 64. And if you shoot a good multiplayer in a 1 person, you need to go with Perfect Dark. At least you can play multiplayer yourself.
