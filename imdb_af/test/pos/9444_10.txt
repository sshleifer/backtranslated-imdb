It must be one of the best episodes of doctor I've seen since last year. There is a brilliant blend of entertainment, fear and tenderness all mixed up, which is like a wonderful episode. The ood was brilliantly designed and I'm pretty sure there will be lots of odd jokes in the next few weeks. I'm guilty of it. I especially liked the way we saw a different perspective on Rose's and the doctor's relationship and the end. Well, this is the first time I've ever hidden behind a pillow! I can't wait until next weeks episode to find out how they get out of this mess.
