I won't spoil you with any summary, chances are you already know them. And hopefully you're already familiar with Park Chan-Wook's work. <br /> <br /> I totally agree with some of the other commentators by saying that Park did not blow the revenge trilogy blah blah blah. Because you know what? He has!!! The revenge trilogy was different in style to start with, how can you even compare the sombreness and subtlety of "Sympathy For Mr Vengeance" to the surprising and exaggeration of "Oldboy"? Park Chan-Wook has amazing style, but its movies don't all share the same style! This is true and true with the release of "Thirst". <br /> <br /> "Thirst" is an amazing picture, it literally has everything you want in a movie. Violent violence, tasteful gore, good humor, incredible tension and even very realistic sex scenes. The story is so crazy that you can't guess what will happen next. I'm so happy to say Park is back in the best shape with this fantastic dark comic vampire love story. Watch it as soon as you can!
