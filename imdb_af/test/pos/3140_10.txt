There is a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford movies for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no cash names in them that Ford was not supposed to make the film the person of a star, namely John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others with whom he worked. Not surprisingly, Ford saw all of these as favorites of some kind. <br /> <br /> Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. A few nice coupons sign up to lead a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona's area. Along the way they are first made by a group of stranded players of a medicine show and then by a family of illegal attacks called Clegg. Their stories merge and what happens is the basis of the movie's plot. <br /> <br /> Even if Wagonmaster was even 10 years earlier based on the two shows Johnson and Carey turned on, both would probably have had a lot. Careers as B photo cowboys. In the case of Johnson, it would imitate art life. Johnson was a true rodeo cowboy and came to Hollywood with a string of horses for John Ford to use in Fort Apache. Ford was hit by its presence and the rest is history. <br /> <br /> But the day of the B-Western ended and Johnson and Carey had good careers than two fine character players. <br /> <br /> Ward Bond plays Elder Wiggs leader of the Mormons. Bond, however, is a recent conversion and has difficulty remembering not to use four letters. But he is the leader because of his strength of character, not his impeccable LDS theology. He seems to be a wise and compassionate leader. <br /> <br /> In the depiction of the Cleggs, Ford had to return to his My Darling Clementine for four years. They are the reincarnation of the Clanton gang and pure evil. In fact, if Walter Brennan, who, after my Darling Clementine refused to work for Ford again, was willing again, I could easily see him as the head of the family, Shiloh Clegg. As it was, Charles Kemper did a good job, it is probably the role he most noticed. Shortly after this film was made, Kemper died in a car accident. He may have worked for Ford in the future. <br /> <br /> Ford makes the Mormone pacifists here and I don't remember that pacifism was part of the LDS doctrine. Yet it works here, the whole idea is that these people who carry no weapons are innocent when they go with evil people like the Cleggs. It takes a few gun-pushing cowboys to properly dispose of them. I think this post-WWII movie is trying to say that pacifism is not always the best policy. <br /> <br /> Another transfer from My Darling Clementine is Alan Mowbray who plays the same role as he did there as head of the medicine show group. Part of the group is Joanne Dru, who does a different turn than a woman of elastic virtues, like in Red River. Dru was so much western that she wanted to be out of the honey and in a few modern fashions. <br /> <br /> Wagonmaster is great entertainment and I am willing to bet in Utah State. It's a pretty popular movie. .
