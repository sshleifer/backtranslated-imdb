The second episode of Mr Eco has somewhat less interesting flashbacks than the first (the 23rd Psalm), but in just about every other department it is one of the best episodes of Season 2, featuring the series' mythology / background as well as the characters. A new Dharma initiative station - The Pearl - is discovered by Locke and Eko and the orientation film they find and watch completes Locke's transformation from a believer ("Orientation") - to the end of the movie: "We will have to look at it again ") to a doubter (" SOS "-" Did you push that button, Henry?) "to an unbeliever ("? "- after the end of the movie:" Do you want Terry O'Quinn's performance is powerful as usual ("every second of my pathetic little life is just as useless as that button"). Meanwhile, Eko takes his place as the man who is sure he's brought to the island as part of his true fate, what the button should continue Other high points are a spectacular, unique dream series where person A has the dream of being person B (this is the kind of bold idea that the current season of lost can use much more) , and the haunting scene of Libby's last word before the death, and the way Jack and Hurley cannot understand its true meaning and not. *** 1/2 out of 4.
