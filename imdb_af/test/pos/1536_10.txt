"Closet Land" tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements. You can read a lot of things about the movie's plot, but you don't really have to. All you need to know is that the movie is about an interrogation. Along the way we learn a lot about the interrogator and the person being questioned. We also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place. Especially if you have absolutely no control over it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie is a warning (really, though the film is about different aspects of it) about what happens to people's freedoms when they "look the other way around" and ignore the injustices that affect those around them. happen. <br /> <br /> If you have about an hour and a half and know where to rent it, I strongly recommend you do it.
