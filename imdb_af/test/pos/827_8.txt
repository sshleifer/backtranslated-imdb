I thought it was the most interesting movie JCVD ​​did in many years. I loved his character and the whole thing with the rabbit showed a different tone to this movie. IMHO, JCDV can really do something. A little more light hearted, some obvious homage to other movies, mixed with some great fights ... I'd like to see more of this film-making style of him. One of the other posters thought the bar scene was a Desperado rip. I immediately saw the R. Rodriguez connection, but thought it was very clever and showed me that the movie will look again for more subtle directions from other films. JCVD rocks !! <br /> <br /> Other stuff after reading other comments: <br /> <br /> No music in the church fighter? Initially, I didn't look it right either, but then I thought it was interesting because it made me slightly wiped out by giving something we didn't expect. It looks like it's more real. <br /> <br /> I also always get a laugh when directors cry like 2-year-olds that their movie is "stolen". Directors are paid to do a job. The studio is the boss and they want the product they want. Very few directors have an absolute final cut on a movie. In this case, JCVD ​​is the talent and the only reason someone watches this movie. I'm sure he has a movie in which he was happy. I have a family member working at a post office who knows a bit of the story. PRESUMABLY, the director worked and delivered his clip of the movie. Everyone who saw it said it was a disaster ... then JCVD ​​and the studio changed the movie. These things always happen. He also saw the final cut (which he claims he didn't do) and his "delicate genius" ego was badly bruised because he hated his cut cut. If this director was smart, he had to have taken one credit for it, as it would have been best.
