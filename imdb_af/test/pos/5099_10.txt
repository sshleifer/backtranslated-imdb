Peter O'Toole is a Latin Teacher of Arthur Chipping with strict adherence to detail and thoroughness to help young people understand the meaning and definition of Latin words and phrases. He is seen as cold and unfair and not in contact with times. But at the meeting with stage actress Singer Katherine Briskit (Petula Clark), not just on a late dinner to London, London is, but at an Amphitheater in Greece his closed world is beginning to open. <br /> <br /> Mrs. . Chips is an MGM musical remake of the 1939 movie also from MGM. During this time musicals were out and the Hollywood studio system was in total mess. When placed in New York City, Los Angeles and London, the music numbers were intact, but when it came to the local main street theaters, it was songs that made the movie shorter and maximized. <br /> <br /> Thanks to MGM / UA Home Video under Ted Turner in the late 1980s in the early 1990s when VHS and Laser Disc were the main home video formats of choice, the music numbers were re-established and the gaps closed. Laserdisk was the only format chosen for goodbye Mr. See chips in the widescreen letterbox format. <br /> <br /> For a while, the original Motion Picture Soundtrack was only available on the original Vinyl and Cassette Tape and is still available on Ebay today. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the wonderful people at Film Score Monthly.com in 2006, the soundtrack was remastered digitally and remixed in a 3 CD set with the completely reconstructed score, the original 1969 general release album score, and tell Sequence source music and interviews are great. You also get an unused song that is a true lost gem, "Tomorrow with Me" by Petula Clark, who would be chosen instead of "You and I" at hand. <br /> <br /> This movie is both a classic musical and a true tribute to educators everywhere. I will definitely buy this movie as Warner Bros. MGM and Sony will put their money where there is mouth and get this movie from all the master movie sources and put it on both DVD and Blu Ray with all the bells and whistles back in place with all the extras you can find and things in a release.
