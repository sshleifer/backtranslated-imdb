I did this movie with my BBC "Jane Austen Collection" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't look like it. It is completely different from the others and it is missing, or so I thought, one of the qualities I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs Richards apparently sewed her fingers together was particularly disturbing. <br /> <br /> I still don't like to watch the fingernail scene, but I like Mrs. R. to hear, dreamy, as she fucks, "My only expert ... tore my gown." This movie is now my current Austen favorite. I watched it 7 or 8 times so far. The acting, in my mind, is incredible. The way I do well is when I look up from everything I do (sewing, though not my fingers together, hopefully, or boondogling or whatever) to see if the character delivers his lines. This is the turn of expression, the throwing of posture, which makes the words alive - that is what does good, as far as I'm interested. <br /> <br /> Well, I watch almost every part of "Northanger Abbey" because almost all actors play their roles with such charisma. Peter Firth is wonderful as Mr. Tilney, the perfect combination of Bathian rag and true, male hero. You are not sure to end up whether he is Catherine's money or not. I love his touch of (Welsh?) Accent. Mr. A wife. Richards is beautiful: the combination of their behavior - especially Mr. Richards's high voice, the awarding of the consideration in his knowledge and wisdom, makes them so real. General Tilney as the heartfelt father who may be a murderer is also fascinating. And Captain Tilney, the grinning rake who so enjoys himself ... and the money-grubbing sister and brother whose names I can't remember at the moment - the two of them are so perfect, instantly clever and smart. <br /> <br /> The other reason I love this adjustment is that it is the most romantic of all Jane Austen adaptations. I know it was one of Austen's weaknesses. Well, this is my concern. Although all her novels are love stories, it's hard to feel her heroes and heroines finally fall in love. And if they're not really in love, what's the point? All the other adjustments I saw (except the early Olivier / Garson one) had nice cold fish at the end, as they kiss. I don't like sex in movies at all, but it is really necessary to finally have a sincere kiss. And the finite kiss in Northanger is a dead end. <br /> <br /> The top-of-the-line approach to costumes, music and lighting works great as far as I am concerned. And the writing is extremely clever. The way we were educated about Gothic romance, Highlife in Bath, Cathy's normal country education, etc., was done very well, as usual in BBC productions. Also, I like the part when the little black page makes the cars. And the Marchioness was, according to me, a very suitable and very clever exhibition. <br /> <br /> Some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what Jane Austen intended to do in Northanger Abbey - fun of Gothic romance does not promote it. But I don't think she put down "Mysteries of Udolpho" and so on. She just made the point to distinguish between reality and fiction. And this point is made when Mr. Tilney Chatherine in his mother's room. Besides, General Tilney was a villain, even though it was a prosaic one. That point had to be made sure.
