As a modern Marco Polo, from Venice to China, we come here again Amelio, with the task of making the gray area in the middle of two worlds solid colors. Hearing the globalization's collateral damage, the pessimistic vision of Europe is interrelated with Chinas. <br /> <br /> The view of that beautiful, confusing country is turned down below, without any demand to learn or impose opinions. But the reality is hard. Abandoned and exploited children, beehive homes, backward areas are the other china we ignore. Vincenzo (Castellitto), a steel mill technician, is one of us. His journey to China is an excuse to understand, to learn from within a country where progress and third-world problems live in a notorious balance. It is not quite clear whether Vincenzo knew for the first time that the mechanical component was already fixed, I think so; anyway, it's a small aspect. Liu, the Chinese girl, is the key to the whole movie. She has many problems on her back, she has the power to overcome, but how can she fight with little money and little help? <br /> <br /> The realistic and unbiased view of the facts by the girl, who refused Vincenzo's money, touched me a lot. A bunch of banknotes can't get her husband, her baby (forced to treat the stranger like a stranger) back, protected her by spotters. Liu knew his intentions were good and friendly, far from a cold charity law. Their friendship is beautifully told, the way it grows step by step, worthy and formative, unique. A valuable legacy to retain. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are stunning, either for the play (Vincenzo crying on the ferry) or through the dialogues (at the restaurant, on the tracks). In addition to careless editing and a pretty lazy start, La Stella che non c'Ã¨ is brilliant and sharp, just because the inexplicable truths are chronicled. <br /> <br /> In the competition at the 63rd Venice Film Festival, there are many bets on Tai Ling for the Mastroianni Prize, dedicated to emerging stars. She definitely deserved that award. <br /> <br /> [8/10]
