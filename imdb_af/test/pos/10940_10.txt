The twin effect is a vampire martial arts movie available in Cantonese with English subtitles. This is a Jackie Chan production and he makes a special guest appearance, but it is not for those who love Shanghai Noon / Knights and the other recent Hollywood movie for which he became known is this movie much more special. <br /> It was originally called The Vampire Effect, but as a very popular Chinese female pop duo called The Twins (Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung), the two leading roles changed the title in cash to their name. </ <br /> <br /> The film will appeal to three types of audience: those who hold martial arts films, those who love vampire films, and those who reject Hollywood's rubbish films are usually chosen. <br /> <br /> The assumption for the movie is that vampires are over and a secret society is trying to hunt them down before we all go for the undead. This bloody work is done by some martial artists who drink a little vampire blood to give them the edge they need, but it must be thirsty! There are many things going on for the course to find a particularly nasty European vampire that, if he gets a set of keys held by all the vampire prince, he can walk in sunlight, and usually eats when he wants. To say more on the plot, the pleasure of seeing the movie would be spoiled. <br /> <br /> The twins consist of one dedicated vampire slayer (Chung) and another's sister (Choi). These are the twins who really make the movie; with some of the newest and funniest acting going. The combat scenes they exercise are fast and furious and well choreographed with a mix of real athletics and wire work. To add the cherry to the cake, the twins are also nice to watch. <br /> <br /> The direction is sharp and the writing is sharp. There are only 3 things that make this movie fall: the makeup for the vampires is pretty poor, Jackie Chan seems to be just in the movie, and doesn't add anything to the content, and some of the slapstick comedies have tried . by the male vampire hunter is quite lame. Fortunately, the twins save the day to make their original appearance in the film that is normally only found in European films. The best scene for me was one of them (Choi) who only communicated by shouting. Her ability to convey her thoughts through this medium was a comic joy. <br /> <br /> They are many others of originality in this movie - I especially like the box full of surround sound stereo and TV screen! And it's the movies' very original touch and acting that prevents it from being a tired old flop and seeing it in a movie.
