For those of you who are still in the dark, I will not spoil this Christie, as it is definitely one of her best works, and I emphasize that you should see it when you have free time too! If any of the adjustments have to be looked at before or instead of reading the book, I will submit the following reasons for "After Funeral". <br /> <br /> I wanted to give up the performance by Monica Dolan (Miss Gilchrist), whose employer Cora was brutally murdered at the start of the film. Her portrayal of a shocked, nervous, insignificant woman actually moves, especially if she has a moment of personal connection with Poirot, another person traveling alone in the journey of life. And when the killer is revealed in the typical Poirot denouement fashion, Dolan's reaction to the revelation works best: you feel so angry with the killer as you sympathize with me. Gilchrist is ... something unusual in Christie Lore. <Br /> <br /> Although there are some differences between novel and film adaptation, as usual (the business of the will may be less meaningful in the film), the incredible exuberant relaxation of post-war England, thorough high caliber of acting and ruling, and the preservation of Christie's mystery and plot, these differences retain little. <br /> <br /> Bravo Suchet, Dolan and the whole team for making this masterpiece of murder fog theater, and the producers who gave it the green light! Encore!
