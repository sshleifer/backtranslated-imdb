Based on his current IMDb rating as well as several summaries, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, you are deeply into the genre that has been original for some time. Even in terms of mise-and-scene and cinematography, the director becomes outstanding and creates a film made up of imagination. If you are looking for a movie that is not only entertaining but also challenging, compelling and truly extraordinary, then make the next movie you watch. <br /> <br /> I hope Heath Ledger's tragic death will lead to more people picking up this movie. He was an incredible talent, and his performance in this is one that should not be missed. Don't make the mistake of judging and throwing this wonderful movie before you see it.
