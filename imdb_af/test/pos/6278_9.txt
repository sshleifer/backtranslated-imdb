By 1952, Hollywood had decided to make the Al Jolson first-rate classic reminder. <br /> <br /> This time the Cantor's son was played by Danny Thomas. Getting home from the army is expected to follow in the footsteps of his father and other male families by becoming an office. Yet young Mr. Golding has a spectacular show. <br /> <br /> By now he meets Peggy Lee, an aspiring singer. She works very well and her version of her favorite song, Lover, is remarkable. The film writers were smart not to join the obvious Jewish man and non-Jewish friendship. If it is, it is switched over. In his wrath, betraying his promise to become an office, his father made the traditional Jewish sign indicating a loss in the family. This would not be done under circumstances to break a promise. This would be done if an orthodox marriage were to take place between the faith. <br /> <br /> Thomas does a very good job playing the office's son. His song is about to end because the film ends on a positive note. <br /> <br /> It is astonished that technical advisers did not realize that women do not carry sachets in the synagogue on the Sabbath or at all during that period.
