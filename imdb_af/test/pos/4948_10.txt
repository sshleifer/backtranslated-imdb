It was an amazing movie with flight scenes that was incredibly realistic! I've seen it several times and it kept my attention throughout. I am a huge fan of the Air Force myself and love watching any movie where I can get a glimpse of an F-16 pilot. If you like Top Gun, I guarantee you will love this movie as well. Except for some soft swear words, it's a great movie for the whole family. It has a good plot and does not have a dull moment throughout the movie. Every second is action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. So again I recommend this movie!
