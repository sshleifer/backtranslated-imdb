Like those who listen to the radio reports on the attack on Pearl Harbor, anyone who ever saw PINK FLAMINGOS knows exactly where they were when they first saw it. And thirty years later, the movie is still one of the most unspeakable dirty, unpleasant, repulsive and hilariously funny movies ever to be transmitted to celluloid, guaranteeing the strongest stomach and the most difficult funny bones. <br /> <br /> Filming with a zero budget and some of the shaky cinematography Around, ROCHE FLAMINGOS tells the story of two families competing for the tabloid title of "The Filthiest People Alive." How dirty can they be? Many: The movie contains everything from sex to chickens to what I can only describe as a remarkable display of rectal control after a heap of doggie doo help, and I guarantee you don't want to eat an egg at least a few weeks later no. see it. <br /> <br /> The cast is either wonderful, horrible or frightening, depending on how you see it. The star is, of course, Divine ... and to describe Divine as the GREATEST queen of the planet on the planet would be the oppression of the year. She is a mammoth that is given to BIG eye makeup, BIG orange hair, and BIG expressions. She is the Charleton Heston of dress, and whether she is running a jogger and pausing to use the bathroom on one's front lawn, or surprisingly real buyer by taking a walk along a Baltimore pavement, she is unspeakable inexpressibly funny. Others in the film include Mary Vivian Pearce, Danny Mills, and the ever-shocking Edith Massey as members of the Divine Family; and Mink Stole and David Lochary as the white slaves, baby-selling couple challenging God's status. <br /> <br /> It should be pretty clear that PINK FLAMINGOS is not exactly a movie that will only appeal to everyone, and viewers who know John Waters will only be featured in such later films as HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY. be a big push. But if you want to see something so completely different, that even Monty Python couldn't imagine it, it's the movie for you. Just make sure you eat before you see it, because you'll probably not want to eat later - and you might just want to keep a bag handy. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
