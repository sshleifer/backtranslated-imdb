This is one of the many techno-phobic movies that originated like mushrooms in the mid-90s. After the internet became mainstream. <br /> <br /> Hollywood movies always had their way to beautify the images, making them better and more attractive. The same happens when Hollywood tries to show us some hi-tech. The outcome of such efforts differs from far-fetched and ridiculous (see Hackers (1995), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), etc.). To be fairly realistic (see Sneakers (1992)). <br /> <br /> The Net lies somewhere between those extremes. By nitpicking one can come up with many technical inconsistencies, and many instances where the evils are much more "sexy" and graphical than things are in real life (as usual in movies). <br /> <br /> But just by looking over, the viewer ends with a fairly solid, entertaining movie. The characters and acting are convincing, and the movie does a great job of keeping you in the seat until its end. The plot is okay (a fairly standard one, really based on the good eg paranoid design but with high technology edge this time), and pretty convincing (again when technical issues are not considered). However, the development of the plot is a bit slow, and sometimes you can expect some so-called surprising turns in the plot. <br /> <br /> The bonus here is a tuck shop Sandra Bullock, which, besides being cute (something she does pretty easily, apparently), also portrays a firm act. You can really feel her character - her despair, her emotions. <br /> <br /> In the bottom line, the film is entertaining and interesting, about 7 out of 10 in my scale. It is worth renting out of the video library or even watching the theater. Whether you want to buy it or not, is yours.
