I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> No one I know likes it, but I do. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it as much as the first one, but it was still good. The writing and plot may not have changed, but the story was better than Caddyshack 1. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't have Caddyshack 2 is ... <br /> <br /> NO RODNEY DANGERFIELD! <br /> <br /> I think the movie would be better if Rodney Dangerfield had Jackie Mason's part. Although I was Jackie Mason in the movie, it would be much better if they kept Rodney Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> Another bug in the movie, which I didn't hate so much, was Dan Akroyd. The movie was done 8 years after the first one. Bill Murray, "Carl," could stop his job as an assistant green farmer and join the army, you know? If Warner Bros thought about it, it could have made the movie even better. <br /> <br /> This was my comment for Caddyshack II. <br /> <br /> I give it 8.2 out of 10 <br /> <br /> It could have been better, but good. <br /> <br /> If you saw Caddyshack 1 and debate whether you want to see Caddyshack 2, I say giving it a three.
