Wonderful editing, excellent acting, especially by Epatha Merkerson, and very enjoyable musical soundtrack. This film dates back to the 40's to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and the effect of desegregation while weighing the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady. <br /> <br /> The actor depicting the young Terrence Howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his education in the small New York city. The audience laughed, exclaimed and burst into applause for the film and its director. <br /> <br /> Soon to be shown on HBO (February 7, I believe) - burn the TIVO and enjoy a wonderful story!
