I found the movie Judas Kiss excellent. Carla Gugino's performance was extraordinary, probably her best in her career. Her facial expressions in many scenes were incredibly true to character, and they were best exploited by director Gutierrez. All actors and actresses were very good at their performances. Emma Thompsom was as usual wonderful. Her acting abilities are much higher than would be necessary for this character, so it actually improves it in the movie. <br /> <br /> The story, though sometimes influenced, is preserved and pointed to the end. Very, very good. A movie that should not be missed. A story well woven and brilliantly targeted. Quality of film, excellent.
