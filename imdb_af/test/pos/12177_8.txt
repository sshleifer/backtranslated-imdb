Aaliyah blows all the female members out of the water, including the official love interest Marguerite Moreau. <br /> <br /> I would like this movie to play like Akasha's power trip. Aaliyah is simply electrifying when on the screen. She does sensual, beautiful and threatening to the power of 10. <br /> <br /> If you see her taking on a bar full of vampires, Lena Olin is in the ungrateful role of the "older woman", who is extremely unfair is. She looks fantastic and at 46 (according to the IMDb) it looks pretty beautiful. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story shows very limited plot, we've seen it all before, etc. <br /> <br /> The most sad thing is Akasha's death scene, especially keeping in mind what happened to Aaliyah after filming. <br /> <br /> All in all, a remarkable vampire movie.
