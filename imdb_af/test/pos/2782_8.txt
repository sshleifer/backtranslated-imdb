A little beautiful representation of the European Union, starting under the young generation as representatives of the group, is learning to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, ​​where they all study at international associations. The centerpiece of the story is Xavier (Romain Duris), who lived a fairly conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly became a leader in the group, helping them deal with homeowners and other problems. He quickly learns about life and love. Duris has a healthy appearance and gives a good performance. The rest of the role-play also plays well. Sometimes they all fall into English when they make sure they communicate, unsure of all their apartment mates' ability to understand French or Danish or whatever the languages ​​may be. Cinematography notable including fine views of Barcelona and its famous Gaudi towers.
