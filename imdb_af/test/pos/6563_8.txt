Wow. I just saw this movie on the Sundance Channel, and it's really weird. I can't be a filmmaker, but it's probably the most bizarre movie I saw as an average movie lover. <br /> <br /> Whoever came with it had a great imagination. I'm a bit of a fan of Japanese dramas, and there are often drama actors in movies. (Matsushima Nanako, for example, starring in Ringu, is an important j-drama artist.) But it seems to be the first film for Kirie and Shuichi's portrayals. I must say, if they really debut here, they do a very good job. <br /> <br /> Kirie was a very sympathetic character, I thought it was easy to maintain. She was friendly and kind, perhaps not the most popular girl, but more beautiful than some of the other attention-seeking girls. She was also beautiful in a classic way. I hope she does more movies, but it's been a few years so maybe she doesn't have such plans. <br /> <br /> The end was strange. I'm not going to give anything away, but the rest of the movie's weird guys were sorry. <br /> <br /> Very bizarre but very imaginative and unique movie. I would recommend it to Japanese horror fans, though I will warn you, it's much more bizarre than Ringu. <br /> <br /> I want to give it a 7.5 out of 10, for originality, imagination, good characterization, above-average acting, and just plain intrigue.
