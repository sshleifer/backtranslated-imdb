I thought I was wasting my precious $ 50 to watch this movie. But on the serious request of my friend who is a fiery fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to show up for the movie. Going to this cheap theater really bothered me because I saw King Kong at $ 50 at one of the best theaters in town. Anywasy started the movie and amazingly I didn't complain. <br /> <br /> A great story and some amazingly wonderful plays on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma's part. Shabana Azmi a divorce dedicated her life to the welfare of her mother and step sister. Concern Sen Sharma a schizophrenic (saving me the spelling), which always suggests the thing. Rahul Bose also gives a star performance. <br /> <br /> The story is that Mithi (Sen Sharma) is schizophrenic and, after being brutally raped on her fieldwork as a reporter, her levels are really increasing, her fiancé leaves her, for the person she has become. Her whole world comes down to her. Shabana Azmi, her older step-sister, takes care of her and Mithi believes in her imagination that she is married to her fiance, with 5 children and they live in 15 Park Avenue (which is really a place in New York). The plot is going on when Mithi becomes suicide because she believes that no one believes her and that she is being held in her house by her husband. As fate would have, Mithi and her fiance meet when they are both traveling. 11 years after the brutal rape, her fiancé has no existence in her real world, she cannot recognize him. Her fiancee, now married and a father of two children, feels it is his duty to rectify the mistake he made 11 years ago. He promised to take her to Park Avenue. and he does it. He took her to a place in Kolkata that probably looked like her husband's house. As Joydeep / Jojo (Rahul Bose) speaks her fiance on his cellphone, he loses Mithi. Everyone's looking for her, but she's nowhere to be found. She eventually found what her, her family, had been denying her own imaginative family in her own world on Park Avenue. <br /> <br /> I must say it touched my heart. I am now a fan of Aparna Sen's direction. The camera work is wonderful. And the quality of performance is gaming. Konkona Sen Sharma gives a good performance as the schizophrenic child. Shabana Azmi gives a different thought role to the divorce's older sister, who has the burden of keeping the family. Rahul Bose, another neat and quiet roll (I don't know why this guy doesn't get big breaks, he has so much potential). Lastly, Aparna Sen, she still captivates the audience, even though she is not in front of the camera and behind it. <br /> <br /> A very well deserved 8/10 ....
