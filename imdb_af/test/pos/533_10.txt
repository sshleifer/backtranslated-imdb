Adam Sandler's movies are my favorite comedies. The silence of the lambs is my favorite horror movie. The Matrix is ​​my favorite sci-fi movie. Anywhere But here is my favorite drama. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the single most valuable asset this movie has is acting. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon is absolutely wonderful. By the end of this movie I felt as though I knew her character better than I knew myself. She did a wonderful job. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman also did a good job. I recently rented her first film, Leon (1994), in which she played a 12-year-old girl. I believe she is a contradiction in terms; she was a good kid actress. Well, 5 years later she is just as good an actress. In fact, she's much better. <br /> <br /> Not only did Sarandon and Portman portray their characters well, they also worked perfectly together. I mean, even now I can hardly believe they are not actually mother and daughter in real life, as well as in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a 14-year-old girl (Portman) and her restless mother (Sarandon) leaving their home in Wisconsin for Beverly Hills. <br /> <br /> Initially, Portman hates her mother to take her away from her cousin and friends, and the two start a very turbulent relationship. and off in the course of a few years (usually down, I may add). <br /> <br /> Although this explanation is slightly vague, the plot can only be summarized vaguely. But if you see this movie, you will see that the plot is really not so vague or weak, as it is really deep. What I am saying is that the plot is poorly sketched, but then they focus on making it strong. <br /> <br /> And it's very strong, but the plot sequence is great too. And there are some brilliant scenes that I hope will one day be considered classic. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. I laughed. I cried. And while there are some loopholes, it's still a star movie and it finally comes together.
