I think this TV movie was first broadcasted by Manchester Utd in the Champions League final (1999). They performed many soccer-related items that week and this one was an absolute look. <br /> <br /> It played on all the clich√©s that are struggling every season during the FA Cup, ie underdogs, lucky clothes / mascots, name on the cup etc. And it was brilliantly funny. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised this has never been repeated before other major soccer events, even now with the World Cup just under way. <br /> <br /> Some previous posts from non-football fans have said they are still fond of it, but a football fan will find it hilarious imho.
