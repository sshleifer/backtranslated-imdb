(r # 88) Brilliant, very entertaining display with spectacular effects. Any fan of these prehistoric reptiles should see it. The CGI combines very well with the environment and it's just fun to see these giants doing their daily business as if they were on Discovery Channel. This show was a stroke of genius and it blows its followers "Walking with animals" and "The future is wild" out of the water. <br /> <br /> The biggest episode was definitely the last, where we watched the last days of the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the meteor strike that became their punishment. These things are almost too fantastic for television. What about a theater release? I'll pay anything to see this dinos in the theater. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a show that is spectacular, engaging and educational at the same time, it's for you. Dinosaurs have never been cooler.
