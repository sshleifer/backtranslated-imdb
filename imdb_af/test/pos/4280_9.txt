Those who do not like this movie seem to think that a loved one somehow "belongs to them" and should be thrown away if they go with someone else. Fortunately, human nature is much deeper than that; To love someone brings unnecessary suffering, although we are just happy with their death. <br /> <br /> This film is true in the environment, atmosphere and dialogue with Nigel Balchin's original novel (A Way Through The Wood), and by finding a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma, the silent despair which lies behind many seemingly idyllic lives (and the portrayal of English upper class terrestrial life is very accurate). <br /> <br /> I loved the movie and hope it will appear soon as a compatible DVD in the UK
