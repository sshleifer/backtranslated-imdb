Jamie Foxx does a great job of portraying the famous blues / soul / country singer Ray Charles. For the film's credit, it shows both the good and the bad about Charlemagne's character and the choices he made, both personally and professionally. <br /> <br /> It's a smooth movie that gives you a rich sense of the periods in which the story takes place. It doesn't look good, it sounds good. I just wish there was more music here. When inserted, it is fantastic, but not enough. <br /> <br /> Accepting, at least for review, that the story was true, I was impressed and disappointed with Charles, meaning that the story left a few memorable impressions since I wrote this 16 months after I watched. Key Impressions include: <br /> <br /> GOOD - Relive Ray's tremendous talent and prospect of walking out and making chances musical, such as going for a country a while. The man had the highest confidence in himself, but did not get so arrogant about it. He also remembered that he had defeated his heroin addiction - without help! It's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> BAD - I also remember by this movie how easy Ray got in the first place and disappointed that he was so unfaithful to his wife. A very sad note was that his wife was more upset because he missed the youngsters' little ones of his child than she was for all the fraud he had done to her and even a child with a member of his singing group taken. <br /> <br /> The only negative I had with the filmmakers was the over-emphasis that his problems were blamed on one early childhood event, the accidental death of his brother. This tragedy has been used as a cop-out for all Ray's crimes as an adult, another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actions. <br /> <br /> Note: There is an extended version with The DVD but the word has edited it so poorly that it is not worth watching, so stick to the "theatrical version."
