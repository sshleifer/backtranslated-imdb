I saw it on DVD with subtitles, which made it a little frustrating to go through because of the movie's length. But I did it. Being fascinated by the characters and always doubting the story, despite the captions, proves the power of the film. It's a wonderful piece of work. I put it on my list of ten favorite movies of all time. It's the best foreign movie I've seen in the last twenty years. I would like to know the full story behind the making of this movie. It must have taken very long and needs the use of hundreds of sites. The use of some hardcore scenes (on the TV in the motel room) can unfortunately choose some people not to see, but if you don't mind, you will be deeply surprised by all the stories in this one!
