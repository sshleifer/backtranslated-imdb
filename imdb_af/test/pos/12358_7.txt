It is a mistake to refer to any movie of this era as a horror movie. Most early German movies with supernatural themes are not so much horror movies, as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early German Romanticism such as E. T. A. Hoffman and others. In Fritz Lang's "Der Mude Tod" (also from 1921), the dead person takes a young man away from his beloved, but in Lang's movie the characters' fate cannot be reduced by behavior. None of the young lovers deserve to die, but they are destined to be reunited only in death. <br /> <br /> However, in Victor Seastrom's "Korkarlen" repentance is always an option. Destiny can be changed - and postponed - by the characters' choices. Although scenes from the Phantom Carriage that collect souls are truly ominous, these horrific images of Death are compromised as the great level by the sacrifice of salvation to the true monster of this story, David Holm, a brutal drunk who is due to a wrong hatred of humanity, distributes tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone he comes into contact with. <br /> <br /> One New Year's Day Holm is beaten in battle with a drinking company. As the first person to start dying at midnight, Holm must become the Phantom Carriage manager and collect souls in the New Year. The Phantom Carriage, driven by an old expert who has ruined Holm on his way, comes for his soul and takes him on a journey of self-discovery. Along the way, Holm sees the horror he committed to his family and the people who are trying to help him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps my disappointment with the movie's end is a criticism of the Selma Lagerl√∂f novel on which the film is based. But I would have preferred not to allow David Holm to escape his fate and to see his conversion come to prevent his wife from poisoning his two children and herself and to see that Holm is the result of His sins suffer their souls. It would be an appropriate punishment and an abomination that was greater than the evidence of the abuse he committed to others. In the film, however, the immutable nature of fate is not the message; salvation is. The driver of the wagon returns Holm's spirit to his body, and he saves his family in the neck of time. His remorse is Scrooge's remorse in "A Christmas Carol." <br /> <br /> If the trite and sentimental end do not offend you, there is much to impress in the movie's images. The special effects are astonishing, measured by the standards of the day, and still hold fast, which is more miraculous if you think this double exposure is created in a hand-made camera. Also the recovered movie on Tartan's new DVD looks fabulous.
