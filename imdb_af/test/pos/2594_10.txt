Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that Bugs Bunny / Daffy Duck / Elmer Fudd knows in a war of words and knows if it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stir "Pronoun's trouble" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun, followed by his beak being still demolished. Then there is the rabbit's cross decoration that always gets Elmer in his love. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always my favorites in the category of writer-directors because of this hilarious hunting trilogy I have laughed since I was a kid. And at least two of them end up with Daffy's call to Bugs: "You're despicable!" Can't get better!
