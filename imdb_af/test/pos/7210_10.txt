If you've never been "Tromatized", it's the Troma movie to see first. Wonderful acting, super-loaded soundtrack and breast-a-gut humor blend perfectly with Troma's unique brand of storytelling and special effects. Despite a word for word of Romeo and Juliet, the fact that it remains in an iambian pentameter remains the strange feeling that it is closer to Shakespeare than that exaggerated video with DiCaprio and Danes. I assumed that I saw the ultimate Shakespearian comedy when Moonlighting's movie reviewed The Taming of the Shrew, but nothing comes close to Tromeo and Juliet. I strongly recommend the DVD version, which includes a second soundtrack with director Lloyd Kaufman who is just as entertaining as the main track.
