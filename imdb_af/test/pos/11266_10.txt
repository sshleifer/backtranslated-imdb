I bought this video on VCR tape in a good-will store for US 50 cents. I took quite a few videos that I bought back to sell to others after watching them with the 50 cents cost of renting. This is the only one that will never go back. It is an explosion of artistic talent, color and sound. I don't know if I should call it circus, dance or both. It is bigger than life itself. They will be able to do just a few short years in their lives. These are the artists for the artists. If Gene Kelly and Burt Lancaster live today and have seen them, they will get rid of. I will lend it to others to look at, but I know if I will do it, I will never get it back.
