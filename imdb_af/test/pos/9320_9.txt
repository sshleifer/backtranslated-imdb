One of the better musical bios. Dennis Morgan is wonderful as the singer / composer Chauncey Olcutt. The supporting role is very good, especially Andrea King as the glamorous Lillian Russell. That atmosphere of the centuries is that perfection setting. The technicolor is excellent. A simple plot, but the movie just makes you feel good. Morgan was always underestimated as an actor and a singer.
