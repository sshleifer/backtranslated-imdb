I looked at King of Queens from the beginning and felt it was overlooked at the awards. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk a lot about it because I work at a company like IPS, (DHL) and we just love the Teamster plugs !! Carrie is my hero, she's the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur, what can you say? He just cracks you up and turns on things. Doug, well, he is just as sweet, and funny, the three characters, plus all the friends, just make the show complete. This is the best comedy on TV !! I'll say there with Seinfeld, and hey, there's nothing wrong with that. Excellente !! as Doug would say.
