Very trustworthy entertainment, such as Las Vegas amusements as well as intriguing, very light heart and much enhanced by Josh Duhanel !! I like this television program and I think many people consider it a form of escapist voyeurism. Voyeurism in this case is very positive, and many women in this series are very nice to watch ... This show includes Las Vegas in legends such as Wayne Newton as intermittent characters to verify the Las Vegas genre !! There are abundant depictions of the city of sin, this is one of the better efforts ... The producers and directors are happy to have James Caan in the show because he is a very perfect actor !!! Generally I like the TV show Las Vegas and I see it on Fridays, I also watched it on Mondays, but with Monday Night soccer I could see why NBC switched it to Fridays. Nevertheless I love Las Vegas a lot !!
