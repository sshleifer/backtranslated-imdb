"Mishima: a life in four chapters" is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with ease. It is based on the life of the controversial Japanese author Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. It is not really a biopsy - at least not one in the traditional sense - but an exploration of Mishima's iconoclastic oeuvre. The film manages to present abstract concepts in an unbroken, completely engaging way. Paul Schrader sympathizes with Mishima without exposing him or his work. It doesn't make the mystery right, but it does make you understand it. An added bonus: As we see Mishima's anger over the lack of tradition in a morally freestanding modern society, Schrader gives us an excellent demonstration of the dichotomy between thought and performance in the cinema. John Bailey's cinematography is spectacularly good. The greatness of composer Philip Glass's work is perfectly suited to the project. Mishima is the best movie I've seen this year.
