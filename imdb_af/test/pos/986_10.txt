If I never read or saw the Bard's original work, I can't compare this work to his story. So I won't. Instead, I would just say that it was a very entertaining story with some very special special effects (and some looking a bit lower in the budget, but still decent enough to enjoy). I thought all the primary actors did good work. The style of magic looked more black and white and was almost certain to offend anyone who had easily upset that kind of thing, but I thought it was well done.
