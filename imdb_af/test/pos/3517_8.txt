Just before Dawn I was really surprised when I saw it by being much less of a horrible horror adventure than I expected. Instead, director Jeff Lieberman directs a wonderful atmospheric and disturbing atmosphere for much of the movie, the constant build-up of tension until I'm really uncertain about what is going to happen, but is being stuck as a spring waiting. The lack of action in many parts has given it a very satisfying blend with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre kind of atmosphere, and when the action really kicks, it's really shocking and dramatic, without ever really being needed to be stingy. The characters are about the same for this kind of movie, though more sympathetic than some, and the bad guy, memorably freaky. Photography and tension are the real winners in this movie and they like the fact that it never gets boring (as suggested). I recommend this one to serious horror fans. Don't expect Gore, expect a terrific backwood story with several wonderful moments and a wonderful dream-like atmosphere.
