Watching this little movie is a real delight from start to finish. The story is always entertaining, the tension never falls. The whole role is wonderful. The team of Walken and Bracco work perfectly, it's almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance. Bracco is very sexy and very funny as the scam artist who fights for her independence. For some reason they have given Walken a very strange makeup and the strangest hairstyle I can imagine? It's kind of a parody of the one that Burt Lancaster had in Elmer Gantry. For me it added. This is the first film I have seen Miguel Ferrer, probably one of the most undervalued film actors of his generation. He is very good at a small role as Bracco's pimp. Even the Jamaican thugs are an eye to see. I can highly recommend this movie.
