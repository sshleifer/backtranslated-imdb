In the 60's, Cleveland television groups were an episode of "Flash Gordon" as part of the Ghoulardi Show (Friday at 11:30 am). It was the best mockfest material ever seen by any of us in junior highs. We will often have a place to sleep (although we have not mentioned it) just to watch the fun of these with a group of friends. Then next week we will quote our favorite cornball lines of the latest episode. <br /> <br /> To see it today, very much the same reaction. But if you stop laughing at the dialogue, the lame creatures, the stupid costumes and the awful spaceships long enough, there are good things I didn't appreciate for the first time. The production designers have built some excellent sets, both the rooms and the laboratory appliances. Charles Middleton's "Ming the Merciless" character was the best screen saver, certainly up to that point and better than anyone else. Jean Rogers is exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
