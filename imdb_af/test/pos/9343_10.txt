John Landis surprised himself when he directed Michael Jackson's THRILLER as a short film. Of course it is stingy, the dialogue is awful and it seems to be cheesy, but it is perfect, nothing less. <br /> <br /> Michael and his date are at the theater to see the latest horrorflick. . When it all becomes a bit too graphic for the date, she leaves. Michael follows. On their way home, they decided to take a short cut through the local cemetery. It starts there. <br /> <br /> The real thriller dance is wonderful. It's full of Jackson's brands as well as some unforgettable zombie movements. It does not seem rushed, not too long. The whole thing looks filmy and it's actually scary. Of course, this is one of the best-known music videos of all time, and is probably the greatest music video ever made. <br /> <br /> Overall: Look it seriously. The 13 minutes will be the best ever spent watching a screen. (5/5)
