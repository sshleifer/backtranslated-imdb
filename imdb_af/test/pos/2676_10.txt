this show is the best, it's full of laughs and Kevin James is the best. If you want a good performance, I recommend the king of queens and it is a decay that they have canceled. cause problems if you play a role with Kevin James and Jerry Stiller, you can't go wrong. so I don't know why the show was canceled if anyone knew. Tell me now. Now you can't find many shows that meet your needs. After Seinfeld and king of queens were worthy of the only show, prison was broken and if it stopped, I didn't know what to do. In the end, if I had to recommend a show, it would be king of queens.
