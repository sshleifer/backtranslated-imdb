I have heard some remarks, especially from prisoners, that CHANGI is not historically accurate, and that it is disappointing. Maybe it's for those who really had to live through these things, and much worse. But for the rest of us, who really have no idea how prisoners were treated by the Japanese during World War II, CHANGI is a remarkable introduction. But CHANGI is not a war documentary - if it had been, then the historical accuracy aspect would be of the utmost importance. It's a miniature drama, with fictional characters and fictional situations (though loosely based on real-life events I've heard and read) - and in the middle of the story is the ideal of mateship. This group of young Australian soldiers, who had been captured by the Japanese for many years and kept in terrible conditions for years, became their friends through adversity and the strength of their friendships continued during the course of their lives after the war. It is also a cultural study of the differences between the Japanese of the time and the Western world, with its music, games and entertainment. In Part 5 it becomes clear that Japan will lose the war after Germany surrendered in Europe. The Japanese colonel of the prison camp insists that his country should study the culture of their prisoners. To defeat a people, they must defeat their culture. To do this, one must understand it. All in all, Australia continues to produce its rich tradition of exceptional television miniseries. He is an unrivaled world leader in this regard. Exploring the AFI award with CHANGI is MY BROTHER JACK, adapting George Johnston's novel and also a worthy winner. Miniseries in recent years include DAY OF THE ROSES (The Story of the Glanville Train Accident Investigation), KING IN GRASS CASTLE (adjusting Mary Durack's historic report of her provisional ancestors), KANGAROO PALACE (about a group of friends from a country city in Australia that travels to London and changes and grows apart, and the (somewhat disappointing) adaptation of Bryce Courtenay's powerful novel, THE POTATO FACTORY. Less recently: Nancy Cato's falling saga of life on Murray - ALL RIVERS RUN; Cusack & James's brilliant novel on post-war life in Sydney - COME IN SPINNER; Colleen McCullough's outstanding pioneering saga - THE DORNE BIRDS; THE RIVER KINGS; Ruth Park's novel THE HARP IN THE SOUTH; BODY LINE; EUREKA STOCKADE; ANZACS; etc. ... of course there were some non-good productions - for example MOBY DICK, DO OF THE, ON THE BEACH, DORNE BIRDS: THE UNDERGROUND YEAR, etc.). Generally, if an Australian miniseries comes your way, make sure you see it - and it's double for CHANGI, a wonderfully-directed masterpiece. Rating: 9/10.
