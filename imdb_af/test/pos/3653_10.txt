A work of love. Every frame is picture perfect and grab you. Then the mere emotion and storytelling takes you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are part of the emotional ride of the characters. I saw this movie at 2 festivals and it had standing ovations at each show. The remarkable narrative story exceeds nationality and language and I felt I was part of the drama that challenged me. The casting is as perfect as you can get. Vijay Raaz, Camille and Benoit each own their own. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates good cinema. I can't wait for the commercial release of this movie.
