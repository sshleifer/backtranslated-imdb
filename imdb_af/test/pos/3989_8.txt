I've always liked this movie, I've seen it so many times, but I've always enjoyed it :) The story is interesting and special. But the only thing I disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Roem English monastery, or what was it: P They don't look like that in Romania. Anyway, Ghita Muresan played anyway. Well, but as someone said to me, she needs to improve English. <br /> <br /> And there were some funny moments as well as some tragic / sad parts. It was seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love. I recommended to everyone. It's not the best movie ever, but it was great!
