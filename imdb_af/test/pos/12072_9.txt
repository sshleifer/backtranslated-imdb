I sounded like a girl at the end of this movie and I dare anyone else to keep it without a sob. Absolutely heartbreaking things, but lifting at the core. <br /> <br /> A good effort by Ann Margaret who plays a terminally ill mother of ten who will know her arthritic steel-working man will not be. able to support the family when she's gone, arranging the adoption of her children before she shakes. The role really earned an Oscar. <br /> <br /> You really feel this poor family, as the dying mother gives her everything to ensure that her children are not hospitalized in a poorly administered orphanage. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, get it if you can.
