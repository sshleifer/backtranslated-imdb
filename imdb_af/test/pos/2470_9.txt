I caught this movie on TV yesterday. I had a certain curiosity about it being directed by Emilio Estevez and leading him and his real father, Martin Sheen. I love a movie about a father-boy relationship that involves a real father and son. Of course, there is a direct chemistry between Sheen and Estevez, and their scenes of conflict are even more intense because they know they're actually related. Of course it helps that the two of them are both great actors. I've seen Martin Sheen before in intense roles, but I think it's Emilio's most intense role - because I mostly remember him from the Mighty Ducks series - and I was very impressed. Talent really works in that family. And Kathy Bates steals the movie in an Oscar-worthy performance. She drew my passion with every word of dialogue. Kimberly Williams - the beautiful actress of the "Father of the Bride" movies - is also very good, holding her own among a group of talented veteran actors. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit of a stage, with dialogue obviously for stage, but it didn't bother me. It is not meant to be an action movie; this is a character study. And for a movie based on a play, it never gets too claustrophobic. When Emilio's character, Jeremy, recalls his days in Vietnam, we actually see his annoyances coming to life. <br /> <br /> The movie is extremely powerful and realistic, without being sentimental. Eventually, I expected all the conflicts to be resolved and the family would be, but that's not how it turned out. The end made me cry, without applying the standard Hollywood melodrama. It proves that reality is much more gripping than Hollywood can emerge. <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for a beautiful, powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that will knock your socks ... please watch this underrated jewel. Hopefully Martin and Emilio will be united with Charlie one day, and they will all make a good movie together. <br /> <br /> My Score: 9 (out of 10)
