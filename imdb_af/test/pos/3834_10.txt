It should be one of my 3 favorite episodes from the original TV series. <br /> <br /> What makes it great is the battle of mind between Romulan commander and Kirk, as well as the forefront of Mark Lenard, who will later play Spock's father in other TV episodes and movies. This is a case where those around them have risen to the level of talent around them, and Shatner, Nimoy, and the entire cast provide an excellent performance in this episode. <br /> <br /> The writing and plot are also excellent, and I love the direct approach with which we characterize the characters, and the feelings and thoughts of those characters, and how freely they are expressed by the actors. <br /> <br /> This very entertaining episode is 10 out of 10. AWESOME !! Desert Buddha
