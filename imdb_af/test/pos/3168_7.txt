I thought it was very "different" compared to most modern interpretations of Shakespeare and thoroughly enjoyed it. It will not be useful to those at school, etc. Do not study, as this does not show the traditional Shakespeare character interpretations (ie Miranda is fairly well-portrayed in comparison to your traditional Shakespeare lady) but for the understanding of the play and the basis of the story it is a very strong piece and great to watch. It also does not include the correct format, such as in explaining acts and scenes, as I currently play Miranda in a production and most of her lines are cut and some scenes are divided and mixed, but it is very useful and useful. I'll definitely recommend it as a must-see even if you just say you've seen it! Shakespeare fans will love this!
