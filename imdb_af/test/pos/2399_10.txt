Fred Carpenter has tested Eddie Monroe at Boston College, and judging by the enthusiastic response, he has much to be satisfied. A scholar, well done Indy, impressive for it is a great budget look and feel. This movie has it all: a stiff writing that grabs you and does not release until the surprises end. This viewer didn't see it! Excellent achievements everywhere. Craig Morris and Jessica Tsunis were particularly well-versed in the lead, delivering strong performances. And kudos to Frank Bongiorno and Alex Corrado for creating two detectives as tempting and interesting to watch as any movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It confirmed my belief that the best work in the film comes from the independents, and Fred Carpenter looks one of the best.
