If there is one theme of this movie, it is that people can handle hardship by having a good imagination. This family is poor, their father works graveyard and their mother works double shifts, and Peter is constantly tackled for various reasons, and is increasingly frustrated that he is often mistaken for a girl. He is only approaching that age of 10 or 11 where your perceptions start to change, and think your appearance is starting to matter. The background to this story is the 1967 World Fair and the Centennial of Canada. The movie's biggest moments come during the different fantasy rows where we just see how they handle it. Look at the flim, and if you ever had a childhood friend you dreamed of, and for some reason lost, you will really like this movie. Perhaps children will love this movie, but only adults will really appreciate it, including references to Bolshevik and what parents will do for their children.
