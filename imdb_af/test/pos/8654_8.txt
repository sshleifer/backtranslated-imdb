Scandinavians are pretty good at letting me laugh at killing nothing of my soulless life. Huh. The film production here was incredibly meticulous, every piece of frame, every deadpan staring, every element of the color palette, every piece of muzak or cradle of those street cleaners was there to house the world's calm emptiness. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think I could have found the general sense of emptiness, if its absurdity hadn't been. really funny and related. As Andreas tells his boss that he misses and watches children and the man smiles and is halfway out of the door, it's a kind of sad but true reflection of work with people spending 7/8 hours with them, more see them as the people you love, but ultimately know deeply, they don't give a damn about your problems and you the same. <br /> <br /> It may have been a movie the Coens made when they were born. in Oslo and not Minnesota. I think their humor is more aggressive and more wrapped up in the past by the theater, but they have the same techniques and their films have the same underlying meaning that life is pretty inconspicuous. <br /> <br /> I'll stop before I speak myself to take a bus in the winter wilderness.
