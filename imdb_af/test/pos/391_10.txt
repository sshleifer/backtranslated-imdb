Beautiful .... that one word gives up this whole movie. Everything about cinematography, directing, acting ..... brilliant. At any point in the movie you can interrupt it, and you'll definitely look at something mosaic or "artificial fartsy" as some people would say. I assure you that after a viewing, "Bobbycrush" will sit in your head. I know this from first-hand experience. Even the soundtrack is great. It goes very well with the tone and fitting of the film. Be grateful that Cam Archer exists in this world. We need more people like him to make movies that show love and shame in completely true (and surreal) images.
