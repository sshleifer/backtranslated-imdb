Uncle Frank is everyone's uncle. This documentary dealt with all aspects of aging in America, loneliness, humor, irony. Uncle Frank and Aunt Tillie were extremely generous to share their life experiences with the audience. The director had an incredible job of capturing the small and large pieces that made their lives. Thanks to everyone who helped make this movie!
