This film shows a serious side to the often thought as gore-fest works of fulci. Not a lot of blood and intestines here, but a fine story about murder and the lives affected. <br /> <br /> A real find as it was created in 1972 and will soon celebrate its 30th anniversary. /> <br /> Check this one, but be warned it's hard to find! <br /> <br /> Ron
