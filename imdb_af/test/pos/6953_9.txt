Where the Rivers Flow North is a well-known story about two people's struggles to live their own lives in the face of "progress" and development. In addition to the movie as entertainment, in the late 1920s I learned a little about living in rural New England. <br /> <br /> The cinematography captured the raw beauty of North Vermont and set the stage, while the music brought the movie to life. Well done for a low budget, locally produced movie. I found Michael J. Fox's character the worst in the film, but Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal make two of the best shows I've seen in a long time. I was sad that she didn't get the best actress this year (I suppose the movie was too small to consider a movie).
