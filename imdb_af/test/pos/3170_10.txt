A wonderful movie, I just saw it and I want to see it again. I've never heard of Derek Jarman before I saw this movie, but now I can't wait to see his others. The film takes a whole new perspective of Shakespeare's The Tempest, I sure he appreciated Jarman's use of the drama's themes of love, magic, darkness and atmospheric tension. OK, OK, there might have been some nudity in the movie I didn't really expect, but it didn't offend me, it just surprised me and made the movie more unpredictable. One Spoiler (for those who are nervous: Fast forward the playback scene with Sycorax & Caliban and Ariel as their slave, its beautiful graphics. Overall, if you begin to find Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare performances briefly and monotonously, you should see it. Movie, Fantastic and Surrealistic, it'll blow you away, but only if you leave it, keep an open mind - and then let this movie work, it's your magic.
