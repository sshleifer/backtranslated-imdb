I've never been so impressed with Night Gallery, but this one episode is out. <br /> <br /> A TV network executive audition is a strange act - a young, naughty boy who continues to make predictions. The exec rejects the whole thing as a capricious waste of time until both forecasts come true the next morning. <br /> <br /> What looks like is a parlor act, becomes a hit show, as the child's predictions are consistently accurate. <Br /> <br /> One day he refuses to do the show. As a result of imminent show time, everyone is threatened at the end of the case, even with a legal action if he fails to fulfill his contract and does his daily forecast. <br /> <br /> The young boy remembered and predicted a seemingly utopian tomorrow. br /> <br /> After the show, the guarded executive asks for an explanation, just to learn why the full truth is too frightening to reveal.
