Don't change your husband, and on the one hand is the start of a series of lightweight wedding competitions by Cecil B. DeMille. On the other hand, it is his first star for star Gloria Swanson, probably the greatest actress of the quiet era, and is the movie that made her a star. <br /> <br /> Although the old DeMille formula has begun to change, and its films become more and more purely visual, with such an expressive artist as Swanson, we get a lot of silent storytelling style. Her character does very little, but carries volumes through subtle gestures and facial expressions? with a specific talent for the appearance of contempt. In real life, Swanson herself was at the end of her disastrous marriage to Wallace Beery, and this fact may have fueled her convincing performance. <br /> <br /> As if the best of his leading lady's talents is the best, use DeMille's framework and close-ups are especially strong here. He uses cinematic technique to show the play? does Swanson often keep in long neighbor at long hours? and also to explain the story visually. For example, when we were introduced to the character of Toodles, she was shown three times in a dressing room mirror. Her character disappears from the story, just to become important to the end. That first step shot of her helps us remember who she was. Later, at the birthday dinner, Swanson and future husband number two Lew Cody are framed together in one shot, while Elliot Dexter is isolated in his own frame. Also ?? and this is a sign of the increasing sophistication of theater in general ?? There is much use of reaction shots ?? for example, the bishop's disapproving look when Cody portrays his intentions with the wedding figure dolls. <br /> <br /> Contrary to DeMille's visual narrative method, the increasing painting of his associate was Jeanie Macpherson. As I noticed in several other remarks, Macpherson could bring a strong and dramatic story, but like DeMille, she tends to put her themes in a somewhat pretentious and flamboyant style. And so we get these very long, quasi-philosophical title cards about the pitfalls of married life that, if they completely improve the story, just because they are inadvertently funny. For example, just Jeanie Macpherson could do with a line like "the fate sometimes sneaking in Christmas shopping". Fortunately, although in this picture these titles mostly represent scenes rather than breaking them up. <br /> <br /> Although the photos he made around this time tended to be small, it is at this point that DeMille wanted to develop his taste for the spectacular. You can see him start sneaking in excuses for a little razzmatazz, as the little Swanson fantasy devices are disturbed with "Pleasure, wealth and love". It won't be until the early twenties when the official embargo on historical photos has been lifted, so he gets the chance to go out with the big spectacle. <br /> <br /> All in all, don't change Man is a pretty decent DeMille silent picture, although honest, it's just the presence of Gloria Swanson that elevates it above average. It is curious that it is called a comedy, and Swanson is at least partially thrown because of her background at Mack Sennett's slapstick factory. She hates comedy acting, and gives it a dramatic rather than a comic show. It is then that the only straight drama she did with DeMille, Man and Woman was by far the strongest of their co-operation.
