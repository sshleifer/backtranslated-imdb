I can't believe this movie only scores 7.4! It surely includes the best of Hitchcock's movies like VERTIGO or MARNIE. The only reason I can think why the score is so low is that the MAN ... mostly leaves violence and certainly won't get a sex and crime diploma. <br /> <br /> What comes from it is not violence, it is the reckless energy of these criminals who take a child from their parents and are ready to kill the child if the operation fails. Today it looks like a lot of hard-boiled kidnapping movies, like Mel Gibson's RANSOM, but it looks normal, but in the 1950s, where the family was all in contemporary America, the thought of such a crime surely aroused many emotions . <br /> <br /> And this tension is still working for me today. Yes, these guys are selfish, ignorant bastards, disturbing how they act. This is a deal for them, and they want to be "good businessmen" and ignore the fact that things kidnap child abduction here and murder politicians in the opera! <br /> <br /> What makes the movie good, however, is the creative aspects, the kitchy ideas of Hitchcock, the indignant story in the church (bringing it to the viewer's attention, how alone, how the protagonists are left , no one cares, no one helps, people in church go home ...), meeting the owner of that shop stuffing and preparing dead animals (emphasizing the somewhat oriental flair, has the movie from the opening scenes abroad), does not last the role of MUSIC in this movie. <br /> <br /> Music is the key principle here, if *** SPOILER ***, the killing of the targeted politician must be done right now. of a harsh orkastra tutti / gong; so Hitchcock lets the camera follow the orchestra count and you will happen it in a second *** BANG *** And then, of course, DORIS DAY sings Que sera, which became known as the movie itself; she sings it to tell the child of his parents in the embassy ... <br /> <br /> All in all: a classic !!
