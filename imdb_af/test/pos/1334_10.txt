Despite what his critics experienced, I really enjoyed what it was. Eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum. Soderberg did the artsy hard edge things before Oscars won, at the top of his game. Ocean's 12 is light, commercial, fluffy, Steve's day at Midway if you like. I'm not generally a fan of Zeta-Jones, but even I have to admit that Kate is STUNNING in this movie. It ends up screaming for an upcoming sequel and I'll be one of the millions who watch George and Brad and Matt parlay by Clooney's digs in Lago di Como 120 minutes, swapping over a rich, bad man. If we were able to tolerate 3 installments from the Lord of the Rings, would I ask if we could just shift Clooney's salt and pepper lid one more time?
