I saw this movie in Indianapolis on September 1, 2005. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival showing films for their Real Moving Picture Award screen. A real moving picture "... exploring the human journey by expressing hope and respect for the positive values ​​of life artistic." Heartland gave the award to this film. <br /> <br /> This is a story of golf in the early 20th century. At that time, it was the game of higher class and rich "gentlemen," and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs. With this backdrop, this deployed based on a true story with a young schoolboy adopting the golf foundation and the world's biggest golfer, Harry Vardon. <br /> <br /> And the story is inspiring. At all odds, Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf of "Holes") gets against the best golfers of the US and Great Britain with the US in 1913. Francis is ill-prepared and has a child for a caddy. (The caddy is hilarious and motivating and steals every scene he appears.) However, despite these disabilities, Francis shows courage, spirit, heroism, and humility in this world-class event. <br /> <br /> And we learn a lot about the early years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the layout of the short holes, the manual scoreboard, the golfers swinging in their mouths, the terrible conditions of the green and fairways, and the play is not canceled in the rain. <br /> <br /> This film has beautiful cinematography and art management and editing. And with no big movie stars, the story is somehow more credible. <br /> <br /> This adds to the inventory of major sports films in the year of "Miracle" and "Remember the Titans." <br /> <br /> FYI - There is a website that is really moving, where there is a list of previous winners who are 70 years old.
