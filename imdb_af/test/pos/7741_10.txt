I love this movie and all aspects of it, well directed as a comedy and as a drama. The acting is great, performed by an all-star cast that perfectly plays New York's high society. The scenery is amazing, absolutely breathtaking. I also love the story: a successful NYC architect going through a midlife crisis leaves his fraudster and goes down to a Greek island to hide with his daughter who goes with him. <br /> <br /> I just can't express my love affair enough about this movie. "Show me the magic".
