OK, the other reviewers thoroughly covered the highlights of this wonderful jewel, ie the story started out as material for Buster Keaton's quiet classic "7 Chance". Comedy, or in such a genre, is merely the interpretation of a scene and lines that someone else wrote and performed before, if it is not a completely original creation. Here, The Stooges mainly has material written and performed by someone else, yet for a low budget, a short timing of a movie, they fix things. Whatever the credits on their films say, the real "stooge philes" know they have a lot of input on lines and directions. They tackled their work as seriously as a surgeon needed a surgery. Words that Emil Sitka himself spoke during a documentary about the boys. Here, what seems to be their usual anarchy about something as simple as getting married is actually organized chaos. Each line is perfectly timed with a related physical action. How many comedians are there today to claim such mastery? Mostly, the Seinfeld has crew, but no one else I've seen in the past 35 years to watch television. The critics will always be "pooh pooh" The Stooges or Laurel & Hardy and others, but again ... who ever remembers the critic's names or what they said? Look, laugh and enjoy!
