For those with access to the BBC or the CBC, it has proven to be spectacular. Like Battlestar Gallactica, it is a show that is being rebuilt from the ground up. But in the case of Dr. who saved them the best parts. I can't believe I say it, but it's by far the best Dr. Wie. It does not have any of the cheap production values, and sometimes the old display has slowly started to pick. The acting is pretty good and there is a real sense of continuity and history. The new doctor is easily the equal of the great Tom Baker, and the author (former QAF chief) looked as if even the minor characters had become alive. <br /> <br /> I know ... I'm a good guy. . But it must be on every sci-fi geeks list. I just don't know why it didn't go here. Whatever you do ... if you ever loved Dr. Wie or Sci-fi .. see it !!!
