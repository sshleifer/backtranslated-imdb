This is unfortunately a little-known movie ..... I'm sorry, because it stands with the "classic" of the American silent screen! <br /> <br /> It's about a legend of a "phantom car" traveling all over the world, picking up the souls of those who died. The legend says the last person to die on New Year's Eve will be sentenced to drive the wagon for the next year. <br /> <br /> Bear in mind the sequence of the "Spirit of the Future". Dicken's famous "Christmas Carol". <br /> <br /> The double exposure effects of the ghosts (especially when communicating with the "living" people) are excellent! <br /> <br /> If you like silent movies, you should see it; it will blow you away! <br /> <br /> Standard Bird <br /> <br /> Norm's Old Movie Heaven http://www.nvogel.com/film/film.html
