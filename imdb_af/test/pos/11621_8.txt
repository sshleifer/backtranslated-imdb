The movie "And the Earth didn't swallow him", based on the book by Tomas Rivera, is an eye-opening movie for most people. It talks about the exploitation that migrant farm workers are going through to survive. <br /> <br /> Sergio Perez uses impressive techniques to portray Rivera's story. He uses sienna and gray scale effects to depict the scenes, and he uses specific photographic techniques to make the screens look like they did in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Perez also gives life to the movie <br /> <br /> I feel it's a good movie to watch because it shows in detail how migrant farm workers live, what they do for entertain and do their beliefs.
