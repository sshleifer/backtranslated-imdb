I would like to cancel my dissatisfaction with NBC to cancel Las Vegas. The show has been the Top Notch for the past 5 years. Tom Sellecks's addition was wonderful. He really brought a nice fresh addition to the show. What does NBC have now? Lame reality and night time game shows. I mean come on Keep the old and tired law and order? Not even to put Jack McCoy as DA, the show might be interesting. Give, let's keep quality programs like Deal or No Deal or ED? It has to be poured out into pasture. NBC is now worse than in Pre Seinfeld Cheers days. With cable and internet, NBC can't afford to fall flat on its face. PLEASE AGAIN TO VEGAS! I remember when the Murder on the Street ended on the Street as it did. At least they had a two-hour series final. Hey CBS do you listen? Please pack Vegas, this is a good show.
