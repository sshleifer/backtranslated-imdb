I chose to watch this movie for some reason and one reason alone ... Samuel L. Jackson. I like to love him a lot. I didn't see any previews or trailers for this forgotten movie, so it didn't come up with any real expectations. <br /> <br /> Jackson has not been disappointed as Lazarus, a blues man in the depths of South Africa, and has ever delivered his most powerful performance, including playing and singing some excellent blues songs. But the real surprise here was Christina Ricci, at best a fleeting airlift, who took the role of the sexually abused village disaster Rae and made her a credible, almost equally character. Justin Timberlake, pop star who wants to be an actor, has to go back to cause a wardrobe problem and move a pop stage. . His predominantly forced performance was in the best possible distinction from the real story here. <br /> <br /> This movie is raw, eager and sometimes completely in your face. Not everyone will like it. However, those who do so will quickly move to the top of their favorite list.
