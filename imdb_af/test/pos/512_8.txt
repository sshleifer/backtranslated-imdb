Wesley Snipes is perfectly thrown as Blade, half a man, half-vampire, known as the dagwalder. He has all his strength and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since collaborating with the whistle (Kris Kristofferson), he has chased vampires who have been undetected for centuries, but the Almighty opposite Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the people. he plans to guard the blood god and take control of the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is well thrown, written and directed; to make sure the viewer has an exciting ride from start to finish. Sheets are packed with great battle order and smooth dialogue. Leaves are definitely more action than horror, but it definitely does. <br /> <br /> 8/10
