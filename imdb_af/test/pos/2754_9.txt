Others commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they've been trying to figure out what you're going to watch while attending a live show. The feet, the faces, the general view. Unfortunately, it falls a little short. But after saying that, Colin Dunne is immediately satisfactory. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The performance of the show is clear, changes to the original Dublin production are evident. <br /> <br /> "Trading Taps" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion. Tarik Winston is incredible, just like his partner in the play. <br /> <br /> I think the sound was better in this version than the original video production (1995). In Dolby 5.1 on DVD this is excellent. <br /> <br /> Despite the lack of videography, it is a feature of Riverdance fans.
