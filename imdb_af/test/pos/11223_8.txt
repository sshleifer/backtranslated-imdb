At first glance, a film such as Northfork, a town flooded in 1955 and a group of 6 characters being evacuated to evacuate the remaining townspeople, could just be an ordinary movie. As we soon meet a remaining priest who cares for a sick child, a greedy landowner, we can be set up for a simple story that can easily be consumed. When one is introduced for the first time, you see the wonderful wide open cinematography and a scene where a church hall is involved, a wall that opens to the pastures and the view over the mountains with cattle grazing are missing. It soon becomes clear that this scene and some of the villages' people are aware that this is not an ordinary movie and no ordinary story. It is something special and unique. <br /> <br /> At first glance, things are not so clear, but the view and cinematography of the viewer is astounding, and the characters that soon die out of this inhabited area are just amazing. This is what you can draw in this qwerky movie, whether you're bored and waiting for something to happen. <br /> <br /> The movies are spiritual and dream like features, giving it a slow and methodical approach. what I'm sure will be some viewers, but if you are patient and see the bigger picture, the movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Rating 8 out of 10.
