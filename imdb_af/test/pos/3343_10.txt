I saw it on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun skirt with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover, and the middle fold, as I remember. She is really cute and beautiful and has lots of charm. The movie showed me to see more of her and I found out in other things. She is in Steven Spielberg's "I Want to Hold Your Hand" and Barbara Streisand's "The Main Event" and Bill Murray's "Meatballs", plus many TV shows like Night Court and TV movies. My friends and I really enjoy her. But her lead in Alice in Wonderland puts the focus where it should be, just on Kristine as the center of attention, probably the most beautiful, hottest girl I've ever seen in movies.
