George Sanders plays the Saint for the penultimate time, doing a good job from a good screenplay - with the usual good RKO circulating. It's a non-Charteris story, with murder and good clean fun. <br /> <br /> Thread 1: In New York, police inspector Fernack, Templar's friend was canned and scanned in a corruption scandal - ST came over from London to try and fix things. Nice and simple so far - but is there really more than $ 90,000 in the world? Thread 2: Another story of a woman who takes revenge on the people who killed her brother, Wendy Barrie, does well to bump some nasty men and fall in love with the Saint on her. Including a bath that was under their direct protection and in Fernack's cellar - there was a sly shot of him (dead and staring) and them in a car when they brought him back to where they found him. Paul Guilfoyle as Pearly Gates should have been homosexual in this regard - testifying to the dress dress at the start, and the later fraudulent comment from ST that he thought to keep him a pet - and also did Palm Springs! Fernack was usually played by Jonathan Hale, but this time with such a deviant deviant attitude that it was really needed, a good blow from Templar was to educate him. <br /> <br /> The Hays office also made sure that you fix the photo, all threads are tied with no bumps. It is worth looking for all of us who like this kind of thing, but if Val Kilmer's version is your benchmark, don't worry.
