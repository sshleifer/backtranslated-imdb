Like many stars from the big screen while their careers fell, so much went to television where they probably ensured their reputation for posterity. Donna Reed is a case in point. <br /> <br /> I don't think Donna Reed ever thought Donna Stone was anything challenging, not for a woman who won an Oscar for a very different type. forever. She was definitely better off playing wife, mother and homemaker Donna Stone after playing Mary Bailey in a wonderful life. <br /> <br /> Donna was always beautiful and wise and always helpful with the problems of her children and her husband. Carl Betz was not an idiot, he was a pediatrician who had his office at home. Talk about the man who is ever ready in a crisis. <br /> <br /> Although it was the Donna Reed Show because of Donna's husband at the time, Tony Owen produced it. Yet it took so long because of the popularity of the two children, Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen. Fabares best selling teenage teenager Johnny Angel who she introduced at the show. She successfully made the transition to an adult star, best known for her role in Coach as Craig T. Nelson's wife. <br /> <br /> But Petersen was again a bubbly teen idol. The Donna Reed Show dares to have most of his viewers because of him. It's forgotten now, but Petersen also has a best selling record, My Dad. Didn't do half as well as Johnny Angel. <br /> <br /> Now Paul Petersen is a support group for former child stars like himself. So many of them end up so tragically, it's good work he does. <br /> <br /> The Stone Family was the essence of Central America. They lived in a suburb near Chicago, they had healthy lives. Mom and Dad were always there for the kids. Of course, the problems they usually had were nothing more than breaking out whale. <br /> <br /> It is this series that I believe was the model for the TV town of Pleasantville where Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are sucked. <br /> <br /> I have pleasant memories of The Donna Reed Show. Easy to take, but not too serious.
