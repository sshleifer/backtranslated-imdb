I will honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I have clicked 10 to try to count the 5 pages of unauthorized, unjustified 1-star reviews. It's an interesting story, all the plays are good to very good (even Diaz, who is completely out of her ordinary grinning bimbo role, plays it quite well.) The sets are perfect and cinematography is consistently creepy . This is a fine morality game and there is no reason to declare the origin of the god / supernatural being / stranger / whatever the show is. So I'm glad the movie didn't try. This is really irrelevant to the story, which is relatively long but very compelling and is summarized in the end quite satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> Before deciding, this movie is terrible (or really, anything under a 7.5), read a few of the dozens of 1-star "hate it" reviews that are big with misspellings, lack of punctuation and capital letters, and youth criticism. Maybe the trailer was misleading or something - I didn't see it - but some of these reviewers apparently expected Terminator 4 or Saw 5 (one reviewer really compared this movie to Saw! How totally inappropriate and unrelated!) < <br /> In general, most of these reviews read comments on your tube. According to these critics, this movie is too confusing, but too predictable, not enough action, but there is too much going on, too smart, but too stupid. explains too much, but leaves too much inexplicable ... oh - and that's apparently a "waist of time." Think about the quality and source of the reviews before they take it to heart. I fear that these 1-star children did not understand the phrase "altruism coefficient" and were therefore totally incapable of understanding the performance of the film (despite having "accomplished" before explaining it) how confusing it was!) If you know what these two words mean, you will have no trouble understanding (and enjoying) this movie. I really wish there was an adjudicator reputation system here so I can be sure to ignore the score of everyone who gave it. movie 1 star forever. <br /> <br /> See it for yourself and enjoy the fine presentation of an interesting couple who take an interesting, moral "test" and face the consequences. It's a good time, in my opinion.
