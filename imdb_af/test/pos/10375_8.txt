David Suchet is Agatha Christie's prestigious detective Hercule Poirot in "After the Funeral", produced in 2005. Anyone who has heard David Suchet with his own British accent knows what a shock is because his accent as Poirot is so perfect and organic to the character. Suchet is the Poirot of Agatha Christie's books, and although I confess a love for Peter Ustinov in the role, his depiction does not have much to do with what Christie wrote. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Poirot is asked by a lawyer friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients. On the train, the lawyer drives the events to death - a stranger wants to cut off the expected heir and the man's sister's verdict that he was murdered. When Poirot meets the family, he discovers adultery, many secrets, another will and murder. <br /> <br /> The story is excellent with rich production values ​​and a wonderful, detailed depiction of the era. All the plays are excellent, especially from Monica Dolan, who is me. Gilchrist plays. Poirot is here without Hastings, his beautiful office or Miss. Lemon, but he is effective. <br /> <br /> I had the privilege of seeing David Suchet on Broadway in Amadeus. Breathtaking. What an actor - if he plays Poirot, I just see IS Poirot.
