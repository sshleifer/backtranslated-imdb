Number murder is a good movie. Although the plot is in a snake, the character of Sandra Bullock's character, along with her partner, rolls the movie back to a previous trauma situation she participated in, keeping the viewer in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I think it's a good job to set the ominous kind of "who did it", write atmosphere. It tells you which one of the boys really was behind the murder, if not both of them. I think Ryan Gosling and the other child (lol) are doing a good job selling the bully versus dork relationship. Not sure that Gosling is playing a bad ass, but for a man who would die in a movie like The Notebook later, he did a good job. As soon as the movie started rolling, I really had myself involved in the story, like asking myself, "Oh my God, what would I do if I was in that situation?" As I said, a good CSI-type movie, maybe not for the EXTREME crime drama movie junkie, but a good all around movie. <br /> <br /> 8 outta 10
