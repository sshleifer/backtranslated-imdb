I have to be honest, I really had a good time watching how she was. Despite being a typical teenage comedy or wanting to convert the gender movie, it has a bit of a decent laugh that I think anyone can get. Adults and teenagers will all enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is your typical rebellious teenager who looks and acts like a man, and when she comes down to trying out for the boy's soccer team, she decides to take over her brother's appearance to be worthy of herself to be on the boy's soccer team. Of course, love shows herself when she meets another man who thinks she is her brother. She also has a girl chasing after her. Well, the tagline says it all. <br /> <br /> It's a fun little teenage drama that I think will be remembered for a while. Amanda Bynes has shown something in the film, it's really hard to really act like a man. : D Well, that's true! <br /> <br /> 8/10
