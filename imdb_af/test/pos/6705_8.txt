Something I think some people miss out on great science fiction is that it predicts part of the future. No other movie I can remember has predicted that when the spacecraft Halley's Comet is going to study that a disaster would happen! Some differences were: the "Churchill" (the shuttle in the movie) actually went to the comet, the "Challenger" was just in a low ground. The Churchill had just burned out inside, while the "Challenger" exploded - the vampires had to come back. One big deal (and it's always an accident!) Both had mixed male / female teams - the legend of Halley's comet and disaster continues! <br /> <br /> Other than that, there's not much to say about this movie that hasn't been mentioned before. As an outer space / science fiction / horror / sex movie, it doesn't really give anything new, but like all great dishes, it's the combination that counts. And it was a very original and satisfying combination. <br /> <br /> I just want Mathilda May to drain her victims through another part of the body!
