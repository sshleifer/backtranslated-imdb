Well, this may not be the most sophisticated movie you'll ever see. Actually, there is no "sophistication" in it. This is puerile, adolescent, unsatisfactory, idiotic. And completely hilarious. Basically, Richie and Eddie run the worst hotel in Britain. Call some ridiculous abilities with the guests as they beat each other, try to get the rent from the only resident enough to stay, drink all night with the boys of the power station next door ... And fall with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press. Try it if you are a fan of Rik and Ade and their work. If you're not ... Don't get the movie. Simple as that. <br /> <br /> * I'm not fat, it's another word from Rik's fabulous chase in the movie world ^ _ ^
