I can't stress enough what a lovely movie it is. Just <br /> <br /> the memory of this movie is now renewing me. If you <br /> <br /> <br /> want to see a movie of a movie, with great actors in a spectacular <br /> <br /> landscape, with a great dialogue, reminds you of what early America could have been <br /> <br /> like [what the world could be like back <br /> <br /> then] ... well ... I recommend this movie to. Especially during a <br /> <br /> time of war and conflict in Iraq ... when our American image isn't at <br /> <br />, that's all it was ... this movie take you back to a time when we <br /> <br /> just started. Being an American really means <br /> <br /> picking yourself up and down your bootstraps. When <br /> <br /> the world was so untamed and unfamiliar. Well, this <br /> <br /> movie has it ... and more. Enjoy.
