I must confess that I fell into the cynical trap to believe that Australians could not make drama unless it cried a lot, and I am an Australian. Sad, isn't it? While this film is crying, it is not dramatic cry, its honest emotion shines through. <br /> <br /> This movie is also a madness. I knew what the final outcome would be when I started watching it, so I tried to guess who it was that was going to do it. I missed a mile. <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I got the director. Murali Thulluri was only 21 to make the film. I'd love to shake his hand. He knows how to make a movie. I hope he gets more. <br /> <br /> All the characters we meet before the capital credit (about 12 minutes into) is an anti-hero. Everyone has upset them in their own way and all of them are selfish like the following. Even when they are sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The saddest scene in the movie, and there are some that are hard to watch, is the final scene where we are formally presented to the right main character and we are told of their cousin. That scene made me cry. <br /> <br /> My faith in the Australian drama has been restored. We are masters of comedy, but I got bored with comedy. <br /> <br /> Murali, if you check it carefully, you've touched my soul and I can only thank you for that.
