My favorite movie of all time. It was a defective piece of work by Coppola and saw the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola was at that time the king of Hollywood after making "the Godfather" and "GodfatherII" and developing the ego needed to even make a movie like "Apocalypse Now." Through sheer arrogance, he went to the Philippines in part, thinking he would know what he would do when he arrived. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once, he told Col. Kurtz's connection came. And just like Willard, he doesn't know what to do when he gets there. It's such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. As a result, because of this open-endedness, some viewers who keep their movies more obvious are being harassed. <br /> <br /> This movie is categorized. Some call it a war movie that it is not at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best picture about Vietnam is, in my opinion, 'Platoon' and if a viewer wants a re-announcement of the Vietnam War, first go to answers. <br /> <br /> Coppola should be commended for his action on the War Circuit which he provides reasonably effectively with the encounter with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate Review. The mere audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the daunting attack will always be a Hollywood classic. <br /> <br /> This is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal end that makes it a movie that's not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but also rewarding. I could present my explanations on every scene, but it would be completely useless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification. <br /> <br /> A small footnote, definitely if you are a first-time explorer of the Apocalypse Now look at the original version, the 'Redux' version is, I think, more meant for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a "new and improved" version of the movie
