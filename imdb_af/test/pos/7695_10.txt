I was @ 13 years old when I saw this great underhand movie at The ADAMS Theater in Newark, NJ, I bought the Program, and later bought the soundtrack ... still both .... I'm now 55 + yrs . and didn't see it (maybe once on the network TV, in the 1960s ???) One of the greatest casts ever compiled, good score and production, please leave another generation see this wonderful movie ... This was my introduction to the opera, and helped with my understanding of tolerance. Please family of Gerswhins or Premingers, let this classic out soon!
