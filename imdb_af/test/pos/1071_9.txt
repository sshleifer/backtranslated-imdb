First, I loved the documentary. It represents a new school history / theory where a subject can reflect a wide variety of social and historical issues. <br /> <br /> I'll get the camera and dogs out of the way. I hate the Blair Witch quality of the camera, but also understand the benefit of such a casual approach. In fact, I agree with the other reviewer that it gives us unprecedented access. <br /> <br /> Dogs: Warning, I have a doctorate in literature that I do NOT use as a profession, so some of my training may be in Sip: The dogs are a beautiful metaphor for the complex relationship of man's great efforts and our need to find the labor to achieve it. The dogs can reflect their owners, as one reviewer suggested. But they also serve as a stand-in for the workers we see in the film. Although this may indicate the Marxist problem raised by one reviewer, I think it also shows how difficult it is to globalize labor issues. No Mondovi's in Italy may also translate elsewhere. (Yikes! I am a Marxist of heart and hate to hear my cynical resignation!) This is a remarkable bait and switch. The dogs are family, the workers are family. But in the end the dogs are the workers (the last scene with the poor farmer). While you may not agree with politics, the art of analogy, along with the more open-minded politics of the film, is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Just Faulkner (I'm from Alabama) had the power of film past the Hollywood market, which would have been interesting stories.
