Voetspore is definitely not your average run of Giallo mill, and it's not bad. In contrast to his previous attempt, the fifth chord (which is your 'classic' Giallo), Luigi Bazzoni's film leaves almost all the Giallo brands and instead of murder; The focus is very much on psychological mystery. It goes without saying that it will be a completely bizarre movie, as the film opens with a play on the moon. Things are no longer clear because the moon series is evident from Alice's dream, a troubled woman. Alice is tormented by dreams of an astronaut-stranded moon, apparently coming from a movie called Footprints on the Moon. After several things went wrong for her, Alice decided to go to a mostly deserted former tourist site called Garma. At her arrival she was surprised because the people she met already knew her. Alice also meets a young redhead girl who knows her too; The girl tells Alice she looks exactly like Nicole, except nicer and shorter hair. <br /> <br /> The fact that Footprints does not really stand in the way of sex, murder and other Giallo brands is somewhat suggestive. On the back foot with his primary audience from the beginning as most people going into this movie are not going to get what they expected (or probably wanted). But on the other hand, Footprints commends respect for the fact that it doesn't just follow what has gone before. By 1975, the Giallo began to lose its popularity and many of the films released during this period (with some very notable exceptions) were just an overview of what had come before, so Luigi Bazzoni would have a great chance took on this movie. . Florinda Bolkan gives a strong performance in the lead; and the fact that she is not the most beautiful Giallo heroine is not really important. The mystery builds beautifully throughout, and while it can sometimes be somewhat turgid; Footprints are generally intriguing for the duration. It will probably not come as a surprise to many if they come to the conclusion that the end doesn't make much sense and doesn't really make it clear; but it also adds well to the bizarre cult value of the film, and all in all; I give Footprints a thumb up!
