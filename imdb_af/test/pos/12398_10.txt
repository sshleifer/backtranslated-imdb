I just saw this movie on Showtime in the early hours of the night. I watched the start with an eye open, but instead of sleeping out, I invested in this clever, nail bitter of a movie. It was very credible and engaging. I could have done without much curse (as with every David Mamet movie I see), but thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I know teenagers swear, but I don't have to listen. Anyway, the story has some interesting surprises I won't reveal, but if you have the opportunity to catch this movie on Showtime, I think you'll enjoy it as much as I have.
