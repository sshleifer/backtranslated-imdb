ROMEO AND JULIET have been interpreted in so many ways, but many of the versions have captured the essence of the play. The ony I can think of, haunts the spirit of romance, was WEST-SIDE STORY, and believes it or not, Troma Film's TROMEO AND JULIET. At first glance, this is a mere squatter party, and many will think it ruins the Shakespearian classic. However, the film has an honest feel about it. Updated to naturally appeal to the sickly youth of today, but not without merit. Yes, the regular dismemberments, body piercings, car accidents, lesbian sex scenes, masturbation and incest are in bad taste, but what is the damage when you have such a lovely love story as the foundation? Just as much as most of the plays in this movie are (I mean, that is Troma), the two leaders have a real chemistry, more than the big-budget monstrosities. TITANIC AND STAR WASHING, BEING EPISODE TWO. There is a lot of modernization, but a lot of the original text is in tact, especially when Tromeo and Juliet are together. There is a wonderful scene where Juliet walks the famous, 'Parting is such a sadness,' and tromeo follows in the middle of the nineties grunge fashion. "Yes, it sucks completely." I think it's really a pity that this movie won't get the recognition or the wide release it earns. I hope people who see it on the shelves of the video industry will not be turned off by the brutal in the movie, as they will miss out on a very subversive experience.
