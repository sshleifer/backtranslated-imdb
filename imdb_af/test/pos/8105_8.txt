I caught about 20 minutes of this movie about Turner Classic Movies in 6 months. I thought every minute of what I was watching was gold and because it was somewhere in the middle of the movie and I didn't want to spoil the whole thing if I wanted to see it from the beginning, I decided I would. rent. immediately. Well, the video store I have regularly had not a copy, so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. I saw the experience before, just saw a few Chaplin shorts, funny but not much art, but after seeing the piece of The Great Dictator, I have three of his other films, City Lights, The Gold Rush and Modern Times (City Lights was wonderful, I overestimated the Gold Rush, but still worth it, and I found Modern Times one of the funniest movies I've ever seen (the second funniest behind Keaton's Sherlock Jr., more precisely. /> <br /> Finally, the whole Great Dictator: Well, honestly, it has its moments, both comedy and drama, but these moments don't always mix well. worked when mixed with Melodrama (City Lights is the best example of this), but it has not always worked with social commentary, the fact that there is a dialogue reduces Chaplin's talent and does not misunderstand me Not, I like the movie as a whole, but I do T thought of little consequence. I would have given it a solid 7/10 on the rating scale. . not for the end The final speech given by the Jewish hairdresser is immensely powerful. Yes, it is aimed at the tempora et mores of 1940, but its message is perfectly applicable to the world today. The speech brought me to tears, and I see it as one of the best endings I've ever seen. Final Score: 8/10.
