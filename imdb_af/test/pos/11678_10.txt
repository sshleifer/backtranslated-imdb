THIS REVIEW CAN CONTENTS SPOILERS! The decline of Western civilization ...... what a good title, eh? And from a pretty good movie. This is the best concert movie I've ever seen. A second second is the Talking Heads movie "Stop Making Sense". I first heard of this movie when Waynes World came out in 1992. I looked at the director's name, Penelope Spheeris, and thought cool name, what did he do? I thought the nickname was pronounced like envelope. After a while in movie guides, I got the critically acclaimed Decline and realized Penelope was a woman ... my mom made me fix. I spent 8 years of my life finding it. I finally saw it on VHS in Vancouver, where I currently live. It was worth the wait. This keeps the LA punk movement very good. This is teenage anxiety among the best people. My favorite is the group of the Kims who need lyrics for the lyrics, because Darby Crash sings so crazy, you can't understand it. I laughed when I saw it. The band Black Flag lives in a deserted church and the group X is a very intelligent bunch. Laughing at the letter writing an idiot in Slash Magazine on how not to save the whales, there are many miles to us to throw poisons! I then became a great Penelope Spheeris fan and saw all her punk movies. Dudes were OK, and Suburbia is a cult classic! I own both these on VHS. She is a true underground filmmaker and I love her well. I would have liked this movie to be seen in 1994 when grunge was so popular. I was a big Nirvana fan then, but I saw it in 2002 and at that time I grew out of grunge and now listen to Crystal Method / Fatboy Slim. Quite a change of pace, I know, but what can you do? But if you want a real portrayal of the punk movement, take it better than anything. Much better than 1991: The Year Punk Broke. It's a difficult movie to find, but if you hit your hands on it, rent it, even if you don't like the music, it is a great piece of work. Now days can be easier to find with DVDs so popular. By the way, Penelope produced a well-known Albert Brooks movie called "Real Life" which I also own. Many funny things in today's reality, TV, scandal! Rent decrease ...... highly recommended! Thank you!
