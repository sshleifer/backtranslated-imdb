I am very impressed with the reviews I have read about this movie - usually well-read, thought-through and informed - of course by people who love movies and think. I couldn't add anything to the excellent review work that IMDb members already did. If I want, I would like to rectify a small but widespread misunderstanding found in many reviews: Baseball was American and acted ugly, but he was NOT an Ugly American. The original Ugly American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of the eternal 1958 novel by Burdick and Lederer, and the exact opposite of Mr. Baseball. Homer was an archetypal American and an archetypal engineer. He went to Vietnam to work with people. He used the people he met to use appropriate, sustainable technology in conjunction with his hosts. He was kept exactly and respected. because he showed democratic values ​​and American virtues. She was ugly, pure face, just skin-deep; His personality and humanity were deep and sincere. <br /> <br /> Mr. Baseball illustrates all the scratch, ignorance, unsafe borishness that our Europeans and Americans often allocate to other cultures; Homer Atkins, the Ugly American, was the other side of our coin, which represents our humanity and decency. I believe the Ugly Americans still outnumber Mr Baseballs; they are still our last, best hope.
