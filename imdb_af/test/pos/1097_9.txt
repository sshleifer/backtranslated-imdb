Yes, maybe there are parts of this movie that suspend the suspension a bit, but it doesn't take anything away from the movie's charm and wonder. This was shown as part of our town's youth film festival and was the organizing committee's favorite. It is not surprising. The topic - rallying in a race torn, but post-apartheid South Africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspiring. Of course, as the previous comment mentions, the film does have its shortcomings, but the realism of the environment and the way the director deals with his subject matter hamper these shortcomings. I saw it with my wife and we returned with the children that night. A movie to watch, meditate, discuss and act.
