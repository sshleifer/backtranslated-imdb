I'm not normally a Drama / Feel a good movie kind of man, but when I saw the trailer for "Radio", I couldn't resist. Not only is it a good movie, but it also has a big role to play. Cuba Gooding Jr. had an excellent job depicting James Robert Kennedy, viz. "RAdio." Ed Harris also did a fantastic job as Jones coach. I was pleasantly surprised to see a comedy too. So for a great story, great acting and a little comedy I give 'Radio' a 10 out of 10!
