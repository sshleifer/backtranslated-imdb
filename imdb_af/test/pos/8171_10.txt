I love this movie: the music, the cinematography, the play, the story and all the Mormon cliches. Just because they are clich√©s doesn't mean they aren't true! It's not perfect, it's a movie. Although excommunications are held in well-lit rooms with pretty large tables and chairs, it was perfectly fitting to portray it as the dark cold scene they did in this movie. I also held the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop and smoking a cigarette. I thought it was so cool. I mean, I believe angels are watching over us. What to do while waiting? Smoking is a way some people pass by while waiting. I loved the irony because Mormone made such an agreement on smoking. I saw this movie 7 times in theaters in Salt Lake and screaming every time! It blows me away. And I watched it 3 times now and it still makes me cry every time. I would have the chance to see it again on a big screen. I hope the Salt Lake Tower Theater will return it regularly during the General Conference time, as a cult film (pun intended, but no offense intended).
