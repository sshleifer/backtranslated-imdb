This film is based on the true story of Iowa's housewife, Lucille Fray, who had breast cancer after the birth of her 10th child. Realizing that the state would take away the children from her ineffective alcoholic husband, she devoted herself over the last year of her life to visiting the state to find new homes for each of the children. A great script - still made 20 years after it was first made. The grown-up children, many of whom have not seen each other since their mother died in the late 50's, were reunited on "That's Incredible", before the movie's airing in 1983. Barbara Stanwyck won the Emmy for the best actress in a TV movie or mini-series, but during her acceptance speech she went out of her way to postpone Ann-Margret for her moving performance.
