George Cukor is and will always be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. No one calls Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet watch his filmography. From the sparkling comedies "The Philadelphia Story" "Adam's Rib" "Holiday" Psycho melodramas "Gaslight" "A Double Life" is a great semi-western "Heller in Pink Tights" not to mention "My Fair Lady" or " Travels with my Aunt "He was employed by his actors, he never put him in front of the camera. I feel a certain tenderness to still see a rich and famous flash of the old master. Candice Bergen gives us a look at the wonderful comedian she is going to be for the first time in her career. Jacqueline Bisset is a setback to the days of Greer Garson and Loretta Young and Hart Bochner, who are enchanted and promising to make something spectacular that will eventually come to fruition in 1989 with Meghyan, an apartment zero, since Bergen's daughter already Meg Ryan is. As tired as the formula, it remains a Cukor movie and for which I am collecting one of Almodovar's favorite movies.
