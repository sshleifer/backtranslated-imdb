I saw this masterpiece on VHS 10 years ago, and the powerful interpretation of the painful-painful-against-established society has remained in my heart ever since. Director Hector Babenco is such a good humanity, who finds a delicate angle to tell the story of how urbanism kills the childhood of the poverty class children. Even the extinct children have their innocent, beautiful dreams. But the corrupt reality never gives a chance. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the publishers for the recent DVD edition, I can now keep this great movie at my favorite collection.
