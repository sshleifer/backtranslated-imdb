This is my favorite movie and I think it's perfect. Unlike almost any other movie I can mention, I never look at this movie and think it would have been better if they did it or that or whatever. Is this the definition of a work of art? I think so. Each brush in Mishima is perfect and it all flows out of Schrader's writing. I always liked Paul Schrader's work (you can't argue with Taxi driver and Light Sleeper, it's a wonderful movie), but his writing often appears to be on the bombastic frontier, but his registration style is usually non-existent no. It is deliberate, I think, because his films usually deal with a search for salvation and are set in the real world. ugly and hard. His style suits his themes as he presents his characters in a simple and realistic way, and lets them show the audience the truth of the situation. Imagine whether Schrader directed the driver or the dead instead of Scorsese. But like the main players of the two films, while Mishima was the man of the ideal Schrader material, right-wing, in vain and in conflict with society, his works were subtle and beautiful. In fact, he had a secondary writing job as a woman's writer, looking out on what can reasonably be described as romantic potboilers. So you won't necessarily think that Schrader was the ideal man to capture that subtlety and beauty on film. I think the movie shows he was. The script he helped divide Mishima into man; his life, his death and his mind. His life is represented in black and white, silent camera, formal compositions. His death, for which he will always be best remembered, is handheld documentary style. And his thoughts are represented by the dramatic extracts from his novels. Everyone reveals the thought processes of this complex man, who hardly wrote a character who did not reflect himself. These dramatizations are beautiful to watch, thanks to Eiko Ishioka's remarkable production design and Schrader's imaginative staging. In all respects, the play is excellent, especially from Ken Ogata and Mishima, capturing the essential charm, arrogance and narcissism of the man. Photography is excellent and contains images that the viewer will keep forever. Finally, the music is simply super, perfectly matched to the images, although written and recorded before being shot, adjusted during the editorial process and then recorded again. I don't know how much the music influenced the shot, but it binds perfectly to the image. I have seen many ideas of what different people think is the theme of the film, which Schrader is trying to say. You know, the big things about life, death, etc. But I don't think the movie says anything. Mishima said it already, the film just repeated.
