Brown returned to his role of the previous year (in "Slaughter") for this rough sequel. In the original, he killed his parents' death by wiping out a huge mob organization in Mexico. Here he is the one pursued by a money launderer depicted by McMahon. When the first murder attempt fails, Brown is once again in action and he kicks in all over the place while trying to protect his new friend Hendry. While the original film is generally a better and more cohesive film, this one delivers all the exploitation aspects in much heavier doses, making it more enjoyable for fans of the genre. Aside from a pretty furious opening to horse and a deadly deadly car, a city street drives at night, this movie cuts with a very fast pace. Every few minutes, one or more of the following appear: drug use, sex, nudity, gun, murder or other action. Brown is his usual trustworthy, friendly self, helped by his wonderful physical presence, relieving a long way in the stiffness of his acting. McMahon is a riot! With tinted glasses and his hair cut in the middle (!), He was shown to have made his orders to his gang of boefies. He is heard to make passionate love for his fur clothes. The view of Johnny Carson's sidekick in a role like this is a perverse excitement. Stroud makes an impression as an intense, racist hit, while Peters just adds a glance to a straight-line police detective that alleviates Brown's help. Unfortunately, no mention is made of Brown's original sidekicks Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly, Brown now has a friend (Hendry) who is just enough, but lacks the fullness and personality Stevens had before. Williams does an exorbitant turn as a pimp who can seemingly pick any girl from a bar and make her a member of his harem. The cinematography and overall direction are less polished than the first movie, but one has a ride and a sense of danger that exceeds the original's feel. The film spends a lot of time in the sewage of organized crime, drugs, prostitution and other vices, but it maintains interest in the creativity of its action scenes and the striking lack of political correctness. One odd note: A key support player in the first movie was shown to be shot dead, but appeared in a different role here.
