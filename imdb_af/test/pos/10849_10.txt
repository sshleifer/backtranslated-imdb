When I rented this movie, I half expected it to be a low budget, but less Indy movie, but I thought I'd try it. I started looking at part 1 and couldn't move me off until it ended 3 hours later. It was by far one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. From writing to directing to the performances, I laughed, cried and sang through Nan Astley's ritual of transition from innocence to adulthood. Rachael Stirling is phenomenal in this movie. I have never heard of her, but now I will always remember the vulnerability and power I felt in her performance. She, Keeley Hawes and Jodhi May are incredible because they guide you through the emotional turmoil that feels the most when dealing with an alternative form of sexuality. The introduction of the film in the 1890s not only nourishes the audience on homosexuality during that period, but today makes a statement about our society. You should see this movie and probably like me, you will make a trip to the store to add it to your collection.
