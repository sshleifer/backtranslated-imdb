It took a couple of years despite the late hour it was. <br /> <br /> Like many of the 80 crime dramas, it looked cold. Both physically and figuratively. However, this is not a bad thing. And the (of course) low budget actually works in his favor. Eager at a time when 'smooth' was. <br /> <br /> Allan Royal's wraparound segments as the news writer gave it a slight edge. <br /> <br /> The only actors I remembered were Scott Nylands (Earthquake) and Tony Rosato (SCTV). The scrapping of rare celebrities was a good thing because you could see the group as a whole and not as a lot of people who support a 'star'. And yes, it's a young Clark Johnson (murder) in a recurring place. <br /> <br /> I hope a DVD edition will be in the future. Someone out there wants to get it?
