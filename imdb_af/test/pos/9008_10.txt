It has helped the characters on which this display is based, to be among Disney's best ever. The writing is what really makes this show. It's a total classic. Given, you should appreciate the kind of humor to enjoy it, and it's hard to explain. The humor is related to the old school scenes of the 40's and 50's Disney, with modern spins. It never falls into jokes or anything of that sort. It's also not worth it with sandler humor, though I enjoyed it. This is exactly the same humor of the movie, just extended for the length of time a TV program allows. So if you don't like it in the movie, you won't like it here, but IMO. The emperor's new groove was the best thing to come from Disney, as Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> A +
