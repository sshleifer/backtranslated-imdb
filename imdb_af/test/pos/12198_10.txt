Surface is one of the largest, e.g. series I saw. The acting is wonderful and the storyline staggering. Every episode barely allowed me to wait to watch the next. I especially thought Carter Jenkins did Miles Bennett's great work. He is a very talented actor and I look forward to seeing more of his work. <br /> <br /> I can't believe Surface just made one season ... again the public dropped me. It's hard to understand that a great show like this one will be canceled, while the crap reality shows continue year after year. Anyone who made the decision to cancel this show really dropped the ball on this one.
