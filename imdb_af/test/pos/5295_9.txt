It has been widely agreed that Hayao Miyazaki is a master at his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful story lines and similar imaginative characters. His films, from NAUSICAA, TOTORO, KIKI, LAPUTA, and MONONOKE to the recent HOWL's Moving Castle, are not only donated to the arts but also to the film. Can't this man do wrong? Not really, but it's impossible to expect that all of his movies will always be five-star wonders. His latest film, PONYO, an unashamed family-friendly story of a "goldfish out of water" is so lazy animated and alive with interesting characters as you would expect. And yet it's the first film of its in "less" area. Don't get me wrong, PONYO is not a bad movie at all. As mentioned, it is an eye for the eyes and is as charming and worship as TOTORO and KIKI. The problem is that the story is not left to anyone keen for another intrusive, in-depth plot. <br /> <br /> For his opening hours, PONYO is the storytelling of Miyazaki at its best, in which a rough and victorious young goldfish (later called Ponyo) makes a forbidden trip to the human world where she is later adopted by a son of her own age, called Sosuke (modeled, interesting to the director's own son). It is not Ponyo's father, a mysterious wizard named Fujimoto, who is very angry with man for the destruction of the sea. (This environmental issue doesn't differ much from Miyazaki's other films). A problem he really wants to rectify by manufacturing jellyfish from the prospect of his submarine. He separates the couple and tries to talk to Ponyo to stay with him underwater. The goldfish, however, both tasted Sosuke's blood (a cut on his finger healthy) AND some of the human food (ham, which she becomes inexplicably addicted to), and of course stealing in her father's forbidden drink, turned into a hyperactive young girl (who is the spitting image of May of MY Near TOTORO). This leads to a dangerous tsunami that threatens to engulf the whole world with water. Conspiring with his wife, Mr. Gran Mamare, a creeping sea goddess who alternately moves from bulk titanium to human size, decides to test Fujimoto's love for each other. They do this by raising the sea to the level of Sosuke's house, after which the youngsters protrude over their now-ocean-infected world in an excess toy boat (possibly made by Ponyo's own magical powers). <br /> <br /> It is at this point where PONYO starts running from steam. Although Ponyo and Sosuke are rich and the screens they are about are funny and cute, they slow down the movie. Where the movie really takes water, it is unfortunate at the height of Sosuke to prove his love for Ponyo, in a way that is funny and hilarious. It brings a sudden, spectacular story. It will probably expect underworld viewers to find another fast-paced man that has delivered much more interesting finals to many of its other films. Remember the destruction of Laputa? Satsuki's quest for little May? Kiki's rescue from Tombo? Porco Rosso's fight with Curtis? The rescue of the Bosgees' head? Or even the test between Chihiro and Yubaba? All the decisions were much more satisfying and more complete than this. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, PONYO cannot be found guilty. The animation is absolutely beautiful to look at, produced entirely without a single shot of computer-generated footage, and of course Joe Hisaishi gives us another breathtaking musical score; The best moments are the suppressive rows underwater, accompanied by a choir and a soprano voice. And the backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed than any other Ghibli movie. <br /> <br /> Having proved themselves worthy to translate Ghibli's previous movies into English, with top quality results, Disney Studios and Pixar are once again completing English dub with a mostly capable role player. Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good like Sosuke, which sounds very natural and credible. Noah Cyrus as Ponyo, on the other hand, sometimes goes overboard to shout her lines before finally settling down. The leading role of film, Liam Neeson, is the overprotective Fujimoto (who is surprisingly good at driving character), Cate Blanchett as Gran Mamare (in a ubiquitous scene that doesn't differ much from her Galadriel in Lord of the rings) , Matt Damon as Sosuke's constantly seafaring father Koichi (who is good, but nothing to write home), and Tina Fey as Lisa. Of them, Fey is the best voice in the whole cast, the character with just the right amount of spirit and personality. Her plays with Sosuke show true chemistry. On the other hand, Cloris Leachman, who was spectacular as Dola in CASTLE IN THE SKY, was disappointedly wasted as one of three disabled elderly (she barely has any lines!), Also spoken by Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Some of them, just Tomlin's character, a cantanker woman named Toki, show any real personality, but if I cast the movie, I want to switch Tomlin to Leachman. Probably the only really downside of the dub is a blatant techno remix of the movie's catchy (but ridiculously repetitive) title song that unfortunately does not appear halfway through the closing credits. <br /> <br /> On the PONYO is a good movie; a fine piece of animated work that is ideal for young people and family audiences. However, due to the loss of momentum towards the end, it falls short of classic status. As Miyazaki is at least even better than a majority of other animated films, I would be delighted to give PONYO a complete star rating, as any feature of her is still worth watching, especially on the big screen. (Be sure to catch it in the theaters while you can.)
