Written by science fiction veterans Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. This space fantasy is fittingly directed by Robert Parrish. Experienced American astronaut Colonel Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) agrees with a manned flight to the other side of the sun. The mission is to be controlled by Jason Webb (Patrick Wymark) and his scientist John Cane (Ian Hendry), Euro Sec Space Agency, will accompany Ross. The two will explore a newly discovered planet that is in the same identical orbit to Earth ... except that it is always hidden on the other side of the sun. Ross is the only one to make it back to earth and has a very amazing story to tell. Special effects can be better than the story line. Still, it's fun to watch. The film also includes: Lynn Loring, Loni von Friedl, George Sewell and Herbert Lom.
