cool flick. nice to watch. hope to see more of Fred Carpenter soon. I really like the location setting with all the New York references. It was interesting how it eventually unfolded. the suspension factor was effective and the acting, though kept simple, was also effective in portraying the characters. There are a lot of neat little tricks recorded in this movie that make everything better. I think the supporting actress played a good role in her role. the casting and directing in this movie seem to be seamless sewing and the quality of the shooting is very impressive. The film is not without its soft moments, which gives it a good balance.
