I went to see this movie because Joaquim de Almeida was in it. Joaquim had a fairly small portion, so it was good that I kept the film on its own. In fact, I really enjoyed it! <br /> <br /> The film centers on two characters, Albert and Louie. Albert is a shy, retired kind, and Louie. Well Louie is not. The story revolves around Louie's request to Albert to allow him a short while to Albert's place. Louie has just gone out of jail. Albert and Louie have known each other since childhood, and of course when they do something together, there is trouble and it is Albert who always falls. <br /> <br /> The action of the movie is based on the adventures of Louie's visit. On The Run is a chronicle of crazy-cap, zany, situations. However, Bruno de Almeida and author, Joseph Minion (After Hours) do not always take you where you expect to go. There are twists and turns that add depth to this film. Of course there is a lot of adult comedy, but there is also very subtle humor here. <br /> <br /> There are also some great achievements here. Albert is played wonderfully by Michael Imperioli. He becomes fairly well-known for the HBO series, The Sopranos. <br /> <br /> Louie is played by John Ventimiglia, who embraces his character with a lovely, child-like quality. (No matter what he does, just love Louie!). <br /> <br /> Both of these actors are excellent in their individual characters. With Imperioli, you want to embrace him and bring him home. Ventimiglia, well, you won't know if you have to hit him or bring him home (and not for mom!). <P> <br /> There are also other excursions. The character of Rita is played by Drena DeNiro (yes, Robert's daughter). The audience loved her. Talking to the others who watched the movie, it was fun to discuss whether it was Albert or Louie who was their favorite of the two. But everyone loves Rita! <br /> <br /> Is this movie perfect? No, I can't say it is. There were many times I wanted the director to have a bigger budget to work with. There were a few scenes that called for more budget freedom. (Give this man a decent budget to work with, and I believe you will see a movie that will make you stand up and notice.) <br /> <br /> The end series was a bit of a victim of the budget. Yet, budget or no budget, in my opinion, the screen shot brought together the talent of actor and director in an unforgettable, emotionally effective scene. <br /> <br />
