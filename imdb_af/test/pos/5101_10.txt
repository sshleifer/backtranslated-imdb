I wish I was only exposed here in a kiosk when it was first released, as some of the commentators were. It's really a treasure. To be fair, I don't have another version of goodbye, Mr. Chips not seen and do not want to. For me it is a perfect version. I only saw it on TCM years ago and never forgot it. I had the pleasure of watching it with my girlfriend yesterday, although I previously recorded it from TCM. There were parts of the movie we were both teary-eyed, it's really a moving movie. <br /> <br /> And shouldn't it be what movies are about? <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful, the movie has been beautifully shot. In addition, the acting is. And the story is delicate and timeless. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite movies of all time.
