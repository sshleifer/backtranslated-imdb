This movie is a sleeper - I watched every miniseries ever on TV, some times, and this one is the best. Wonderfully thrown, beautifully performed, and the characters are well developed. Helen Morse fits perfectly with the part of Jean Paget - strong, in control, sharp and a little more intricate. She jumps off well with Joe Harmon, the cowboy / taciturn / "It'll be fine," kind of old. I was sorry that the movie didn't keep up with the book because there was no romantic interest between Noel Struan and Jean Paget. For those who do not know, it is being chased by the Japanese from a true story of English women by the Japanese for 3 years, which did not know what to do with them. Very little survived. Neville Shute spoke to one of them, and that's her story. This movie deserves to be in everyone's collection who loves the WWII stories.
