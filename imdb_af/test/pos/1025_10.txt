There is a huge danger if you watch a movie that has had such a great influence on you for the first time, that 20 years later, it won't hold the same magic as it did before. I have to admit I didn't expect it to be as good as I remembered but was a pleasant surprise. P'tang Yang Kipperbang is as fantastic as I remember when I was 12 years old. This movie has a certain kind of shine that doesn't own many movies. It's annoying, it's briliant and the best of all that makes me feel like a child, and there aren't many things that can do it. John Albasiny and Abigail Cruttenden's roles in this movie are 1st class and I have forgotten how good they have been so far. I encourage a teenager's parent to sit and watch them and see if it has the same effect on them as it did on me. P'TANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH! 10 out of 10.
