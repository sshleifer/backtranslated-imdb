I avoided this movie as a boy because I thought it would be boring. No fights or shootings, policemen, robbers, cowboys or Indians. It was definitely not a cool movie to keep. So I didn't see the TRC until I was in my twenties and found it one of the most beautiful, engaging movies I saw. All the actors perfectly deliver the characteristics and every emotion is drawn from the viewing scene on the scene. The filming and direction is deceptively simple, but feels so natural and pulls me completely into the story. My two favorite scenes are Bobbie's birthday party and the scene on the station platform near the end, directed and edited to perfection. The quality and phrasing of Jenny Agutter's voice when she calls: "Dad! My dad! ' wrench viewer emotion. Tears are good in my eyes as I think of them. <br /> <br /> This adaptation is not just a movie, it is a piece of precious art, as well as the perfect example of what all filmmakers should be. strives to achieve the creation of an emotional experience.
