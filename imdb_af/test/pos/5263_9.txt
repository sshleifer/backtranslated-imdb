Most of the comments so far have nailed this one right on the head. Viewers under "a certain age" and with three-digit IQs should avoid "Lives of a lifetime", such as a George W Bush nominee facing a congress grilling. <br /> <br /> The cast is composed mainly of veterans who know their way to a well-written writing. Is the starting point wild? No, but the movie comes out like a midnight lighthouse in the current and non-finite movie / TV movie aimed at the most desired audience demographics of teenagers and young people. <br /> <br /> In addition to Betty White and Leslie Neilsen in the prospect, the film also features reputable veterans such as Elaine Stritch and William Windom. The sharp dialogue is made effortlessly and effectively through these benefits. <br /> <br /> "Longevity" is certainly not a movie for the Will Ferrell / Adam Sandler / "Saw" slasher gore-fests, "American Eye Doves," and ninety percent of the rest of the sludge being slipped through Hollywood and TV.
