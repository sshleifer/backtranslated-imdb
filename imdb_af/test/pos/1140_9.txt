It is the type of film that may be needed several times to capture all its beauty and intelligence (such as Curse or Frankenstein from 1957). If you don't like strange, non-mainstream movies, stay away from this masterpiece. For me, the artwork alone in this movie is worth the purchase price of the video cassette. The storyline is a bit fantastic, but it seems to be a reality in our world today. To be produced in the 1980s, this film is a prophetic vision of what comes with Big Government and Big Brother, which we want to control and monitor. <br /> <br /> There are many slow sections and the dialogue can be very difficult to capture in many scenes (that's why I watched it six times now), but if you can digest it all, it may be time. <br /> <br /> The movie is basically a world where people have evolved into robotic machines that have lost their individualism. They are only concerned about the accumulation and reproduction. The hero of the movie did not succumb to this disease and was not monitored by a big brother. His mission is to release a secret drug into the water supply that changes the way human robots think, change and allow individuals to become part of humanity again. <br /> <br /> Yes, its very low budget but for its time computer effects and sound effects are very unique and the paintings are quite fascinating. If you have an open mind, this movie must be impressed and its prophetic visions are chilled.
