I gave this movie a 10 out of my sick obsession with Ingrid Bergman :) lol. I really think she was the best actress to satisfy this earth with her talent and all her movies are absolutely wonderful (even if they are terrible) because she is in them. If it wasn't her and Vivien Leigh (as it was originally won, I heard), I'd give it a 9.0. Just because I'm from Viv, but probably not as much as I like Ingrid. And any other actress might have made it a 6. It's a good story, two wild people fall in love with a society where it's bad to be bad. Remind me a little GWTW except with a more high attitude. Gary Cooper is, as usual, very attractive and of course his voice never changes the whole movie, but hey, Ingrid, makes him look so great and look 20 times hotter than he probably should.
