I am from Phoenix city and the first time I saw this movie and read the book, I just confirmed the stories I have heard from my life. I asked my grandfather about the crowd and he told me that when he came back to fight in the Pacific Theater, he started a CPA firm that is the largest in the Columbus area. when he just started he was asked by the crowd to do financial work for them, but he said he softly refused. Even when the FBI and the army came through the city of Phoenix and cleaned it, it would not take my grandfather lightly if my mother, aunt or uncle had gone over the river, but I assure you all that is over. The city's city center of Phoenix has a need for recovery and it has slums at the court building where all the shooting still takes place over evil, uneducated, low socio-economic people and the 14th street Phoenix eagle bridge is closed. for a fixed 15 years and replaced by a new 13th street bridge but on the fairer side of Phoenix City on Summerville RD. It is very beautiful and the landscape is depressed. <br /> <br /> Another incident was told to me by my best friend's family of high school living in a niche point on Hwy 165, the Holy Trinity, Alabama, about 28. minutes outside Columbus, Ga. My best friend in high school's uncle was a man who went under the name Old Man Davis. No matter how the movie goes, the fact is that there were 3 bosses and Old Man Davis was one of them ... you can even read about him in the original book. Legend has said he was so cold-blooded that he went to downtown Phoenix to make a deal with a man, but the man apparently corrected the deal before Old Man Davis, so the Old Man Davis continued to take a sawn shotgun out of his dress and shot the man in the chest in the middle of the village through the court building. they say he even ran unashamedly because the gang paid off all the law enforcement officers in town, so he had nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> Another incident is about a bridge where another of my friends owns a lease. house next to downtown Phoenix city. It's the same bridge that the crowd killed and threw out a black man, and you can even read that part of the book. I would also like to ask in many Columbus and the city of Phoenix to be extras in the movie. When the Patterson's friend is murdered and judged and found guilty but still free, well, the judge is my father's partner in his Columbus law firm, which unfortunately died.
