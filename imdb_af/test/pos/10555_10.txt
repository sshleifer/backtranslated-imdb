I think it's a big and very funny movie. The story is so funny. The daughter Nicole brings her father Andre, in some very embarrassing. In an effort to impress the son of her dreams, the daughter states that her father is her lover. You just have to see !! Heigl is beautiful like Nicole, maybe too beautiful; I'm not sure why she should lie to hook someone up? Gerard Depardieu Acts very well in this comedy film, he is so nice to watch. If you want comedy and romantic movie, just watch it! I think you can see this movie many times, and you'll have a good laugh. <br /> <br /> In an effort to impress the son of her dreams, the girl says her father is her lover.
