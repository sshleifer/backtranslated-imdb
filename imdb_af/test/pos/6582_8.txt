Imagine the most depressing winter you will never experience: gray instead of white, no snowflakes and certainly no wonderland. This is the Finland depicted by 'Frozen Land'. This movie follows a lot of people whose lives are strangely linked to results above anyone's nightmares. Yes, most characters are flawed in the way that only celluloid characters can - quite annoying and frustrating to look at, but for some reason you wish to turn their luck. <br /> <br /> With some random humor and a role play that brings Finland's somewhat mainstream levels together, Frozen Land offers a glimpse of the Finnish mentality which, despite its downward spirals, succeeds in achieving a degree of faith. in humanity. More than Kaurism√§ki, to say the least.
