What a great movie !! It is a touch of four high school friends who grew up in the 1960s. During the decade, the friends were somewhat divorced, but sometimes they had to see occasionally. There are many tragedies, but there are also many happy moments that make you laugh and smile. It is a sad story of life, love and friendship. Definitely a must for drama supporters.
