And a perfect movie to watch during the holiday season as the winter / sphere Burton creates for Gotham City is very cool. It's strange that Warner decided to release it as a summer movie. It doesn't fit. <br /> <br /> But what's even more important if you consider the content of this movie, it's aimed at families. A higher class family throws their mutant baby in the sewer, a socio-phobic billionaire dress in leather as a pilot, a lone secretary dress in leather as a cat and a freak run for political office. And S&M and slavery are presented in a very distorted way. But Burton got away with it. His visual style in this movie is at its best. <br /> <br /> These and Batman: Dead End are the only true action incarnations of the cartoon character. The animated series was closest to the source material, but compared to Batman Forever and the untamed one, Batman Returns is the best of the four. <br /> <br /> Darker and more violent than the first movie, the feeling of Gothic pathos reaches a new high. I was very keen on Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne (don't start me at George Clooney first!), He showed the right balance of weirdo loner and cool crime fighter. Michelle Pfieffer is wonderful like Catwoman (much more sexy and more 'realistic' cat-like), she's wearing the leather outfit better than Halle Berry. And Danny DeVito was so convincing as the Penguin that his scenes became disturbing to watch. And Christopher Walken is brilliant as the haunting Max Shreck (if you think you recognize Chip Shrek it's nothing but a very young Leatherface / Butterfinger). <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman's score is also better than it was for the first time. round. Its powerful and engaging themes are much better than the foam that followed in the later 2 Schumacher movies. This movie is the Batman phenomenon at his Zenith. Forget the following sequels and then follow the animated series. Let's hope Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale will give integrity to the live action next year, Batman. <br /> <br /> This DVD was one of the first ever DVDs released by Warner (almost 7 years ago! !!) and as a result there are no features and the case is a snapper. Pack it cheaply like me and hope for a SE in the future.
