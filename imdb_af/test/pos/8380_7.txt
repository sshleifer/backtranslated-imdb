Operation Scorpio (AKAThe Scorpion King) does not last until the last 25 minutes, but when the action hits top speed, it delivers some wonderful martial arts scenes that require the viewer's attention. It is not to say that the first hour is worthless? Just compared to the final battle party, it looks a little bit subversive. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Yuk-Su, a talented comic artist who dreams of being a hero, like those he portrays. his drawings. When Yuk-Su saves a young girl, Siu-Yu, who is sold into prostitution, becomes the wrath of her evil boss, Wa. Under the direction of Sonny, master of scorpion style kung fu, Wa's henchmen give to Yuk-Su and the maid. Yuk-Su's dad interferes, but he's injured. After being saved by some friendly bodybuilders, the three eventually hide at a noodle restaurant owned by their friend, Master Yat. <br /> <br /> Yuk-Su learns to cook noodles, but also cut out regularly to Secretly build his power and teach kung fu under the supervision of Jean, the teacher of the muscle bands they saved. When Master Yat has to leave, Yuk-Su is in charge of the kitchen; However, he is practicing his skills with Jean, leaving Siu-Yu to serve the clients. Sonny and his men visit the restaurant and, disgusted by the noodles they serve, the restaurant must be dirty. <br /> <br /> When Master Yat learns that Yuk-Su came out, he tells him to be taught Kung Fu from him; Master Yat seems to have been a triad assassin before deciding to change his ways. Under the leadership of Master Yat, Yuk-Su improves his skills, even to learn the art of shading! Yuk-Su eventually gets a chance to become a real hero when his friend, Fatty, announces that his daughter has also been sold into prostitution. With Jean, they visit Wa as French brothel watchers looking for new women. When Fatty's little girl is presented to them, she accidentally hits their rage and eventually the action starts great style. Despite his best efforts, Jean is beaten by Sonny and he and Yuk-Su are forced to flee. Upon returning to the restaurant, Yuk-Su finds it on fire; And worst of all, the bad guys found Siu-Yu! Yuk Su, accompanied by Master Yat, returns to Wa's place to save Siu-Yu ... <br /> <br /> Despite some entertaining exercise scenes, the slow build up to the final action at Wa 's house rather drawn and without any serious fight scenes. It is a pity that the tide has not been broken up by a decent screwdriver, rather than saving all the juicy things to the end. <br /> <br /> The last battle is, however, waiting in the finals; Won Jin gives a jaw that lowers performance as the high kicker Sonny who spins with great skill and skill, and Chin Kar-Lok gives a solid performance as the artist fighter Yuk-Su. Especially good is former school kung fu star Lau Kar-Leung (AKA Liu Chia Liang) as Master Yat, proving that this old timer still has what it takes to kick ass! Although it's not a perfect movie, Operational Scorpio has enough stance in its final to surely guarantee a viewing. <br /> <br /> NB. Maybe I got the names wrong. My DVD names characters with different names than those listed on IMDb.
