"Hari om" is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the movie of the same name (played by the wedding planner of Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of South India. There is no "Bend it like Beckham" backgrounds and stereotypes, and only small salutes for the music and dance of Bollywood (the soundtrack is well worth the effort), but rather the feeling that you see the real India the film penetrating through the use of dozens of locals in every scene to enhance the performance of the five professional actors. Fortunately for us, Hari Om's companion is a young and beautiful French woman looking for a trip. With the transfer of a Y Tu Mama Tambien journey to self-discovery (without the sex and deadly disease), this beautiful film calms the philosophical mind. Against the initial composition of the protagonists, everyone with characteristics of both identifies and the cultural divide disappears as human steps. At the heart of the film's central theme, "Everyone has a love story, don't let yours pass" teaches us a great deal of love on a number of levels. Don't let this movie pass you by!
