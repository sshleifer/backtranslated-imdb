A refreshing interview with the legendary Italian film-producer director who died in 1999, with about 200 features as director. Much is being spent on D'Amato's soft video sex films, including his notorious EMANUAL entries with Laura Gemser. They also cover his porn career briefly, which kept him in the air for his last decade or so. More interesting to me is the section that focuses on its horror and action efforts. D'Amato has many good anecdotes about actors and his low budget film-making, including a story about an assistant accidentally collecting real bones in his neck while shooting in a 2000-year-old catacomb. Other interviews include George Eastman and Al Cliver. I would have liked a little more talk about his Stateside Filmirage productions (not a single question about TROLL 2; it wasn't the cult movie when it was now).
