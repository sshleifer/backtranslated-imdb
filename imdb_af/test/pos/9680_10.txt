Being Russian, sometimes it's hard for me to get the referrals jokes about American TV personalities or celebrities. In addition, Family Guy is the smartest, funniest and most politically wrong show on earth. The voice maker is excellent and sounds clear, even for a non-English speaker like me to understand. Animations are also good, maybe even good for a TV show. Here we have the equivalent of the Adult Swim Channel, but nothing compares to this jewel. Not even Simpsons or South Park. Hope the creators will continue to entertain and entertain us. Don't want to do the whole thing for mediocre entertainment.
