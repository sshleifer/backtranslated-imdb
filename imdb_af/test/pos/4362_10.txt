Little Dieter Need to Fly was my first film during the 1999 edition of the GÃ¶teborg Film Festival. As I was extremely tired that night, I was hesitant to see it, but the brilliant overall score of 9 here at IMDB let me go. <br /> <br /> It was 80 minutes of pure life force! The experience of Dieter Dengler's life through his own story was magical. <br /> <br /> SEE THIS! And if possible, see it at a theater!
