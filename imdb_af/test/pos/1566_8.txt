Six out of seven people who have taken the time to comment on this movie have many positive responses. The one negative review happens to stay on the first page of the movie's location in the IMDb. <br /> <br /> I found that "What Alice Found" to be one of the best movies has hardly ever heard of what I've seen this year. It's 6.4 grading is misleading and can be more of a difficult topic than the quality of the movie. Who would think that a movie alleged to be about truck stop prostitution would be worth seeing? Guess again. <br /> <br /> For me, "Alice" was a positive psychological tension. I was almost on the edge of my seat all the time. It is a very believable story with a realistic writing and is very well thrown. In a fair world, actress Judith Ivey will win prizes to guess whether she was good or evil. <br /> <br /> Ignore the rating and see this awesome movie. (And by the way, I wish there was a soundtrack album.)
