While it may seem a bit strange to watch a 32-year-old play, part of a 12-year-old, Mary Pickford, makes you forget about the irregularities and enjoys fun. <br /> <br /> Mary is a street child in New York City, with her own lovely gang of spookers, whose attention is brought to the attention of older William Haines (he was 25 at the moment and just on the screen of his Own screen area.) <br /> <br /> Too much of the plot would not be fair. Satisfy that Mary is very nice to watch and see how she was Hollywood's first and beloved superstar. Production values ​​are very good, with many extras making the NYC street scenes reasonably credible.
