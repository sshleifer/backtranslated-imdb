Since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I've lived here all my life), I waited for this movie to come out. And I mean, waited and waited and waited over one and a half for this movie and it was worth it to me. <br /> <br /> The movie differs from the book, but in my eyes it is still a beautiful piece of work like the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me. I laughed and I just laughed. It's a great movie with a good story line. <br /> <br /> It's about never giving up to find that one, the one that will change you forever. The one who will shape your soul and awaken you to a whole new view of life. <br /> <br /> I must say that it is possible to meet someone and change them forever, which is the character of Gere's done to Lane's. I met the love of my life and was instantly amazed that I never forgot him or how struck I was with him before I met him a year later. For me, with my whole heart I could relate to this movie. I think if you listen and watch the movie with your heart and your hope, you'll see what I'm talking about. It's never too late to find your true love, good work, Mrs Lane and Mr Gere!
