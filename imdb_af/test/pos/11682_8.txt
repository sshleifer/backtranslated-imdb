First, start by saying that I have been a punk fan for most of my life. I always had a lack of respect for the LA scene of the early 80's, which is The Decline of Western Civilization documents, with the exception of X and Black Flag, more of New York and English punkman. After I saw this movie that changed completely. The people shown can look like a lot of idiot, outspoken kids who think they can achieve something different from Street Cree through their lifestyle, but this is an excellent performance of hedonism at its best, along with some fun, hard rock n roll. One of the best scenes, and actually the most informative, is the interview with Claude Bessy of Catholic Discipline, or "Kick-Boy" as he was known for Slash magazine readers. He originally criticized France for punk as a dirty old Frenchman and clues for many aspects of the punk, or DIY, attitude towards music, politics and life in general. Darby Crash of the Germs comes off most of the time as a complete idiot, but Manimal's German performance is pretty decent, complete with a young Pat Smear. Black Flag's performance with Chavo Pederast on choir (which was filmed a few years before Henry Rollins joined the band) is decent, and X and FEAR give the best performances in the movie. Watch out for interviews with young punk kids. You'll hear some of the funniest things you've ever heard in a documentary. Highly recommended.
