First of all, nothing will ever compare to the original movie, but for the sake of it they try not. It's just one person's opinion on what could have happened after Rhett left Scarlett at Tara. I think it was a great movie and I want to add it to my GWTW collection. The view alone would make me want to watch the movie. Just look at this movie as an extension of the original and don't think they are trying to replace Vivian Leigh and Clark Cable and you'll enjoy it. They really captured Scarlett's sly selfishness in many of the scenes and you can see from the longing in Rhett's appearance that he is still in love with Scarlett. The fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the movie is another plus, although some of them are only seen on TV. I always wanted them to have other kids after Bonnie Blue died in the movie and it met my need perfectly. <br /> <br /> Lore60
