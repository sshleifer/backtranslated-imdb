Good raw sethrp-1, you missed the point completely. The girl was only briefly seen, because she was the one who would kill herself. Everyone was so wrapped up in their own stories that they didn't notice her, and neither. As one of the other students says in the end, we are all so complicated in our own problems, we don't see what happens to anyone else. <br /> <br /> The director himself said if he killed one of the others, it would have suggested their problems were worse than anyone else. The whole point to killing Kelly was that she was unnoticed by us all. Get it now ??
