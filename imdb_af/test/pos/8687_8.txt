This is one of my favorite movies for many reasons. To start, there are striking performances by beautiful Debra Paget as princess / dancing girl, by Michael Rennie as the villain, attractive young Jeffrey Hunter to investigate crime in her city / state and others. The movie is an unusual colorful adventure, and we even see the princess repeating the dance she later performs (once). She manages to shave hunter before she learns that he is on her side; Photography, the costumes of Travilla, Lionel Newman's music and the film's style are also extremely good. Add to this exciting action, intelligent characterization and fine direction by veteran Harmon Jones from a script by Gerald Drayson Adams in 1249 AD, and you have the ingredients of a pleasant Grecianized Near-Eastern. But there is much to praise about the unusual and well-developed storyline here, as there is much more to praise than the quick pace of the movie, well-managed physical action sequences and outstanding technical aspects. Classic-trained actors such as Michael Ansara, Edgar Barrier, Wally Cassell, Jack Elam and Dona Drake are not commonly found together in one "B" movie; There are also no fascinating sets, a variety of venues and a secret of the quality provided here. One way to assess a movie is: "If I were guaranteed to live through the experience, would I choose to go through these events and perform these actions?" Since my answer in this case is a resounding "yes", this film remains one of my choices as a favorite and much understated film work. Could it be that American critics are too often contempt for women as warriors and thinkers, as in so many other cases have caused closed-minded condemnation to condemn this treasured film's obvious anti-tyranny and pro-entertainment traits?
