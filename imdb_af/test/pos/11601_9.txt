It is very difficult to portray a Tagore novel along cinematographic lines. And if you forget a dark production of 1967, this is the first time that Chokher Bali has been extensively done. Generally speaking, the sets look fantastic with the right touches to make a successful drama. Prasenjit, so used to doing crass commercial goods, made a good effort. I saw the Bengal version and found that Aishwariya's voice was called, which made her dialogue somewhat poor. While the director had a good job portraying each of the characters with finesse, there was very little in the sense of meaningful plot, probably a lack of the story itself. However, the development of the characters, including those with less important roles, seems to be the strongest point. It is difficult to make some Tagore stories in movies, as only the visual parts seem to be realized.
