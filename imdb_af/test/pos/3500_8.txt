By convincing the prime minister to return the totally inappropriate Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, the nasty chancellor, David Carlton (Charles Dance), hopes to discredit his party's current leader, by which he can seize power . To his surprise, however, the plan comes back, Ali is embraced by the nation and Carlton has to find other ways to secure his political future. <br /> <br /> Puerile, rugged, misogynistic and always shameful: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle class Berkshire gangsta, is all these things and more ?? what does it mean is my kind of movie !! Clearly, there are those who just won't get the joke, and there will definitely be people who find exciting jokes about oral sex, homosexuality, recreational drug use, hardcore pornography and the Queen's northern regions offensive (unnecessary to say goodbye away!), but if you find such youthful humor in a spectacular way, it's a fan of Baron Cohen in general, or you just want to see Hottie Rhona Mitra in her underwear (and you're shaking, she is fit!), then I fully recommend spending an hour and a half in the company of Ali G and the West S keep Massief. <br /> <br /> They're worse!
