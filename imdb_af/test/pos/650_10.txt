A wonderful movie before his time, <br /> <br /> I think so. In the eighties it was all to win, greed is good? Remember that one? I've seen this movie more than 20 times. For me, this is a real island island movie, I keep looking, as there is always something more to learn about these faulty characters I just love, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin are just wonderful. Beverly D'angelo, Beau Bridges, is also coming soon. I'm not mistaken. There are many more good performances in this movie, and this is also the way it is written that made it for me and I hope you, a movie you want to see over and over, I think TV shows like "Northen Exposure, and now "Earl" owes much to this movie. but remember it's not a Tom Cruise movie.
