Brilliant thriller, much more celebrity merit, Mitchum and Ryan are great in their lead roles as well as the whole supporting role. A truly enjoyable film noir with some wonderful images and great dialogue, at the heart of it is a strong message of tolerance and understanding. Based on a novel on homophobia, this movie attacks post-war anti-emitism, and all intolerance and hatred, with considerable power. Although parts may seem a little preachy to modern audiences, it still has the power to shock, and works very well as a splinter in its own right. A credit to everyone involved.
