We all played Halo and Socom and GTA and Resi, but none of them can stop with GE007. The game itself is wonderful. I literally burned out my N64 playing this great game, along with Zelda OOT. This game alone has built the shape that is essential for all modern shooters. In addition, the multi-player is great. The story mode itself is worth playing a hundred times over and over. This is a great game for when your advice and you just want to shoot some people and there is endless unlock ables. (cheats, aztec, egyptian, god knows how many multiplayer charries and the three problems as well as the famous '007' trouble. Our modern games are great, but when you sit and play, you play a certain feeling that few other games And with the online capabilities of new shooting games, we rarely see this guy two to two death styles, and when we do, it's not as close as these games, and if you get bored with the story, There are endless mysteries, glitches and easter eggs found and used. <br /> <br /> It is definitely one of the greatest shooting games of all time.
