I think FARSCAPE is the best scifi since Babylon 5 and is one of the best sci-fi television series of all time. (Arrangement above with Dr. Wie, Blake's 7, Red Dwarf, MST3K and B5). I find the characters and races of Farscape much more interesting and imaginative than the typical "people-with-birth" that occurs in many series. The effects are pretty good and the stories are addressed. Despite most of the season 2 and season 1, I find the character development done very well.
