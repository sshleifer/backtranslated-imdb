Look at this PPV, I have high expectations for that, since Smackdown is the best show in WWE, it is a very good PPV because it is the last one before Wrestlemania. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH-HARDY BOYS & CHRIS BENOIT VS. MVP & MNM W / MELINA IN A 6 MAN TAG TEAM MATCH Good way to start the game. It started, but later the pace became faster and the game became more exciting and entertaining. Benoit rolls through and makes Joey Mercury out for a victory for the Hardy Boys and himself. 6/10 <br /> SECOND MATCH-GREGORY HELMS {CHAMPION} VS. SHANNON MOORE USA. FUNAKI USA. CHAVO GUERRERO USA. DAIVAIRI VS. SCOTTY 2 HOTTY USA. JAMIE NOBLE USA. JIMMY WANG YANG IN AN OPEN CRUISERWEIGHT INVITATIONAL MATCH FOR THE WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP I am a huge fan of Cruiserweights, and I never get disappointed to watch them, especially in this game here. Chavo Guerrero nails the Frog Splash on Jimmy Wang Yang to get the win and become the new WWE Cruiserweight Champion. 5/10 <br /> THIRD MATCH-FINLAY & LITTLE BASTARD VS. BOOGEYMAN & LITTLE BOOGEYMAN It wasn't really a wrestling match, it was more like a comedy game, despite not being a clear struggle, it still entertained me with the funny fiancee. Finlay nails the Kleinboogman with the Shillaegh to win the victory. Boogeyman doesn't deserve to be on a PPV, and doesn't deserve to be in WWE. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FOURTH MATCH-KANE USA. KINGBOOKER W / SHARMELL It was a surprisingly good game, I thought it would be mediocre, but it was a really competitive battle struggle. Hats off for both men, draw a very entertaining game. Kane wins after a Chokeslam on King Booker. 6/10 <br /> FIFTH MATCH-PAUL London & BRIAN KENDRICK {CHAMPIONS} US DEUCE & DOMINO W / CHERRY FOR THE WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS Not so much of a good game, Deuce & Domino need more training to struggle, and London and Kendrick are the only ones to keep this game faster. London and Kendrick retain their titles after Kendrick played on one of the guys for victory. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SESDE MATCH-BOBBY LASHLEY (CHAMPION) VS. MR. KENNEDY FOR THE EQUAL CHAMPIONSHIP Mr. Kennedy attack Lashley from behind, before the game begins. It was a good game, but not really good. Lashley & Kennedy have a little chemistry, but not enough to make a good match. Kennedy wins by DQ, after Lashley nails him with a chair and then attacks the chair to the entrance area. Lashley still retains his title. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SEVEN MATCH-JOHN CENA & SHAWN MICHAELS USA. BATISTA & UNDERTAKER This is probably the biggest team game I've ever seen. Hats off for all these guys (yes even Batista) to pull as close as a 5-star main event classic. All 4 of these men played their parts very well, as it was a very good and entertaining team-team match. Batista turns his back on Undertaker spine-breaking him, then leaves the ring, which asks Michaels Sweet Chin Music to nail, then Cena n F-U to nail for the hard fight victory. 7/10 <br /> I don't know why everyone says this PPV isn't good enough, or it's boring, I just can't get it. It's a good PPV that Smackdown always delivers. A great PPV indeed. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give it 8/10 and a B +
