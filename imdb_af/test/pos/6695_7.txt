I have it as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 DVDs. I didn't know anything about the history of the series. Season 1 of the series has the pilot section as episode 1 and then 3 more episodes for a total of 4. Season 2 contains 5 episodes of which the last is Beyond Good and Evil with an original air date of December 7, 1998. The other 4 episodes Season 2 was sent out to Febrausry from December 1997. So Beyond Good and Evil looks like season 3 episode 1, except that there are no more episodes in season 3. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here. The two main characters of the first 8 episodes, dr. Iain McCallum (John Hannah) and dr. Angela Moloney (Zara Turner), missing from this episode being replaced by dr. Dan Gallagher (Nathaniel Parker) and dr. Charley Fielding (Dr. Eva Paus). I recognized Nathaniel Parker of the series The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, which began in 2001. So they plan to have a season 3, but only one episode has been broadcast. Trying to continue a series seems strange. named after the main character, McCallum, when the main character of the series is gone. So they may have a return from Dr. Iain McCallum planned, but when it failed, the series was canceled. I have no information on this, but I see that both John Hannah and Nathaniel Parker were involved in other projects in 1999. Does anyone have information about this?
