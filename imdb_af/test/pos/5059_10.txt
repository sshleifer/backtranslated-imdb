We start all our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies a year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by lifetime film to get any movie without any cost! So we can see what we want when we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert are really no different from you or me. The only difference is that they are going to write about the movie and are forced to watch hundreds of movies, whether they want to or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you value your money for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We never listen or ever read the critics. We only care for our friends and those we know as the same things as us. Well enough about it. <br /> <br /> When Meryl Streep heads the NSS in the movie, "The United States doesn't have torture", it has a big laugh at this movie. This, of course, is a lie that Bush administration has repeatedly refused. It's a very good movie and it's scary in what they can do to us if we lose all our civil rights. They can just "snatch" you anywhere and tell one they did. In this case, they snatch a man with a name similar to those who killed thousands on 9-11. He is, of course, just like you or me. And so they take him to a secret place outside the US to torture and water him. <br /> <br /> Very scary. Well acted by Jake and Reese and the whole cast.
