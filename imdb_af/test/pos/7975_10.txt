This is an excellent movie and I would recommend it to anyone. Drury's play is, as always, and he mixes well with the other actors in the movie. Can't give away the tension or drama found in the movie. Hell to pay is a must film! The plot was very exciting. I will see this movie over and over because it has all the elements of a great western movie. It was very authentic in how they display the components that deal with this movie that include guns, horses and clothing. The soundtrack is enjoyable and adds flavor to the movie. James Drury has the right contact when making a movie to be involved with. This is another winner for the Western genre. !!!!!
