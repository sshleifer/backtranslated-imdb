I recently caught this movie on the Sci-Fi channel. This was actually pretty decent as far as B-list horror / suspense movies are going. Two guys (one naive and one loud a **) took a road trip to stop a wedding, but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky, slider / truck hybrid decides and mouse to play with them. Things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculous whorehitch hitchhiker. What makes this movie unique is that the combination of comedy and terror really works in this movie, unlike so many others. The two guys are nice enough and there are some good chases. Beautiful pacing and comic timing make this movie more than acceptable for the horror / slasher buff. Definitely worth checking out.
