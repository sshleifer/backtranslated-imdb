I went to the theater in 1973 when the film was released, I was then 11. I remember how much I enjoyed it and wanted to live in Shangri-la, that's how naive and young I was. I recently received a video of the movie I recorded a few years ago from television. I watched it again and was not ashamed to admit that I still enjoy it as much as I did 29 years ago. I also enjoy listening to the words of the songs because it makes me think that we can one day live in a place where the sound of guns does not fall into our ears and if we look at our reflection, we must be satisfied with what we see. That's what I call a "good" movie because I feel happy after watching it. Maybe I'm still naive, but it makes me happy and I'm sure it'll make you happy when you see it with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is - a good, family movie. I have to be one of the few people to make this movie on VHS PAL video and DVD (self made). I recorded it on DVD, as the video recording of TV was thin. I still watch it from time to time.
