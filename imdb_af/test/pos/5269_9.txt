I am impressed that there is a "hail the woman"; released just one year after the American women voted, this turgid drama makes a serious plea against the sexual double standard that judges women's sexual behavior more than men's. <br /> <br /> BEGIN SPOILERS. A prologue, which took place in the Plymouth Colony in 1621, shows a Pilgrim girl sentenced to the dive chair to thrive with a boy; the boy is not penalized. Now we come to Flint Hill, New Hampshire in the present (1921). Oliver Beresford (Theodore Roberts) is a bombastic bible dump: what we call Britain and Australia a "God-blasphemy". Beresford is determined that his son David (Lloyd Hughes) becomes a preacher, regardless of how David feels about it. As for Beresford's daughter Judith. Well, Beresford is confident that women are not important enough to be anything more than women and mothers. Apparently God told him personally. <br /> <br /> David's evangelical career is in jeopardy when he fertilizes Nan Higgins, the step-daughter of the local foreign worker. (Tully Marshall's character is only identified in the credits as the 'Odd Jobs Man', but a check concludes that he is Jake Higgins. The 1921 prejudice requires that he be merely a stepfather, not her biological parent. .) To save his son from scandal, buy Beresford Nans stepfather with a check. Nan goes out to the big city, to melt in oblivion as one unpopular mother. <br /> <br /> Of course, Judith is upset about the limitations she puts on her gender. (Or rather, by other people's perceptions of it.) She meets Wyndham Gray (excellent performance by Edward Martindel), a writer who encourages her to outdo sexist stereotypes. But Judith is informally engaged to local Joe Hurd, who won't get such nonsense. Hurd is played by Vernon Dent, an avid artist, just remembering comedy roles (as a second banana for Harry Langdon, and as a villain in Three Stooges movies). He gives an excellent performance here, in a role outside his regular range. Unfortunately, Dent spent his last years in poverty and total blindness due to diabetic retinopathy in real life. <br /> <br /> Eventually Judith ends up at an orphanage. It was in 1921, I expected the orphanage to be whites only, and I was pleasantly surprised when it seemed to be one Chinese boy. (And unpleasantly surprised when used as the buttocks for a racial joke.) The movie makes a strange mistake here. In a Christmas series we see the orphanage lover, who visits a visit from Saint Nicholas ... but (in a dialogue title) she gets Santa Claus with SIX reindeer rather than eight. This is followed by a short animation sequence, showing Santa with six reindeer on his sled. I suppose the animators (either accidentally or to save money) left out two reindeer, and the title card reviewed the poem to update the bug. <br /> <br /> In general, Lloyd Hughes was a mere and unimaginable actor. His best-known performance is his role in 'The Lost World', where he is easily raised by a devastating brontosaurus. For his climaxes in 'Hail the Woman', Hughes gives an unforgettable performance as he eventually rebel against his father's tyranny. In his performance as the gospel-screaming father, Theodore Roberts has been accused of persuading him to make his role caricature. I disagree: unfortunately, decades after this film was made, I continue to meet "holy" fools like this man ... willing to destroy the lives of all around them and convince them that they are God have authority to do so. /> <br /> In the central role of Judith Beresford, Florence Vidor gives a sensitive, realistic and intelligent display. I usually like Vidor, who tended to roll in roles, but wasn't pretty enough to justify them. Here, her character's physical appearance is less relevant than usual. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is impressively directed by John Griffith Wray, a director who should be much better known. Unfortunately, Wray died at the beginning of the talkies era, in his mid-thirties: if he lived for ten more years, he would surely have made several early-sounding classics clear. In 'Hail the Woman' there are several extremely beautiful screen combinations: I was particularly impressed by a scene in the New England forest, when Vidor and Dent have a quarrel before a large uprooted tree. (I wonder where it was actually filmed.) 'Hail the Woman' deals with unpleasant subject matter, but it is much better known, and I will judge this ambitious drama 9 out of 10.
