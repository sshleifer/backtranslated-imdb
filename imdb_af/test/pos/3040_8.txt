Just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie gives something to be desired, it is a very poignant and heartwarming study of one's evolution to overcome his youth and education in a biased south and a teacher's creativity to meet with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As a teacher sees a teacher adapting to his students and preparing them for all the challenges that come with life, not just the textbook lessons, a valuable concept we all need to remember is. The thread on the Vietnam War rings is even true today. Well worth it.
