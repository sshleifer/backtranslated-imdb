To see the fictional biography, The Phenix City Story, is to enter countries where US film players rarely ventured, director Phil Karlson has his direct command of "The Untouchables" TV mega-hit series based mainly on " Kansas City Confidential and this movie; and it is one of the most admired and most imitated films ever made. The rarest feat for American filmmakers seems to be the hero-centered purposeful anti-crime movie or TV series; I remind the viewer how powerful "Cain's Hundred" and "Hardcastle and McCormick" and even the "Untouchables" producers had to work to produce everything, but episodes mainly dedicated to the unfair activities of criminals rather than those of their ethical opponents This powerful, original and very eager movie has its own style, and the lesson seems to pay attention to detail about the opponents and victims of criminal organizations as well as their gang members, and there is a twelve-minute forecast for the film. Reporter Clete Roberts questioned the right participants from the Alabama city who struggled with his corrupt fish gangs, which has grown from the presence of Fort Benning over the river, and the almost centuries-long existence of suburbs in the area. Describes the return of John Patterson from Germany where he was a prosecutor, his father, defeated by the Alabama attorney general, refusing his pursuit of the 14th line t vicelords to join despite various provocations including a beating of his son, avenged by Patterson on his malicious. There are several well-developed characters, including Ellie, who works in one of the clubs and her honest boyfriend, victimized the syndicate's leader, Pattersons and John's wife, Ed Gage, vicelords and Zeke Ward, an honest black man for his opposition to them. The cinematography by Harry Neumann and the art by Stanley Fleischer is in B / W and is much like news movie, adding to the movie's realistic power. Music by Harry Sukman contributes effectively to the movie. Author Daniel Mainwaring and Crane Wilbur have made a quick and straight story that divides into parts. Part one illustrates the vicelords empire inside one of their clubs, showing the fate of a victim being beaten and then picked up by police in the wages of the mob. In part two, Albert Patterson refuses to resist the leader of the intelligent Rhett Tanner. In part three, young Patterson returns and after several incidents, including she's going to beat the Mob's head to avenge his own beat, decide to run his father's attorney general's state. His wife is terrified; and the mob kills Zeke Ward's daughter and drops the body at Patterson's home with a warning that his children will be next. A few more such incidents, including the loss of a trial in which the Pattersons proved to be the case, killed a friend of those who found the car in the murder of the girl. And look at the investigation that declared the accident, Patterson convinced him to run, and he won the Democratic state-wide nomination despite the Mob's statistics - and was immediately killed. John Patterson stops a vigilant crowd from the start of open warfare with the 14th Street mob and uses their voices to call the capital and claim the martial law for Phenix City. The clubs were shut down and equipment confiscated, but not before the girl was murdered within the mob's throw and Patterson had to be stopped by Zeke Ward to kill Tanner instead of giving him the law. The drama's end is optimistic; but the prediction for the town is less bad than painted; The gang did indeed try to come back and move to Tennessee. In this well-educated classic of anti-crime film-making, Richard Kiley is young but very strong like Patterson, playing it without an accent. John Mcintyre as his father is very good, while Edward Andrews as Boss Tanner is the award caliber. Others in the film include Kathryn Grant as the girl inside, Ellie, Jean Carson and Kathy Marlowe as the Mob's women, John Larch as they goon, Biff Mcguire as the young victim, James Edwards as Zeke Ward, Lenka Peterson as John's woman, and some good character actors as townsmen and mob bosses. This suggests to me hard to say enough good things about realism and lack of attitude in this movie; This is definitely one of Phil Karlson's best legal efforts. Karlson also did "The Scarface Mob" also "Walking Tall". An enlightening and inspirational look at the ease with which freed citizens of a public interest democracy can participate in tyranny and how some honest men can teach them to fight their rights.
