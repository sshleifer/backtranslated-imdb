Extraordinary extradition is a frightening practice that has been surprisingly authorized by Clinton, which allows the US government to seize and hold anyone suspected for some reason, to be terrorists against the United States. This is a gripping issue, especially after 9/11, because practitioners of the practice will always criticize the opposition to preserve the essential power of the US to effectively combat terrorism. Fanatic supporters will nominate the opposition as terrorists in themselves. <br /> <br /> But like a recent movie that borrowed a similar level of humanity from the death penalty, David Gale's rendering, a version of the abuse of extraordinary show, or at least ease with which it can be exploited and applied falsely. The story involves Anwar El-Abrahimi, an American chemical engineer born in Egypt, who is trapped back to America to give a lecture in Egypt. The reason is that he made calls to a famous terrorist. No evidence was ever given (or needed) that it was Anwar who made the calls, that his phone was never lost from stealing. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Anwar's extremely pregnant wife, Isabella, is back in the states and is trying to find her husband, who came to Chicago on a plane, but apparently never came. The thin explanation that he was never there evaporates as she finds out that he has made a purchase in flight with his credit card. <br /> <br /> Lately I have been exploring modern Chinese history, especially those of the amazingly selfish and brutal dictatorship set up by Mao Tse-tung. It is more than a little frightening to find the similarities between extraordinary versions and some of Mao's cruel frightening tactics, including his public executions (which forced people to watch), and an extensive use of torture specifically used is to take out "confessions". <br /> <br /> It is quite disturbing to see that Mao specifically did these things to create an environment of fear to reach obedience to the Chinese people. To say that the Bush administration did not create an environment of fear, and continue to milk it for all that it would be worth, is naive in the extreme, and although extraordinary performance was not created under Bush not, it is clear that it does more harm than good. <br /> <br /> The thickness of the film is Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal), who works behind a desk for the CIA and has little field experience until his boss is murdered and he suddenly oversees himself on torture. of a man he quickly questioned had something to reveal. Fatima's (Freeman's boss) daughter also plays a pivotal role, as well as a senatorial aide played by Peter Sarsgaard, who may have the most satisfying role in the movie. Meryl Streep is also appropriately cold and clinically a cold senator with dogmatic support for the necessity and exercise of performance. <br /> <br /> As a political thriller, the movie is remarkably well-crafted and fitting. But the worst thing about it is that it's all really. The film's goal is to really make people think about the things that are being done in America's name, especially when they claim to be doing the same thing. Preventing terror in the name of terror will have no sympathy for us, nor will we call out confession through brutal torture, which is the basic form of criminal investigation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we are gradually moving in that direction, rather to do these things rather than less. The frightening question is what is happening at some point in the future to convince us to stop the other side and to go to civilization and peace or will we just go to a military dictatorship until we finally get there?
