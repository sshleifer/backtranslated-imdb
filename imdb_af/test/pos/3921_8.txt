Eventually, before I saw House of Wax, I assumed it would be just a second-grade quality teenage treasure, following in the footsteps of films such as The Darkness of Amityville Horror. After taking a sophisticated performance on my university campus, I can honestly say that the people at Dark Castle have done an excellent job with the task of making a sanding machine. <br /> <br /> Start with the usual staples of a teenage horror movie like the small group of friends traveling on a road trip, and come across a strange detour that they follow through country back roads that meet the spectacular inhabitants . slow but mandatory back story this movie really reaches a quick clip. Paris Hilton appears in this movie as everyone already knows, but I really have to give it to her for her show. Clearly, her play was not an Oscar, but the filmmakers use her look to the limit by putting two blatant satires on her, let's just say, less noble media look in this movie. Mrs. Hilton also claims the title for the biggest movie scene in the movie, not just because it was her death scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is full on the edge with jumping moments and cheap scares, but Jaume Serra definitely created quality tension and tension between characters. The causes of the horror are partly based on the audience that cares for the characters, what we do. Following the usual build-up followed by a loud noise and some crazy moments in the camera. These standard movie-based movie-making techniques are almost perfect with this movie, offering great scares. In fact, there is not a slow moment after coming to the small town where the dreaded House of Wax Museum is. <br /> <br /> This movie is very much due to many previous films of this and other genres, although I'm not sure how much of the original 1953 movie came from the same title. References to movies like Texas Chainsaw Masacres, Saw, and even Titanic (see Paris Hilton's great death scene and you will know what I mean) are common, but eventually the payout will be scared and fulfilled if you are looking for a good scare with a few laughs. Not bad.
