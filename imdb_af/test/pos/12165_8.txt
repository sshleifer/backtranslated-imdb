After 10 views in 20 years, I think it was the Crazy Gang's best film effort, with more cohesion in the plot than their next best, "Alf's Button Afloat". They were indeed a crazy trio of dual acts cast mainly on stage, sometimes before royalty until Chesney Allen retired through poor health in the 40s. He has survived them for years. Apparently, they were just as angry outside 'work', who often played practical jokes on each other. <br /> <br /> The Six Wonder Boys Troop I will tell me: Alaska, to dig for the gold found there. It was a better idea than going to Mansfield ... because they were there. When they arrived at Red Gulch, they found their information was only 40 years old - they thought the chips that were in the guilty newspaper they had read had a nice taste. But by then it doesn't matter, because they all fell in love with Snow White and want to help her grandmother find his long lost stash of gold. Baddie Bill "M" McGrew, however, wants it himself. <br /> <br /> The number of verbal and visual words is amazing, but most of them will probably only make sense (?) to Brits and ex-pats who are interested to see '30s British b & w comedies. Imho works almost all the gags and routines, including the Golden As-patter between Bud & Chesney and the Whistle While You Work Pastiche - even the "Always Getting Our Man" Mountie inserts. A wonderful little movie, in a rather tired look, but totally recommended.
