To qualify my use of "realistic" in the summary, not many old people I know, pretend to be famous maestros, blind people, and so on. To be - and I have never been elderly. Those little problems are out of the way, the relationships between the characters in this movie and the emotions expressed in it are completely realistic and sincere. In fact, although we are not yet 30, I could see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife in the interaction between the main character and his wife. For those who do not die young (there is a good rule in the movie about this, when the two best friends talk about dying boys and one of them says - and I paraphrase, we missed our chance it should just stick out) , we will all be where these characters are a day. I know many filmmakers will be chosen to be swept away from reality, not to be, but even they may enjoy the sweet memory of our mortality - and the importance of living life to the full - that this film is .
