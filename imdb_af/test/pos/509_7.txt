Hope the summary line won't annoy you (it's a small tribute to the Chappelle Show / Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I'll try to keep all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't keep in another paragraph, so it's easier to read! <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good stuff! The quotes "strong bloody violence" (used by rating boards to describe the contents of a movie are very good here. It is not a movie for kids! Character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and crazy enough storyline to keep / justify the action scenes! The original idea is also very pleasant and intelligent. The action scenes are also good here. <br /> <br /> OK to the things I didn't like, the overall story is too thin, it's enough as I wrote above to keep the action scenes together, but there can be more, and a character like Blade deserves more (imo) is not the best ... also the use of cliches does not help. Some characters are underwritten ... That's it! o)
