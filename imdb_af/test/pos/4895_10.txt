I must admit that when I first heard of the Apocalypse movie, it was a concern. <br /> <br /> I mean, they have a lot to live or not? When they first performed a stage performance, they won the Perrier Award and when they made radio, they won a Sony award. When they ventured onto our counters, they won a Bafta award, a Royal Television Society Award and the Golden Rose or Montreux. <br /> <br /> When the first series was broadcast in January 1999, it was blowing! A real fresh air in the British Comedy, and when the second series broadcast a year later, built it on that basis and locked the cult status across the world. Our web statistics show that we have received visitors from every country on the planet! The 'Local Show for Local People' showed the Gents live-action talent and opened doors for the men to do more live performances such as 'Art' in the western end. <br /> <br /> The favorite favorite has always been the Christmas presentation, less of a sketch show and more a tribute to classic horror movies, but still included in the nice league style. <br /> <br /> And of course there was the "difficult" third series, still a <br /> <br /> As I say, a lot to live. <br /> <br /> <br /> So now we have the movie and ... Well, a movie is different, isn't it? It will be seen with much larger numbers than the radio or TV programs and with the third in mind I was worried. <br /> <br /> Well, as you know, I was happy to see the movie yesterday at a busy screening in London and all my doubts were blown away (literally) in the first few minutes! I'm not going to give away plot lines as some reviewers have done, and I'm not going to tell you the catches (although there is only one), but I'll try to tell you what they've achieved with this movie! I left the theater last night, but I could only imagine: "Oh my god, it's great, it's great, it's the best thing they ever did, better than the first, the second and the offers all in a rolled! " Of course, I owe my visitors a much better explanation than this! So why is it brilliant? It's a movie for everyone, the accidental fan, the obsessive fan of the opportunity fan and even someone in the wrong theater! You don't have to watch the series to enjoy this movie; It works on so many levels. <br /> <br /> This film reminded me why I am a host of the Lord fan! You can see that filming was also a true love work; attention to detail is incredible. The sets for the TV show were always detailed, but I'm going to have to watch the movie again just to look at the wallpaper! The story moves fast, the action that we transport from Royston Vasey to the real world where we meet the 'Creator' who is of course the League itself! Along the way, we succeed in stamping favorite characters from the show, but always within the central story, unlike the TV sketch program. <br /> <br /> I was glad the movie was dark, a little scary and a bit strange ... just fit the league of gentlemen. The Gents also managed to get their revenge on the BBC sensors, not slipping into the word "Mongoloid" like shouting it from the roof trusses! Some may think that the Gents portrayal of themselves is a bit lenient, but it is the joke and that brings me only concern. The jokes I mention below can puzzle some viewers and they may come a little too clever ... but I don't have to worry, there is always a poke joke just waiting around and talking about jokes, they come thick and fast, and in a mix of clever references, wedge jokes, bum jokes, visual jokes and cock gags! I didn't laugh out loud in a theater ... well, I can't remember! The fans who have been with the League since its inception, are rewarded with a number of jokes, some working on two levels can hear a mainstream for some reason after a reference to a slide, while fans of the local show will laugh completely for another reason! The cameos are genius! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg form the strangest dual act you've ever seen. Simon gets one of the biggest laughing movies just by making a noise! I was a little worried about the 1690's aspect of the movie when I first heard it, but as a story in a story I just came in ... but it would tell! All I have to say is that it fits in nicely and adds to the overall feel of the movie! I'm not a professional film adjudicator, so I find it hard to say how much I enjoyed this movie, but I will just say this as the supposed measure of British comedy films over the past year's excellent Shaun of the dead, then I'm sorry, but a new benchmark is fit by the inventive, hilarious and sometimes a little scary ... The League of Sir's Apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Jason Kenny 2005
