When the movie started, I thought cheesy. The first ten minutes were really boring. After the slow start and some of the soap opera antique, I started to like it. The plot was different to what I have ever seen. Now was it a horror? Not really. It should not be considered an abomination, or the producers had to put more money into the movie to make it frightening. As it was, the creatures were there for a short while. I can only assume it was for money reason. <br /> <br /> The good thing was that the movie was very entertaining. It was my interest (after the start) and made me wonder about creatures of a different dimension. <br /> <br /> It was clear that this was a first-time movie for the director, but there were some highlights. By the end I was addicted. Actually, Hollywood didn't put any more money on it.
