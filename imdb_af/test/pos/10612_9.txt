Marigold is by far the best "outsider's" attack on Bollywood I've ever seen. (I didn't grow up with Bollywood, but I've seen a few hundred of them now.) I would say it almost leaves Gurinder Chadha, Mira Nair, and even Merchant and Ivory (from Bombay Talkie) in the dust. Willard Carroll, the director, really loves Bollywood and he has the confidence to let us know. There is humor, but no bow, ironic, no, of course, doesn't really mean these things. As Jerry Lee Lewis would say, "he gets it," and so he can tell us - the joy of a Bollywood movie experience, along with the touches given by a westerner's role in the storyteller's role be. /> <br /> It's a story about a bitter, bitchy, beautiful American B-actress (she's only in movies with numbers in their titles, such as Fatal Attraction 3) that finds herself in another Bollywood movie of the one she went to India to be in (Kama Sutra 3 folded his tents while she was traveling, apparently because his producers are in jail). Salman Khan, in fact a Bollywood mega-mega star, is the dancing master of the wonderful written-on-the-fly movie she has now drawn ("is it before or after I go blind?") And by The sweetness of his gently psychic character, she learns more than to find her inner ecstatic dance ability. <br /> <br /> The strong start gives you both Bollywood - a super-energetic group of dancers in front of the Taj Mahal (both funny to the Western viewer, as well as the high-speed musical excitement we love in a Hindi movie ), and Salman on the screen from the start - no Bollywood 20 minutes waiting for the hero. He decorated an Indian costume with Kit Carson-style Western movie frills (all in white). <br /> <br /> Ali Larter's actress character is pleasing to the western viewer - she is blonde, traditionally a "white" person in a Bollywood movie, and visually understandable castings - but she is a robust girl, not the ethereal kind of blondes we are usually offered, and she is a more or less three-dimensional bitch who does ominous and offensive. cellphone conversations with boyfriend and agent in USA. <br /> <br /> We also have scenes of women who are having trouble with each other, going to a bar to handle it - the ability not to get people together to handle emotional conversations is traditionally in Hindi. movies, but we rarely see much of something that happens between women (except the discussion between mother and daughter about the daughter's choice of groom), let alone "strangers" - unrelated people - let alone bar-going. So the spirit is the same, the details are fresh and I was completely satisfied with it. <br /> <br /> I only saw it once, at a preview attended by the director, a good speaker and a questioner - he and Salman should be "brotherly" good friends about the make it, he loves India, he plans to make a wizard of Oz film in India. I can't touch too much on songs once I've seen them, except to say I liked them all. They range from a happy parody of the Bollywood number in the film-in-the-movie - the ladies costumes, with Leghorn hats and seashell socks (this is a beach scene) on flowing dresses - the cost of a ticket is worth it. alone - to a lovely, reflective, multicolored romantic song in a sad and more serious part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Mix Hindi and English in the music, and it works. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan gets a lot of credit for openness for unusual projects - this and Jaan-e-Mann - and good judgment about who's in it. Carroll said he was full of suggestions and ideas along the way, and totally fine (ie not narcissistic) or Carroll accepting or rejecting it - clearly just a pro who likes to be involved and collaborate.
