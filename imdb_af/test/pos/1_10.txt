My boyfriend and I watched The Guardian. First, I didn't want to see it, but I loved the movie. It was definitely the best movie I've ever seen. They portrayed the USCG very well, it really showed me what they were doing and I think they should really be appreciated. Not only did it teach, but it was a very good movie. The movie shows what it really does and how hard the job is. I think it will be a USCG, is challenging and very scary. It was a good movie. I would suggest this movie to anyone to watch. The end broke my heart, but I know why he did it. The storyline was wonderful, I give it 2 inches. I cried it was very emotional, I'll give it 20 if I could!
