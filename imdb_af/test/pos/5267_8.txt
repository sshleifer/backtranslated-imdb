Vidor shines as Judith, the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strict patriarchal family. Her father, David, is so indignant by his father that it is a surprise that he can even tie his shoes, rather than ask Dad to do it for him. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have already set out the plot. I will not recover it; However, I would point out that David, who is pregnant by David, is also married to him. It is not a pregnancy outside of marriage, which would have been horrible in 1921. The two were married in secret, but Nan's father, paid by David's father, broke their marriage certificate. <br /> <br /> While attending Judith, Nan's death scene is a truly heartbreaking experience and highly accused of emotion. This scene alone is worth watching the movie, but there is much more to the plot than that; why on earth is not made modern movies with the same attention to the story?
