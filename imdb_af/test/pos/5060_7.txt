An Arab American man is kidnapped from an American airport and flew to 'somewhere in North Africa' where he is tortured. The reason? His cellphone received a call from a famous terrorist. The CIA decides to avoid legal means to determine whether the call is a fault or a fault. After watching this movie, we can only pray that some terrorists will not accidentally enter a wrong number! <br /> <br /> In addition to the version, there are several related side stories. One involves the daughter of the head of intel (secret police?) Who tortures the suspect and her involvement with her lover who occurs in the night school for suicide bombings. This story is renewable, yet intriguing, especially when we see the outcome. The director uses a neat timeline switcheroo to hook the audience. <br /> <br /> The second side story is the attempt of the suspect's wife to find out what happened to her missing husband. She gets an old lover to help. He (a muted Saarsgard) is at the Senator (Alda) at the camp and soon gets cold feet when he realizes that his work is not the truth to uncover the truth. Witherspoon is wasted in this role. All she has to do is leave and pregnant, with one short rage. Stripe is good and cold and stereotypical like the govt. (CIA? NSA? Homeland Sec?) Official who appears to be a Cheney clone. <br /> <br /> Gylenhall is also wasted as a minor analyst plugged into his area, but he gets the right thing. The movie is overwhelming, a bit slender, but thought it didn't add much to the box. This is definitely not considered definitive, and it certainly has an ax to grind. Like the Kingdom, it scrapes the surface of a very complicated subject. <br /> <br /> The movie is trying hard to give us an idea of ​​version, but can only end by being a "cautionary story" about one. The whole point of extradition is not to torture, but to get "terror suspects" to give in by avoiding the right (thus obstructive) barriers. Torture can surely be used, especially if the show is out of our hands - although we are not innocent of this matter, but intel that can save lives is essential in this "shadow war".
