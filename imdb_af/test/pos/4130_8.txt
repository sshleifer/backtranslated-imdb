Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock'n'roll. The young singer / songwriter of Lubbock, Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system to find his rock-a-billy sound. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lazy strings with bob rhythms. Holly will take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage anxiety. <br /> <br /> This easy bio look is not without errors. Some situations, events, places and even names were not correct for various reasons. What makes this movie so believable is that Gary Busey did his own song in the part of Holly. A well-produced soundtrack has become a multi-million seller. <br /> <br /> Busey is nominated for an Oscar. Other stars of notes are Don Stroud, Conrad Janis, Charles Martin Smith and Maria Richwine.
