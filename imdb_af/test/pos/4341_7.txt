LOL. <br /> <br /> The mere fact that I start my review with 'lol' says it all. I watched this movie all the time as a child; And even then I felt the folly of everything. The low budget, horrible play and lame writer have always been clear. I looked it up again yesterday and couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good fun. As another reviewer said, it didn't take him seriously. There is no way to look at this movie and say the makers did it. The soundtrack is so funny, I laugh every time I hear it. The 'climax' is just a riot. It's an all-out New York war zone, full of explosions and total chaos ... so ridiculous that you can't help but face it. <br /> <br /> Other hilarious moments: <br /> <br /> - The scene with Kersey and the cop next to each other like 2 cowboys against the entire Wild West was so cute, it was funny. <br /> <br /> I killed myself how the bad guys at Kersey could shoot and he could even put on one knee to always strive so carefully (and slowly) and not get LMAO. Of course, with him it was one shot. One with his elephant handgun LOL kill. <br /> <br /> - Another hilarious scene was the end when he eventually killed the gang leader. With a ROCKET LAUNCHER lol ... it destroys the whole side of the apartment building. <br /> <br /> - Obviously, Kersey is all it uses to lose loved ones ... when its new girlfriend quickly gets rid of just a few dates. The acting is so bad you can't blame anyone who just thinks Kersey is angry with the destruction of the car. He walks down, looks at the bloodbath and just walks away. <br /> <br /> Again, so bad, it's good. <br /> <br /> *** from **** stars.
