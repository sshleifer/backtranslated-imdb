I looked at all the doctors who found out that my local PBS station was playing while I was growing up. (introduced John Pertwee to the doctor), as well as doctor's camera copies sent by UK fans to America to their American counterparts. . I had a wonderful time with the show, but it was never so serious to think about. I mean as serious as a sci-fi show over a time traveler can be. I went to the CON's, the costume piece (Doctor # 5,6 and Tegan were my costume characters), loved it. then it all suddenly stopped. program politics and lack of interest and funding became a doctor in a 25-year-old anti-ethics. <br /> <br /> When I heard that the sci-fi channel picked up the new doctor was my first thought, "cool, now my 11-year-old son can see what I've been struggling for years and know what the TARDIS is "(I have several phone cases and TARDIS of different sizes around the house) Do not expect the excellent quality of story, character development and f / x. I was the least satisfied. For the first time I found a doctor who was not a curmudgeon, a clown, a dummy, a head, a vagina or a while. Christopher Eccleston is by far the most credible doctor to date. Well, now, calm tom baker fans! Don't get me wrong, I almost loved every doctor and his traits, but Christopher gave the doctor something he'd never had before - true word of credibility. I'm just sad that he decided by another season. I will try David Tennant as I would have any other doctor, but now the bar has risen. <br /> <br /> Bad Wolf Rules !!!!! <br /> <br /> 2008 update - I love David tennant! his "mod" persona is something my generation remembers, can handle my son's generation, and relax fashionable walking! He is a little more human than Christopher, but not as humas like other former doctors. I miss roses, I dig Martha, and what do they think about Donna Edele!?!? It's still the best ride on TV
