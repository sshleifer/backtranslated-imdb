Safer indeed, Hitchcock's cinema is perverted all the time; But we all know his perversions are ours too, so we forgive him. And we don't just forgive him, but we welcome his clever way to invite us for a memorable train ride. <br /> <br /> I saw Hitch's 1953, I confess, a week before this one, and I'm both in the same category as part of his brands. These brands remained in his genius interrogation and played his artistic veins that flush psychic drops of blood on the viewer, without blaming, but very subtle awareness of ashame. <br /> <br /> The pen is always more powerful than the sword and Hitch wrote the most arguable questions with his wrist. When held firmly with his hands, he held cameras that always reflect people who are thirsty for blood (most people have), otherwise comedy would not usually be a tragic thing, people didn't laugh so complexly. <br /> <br /> Mix all the dark elements of "high society", with rich psychopath Bruno, and an ambitious tennis player want to be a politician. Guy, the story is one of the most well-crafted and led by Hitch, inspires many filmmakers, not only with the plot, but with difficult images that elicit dark smiles and happy nightmares. <br /> <br /> Little Perfect!
