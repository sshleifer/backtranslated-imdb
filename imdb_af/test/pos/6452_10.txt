City Streets is incredibly modern, technically speaking, for a film made in 1931. Also, who can't be fascinated by Gary Cooper's powerful magnetism, which intensifies the audience's attention. The plot is quite complicated and clear. The scenarios, d√©cor, are exceptional in every detail. All the actors are above average. I keep guessing how the director and his staff, including editing, sound, lighting, photography, were so brilliant. I could not find a fault and understand that the screens in the road (bumpy ride) with the big screen in the background were the best they could get in 1931. All in all, I got this movie fantastic and so much found alive. Gary Cooper charisma.
