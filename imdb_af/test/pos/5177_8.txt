Just live on the Hwy of Georgetown, Co ... I remember this movie well and thought it was great! The story looks like something John will even do in real life, but there's something I will always remember most of the movie. For those of you who don't live in Denver. Every Christmas, the city of Denver, Co. puts a fabulous display of lights and decorations at the Civic Center in downtown Denver. Well ... as it happened, during the filming of this movie, a birth scene was needed. So ... it's borrowed from the Civic Center exhibition ... with permission, incidentally! Someone forgot to advise the forces, and it was reported stolen! A frantic search for a few days started with law enforcement. Eventually someone spoke and remembered to lend it to the Georgetown movie staff! It was returned and replaced where it belongs! As it turns out, it wasn't so much in the movie ... you can hardly see it during the Christmas show with the kids. It did shut down a store, though ...
