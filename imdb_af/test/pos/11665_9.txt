"Dead Man Walking" is an amazing movie story. In addition, all the plays are realistic, and the writing examines the issue of the death penalty on both sides and pays homage to both. Above all, it is a deeply moving story of salvation, of death with dignity and loss of ego. Any film that encourages it and deals with such an incredibly difficult subject, deserves a score of 10/10. Thanks, Tim Robbins!
