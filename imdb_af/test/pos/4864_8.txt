I picked up a DVD at the 1? discount, no idea about it (but at that price I can't resist.) In short: I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> So much so I did quite a bit of research. On the German DVD (part 2 of a series of 3), episodes in two 85 minute parts are combined and out of order. Here are my results based on Wikipedia's episode list: <br /> <br /> "Doomsday" is In My Boots + The Voice (last episode). <br /> <br /> "War of the machines" is Hell & High Water (1, 2) + Pod Listener + Juggernaut Down. <br /> <br /> Well, what can I say. Undressed girlies are of course interesting for older men. I never watched so many Charlie's Angels, so I can't compare, but the more I watched, the less I watched bikini tops and their fillings. Instead, the characters (both m and f) became more interesting. I can imagine that feminists also have their fun. All in all, maybe a guilty pleasure, but a pleasure it was: ^)
