Well, the first time I've seen Talk Talk, it was just $ 2.00 in a video store. VHS believes it or not, and I watched it and I thought it was about Howard Stern, because I only watched it for thirty. Seconds, it just didn't see it again. Then I went to another store about a month later and found Talk Radio on DVD for only $ 5.00. So I see it was directed by Oliver Stone, and I picked it up. So after the movie was over, I was speechless. I have never seen such a movie. Here's the main plot, then I'll tell you what I thought about it. <br /> <br /> It's about a Dallas radio host, Barry Champlain, a Jewish radio host talking about what other people are up to and interrupts, and taking everything seriously. Now a network wants to make its display live anywhere in the US. So Barry's show gets many interesting phone calls like Chet (a neo-natzi), Kent (a rock n roll drunk child), John (rapist) and others. Now some of the callers sound like the same actor / actress. But I still think it fits well. <br /> <br /> Now, what I love about this movie is the darkness and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station. The dark music in the background also fits very well. It also has a flashback scene in the movie how he started the radio, which I think they did well. <br /> <br /> But the big thing about the movie ends. I was amazed at it and it made you feel paranoid a bit about the callers of the air and everything about it is wonderful. It also tells you how to say the right things for people over a big city like Dallas. Called one of Oliver Stone's underestimated / weakest movies, but I think it's his best in my opinion. <br /> <br /> But definitely this movie if you like movies with paranoia - feels like movies with a dark atmosphere with sinister music. in the background. I'm still watching this movie of the time when I'm bored, as a matter of fact I watched it tonight. Yes, if you really want to get the sinister feel of the movie, look at the lights at night with the lights. I may look crazy, but it makes the movie better! <br /> <br /> Another thing I forgot to mention is that the reason I didn't think the movie was doing so well was perhaps in my view due to the title. Talk Radio. It doesn't sound very hard or anything, it's kind of ordinary. A better title like the book "Talked To Death" or maybe "The Abusive Radio Host" or something catchy and not ordinary "Talk Radio". Or maybe because of Universal Pictures? Oliver Stone usually did not do universally. I don't think so. Paramount was perhaps a good company. I don't know, something about this movie didn't do it so well, but I love it. <br /> <br /> "Sticks and stones can break your legs, but words can cause permanent damage."
