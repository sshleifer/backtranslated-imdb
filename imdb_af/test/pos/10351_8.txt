In the last ten minutes of this exceptional television, I smiled like an idiot. I must say that the idea of ​​sitting 90 minutes that was pretty depressed on a Sunday tonight was not a welcome one. The thought of yet another, about worthy, BAFTA winning possibility, didn't enchant me ... But the end result beat me for 6. It's the best television I've ever seen. For years, I was under the impression that all originality had left the BBC's drama department. Our friends in the north were the last production that really blew me and it was 10 years ago. But faith is restored and honor is satisfied. David Tenant was incredible! So many actors I can think of would have been like that in town, but never once did I see the tenant as an actor or as a doctor. All I saw was Alan Hamilton. I haven't gotten much of my heart since Daniel Craig's performance as Geordie Peacock years ago. Sarah Parish was also incredible and I really hope this role brings her better roles in the future. All the role players were big, but special mention should go to the director who really put us in Alans's head. The toaster scene made me feel special.
