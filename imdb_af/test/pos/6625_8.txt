Oh, this is an excellent piece of work to be sure. In fact, several of the best scene in the film, or at least in Bergman's theater, are in this movie. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow are as good as you would expect. Give these two bad performances? Sven Nykvist delivers a little masterful, though unconventional, mastery, cinematography. The writing is pretty good, especially in individual scenes. Sometimes the film laughs, and the tempo is uneven, but probably deliberate. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem? Well, the movie is too dark for its own good. Other Bergman movies are just as dark, but nowhere near this hard. Eventually I just gave up and I got a little irritated. I did a lot of touches during the film, but I finally felt uninvolved. It's a good movie, but I doubt I'll ever see it again and don't suggest it to friends. Or if I suggested it, I would be very sure to warn them about what lies ahead. 8/10.
