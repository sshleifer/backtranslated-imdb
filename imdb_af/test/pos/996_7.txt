Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, excused for serving duty, is doing little for the war effort that prose for a government propaganda side in Whitehall is causing. <br /> <br /> Thomas is portrayed as a freethinker who is married in free love. to a woman with an equally demanding artistic streak and also with a love for extra-marital romance. Thomas writes his poetry in systematic household throughout, becomes somewhat indifferent at the end and rests somewhat uncomfortably on his social connections and ranks on a war veteran who shot his home and who was married to the woman he had. > <br /> The true story of this movie is the love of two women, one (Keira Knightley) whose first love was Thomas (Matthew Rhys), the second (Sienna Miller) who is Thomas's wife. Sometimes it reminds The Singing Detective, as in very good television with a little sinister tap on the scene of surreal camp absurdity.
