My college theater had a special performance of this movie last night. I must say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't mind, but he was not in horror anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton could act. By the way, if you're worried about it, don't be. I'm not actually one of her supporters, but I have to be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actors were very good. I'm not going to go into detail for the plot, because I'm sure you know about it. Surpirsisngly, the characters are pretty engaging and you actually care for them, especially the characters of Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray. We meet them as competing brothers and sisters and end up with them to work together. Another plus is that it does not have the slim look of Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre and is almost documentary as a music video. (Don't get me wrong, I loved Texas Chainsaw and enjoy Amityville.) <br /> <br /> Now for the death tones. In most slasher films, when a character is stabbed or killed, the scene immediately cuts to another scene, but not in this one. When a character is about to die, they die pretty cruelly. But the filmmakers don't stop there and add a little extra extra to each victim every time. I will not say anything about the screens and will show you to yourself. <br /> <br /> While this is a good treasure movie, it has the flaws of almost all treasure movies (a creepy house when you shouldn't be, a ride of a suspicious character, you have to pick up and scream so that the killer can hear you). There is also a kind of dull plot turn that was unnecessary and didn't add to the movie at all. You might say it was just added at the last moment and if you took it out, it wouldn't have touched the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Basically, if you're a horror movie fan, watch this movie. You won't be disappointed. It has all it takes to make it a great movie movie, possibly the best of the year, although it's so early. The tension is felt and it is sometimes a funny movie. If you hate horror movies, chances are you'll love this one. If you are divided, I encourage you to give it.
