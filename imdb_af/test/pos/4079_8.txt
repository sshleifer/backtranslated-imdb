This searing drama based on a true incident relates to several ambitious Afrikaners who decide to leave their families temporarily by hiding on an outgoing ship. They think that if they make the journey successful, they can improve their lives by making enough money in New York to send for their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship they choose is a Russian overloaded truck already fined at a previous port for stowaways. The captain and first mate are determined not to make it happen again, as their work is on the line. The group of blacks is beginning their hasty journey into the container and is eventually discovered, forced to hide and be killed by the relentless partner (an excellent performance by Sean Pertwee.) A few (convincingly feared leader Omar Epps among them) succeed in temporarily escaping and are mercilessly pursued by the ship with their lives forfeited if caught. Altogether, a riveting movie that will bite audiences to tear their nails and mock their teeth is wondering how such serious events can occur in modern civilization.
