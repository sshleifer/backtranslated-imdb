Right the hospital scene with Holly and Shannon was done brilliantly. It starts with Piper. On a Gurney looks very badly injured. The doctors fly her into a resuscitation room and they move her from the gurney on a bed and Prue holds her hand from that point. It is clear that Piper has a lot of trouble breathing and her lungs are failing, as she goes to Prue's turn not to leave her side. "I don't love you and then her wrist falls and she goes into cardiac arrest and the monitor shows a clear flat line and the nurses go out into the trauma and bring in a defibrillator. Prue Steps back in bed horror if doctors desperately try to shock her dying sister's heart, but there is no reaction and she is tragically pronounced dead, good big scene well done girls
