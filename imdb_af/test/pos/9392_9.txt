George Barry is a genius. "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is a prototype for many of the "slipstream" fiction and camp surrealism now so chic. Really innovative, maverick, and just effing brilliant. Hyper-strange acting, subtle nightmare atmosphere. I recommend reading Stephen Thrower's book Nightmare USA (there's a chapter dedicated to Barry and Death Bed: The Bed That Eats). Available at FAB Press. On a related note, 'Doodbed: The Bed That Eat' and 'Beyond Dream's Door' make a perfect double account. Furthermore, it is soon and tired - and ultimately stupid - to criticize a low-budget cult film because it is "poor" or "technically inactive". The B-film aesthetic is part of the movie's charm. No amount of CGI can duplicate the cumulative effect "Deathbed: The Bed that eats" on the viewer with an advanced palate.
