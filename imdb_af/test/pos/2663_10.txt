I write this review just after I heard Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a big loss, and I'm writing about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it's the ultimate Kubrick movie, which he'll remember most. It's a picture like no other, not just to revive science fiction, but to change the way films are conceptualized. It was probably America's first art film and inspired like George Lucas and many other writers and directors. <br /> <br /> Apart from its visual magnitude, the reason why the film is so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-author, had a vision, but we never really found out what had gone through their minds. Of course, the skinny on his 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and determine the course of our lives unless we are careful. The end of 2001 is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child's flight back to earth. It will be meaningless to many, but critical filmmakers will understand. <br /> <br /> Although 2001 did not have the evil, dark humor of DR. STRONGLY or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contains strong, eccentric characters that filled his previous works such as PATHS OR GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would like to remember most of this. As something, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous and artificial. It was half a decade in the making at a time when Hollywood was still dull and just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian theater. Kubrick was a maverick director who made good movies on his own terms, at his own time, and for everyone to marvel. He will be missed.
