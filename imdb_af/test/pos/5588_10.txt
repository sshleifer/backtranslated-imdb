It should not be considered a review on any movie, but a commentary on a movie I saw when I was a boy. I remember coming home for a night, wondering what I saw. I tried to tell my parents a part of the story, but they listened without understanding what was so strange about two children stranded on an island that falls in love and grows together and has a son . As you have to guess, I refer to the Blue Lagoon (1949) which has chased and stunned me over the years (almost 50) and is now full of anxiety and horror who or who has prevented the film from being available in a cassette or DVD or whatever. I spent a lifetime and got the opportunity to get hold of it one day and nobody knows about it. What a waste indeed! Sorry if my English is not technical or scientific, but my native language is Spanish. I do my best to understand. Thanks, my name is Juan and I am writing from Uruguay in S.America.
