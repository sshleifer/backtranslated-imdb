Faith Akin once again made me realize the deepest of my passion for this city, Istanbul. Faith Akin was addressed as a city of cultural mosaic, and contributed to addressing the mosaic of music performed in the film. In addition, the climax of the film is, in my opinion, the scene where Muzeyyen Senar (a Turkish music diva) sings at the age of 86, as well as what she did in her younger years and rolls the raki glass in the air without getting out. pour one drop, which is traditionally in raki culture. She's just wonderful. Sezen Aksu (a Turkish pop singer) with her mystical and meaningful look at the end of her song, the film, is his Turkish title, making the scene no less than a climax. Last but not least, the wonderful landscape of Istanbul can make you feel nostalgic when you are away. Beware!
