I enjoyed this movie since I first saw it in the theater. Some movies have a bit of characters and a script that comes in perfect synergy, and that's one of them. The characters illustrate some truths to get the best out of people, to work together harmoniously, build a team, and achieve goals, without ever proclaiming morality. The situations are well-crafted and are in line with the film's opening perspective. The tension builds beautifully and the humor is always clean and consistent. The movie allows me to root for the characters and to laugh all day long. It's a good movie as good as they come. <br /> <br /> What amazes me is that a movie that looks so simple can entertain so long. The music is a perfect copy of music in the typically serious post-war fleet, which helps to create humor and shows that greatness is in the eye of the awakening. The credits in the credits are a good music video of "In the Navy", which deserve their own full screen special feature. The screens and cuts are well manufactured, and the casting and acting are right. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic as big as any one ever made, without any predictions. In fact, the lack of pretense is what makes it so much fun to watch. I love these guys and gall. <br /> <br /> The other day I thought about the movie and wondered if it was available on DVD. Happiness came, and the DVD came out in May 2004. I went to the store and got a copy. Then my wife and I enjoyed a hilarious evening in front of the big screen. I saw this movie as a 10 because it comes together at all levels, much better than many high-budget movies and Oscar winners. It's fun. <br /> <br /> Listen Fox Home Video: you have a good movie in your cellars and it's a pity to find a cheap shot DVD with bad deviation from hue colors only 8 years since release. So why not restore the colors and present the movie as it was meant to be seen? I'd like to pay a few more dollars to get the picture right. I'm grateful to have my own copy. Now give the eyeball the movie deserves, and how about reviewing the credit range as a full screen music video special feature.
