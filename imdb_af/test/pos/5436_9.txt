This movie is a great comedy drama. Christopher Walken is great in his supportive role as manager, and his comments will make you laugh. Robin Williams plays a big role as a quick white "Jon Stewart" and will entertain you as fans of Comedy Central. The show is good because if the viewer has half a brain, they will see it as an essential subcultural attack on the policies of the current Republican government and a criticism of the American Democratic Process ... not to mention the way most politicians are preferred. <br /> <br /> I was amused at the sub-plots and found that the movie was very fast and entertaining, without any of the usual "oh brothers" agree the movie is less comedy than marketed, but no doubt better than 90% of the garbage in theaters right now. Just my thoughts ... Don
