I have to say one big reason I thought the AristoCats were so good because I love cats. I love cats, who probably gave this movie a big score from me, but it was definitely a good movie than Well, and I love where they make the movie. It's one of my favorite animal films, though animated, and I really love how the actors / actresses don't sound so unprofessional behind the animals' voice. For me, this movie looks like a classic, but I think it's not because it has, yes, I think too low a rating. You look at all the other "original" Disney movies and they have a much higher rating than that, but AristoCats is one of the best animation movies out there and I can enjoy it over and over!
