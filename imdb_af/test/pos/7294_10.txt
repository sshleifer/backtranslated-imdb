It is a very unusual movie that starts with a rich man who gets a brand new sports car for the graduation and decides to take it in the local town. Rich boy meets a poor girl in 'Mabels Diner' who is a waitress and local girlfriend gets very upset and starts a fight. There is a car hunt and all sorts of problems and the rich boy and poor boy have to do the community service as ordered by the village official. Rich boy and poor son doesn't come together and the rich boy wins the heart and soul of the poor boy's girlfriend. There are many walks in the woods and poetry is quoted and some very deep thoughts about life. Poor girl says, "Some people go through life and never find love, I can say I found love and keep it." You will need a tissue if you are sensitive, there are many romantic scenes and I doubt much if you will guess how this photo will end. The producer and director got a good idea and eventually ended a film. If you like life story stories with poetry and very sensitive subjects, it's your movie.
