First, before I start my review, I read every review for 'The Muppet Movie' here and I can't believe anyone can give a negative review to a movie like this. (Fortunately, there was only one.) I mean, I can understand how someone might not like Star Wars because of the whole Sci-Fi genre, but not to be a movie that some of the loveliest puppets in the history of mankind. is almost sad. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm going to go out and review this movie. <br /> <br /> "The Muppet Movie" came out when I was seven. All my friends wanted to see it as their birthday movie, so I think I saw it in the theaters four times in the first month. <br /> <br /> As a child, many things have attracted me here and all the other Muppet movies and TV shows. The song was probably the most important. Most of the songs in 'The Muppet Movie' are classic. From "Rainbow Connection" to "I'm going to Somewhere to go there", they are entertaining and thoughtful. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I see 'The Muppet Movie' in very different ways. light. Yes, those things that make me excited are still there, but these are the little jokes and such that are just hilaries. <br /> <br /> I mean, if you think about it, Jim Henson is a sick man. <br /> <br /> Kermit is a frog and is in love with a sweet pig that carries purple gloves and carats you in two pieces. Fozzie is a standing comic bear. Gonzo is a "whatever" caught with chicks. Then you have two old guys who hate, a piano, a rock band with a maniac drummer, a Swedish chef you can't understand and a number of other characters that are just eccentric. <br /> <br /> Yet, for these reasons and more, Henson has entertained millions of children and adults, and gives us all something special to see and remember. <br /> <br /> "The Muppet Movie" will always remain in my heart for many reasons, but I think the biggest one is because it is a movie, unlike many recent children's movies, which I feel comfortable with. to have. kinderwag. Plus, I'm not bored with my thoughts with jokes being dipped to my children's level. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful movie that will surely be remembered forever.
