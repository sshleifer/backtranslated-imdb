[Contains SPOILERS !!!] <br /> <br /> Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a coil. They basically had nothing at all. All they did was to lie around and count the ceilings. Jon even organized his baseboard according to color and material. He needs a life. So he consulted a book on the subject telling him to meet a woman. A singles bar was a good place to start. Unfortunately, when the music started and Jon hit the dance floor, we saw what made disco: Jon killed it. Jon then tried to pick up girls at the video store. He finally felt in the mouth. Literally. The laundries were not a prize, even if Jon and his wish date had a look at each other's underwear. Jon tried to do everything on the beach, but soon he teased a real buffy, which made Jon feel in the mouth again. Literally. Jon then tried to find and jog girls. No benefit. Jon picks up a guitar and sings the blues. Unfortunately when he mentioned his cat was fat, a fat man walked and knocked Jon's guitar. It was hopeless. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Jon, an ad flashes on the TV: an ad for Lorenzo's School for the Personality Fright. It guaranteed a lifeless person to get a life in a few easy steps. Jon and Garfield attend the class. The building does not look exactly as it did on TV, and Lorenzo did not become as fiery as he did on TV. Jon is sitting next to a pretty girl named Mona. So while Lorenzo learned his lessons to introduce yourself, check your wrist, and pretend to speak a foreign language, Jon and Mona get to know each other. They go along, forget about Garfield. At home, Jon and Mona just sit on the stoep and talk. Garfield was jealous of Mona for fear of taking Jon away from him. Garfield suggested the future: Jon and Mona marry, she moves in, and soon she gives a little Arbuckle who stayed to pull Garfield's story. Back to the present, Garfield would not stand for it. He tried to get Jon to get rid of Mona, until she started scratching behind his ears. But then Jon learned that Mona is allergic to cats. So it was basically the end of their relationship. But they still saw each other now and then, and Garfield was probably with them. <br /> <br /> Another hilarious Garfield TV special! This one was made during TV's Garfield and Friends. Garfield was slightly cut off. Somewhat. Cartoons since the early 1980s. The scenes of Jon are trying to pick up chicks, is funny, so is the one where the fat man knocks on Jon's guitar. Good o 'Lorenzo Music is back as Garfield. Thom Huge is Jon. Frank Welker (the third man of 1000 votes) is Lorenzo. And June Foray (the 1000-voice woman) is Mona. If you like Garfield, I encourage you to see Garfield's life today! This, along with Garfield and Garfield in town, has just been released on DVD! So check them all out today! You are guaranteed a good time. Hey, did Garfield ever drop you? <br /> <br /> -
