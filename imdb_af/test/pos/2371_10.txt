If you loved the 1993 (erotic, sci-fiction) cyborg movie "Nemesis" then you will love this one. I loved it the moment the Elvis Pompadoured hero pulled out a samurai sword during a shooting. Like 'Nemesis', it takes place in a post-apocalyptic slum of the future. Both are police triggers, where the well armed hero must use good armed rebels to resolve a conspiracy by the forces against the undamaged masses. but that's where the agreements end. The ambiguous mayor who is dead or alive tries to keep the masses calm on the drugs he sells. The rebels who are helped by mercenaries and a cyborg, try to slow down his stubborn hold on his subjects. After several failed attempts to return the rebels, he sent his top police to kill the rebels. This movie follows the trail of most action adventure, but is not afraid to color out of line.
