I first saw this movie in the theater. I was 10. I just watched it a second time and I have to say it was wonderful. The music, the dance, the acting. This is a wonderful story and said very well. I absolutely fell in love with Williams when I was a kid after seeing him in this movie. One of my favorite parts was when his mother shouted at him to give her his pants, and then finally said, "How much do you need?" (Money). It was classic. ; ). <br /> <br /> Mom is the best. If you haven't seen this movie, as it came out, I'll say it again. It's timeless. It will do what all big movies do; make you laugh, cry and think.
