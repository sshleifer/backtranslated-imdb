There is no point comparing it to the original range. Although different in appearance and content, both are true to the original idea. This is an SF / horror anthology series. Due to indifferent scheduling in Australia, I have only managed to spread a small number of episodes over the first few seasons. The very first episode really gave me the creeps (nightmares at my age ...!), But some others fell flat; generally when the stories moved in horror races and away from SF. I just hope the DVDs will eventually reach us.
