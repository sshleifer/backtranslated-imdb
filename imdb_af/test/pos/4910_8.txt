Story about a widowed father (Claude Rains) who was serving his four daughters. Emma (Gale Page) is loved by great honky Ernest (Dick Foran). Thea (Lola Lane) is ranked by an old but wealthy man. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to become a singer. Ann (Priscilla Lane) is a romantic. Drop dead handsome Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), a business partner of their father, comes to stay with them. All the sisters fall in love with him. Then came the tough cynical Mickey (John Garfield) in the picture ... <br /> <br /> A lot of entertaining movie was a big hit and nominated for five academy awards. It is beautifully designed by Michael Curitz, has a fairly good (if predictable) writing and a very attractive roll (especially Lynn). It was also John Garfield's first film and made him a star. It was so popular there were three or four successors (which I have never seen before). It's an impressive, entertaining, big budget soap opera - it's worth seeing.
