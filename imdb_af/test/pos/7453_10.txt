Graphics: brilliant, of course. The most beautiful things were definitely NOT given in the trailers. Battle order moves very fast, but after watching some of them your eyes should be used to it and it won't look so confusing. Cloud has a wide variety of swords, and I want things to move a little slower, just so we could see them, because they were all incredibly detailed. Oh, and finally we get exactly how you equip Materia ... <br /> <br /> Music: Brilliant too. I was a little nervous about it, since (from what I saw) Nobuo is not the best way to write music to go with action (remember the Steal the Tiny Bronco series?), But it's brilliant and fits perfectly . I'm glad I pre-ordered the cheese. However, they changed the lyrics to One Winged Angel, so you won't be able to sing if you know the Carmina Burana lyrics. <br /> <br /> Plot: The first half of the movie sets things up and introduces everyone. In a fairly complex tapestry, but the second half is almost completely battle series, once all the players are in place. I won't call it a bad plot, but it is nowhere as far as the game's plot was. I think it's an attempt to prevent the game from being overshadowed, and I think it's a good thing ... the movie is its own entity, and shouldn't try to originalize the original in terms of pure plot. do not place. <Br /> <br /> I admit, I was hoping this movie would bring FF7 to a wider variety of people, but it's NOT a mainstream movie. I'm just gonna give it nine stars just because it doesn't even really try to explain something to newcomers. Marlene (I think it was Marlene, already sounded her) gives a little background at the beginning, but it's more of a refurbishment than an accident course. But then I realized, for me this movie is a 10/10, so why should I repel points just because other people probably won't like it ... if you played the game, or at least fit familiar with it, you should see this movie. But you don't need me to tell you that. If you are not familiar with it, go out and buy it, sit there for twenty hours and beat it and then watch the movie ... even if it is without any background, it is still beautiful. You just won't get the inside references ... which makes up 50% of the movie (that's all NOT a battle series).
