Very pleased to see that this excellent movie gets such high scores from IMDB users. The best years of their lives remain the best movie release about veterans who have come back from the war I came across. Easily the best show by the often overlooked Frederick March. In fact, the whole film shines, including music legend Hoagy Carmichael, who treats us all with a subtle version of his classic Lazy River. I would recommend this great movie to anyone who loves movies.
