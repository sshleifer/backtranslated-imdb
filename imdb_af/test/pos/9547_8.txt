What can happen in a dull Texan city in the summer? Well, a lot of teens find out a few things can and happen. <br /> <br /> It seems that the Mexican werewolf of this story is nothing less than el chupacabra, and the film, unlike the name, will not be a remake or watchful of the American Werewolf movies not, but something completely different. <br /> <br /> Overall, for a naturally low-budget movie, it's not bad! Some clever camera works, pretty decent looking for traditional creatures and grim effects, and for once not omniscient people who can do or do mistakes, like shooting a colleague, think it's the big bad animal and gets stunned by things they might not know. . <br /> <br /> Look at it and expect a million dollar production, and after a short while you will be sorry. Sit down and expect some entertainment and a relatively simple story, and that's pretty good! Overall, it gets an 8/10 of me to be creative, to act, and to dedicate good work to the budget that this movie had.
