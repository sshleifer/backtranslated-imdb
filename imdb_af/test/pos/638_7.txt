If you enjoy tension this movie has it. The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a dumb adds to her indifference and increases tension. Alec Guiness's appearance was nice, but didn't really add to the movie. I'm not sure if Evan Richard's role as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor, or if he just had to be a stupid idiot. I thought the cinematography was excellent. It not only added to the quality of the production, but also to the tension. The slow-motion bath with water droplets was wonderful. Also the scene where the knife came down and then switched to Andy Clarke who cut a scarce piece of meat was well done. I call it total good entertainment
