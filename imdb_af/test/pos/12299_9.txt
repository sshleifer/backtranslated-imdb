A rare exception to the rule that great literature makes disappointing films, John Huston's beautiful farewell to life and the movies, is almost entirely true to the story and spirit of James Joyce's short story, a gentle meditation on love, death and time expressed in the events of a Twelfth Night Party in the middle class Dublin around 1910. As the material might appear, the film succeeds in telling the story on its own, seemingly indiscriminate terms, rather than forcing a conventional theatrical form of plot points and dramatic incidents thereon. Only once did the wrong note hit, when old Miss Julia (a trained singer and music teacher whose voice was cracked by age, did not break) sings so badly that the audience erupted when I read it at the cinema seen. Luckily, the mood of quiet and gentle melancholy in many times is being restored for the moment of revelation between the couple Gabriel and Gretta Conroy in a hotel room when snow falls outside. It's a sad story, but the kind that makes you feel is not blue. Especially recommended as a date movie - for people in love who are not afraid to confront the sweetness and sadness of life.
