From the beginning I watched this show and I'm a 45 year old man. For me, it's so much more a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual but a family. It is centered on a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people who may be unusual but acting as a dysfunctional family. The show also throws the relationship between Lorelei and her parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore, old money DAR WASP people who do not approve of Lorelei's choices in life, although Lorelei doesn't mind. The relationship story and line is what makes this show, in my opinion the best on the WB network (soon the CW). Watch this show!
