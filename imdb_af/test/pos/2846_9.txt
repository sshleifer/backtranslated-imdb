I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone, including the young and the restless. "However, I think some of the profanity, violence and sexual insinuation in the movie are not suitable for all your children. "Anyway before the sand fills in the sand glass, let me tell you the name of the movie:" Nurse Betty. 'Ren√© Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance and thinks she is a true character of her favorite soap. As a result, she goes on a trip to Los Angeles to accompany her alleged soap opera character lover, Dr. Rubell, to reunite. To add fuel to the fire, she is also chased by the relentless "one life not to" live "who thinks she has stolen their drugs. You can say that is how nurse Betty uses her life all day long. This very `` general '' situation eventually leads her to the `hospital 'set of her beloved soap opera. The only problem, however, is that Betty thinks it's all really. It's as if her mind is in another world. 'Okay! Enough! I will wipe my mouth with soap and not name soap. I already registered my vote for Renee as best actress Oscar nominee. Also, Greg Kinnear's performance as dr. Rubell was as good as he got in his acting biography. To sum it up, my final diagnosis is that everybody needs to get in for "Nurse Betty." ***** Excellent
