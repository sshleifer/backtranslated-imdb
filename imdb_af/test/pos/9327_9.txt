No matter how you feel about Michael Jackson, you can't deny that this video is the most unique video of all time. There is no other video that is even close to "Thriller". The first time I saw it was when I was 6 years old and it scared me badly. Now I look at it with a smile, because I can now appreciate the miracle it is. I love this video and it will be around as long as music videos exist. I think everyone should sit down and watch it one day and look back and see how good it was, especially for 1983.
