Cool action - yes the point of departure was done - but not so - it's the trick. hey people - SHOCK - this is an X file. <br /> <br /> To me it's cool that Scully / Mulder has almost no scenes - they have to adapt, rely on each other's intrinsic sense of what really goes on - and each other's adaptation skills. They read in each other's movements and get the job .... (kind of). <br /> <br /> Oh yes yes --- really good acting - are these people paying to do so? Or a slow day when the convenience store doesn't call them in work. (hey - Duchovny - where are the day old donuts? Malcolm - go to school ...)
