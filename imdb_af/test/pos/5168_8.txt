The joy and tragedy of the Christmas season lies in the fact that it mostly revolves around the family. That is why some people call it "the children's holiday." As we get older, natural decay and progress removes the people and the things that have given us special memories. John Denver plays in one of his most beloved roles George Billings, a successful NYC architect and new widower who lost his wife about a year earlier. His life is focused on his 9-year-old daughter, Alex; both are still grieving their loss. George tries his best to make a special Christmas for his daughter. Give his boss, Thomas Renfield (played by the wonderful Col. Flag of M * A * S * H ​​man Edward Winters). He sends George to Georgetown, CO to investigate a possible property agreement. To lie to his daughter that the purpose of the trip is a holiday rather than work, George and Alex fly to the town, where they are immediately met by a collection of lovingly spacious but somewhat eccentric group of characters whose greatest eccentricity is that they all believe in Santa Claus. Georgetown is a picture book community where we all love to live and we want to love the people for neighbors. George soon met a love interest in Susan (Jane Kazmarek.) If it wasn't for the grinch (Renfield), it would be an ideal time. The fact is, he is in town to develop Renfield to develop, and there is a beautiful farm near the town to be excluded. The dark edges of the movie revolve around the impending negative and the reactions of the townies, the farmer, and the outsiders. I won't spoil the end for those who have never seen the movie. It is a typical happy Christmas, but is handled in a fairly subtle and credible way that shows the best in the human spirit, without being too stingy. All in all, this is a pleasant way to spend some of your Christmas hours. John Denver and Jane Kazmarek have good chemistry and Gennie James as Alex does a really nice job. I have always loved the work of Mary Wickes, a recognizable character actress, and all the other members of the group have a nice job with less meaty portions. It's a regular Christmas for my family; I rate it 4/5.
