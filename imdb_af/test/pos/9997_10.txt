Wow, here's another big ghfflfik. It's been at least three the past few years I've really enjoyed, it was well done, beautifully filmed and inspiring. The other two were "Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius" and "The Legend Of Bagger Vance." <br /> <br /> This is a true story, if ever there was one. Having an amateur defeat is all the professionals and winning the United States Open Golf tournament is an unprecedented achievement. I believe this is the only time in the 100 years it has ever been achieved. How much of this movie is fiction decorated for dramatic effect, I don't know. I know I'm planning to read the book, and I know that Francis Ouimet has a three-day lead in real life with just two holes, unlike what we've seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever. Francis Ouimet's victory over golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray are factual. This is a wonderful story and the filmmakers have done a wonderful job here. It's not just for golfers; it's a fun movie. Yes, many of these are just golf, but there are subplots like Ouimet's relationship with his father and with a beautiful young woman who is an excellent job. Of course, <br /> <br /> is interested in him. It is also a touch of someone who gives a small child a chance. The film also deals with Vardon's demons to get out of the way and try to make it into an elitist sport, which was then for both Europeans and Americans. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf is profitable like Ouimet like Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who don't know, Vardon was like the Tiger Woods of his day, perhaps even more unbeatable. In the film Vardon was portrayed as a warm, nice guy; a true person. The other big rival, Ray (Stephen Marcus) is shown as a bit of a brutal nasty man. <br /> <br /> The fourth main character of this golf story can be the coolest person in the movie: a fifth-grade boy who excites as Ouimet's caddy in the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the movie. <br /> <br /> If all of this - a playoff with the great underdog against two mighty benefits and up to the last hole - came true, you wouldn't think, "Oh, man, it's so hokey. Who can believe it? " It makes this true life story enjoyable to finally see on film. Like another sports movie of 2005 - "Cinderella Man" - here is another excellent movie that was unfairly ignored when it was awards. I think pretty movies don't win awards ... just the hearts of their viewers.
