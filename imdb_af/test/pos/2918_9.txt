I was interested in Akhenaton for many years. I was surprised to learn about E-bay about this movie and bought a copy on the DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the movie, the twists and turns in the plot and the file was mainly about the main character. Sinuhe makes it more of a "family saga" rather than an action movie. The costumes and attention to detail were remarkable for his time (1955). The rear projection during the car's ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and its monotheistic religion. In this film he was portrayed as "Jesus", as in his refusal to go to war with the Hittites, even because they invaded Egypt and in his closing speech on the futility of materiality and political power. Initially, one makes a connection between Sinuhe, who was thrown into the River Nile in a reed basket and Old Testament Moses. But this relationship is undoubtedly not worn. It will be fully explored in a new film in which a Moses character character portrays Akhenaten's monotheistic religion to the wider world, if such a film ever becomes politically possible. It is generally accepted that women are concerned that our men are stupid, but the relationship or lack of one between Sinuhe and Merit, the character Jean Simmons played, is difficult to accept. And that Sinuhe, a trained doctor, will be beaten by Nefer's Babylonian femme fatale to the extent she gave her adopted home and Tomb is not really credible, nor that his parents would even have a grave have not. In real life, Nefer (Nefertitti) was the wife of Akhenaton. And although Horemheb became Pharaoh, it was to some others, including Tutankhamen, who was the son of Ahhenathon. <br /> <br /> But of course it's just picking and the movie is great to watch and it's about Akhenaton and its monotheistic religion is a big bonus. Perhaps 'The De Vinci Code' book and film follow this film with the central secret that forms the basis of our current monotheism! I am waiting in great anticipation for such a movie, there are already many books on the subject.
