This is a brilliant, exuberant Czech movie from the Sverak father and son team. It's about two Czech pilots who flee to England to help the RAF in the Battle of Britain, but also fall over a woman (the beautiful Tara Fitzgerald). Features of some excellent and amazingly realistic airline scenes? probably the best ever and much better than Pearl Harbor or even the film Battle of Britain - and a number of interesting common themes such as love, war, romance, companionship, loss and servitude. Also, the trials and tribulations to move abroad and learn a foreign language (although made easier with the great stall black Anna Massey). <br /> <br /> The movie has shown some great little motifs such as the world-renowned RAF bullseye device, across the board and reflected at one point in the black vinyl record, turning around well (music is another theme of the movie, of course). Plus, all the traditional icons of English life: darkened beer glasses (as opposed to post-war straight glasses used in Pearl Harbor), tea in beautiful Chinese tea in an English country garden (though shot in Czech?) , The mascot dog, a vintage bottle of HP sauce, even a dartboard! <br /> <br /> Of course, the airport and surrounding countryside are ridiculous, unlike in southern England, although the virtuoso air ranks make up for Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters, always synonymous with the south of England and the Battle of Britain. But best of all is the sensational musical score of Ondrej Soukup, as good as anything by Hans Zimmer, but all in the tradition of late, excellent Ron Goodwin who achieved the original Battle of Britain movie among other classic English war films. There's even a nice little cameo role for the? apparently ?? well-known Czech musician and actor (and Kevin Kline lookalike) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays the title theme song, Dark Blue Sky, on the piano. Excellent! <br /> <br /> It has a few smacky but funny little Freudian devices, like always an inflated condom that floats through the ceiling when Karel (the calf but brilliant Crying Hadek) stuck to the airfield while she love rival and co-pilot Frantisek (Ondrej Vetchy) is at Susan. <br /> <br /> Another great English actor in this movie! Charles Dance is obviously good as Wing Commander Bentley. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended and worth watching / renting? Get the DVD with special features (things like how they created the dog fights and things). Probably the only movie ever to combine subtitles with characters who speak English, German, French and Czech all at once.
