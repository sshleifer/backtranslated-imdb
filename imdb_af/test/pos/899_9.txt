I think this movie has it all. It has really cool music that I can never get out of my head. It has nice characters. IS VERY funny (you know, the kind you will crack on the ground and you'll keep the funny parts for three days in three days). Despite the bad acting, bad cgi and bad story after a robot, it's really cool. One of those movies that you and your whole family can watch, get together, eat pizza, laugh, and watch it twice. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny parts, like when Kurt was trying to get Edison's attention and giving him his finger and then throwing a paintball gun on him so they can play paintball. On that part I said, "Remember, remember?" To my cousins ​​who saw it and showed them what had happened. There was also a very strange part when Edision entered the room and Kurt was there (just before they fought) and Kurt spoke about his "strange dream" and how he was "Superman". I loved that part, though it has been a while since I saw it, so I don't remember. Everything the actors said was funny, like how Kurt says, "I worship you like a GOD!" to the robot. <br /> <br /> Although there were bad things, it was a BIG movie anyway. Man, I can't stop laughing. I wish I had that movie. );
