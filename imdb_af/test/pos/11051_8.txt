For Greta Garbo's first talk picture, MGM chose wisely for Eugene O'Neill's Pultizer Prize, which played ANNA Christie in 1921. <br /> <br /> Also wise, producers supported Garbo with none, but two members of the original Broadway Cast (George Marion as Anna's father, Chris, and James T. Mack as Johnny the Priest - transferred to "Johnny the Harp" for movies not to be insulted). <br /> <br /> This little change is interesting. Like too many films being accused (by those who want MOVIES to be movies and ignore their origins) of "little more than filmed plays", the problem is not the play, but the filmmakers who are no longer true to the property would not be. By diluting a wonderful play, it will not offend or open anyone, because they can lose too much of the features that made the piece worth filming in the first place. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the respect the studio had for O'Neill and Garbo allowed ANNA Christie to survive the normally destructive process, especially in Frances Marion's generally sensitive screen adjustment. Wonder of wonders, Marion even allows the point of the scene where Garbo's Anna shows her past on the farm to the man she wants to marry and the father who sent her here in tact! What the leader of decency thought of it! <br /> <br /> The bronze game's biggest problem has always been that Chris's friend Marthy tends to walk away with the first action and then leave the last two so that Anna can take the stage - the two sides some of the really good women don't always recognize. <br /> <br /> The perfect Cast Marie Dressler (who also cut her teeth on the Broadway stage) before going to Hollywood is the perfect balance for Garbo's Anna in this area as well as the fast-moving movie only 90 minutes does not leave us too much time to miss her - one of the few benefits of the atmosphere is described rather than eloquently in the original. AND writer Marion is wise enough to get lost in order to bring Dressler back for a touch-scene two-thirds of the way through the movie that will remind much of Julie Laverne's second act in SHOW BOAT. <br /> <br /> Anna and Marthy's early stage screen (16 minutes in the film) takes each other's partner and puts all the tension of the rest of the story up, is one of the most influential scenes in the whole piece. Not to be missed. <br /> <br /> ANNA Christie is a great tragic play and a good movie drama. It's hard to imagine a last-day restoration, which will almost certainly lose the 1930s remake (it was filmed without sound for the first time in 1923 - also with George Marion's original Broadway Chris). <br /> <br /> The internal scenes were closest to the play, but foreigners should not be missed by anyone watching the atmosphere. While the background screen does not meet modern technical standards, the background gives a better look than most movies in the real-world era in which the screenplay is set (especially in New York). <br /> <br /> Almost all of the Garbo's naturalistic sound-era performances performed excellently (only the overly-patented CAMILLE death scene, 7 years later, will sometimes be snickers because of the heavily dedicated direction and parodies) but this ANNA Christie, along with the variety of her 1932 films, MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL, and the sublime Lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy, NINOTCHKA ("Garbo laughs!") surely stand her best. <br /> <br /> O 'Neill fans taken with this play alongside his promised "sea plays", must track down the fine World War II-shaped film released in the year before the USA entered the LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940). It is almost as proficient from these games, as this one is ANNA Christie, and has a young John Wayne in one of his rare non-Westerners who has a good role-playing role of veteran actors.
