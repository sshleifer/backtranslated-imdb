It is a brilliant series along the same lines of Simpsons. To a family as they go through life and problems, etc. Slightly less realistic than Simpsons, does anyone and baby and dog talk? Family Guy goes where Simons or Futurama dare not reach beyond the sick jokes and reach more racy gags. And believe me, it works! Almost all of the days hit the point and they will have you in stitches (especially the random, regular flashbacks!) When my brother first showed me I wasn't addicted, but after a few episodes I was addicted. You'll be 2/10 for a truly brilliant show. Tell Seth Macfarlane to bring this show to life. :)
