The essential message - which Miller would surely have wanted after seeing Vichy war trials - is that the hatred of someone without a rational basis is a waste of life. Meat Loaf's character, Fred, has known Lawrence for years, and when the time comes, he offers his fanatic supporters the opportunity to attack a man who is not part of their "target" group. For me, this is the important message - it doesn't matter what Lawrence and his wife do from this time - they are labeled and have the opportunity to save themselves by reason. Animal aggression and anger blinded Fred's Union thugs to reality. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine suggested that I should see "The Wave" how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without realizing it. I once played a role-play experiment and was shocked to see how normal and flat-minded people welcomed the creation of an oppressive police state - which they would end up threatening - because it came in stages. <Br /> <br /> Fred is the beginning, his LA friends and preacher idol is the catalyst that pushes its neighbors over the edge in violence without stopping to think what they are doing wrong. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Lawrence and Finkelstein is a fascinating Jewish shopkeeper, because Lawrence is almost missing the end. If the bigots force Finkelstein, where does he go? If his family fled the Nazis, what irony to be tormented in the land of "freedom" again. <br /> <br /> The great poster (it is a fairly well-known propaganda piece) about American families that is the highest standard of life in the world is a very important detail. If you watch this movie, look for the graffiti on the subway train, and all the little posters. The message is also here. <br /> <br /> This movie should be on every school curriculum, especially in our time when baseless hatred is so widely promoted by "reasonable" people who are just extremists in thin disguise.
