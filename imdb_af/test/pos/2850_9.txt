I was powerfully impressed with Betty's nurse all the way through. It has a large ensemble of characters, an original plot and an end I've seen, but hasn't drawn to your heartbeat. <br /> <br /> If there is one thing about this movie, the most me was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see that Rock is not going to do the big Hollywood festival like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is always the man. There really should be no more to criticize his work. Hell, kiss, the girls were watching him. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellwegger does the best she can with her role, and Kinnear is good at her possession. <br /> <br /> Sweet movie with a fun touch of gratuitous violence to satisfy the man's bloodlust. 9 outa 10 <br /> <br />
