LCDR Tom Dodge, despite a submarine reputation as an apostate and maverick (* Note to reader: Maverick doesn't mean "Tom Cruise." Maverick means "non-conformist".), Is actually an intelligence for the Fish Admiral of his submarine fleet. The Vice Admiral is worried about our old friends, the Russians are offering site sales with their old diesel fleet. Countries like Lithuania, North Korea or Iraq would like to get their hands on this baby and drop a nuclear weapon at Norfolk Harbor or Mayport, Florida. And this was 6-7 years before 9/11. <br /> <br /> The Admiral gives Dodge the command to take a moth-balled WWII diesel sub and an exercise against the surface fleet and the USS ORLANDO, a top of the line rapid attack sub. Dodge orders and in no time sweeps the bad news reports. I mean his lovely group of oddball submariners in warriors. Despite being "welcomed aboard" on his penis, he is a competent and just commander, he does not choose favorites and he delegates authority responsibly. The US Navy could not have acted with a finer piece of recruiting propaganda, than the cheaper crafted jewel of the creator of the Police Academy.
