Or vice versa. <br /> <br /> This is a French film noir directed by an American film maker (Jules Dassin). He had to leave the country because he was blacklisted by Hollywood, thanks to HUAC. The premise of the story is quite familiar - a last jewel for Tony le Stephanois and his buds - and so is the end with everyone to get. Well, no spoilers here, because that's the kind of movie in which tension to the end is important. <br /> <br /> Dassin is filmed in realistic black and white relief on the streets of Paris by actresses and actresses who are not glamorous. The impressive - sometimes intrusive - score by Georges Auric improves the film and will remind many viewers of a similar score of American films from the forties and early fifties. Jean Servais plays the hardcore, consuming lead in a fedora, as Humphrey Bogart might have played. Tony is out of jail, past his head, but still hard and decisive when he needs to be, his mind is still sharp when focused, the kind of anti-hero whose eyes are watering, though tears will never fall. <br /> <Dassin plays the Italian safecracker and wants to be a ladies man who knows the rules, but becomes indifferent. <br /> <br /> In film noir we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify with the bad guys. Often there are levels of bad guys, the "good" bad guys with whom we identify and the bad bad guys that are going to do in our good bad guys, and then there might be a very bad, bad bad guy or two. (Here we have Remi Grutter, played by Robert Hossein, a slightly sadistic druggie.) Then there's the police who are irrelevant or almost so. In more modern film noir, the bad guys aren't even "good" bad guys, and they get away or close. In the old film noir, which originated from the gangster movies of the thirties, the usual motto, according to the old Hollywood code, was "Pay Crime". Every criminal must pay for his or her crime. end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Probably, the most impressive feature of Rififi is how beautiful the film is. The plot unfolds quickly and seamlessly the way the great film directors have always done it, directors like Stanley Kubrick, Louis Malle, and the best Hitchcock. Some actually compared it to Kubrick's The Killing (1956) and suggested that Kubrick stole a bit. Well, directors always steal as needed, and there are some who might say similarities, as it is a final protagonist, and the girl picked up the works. The similarities can go deeper, because when this film approaches, I suddenly thought, oh no! The suitcase in the back seat goes out of the convertible, flies open the ground, bursts open and all the money goes into the air! Those who have seen the murder can remember what happened to the money near the end of the movie! What reminds me of another movie with something bad happening to the money: Oliver Stone's U Turn (1997) with Sean Penn. There the money in his backpack is blown by a shotgun explosion. Ha, ha, ha! To get the print version of this movie is an act of holiness since the dialogue (when there are a few: the self is completely without dialogue, about 30 minutes worth it). It is slim and easy to follow. It only requires a look at the captions, which are incidentally quite utilitarian and guideline, as opposed to spelling out every word. <br /> <br /> Another thing: all the brutality is done like sex done in film, that's off camera. A man gets his throat slit. We don't see it. I like this approach. We don't have to see the gore. You can almost show your kids Rififi. <br /> <br /> Catch this one now and watch for a Hollywood replay with Al Pacino and directed by Harold Becker coming out next year where you can be. make sure that the violent scenes are fully played out.
