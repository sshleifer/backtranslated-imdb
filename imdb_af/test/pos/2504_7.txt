Apart from the fact that this movie is mostly filmed in Rockport MA, which is a beautiful town where my mom once rented a small shop front and I donated many kids as nice summer, it's fun and cute movie. <br /> <br /> I have no desire to actually see this movie, although I have a weakness for romantic comedies (I don't know why). The trailers I saw were not attractive, the casting didn't look as interesting and I had no idea what the plot would be. In the end, I found it to be an interesting meditation on relationships and family. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and must admit that I thought this movie was one of the most exaggerated gems of last year. I am disappointed that so few people enjoyed the "humanity" that this movie offered the viewer. <br /> <br /> I have read many bad reviews of this movie and must recognize a certain level of shock to the cynicism that is occurring in them. As a graduate student, I consider myself to be rather cynical, but it was a beautiful little movie that earned much better than it did.
