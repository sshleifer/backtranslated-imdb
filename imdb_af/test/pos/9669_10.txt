Ignore the comments for mine. The show is comic genius, the most underrated show ever. 3 reasons why. Reason 1, the flashbacks are hilarious, caring if they have absolutely nothing to do with the story, they make me laugh so loudly, it hurts and isn't it the idea of ​​a good comedy program? People who think it's not funny have no sense of humor. Who cares if they are random, that is, e.g. show, you can do whatever you like and people say it's not realistic, not a cartoon, it's animated. Reason 2, The jokes are just hilarious, Seth McFarlane and the other authors are soooooooooooo funny. All of the Star Wars references make fun of celebrities, I love them all. And Reason 3, the story lines are just brilliant and funny, they put up all the jokes with their crazy nature and wackiness, just getting harder. <br /> <br /> I caught this one late night on BBC2 and I have never come back, I have 7 seasons, plus the kind of movie (Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story), I have several t-shirts , posters and my collection are still growing. I've never gotten a collection of any TV show, but it was so funny that I just had to get everything. <br /> <br /> Just look for Season 3 and trust me that you will be hooked to life, the funniest show ever created and I hope it never ends!
