This wonderful short will at anyone who specifically asked for a child because it was hip or cool, just come home to give something that would mark you with your friends for life and by your mother or father (or both) that did not matter, as you seriously considered entering a Witness protection program to avoid ridicule. For American residents who don't get the horror because you don't follow hockey, it's like a Dallas Cowboy fan who gets a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan to get a Red Sox jersey. It's not pretty. For our European friends, think of two big competitive soccer (soccer for us) clubs and think of a fan of one to get a jersey from the other. Ouch !!! NFB from C left themselves here! <br /> <br /> A homage to you Maurice "Rocket" Richard, Merci, M. Richard.
