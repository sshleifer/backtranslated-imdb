I love meatballs! Great characters and gripping situations make this one very much love. Bill Murray is hysterical and you need to love the 4-mile route at the end! A total classic and one of my favorites now for about 20 years. It brings back good memories of the camp and deals well with the experience of being rejected by foolish counterparts and empowering one by saving a sympathetic adult. Many large one-liners and quite a variety of wacko counselors. This is the kind of movie where you later repeat key phrases among friends. Also nothing overly rough and what a lovely late 70's soundtrack to bring on just the right amount of nostalgia. I can't say enough about meatballs; it is a classic. Be warned! All the sequels are blunt clashes that just bought the marketing rights. They have no connection with Ivan Reitman's masterpiece.
