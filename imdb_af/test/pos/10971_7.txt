It was really a pleasure to see; The dialogue was for the most part outstanding (I thought the women's roles were a little better written, which is a good surprise). The performances were also very good. Frank Gorshin overdo it a little when he goes into his various disadvantages, but it can be his overpaid for what I see as weaknesses in how the character is written; He is very different. Harry Groener also does well with a slightly underwritten character (Tony), slightly overshooting some of the character's angrier scenes. Ursula Burton is excellent as sister Theresa, who really wears the film through some of his weaknesses. Seymour Cassel and Louise Fletcher are a bit underutilized here, but I kept their work as always. Shirley Jones, Wendie Malick, Jill Eikenberry and Faye Grant are also very good (I couldn't help but think Grant gave me a bit of Catherine O'Hara here); Cloris Leachman rather vibrates in her role, with fairly good results. <br /> <br /> However, I wish there was still a safe hand behind the camera. Sometimes the framework or staging was a little off, or uncomfortable. The closeups were too much use for me (or unlawful use). And we don't always go from the scene to the scene as smoothly as we want. Some of the "difficult man" approach to the federal agent (music, costumes) was also over me. And the few fantasy rows didn't really work. But there are things that have been done very well; the opening order, which took place around Buffalo in 1970, for example. And frankly, all the scenes related to Theresa's church work (I suspect the writer and actress enjoyed the character very much, which helps). The screens between Malick and Eikenberry are very good. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably a little exaggerated. There seem to be a few too many schemes going on right away to keep them all straight, and the coincidences should be a little too much. And I was a bit bothered by the end (should we really still have to root for their biggest game yet?), But the ride on the way is very enjoyable. It would be nice to see more independent movies like this one. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
