After watching Desperate Living, I was stuck to John Waters movies. I heard of Pink Flamingos and had to see it and the boy was worth it! Believe what you hear, it's trash! It's full of everything dirty that is actually the main plot of this movie. It contains the following: Incest, cannibalism, rape, chicken harvester, nudity (as you have never seen - beware of baby's birthday party entertainers), poetry, arson, trailer, perversion, transexuality, oatmeal, crossbreed ... ... you get the picture. Above all, this is a definite must! Beware of the birthday party entertainer and divine wonder around the park!
