I haven't seen Hardware Wars for years, but I remember it as one of the hilarious events of human experience, and it was far too soon. Every aspect of this movie was hilarious, and it was even better than "Star Wars." I laughed. I cried. After looking at it, I asked a relative for a moment with three dollars, just so I could kiss it goodbye (I'm joking about the last one). I love it if Ham Salad's sidekick / co-pilot tries to eat Princess Anne Droid's cinnamon rolls, and the Darph Nader character is just hilaries! This movie will be great to look back with 'Thumb Wars', and I sincerely hope there could be a "Hardware Wars, Episode II: The Umpire Strikes Out". (Was there?)
