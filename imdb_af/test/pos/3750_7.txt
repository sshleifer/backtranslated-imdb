I remember this film of old. It's a fantastic, cold, atmospheric horrible picture about a man moving in a Scottish castle, just to discover that there are strangers in the corridors at night. And there are even stranger events happening in Hollywood's best-known fence maze. Yes, it's the maze you've seen in every movie that ever had a topier puzzle, up to "The Shining." But the punchline for this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly didn't see it. This is a good example of how good and convincing a movie can be, even when the point of departure is completely in the mood. I would recommend it to anyone.
