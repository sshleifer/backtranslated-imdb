Shame on Fox for dropping this movie. It was a total riot and I just hope it will find a second life on DVD and cable. <br /> <br /> It's a hilarious satire. It takes the "What if" situation to an extreme and it does not pull (or kick to the groin). It makes you think ... which becomes of this empire as soon as we become completely lazy and stupid? Everyone gets a hit in this one, especially. a number of big companies, and even Fox News takes a punch (which is probably why the movie never had a proper release - except the marketing department thinking about the campaign and not knowing how to market it) so we just will give up! ") Some may find the movie sophomoric, due to the liesskop, and farting, but the movie is much more than that. You also don't get what Mike Judge says or you do. Most of the negative reviews I've read come from people who don't get it or are snobs. <br /> <br /> It will probably play in the selected markets for one week, so if you miss It keeps the DVD in mind, it will be worth the rent and I will eventually have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> Good Job Mike Judge, it's a pity you're screwed, but you've made me laugh out loud and I'm looking forward to the next movie you do.
