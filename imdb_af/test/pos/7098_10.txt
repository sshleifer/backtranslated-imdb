Despite all the comparisons to House of Frankenstein, this movie expires its predecessor and is one of the funniest monster movies in the Universal Monsters series, and unfortunately the last. Okay, so it's not exactly like the Frankenstein Bride like one of the classics celebrated by fans of all movies, but with a cast of Dracula, The Wolf Man and Frankenstein's monster (What? No Mummy?), you can help but enjoy this lock! And unlike House of Frankenstein, the monsters in this movie vary a lot more. But this movie also offers some unique story lines for both Dracula and the Wolf Man who both went to Dr. Adleman goes for the hardening of their afflictions. While the Wolf actually finds a cure, dracula injects his blood into the doctor and then the real fun starts! I recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies. But remember, I never said it was good, just fun.
