I thought I saw every ripple that the crime / gangster movie had to offer, but the combination of Garrett-Marcin-Hammett made some excitement and surprises, thanks to the ingenious direction of Mamoulian, the atmospheric photography by Lee Garmes, plus remarkable sharp movie editing and flawless special effects. Brilliant acting also helps. Coop gives one of his most convincing performances as the reticent hay-seed-turned-fearless bootman (the kind of character progression he had to repeat in other roles like Sergeant York). Miss Sidney (photo center) in her first big role is also an eye-opening. The principals get great support from Paul Lukas, Wynne Gibson and Stanley Fields as the hardships, and even from Robert Homans detective detective. Of course, the film is realized on a comprehensive budget that is brilliantly deployed in its realistic, multitude-filled sets.
