Danny Boyle was not the first person to realize that zombies can run like the crackers. The honor belongs to Life Force, who of course runs the biggest naked space vampire zombies from Halley's Comet amok in London's end-of-the-world movie ever made. Tobe Hooper may have made a lot of shit, but for this deliriously demented epic sci-fi horror, he deserves a place among the immortal. Plus, it offers space vampire Mathilda May, the best thing to come from France since Simone Simon, who spends the entire movie naked. What she does very well. Just keep in mind that while she is the most overwhelming female presence anyone has ever experienced on Earth, she is also "totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous." This is a scene meeting I would like to put: British space program astronauts find three naked humanoid alien life forms hidden within a huge 150km long artichoke / umbrella-shaped spacecraft hidden in the tail of Halley's Comet full of giant dried-out bats and bringing them back to Earth with close apocalyptic results as they continue to drain the people of London from their life force amidst many nakedness, spitting thunderclouds and spitting your coffee over the room direlogue ("I was in the space, and she looks perfect to me. "" Suppose we don't know anything about the matter. "" Don't worry, a mere woman won't come out of this complex. "" Oh, and we will The writers of Alien and Blue Thunder get to write it with unredited rewrite by the author of Mark of the Devil, The Sex Thief and Eskimo Nell and the director of The Jonestown Monster. Sounds like a winner, here is $ 22m?have fun. And they do it. <br /> <br /> True, there is enough promise in the raw material to make something really creepy and thought provoking (at a time when AIDS hysteria approaches its height, a sexually transmitted "plague" offers enough opportunity for allegory ), but in the hands of Go-Go boys at Cannon, who could still have been a Quatermass and the Pit soon changed to be more. Plan 10 From outer space. It's frightening, whether it's Frank Finlay's hilarious death rate, "Peter Firth's great entrance (" I'm Colonel Caine. "" From the SAS? "A room full of reporters:" Sir, the last comment was not for It is a D-Notice situation, "he replies to the surprisingly compulsory press people. The security guards offer Mathilda May's naked space vampire a nice cookie to escape her, sanitized bodies that cover people, the sweetie Prime Minister who sucks life from his secretary and fills London with zombie nuns, stockbrokers and joggers, as the city gets its most comprehensive on screen pledge, as Gorgo junior lost at Battersea Funfair and went on disaster. call the "This woman is a masochis! An extreme masochis! "Scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the male vampire's" It'll be far less scary if you just come to me "while a main player who takes Peter Firth's best Action Man voice to replied, "I'll just do that!" In one scene alone, you own Patrick Stewart who embodies the woman in the deep confused astronaut's thoughts, Steve, "I-never-play-Charlie-Manson" Railsback and his incredibly dancing eyebrows in full on 'Helta-Skelta!' fashion trying to resist the temptation to kiss him, the unashamed Aubrey Morris (the only man that looks like Freddie Jones) in home secretary Sir Percy Heseltine as a kind of dementia Brian Rix, Peter Firth (one of the actors who always looks like he was a doctor who didn't watch anyone at that time, hammered the blaze public school macho in the hope that nobody would ever do not see and the eternal reaction shots of John Hallam as manl ike nurse who keeps opening the mid-psychic tornado to bring in more drugs. As if they needed more in this movie. It's just a pity that Frank Finlay's mad scientist who is not qualified to certify death on strange life forms (a role originally intended for Klaus Kinski) missed out on the action in that one. <br /> <br /> No matter how crazy you think the movie is, whether it's a zombie pathologist ("He must also feed"), exploding everywhere in the home's secretary's suit, Patrick Stewart blood and intestines form a naked Mathilda May or space vampires turn St Paul's Cathedral into the world's largest laser show to transport human souls from the London underground to their geostationary mothership. I loved every glorious crazy moment. In its own unique way, it can be the biggest movie ever made. <br /> <br /> The DVD offers the original 116-minute version opened in the United Kingdom, rather than the heavily edited 101-minute US version, which not only pays tribute to your dollar, but restores also the painting of Henry Mancini to its original glory. The American version covered many gaps with additional clues by Michael Kamen and James Guthrie. Although a somewhat surprising first-sight choice, Mancini has cut his teeth on many of the classic universal sci-fi horrors of the fifties and his score is pretty great, with a tremendous capital letter that offers a rare reminder of how interesting he can be away from Blake Edwards. Unfortunately, there is no more than a trailer by way of extras, although it would be nice to hope to have a special edition with some of the scrapped scenes of Hooper's originally envisaged 128-minute track. From what appears on the screen, it may just offer. even more comedy gold!
