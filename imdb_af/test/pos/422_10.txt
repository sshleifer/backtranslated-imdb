Well, so this series kind of takes the route of "here we go again!" Week in, week from David Morse's character helps his ride a bit of a pickle - but what's wrong with that? David Morse is one of the greatest character players there, and definitely the coolest, and to have him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven! <br /> <br /> Because of the lack of love for this show by many, I can't see it going to a season series - but you never know? The amount of garbage it made is passing me by. Let's hope that something can do well, beyond a first series!
