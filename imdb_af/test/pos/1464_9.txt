The first episode of 'Man to Man with Dean Learner' that just broadcast was at least at stake with most episodes of 'Garth Marenghi's Darkplace' and had me at My Maisonette. Hope this is the good job of faux terribles on my TV. Richard Ayoade is one of the best in the new breed of "alternative comedy" (I hate this phrase, but I'm too lazy to think of another.) Comedians on TV today. I'm delighted that on a trip from local DVD retailers today, "Garth Marenghi's Darkplace" was sold out over the board. Even from his short time in Nathan Barley, I knew that Ayoade was a serious talent and I'm sure he would have been great as Dixon Bainbridge in 'The Mighty Boosh' for continued success! In the course of these programs, I also felt it was necessary to expand my review to ensure a place on this public domain.
