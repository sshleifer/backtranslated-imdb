After working on 7 films with director Mickael Curtiz (The Adventures of Robin Hood is their best achievement), Errol Flynn became tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great Raoul Walsh. This reunification is a happy thing for cinematography. THE DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON is their first and best movie together. Raoul Walsh depicts General George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn) from his debut at West Point, after the Civil War and eventually in the battle of Little Big Horn. It's true that the movie shows a too-lucky portrait of Custer, but that's not important. What is important is the fact that we are transported with the passion and glory carried by the characters. Who can forget California Joe, the great "Queen's Own Buttler" with his song "Garryowen", the touch of Mrs. Custer (Olivia de Havilland), the diabolic sharp stuff Arthur Kennedy played? <br /> <br /> An eternal battle continues over this epic and tragic fresco.
