It is an epic film about the unification of the ancient kingdoms of China in the third century BC. What makes this interesting is the tragic ruin of the king and all the palace intrigues around him. It reminds me a bit of King Lear and some of the other Shakespeare plays. <br /> <br /> The king begins with noble ambitions, uniting the kingdoms under one ruler and stopping all the strife so that people can prosper and lead better lives. He and his youthful darling, played beautifully by Li Gong, a scheme in which she pretended to be in exile in a competitive kingdom, to recruit an assassin to kill the king. It gives him an excuse to go to war. But while she's gone, the king becomes sadistic in his lust for strength and goes on a deadly spree. <br /> <br /> There are numerous sideways that keep the action. There are the Marquis, who pretend to be stupid and fleeting, but who is really very smart and wants to become king himself. He honored two children with the king's mother and management for years to keep secret. Then there is the Prime Minister, a political competitor to the king, who seems to be really his father. <br /> <br /> The killer is itself a complex character. An advanced swordsman and killer, he undergoes a reform when the king's lover comes to recruit him. He doesn't want to kill anything anymore, but is eventually won by Li Gong (who wouldn't be?) If he saw how cruel and evil the king became. <br /> <br /> A spectacular cinematography, especially the large-scale battle scenes - as they said earlier, a thousandfold. The acting is OK, nothing special. That's the story that's interesting, but in two and a half hours it pushes the limit. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching.
