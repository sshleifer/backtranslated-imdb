pretty good, don't expect anything high culture ....... the acting is bad, the storyline fails, but it's still a pretty nice movie to watch. why? because it's dark, a little silly, like unpredictable and just entertaining and fun to watch. Don't expect anything, as I have said, it only looks to you and you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> It's a movie without a plot or memorable play, but there are plenty of scenes that will make you laugh, cry or at least feel obliged to watch it ... < br /> <br /> That's all I wanted to say .... <br /> <br /> 7/10
