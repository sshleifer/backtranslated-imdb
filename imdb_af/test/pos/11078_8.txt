This anime tells the story of the Battle of Mamodo King. Every 1000 years, 100 Mamado children are sent to Earth to fight to determine who will be their next king (in the original Japanese, the creatures are Mamono, which literally means magic / evil object). Each Mamado is linked to a Human Partner and has given a magic wand. Man can use this book to escape incredible powers in the Mamodo, and when a Mamodo is defeated, their game book is flushed in flames. (Alternatively, a Mamdodo's book can be captured and burned directly). Then comes the Mamodo back to the Mamodo world. <br /> <br /> The titular character is Zatch (Gash in Japan), a 6-year-old mamodo with electric powers. He is accompanied by Kiyomaru Takamini, and 14-year-old genius. Satch is initially reluctant to fight, but to learn that some Mamodo are angry and the battle for the king is wrong, he decided to fight to become a "friendly king." <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell made a comparison with Pok√©mon. , but a better comparison is Digimon. Like Digimon, the Mamodo and Human have one to one, symbiotic relationship. Also, unlike Pokemon, both shows have a real plot. <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell has character growth and evolving relationships, and some fairly mature story lines (such as love against racism, slavery, mind control, etc.). It even has some decent plot twists and mysteries.
