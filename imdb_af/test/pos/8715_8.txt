Most of the Brigitte Bardot movies I saw have failed to take full advantage of her fascinating screen presence. Unfortunately, his little roles were really good in movies of unmistakable quality, which was a true watch. She earned them and could show her full movie power when they got away. As Genevieve in "Love on a Pillow" we had a clear exception to the trend of light, soft vehicles, as it was an interesting, artistic film with any reasonable measure, and in it was a 28-year-old BB at her. most enticing. "Une Parisienne" is another, with an extremely captivating Brigitte in an interesting, well-crafted comedy exploring how an ambitious lady's husband can be convinced to stay true to an incredibly beautiful young woman. There are several good performances here. Her playboy husband, Michel, is one, "the prince", played by Charles Boyer, another, with entertaining efforts through a good supporting role. What Brigitte Bardot is about is the way she looks in this movie, the way I remember her as a child in the fifties. She was 23 in 1957 and before her time, nicer than any other actress of the period, including Marilyn Monroe. Her winding, cocky sexuality, which is almost displayed in various bosom dress, skintight dresses, just jumps off the screen. She was more hip and cute than America's women today, almost fifty years later. Obedient to their careers and still desperate to feminist politics, they come down like a bunch of uncivilized lesbians. In contrast, the sex cat was sexually liberated, intelligent and clearly independent long before it was fashionable. Yet she fully understood the power of her extraordinary femininity, and used it for a higher purpose than just self-interest. She believed to love. A quiet photo simply can't do her right. You had to easily cross her sleek but unceasing shape (with her 20-inch waist). You had to see that wild blonde man, look in her big, brown, seductive eyes, and listen as her full, pouting lips speak French. In a close-up at the end of this movie she flashes and flirts with the camera, flashing her beautiful bulbs. What a baby! For fans of Brigitte Bardot, "Une Parisienne" may not be missed.
