In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is hunting, and Daffy is trying to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has its own agenda. In addition, Rabbit Seasoning makes an interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it can only make your croaking and royal fairy tales.) <br /> <br /> I think it's probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon the Bugs Beard and Daffy. One of them seems to have been for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did. All in all, it just goes to show what geniuses the people were behind these cartoons.
