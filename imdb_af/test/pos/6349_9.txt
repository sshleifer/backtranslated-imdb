It is a seemingly simple story of a gifted pupil, Yiu Kwok, who later becomes a teacher of classical Chinese poetry. He is married to two boys, and things look normal at home. He still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage, and his sons are proud of him (the parent) and disappointment (the younger). <br /> <br /> His passion for poetry makes him a forerunner to a senior student in one of his classes. The student, Choi Lam, records photos of him during class, significantly, one of him with a flower coming from his mouth. She plagues him more with her intelligence than her sexuality, although it is also an element. Of course, he is not immune to her attention, although he tries to keep the demarcation between teacher and student in place for a while. <br /> <br /> The reason why he eventually didn't succeed is complicated. First, there is a real depth of communication between him and Choi Lam. It becomes clear that she really likes him and it is mutually beneficial. Secondly, there is a long problem in his marriage that is revealed when an old friend of his and his wife becomes ill. The consequences of the woman's involvement with this friend, both past and present, are almost too sad to bear. <br /> <br /> Nothing is trivial about this movie. All the characters have a lively internal life, and an easily recognizable history. The two leads, Jacky Cheung and Anita Mui, are outstanding, just as Karena Lam as student Choi Lam, and Shaun Tam as the oldest son on Yin. <br /> <br /> Recommended without reservation.
