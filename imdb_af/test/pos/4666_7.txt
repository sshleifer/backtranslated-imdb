* WASTE WARNING !! PLEASE READ PLEASE IF YOU DON'T USE THE FILM! * <br /> <br /> I was originally planning to see this weekend this weekend, but my plans eventually didn't allow me to see it. So my friend and I made plans to see it today after school. Son, we're glad we did. The movie starts in Italy, with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as "Napster" [Seth Green, you'll be nicknamed later], Handsome Rob [Jason Statham], Left Ear [Mos Deaf], and John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) are planning a hoist to steal 32 golden bricks. This leads to the entire opening, which is a good 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a boat hunt, which opens the film upright. As they drive away in hiding, Steve Frezelli turns the group on, steals the gold and kills John Bridger, who is actually the (retiring) leader of the group. Quickly after a year later, when Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is one of the best safe crackers anyone can ask. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for her father's death, as he phoned him from the pension for the lift) said they found Steve (who had fallen down) and wanted to come back to him for what he did . She initially refused, but later agreed, and the team girls came together, with the help of Sniper (Franky G), a mechanic, to carry out the perfect elevator, while one of the biggest traffic jams in the Los Angeles history is created. This movie is a perfect blend of action with funny pieces thrown in through. There's a persistent joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, to create Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while he fell asleep. Lyle will finally only answer as "Napster". There is even a funny line in Seth's movie, which goes. "He said in an interview that he called it Napster because he described his hair as it was a cloth. He calved it because I was sober when he stole it! The beginning and end rows are pure genius, And everything in between fits perfectly in. The only negative thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton's play was a little weak, he wasn't a big, difficult bad guy, he acted like he was paid and only the bare minimum (which is a fact, as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation), but even if the problem is the only real invasion of the movie, the movie is still very enjoyable, and I Definitely recommend it, and even if you are not interested in the real movie, watch Seth Green shine in the comic role, he is perfect. Rating: **** from *****
