A story of a young boy, Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) with AIDS who is having a rough and tumble boy (played by Brad Renfro) his exact opposite, The Cure is sad, as a little to soap, pulls your emotions " message "film with his heart in the right place.

It is a myth of warmth and I hate nit-pick, but I have strayed the plot in a melodramatic, predictable sense and the proceedings have a glow over them just like movies can do.
