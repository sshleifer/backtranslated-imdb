I caught "On the Run" at the Screening Room in New York and was immediately seduced by its true independent spirit. Throwing Starring Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia from The Sopranos, "On the Run" sets us up in a 24-hour game drive in the city that never sleeps. We follow the meanderings of an introspective sales agent who suddenly gets through his long-haired, just out of jail. In fact, he escaped from it and is "in progress" in search of action and a look at life amidst the great metropolis. Powered by great performances, this movie gives us the old feelings of 70's photos, with both characters rediscovering themselves as they blow over the town, bumping into wild events and locals. An elegance on a certain side of New York that seems to be disappearing, "On the Run" shows good sensitivity and humor. I predict it is a cult classic that insists on being discovered: future viewers should definitely surrender to this nightly journey.
