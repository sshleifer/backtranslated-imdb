Despite a stupid appearance, ridiculous plot devices and a low budget, Tourist Trap <br /> is striking. An inventive, well-played movie, a must see. You must throw rationality out of the window to fully appreciate what the director is trying to do. If you do, you'll be a pleasant surprise. Also note that this is one of the few semi-classic horror movies that have not been spoiled by many successors.
