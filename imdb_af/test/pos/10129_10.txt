Radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt, in his heart, was the right thing to do. The viewer will be forced to wonder what he or she did. The adversity Jones and Radio's coach both faced were both tragic and predictable. People didn't understand; they also didn't want to understand. But in the end, the power of circumstances forced people to understand and appreciate as much as they did before it happened. Radio is a spiritually challenging youth who understands very little except three of the most important things, it is too often forgotten as we mature: intuition, compassion and love. Coach Jones is a high school teacher who cannot ignore the plight of the undercover who are just trying to play a bad ticket in the best way he knows. It was sad as Jones and Radio met. The practical joke that frightened Radio was enough to make you punish, not just the boys involved, but every boy who knew what was going on and didn't do anything about it. On the positive side of the scale, however, the incident led to a friendship that would affect so many lives of that kind that most of us just happen to be in the movies. This movie is a real fairy tale and should not be missed. Ed Harris was his usual brilliance. Gooding was flawless. Radio is an inspiration.
