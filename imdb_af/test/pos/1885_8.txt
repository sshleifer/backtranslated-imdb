Oh, classic comedy. At the point in the movie where the brain touches each other, a two-minute scene with Bruce Campbell has partially himself, reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and pack you into a whole movie. <br /> <br /> For years and years Bruce Campbell knows what kind of movies we want from him. We want to see strange movies like Bubba Ho Tep. We want to see komo roles in Sam Raimi movies, and we want to see 'Man with the screaming brain'. With the title alone, one knows that it is the completely silly kind of movie like Army of Darkness, just with more stupid and fewer monsters. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is simple. Bruce sees doctor. Doctor has a new idea. Bruce gets bad things on his way to see a doctor. Coincidentally, this is the thing the doctor wanted to show him who saved him. Hilary follows. <br /> <br /> With the addition of Ted Raimi as a strange Russian man, and travel companion Stacy Keach as Dr Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov, it is funny, it makes this movie. Perfectly funny. Never a point of scary. <br /> <br /> If you like the stupid Bruce Campbell, you'll like it. Then again, why would you see it if you didn't like Bruce Campbell?
