When I first heard that this movie would be made, I was very excited to see it. The idea of ​​making a movie of this caliber, as good as it was, had to be very difficult. I wasn't really sure anyone could include all of the pope's incredible features in a movie, but the movie did its memory justice. In my opinion, the most important task was to reveal to the people who started the pope. Until his days in Poland, until his last days in the Vatican, this movie followed every aspect of his life. Thomas Kretschmann, the man who played the Pope in his adult life and up, did a very good job of conveying the emotion. Overall, this movie was educational, but also very entertaining.
