In spite of myself, I really love this movie. Pauley Shore is always extremely funny, and here is no exception. He is just excellent at playing the weirdo with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> His performance in this, though nothing extraordinary for him, is so good, other actors appear to be picking up. Maybe it's because he's the kind of guy it's easy to bounce. <br /> <br /> The clich√©s about rural life in this movie are hilarious and the way Shore's "city boy" is is Crawl so contrary to the way of life is also funny, but it's not just him what a fish is out of the water; Comedy also comes from the fact that it is a wonderful nightmare of a person for any "ordinary" person or people. That's why this movie works in such a good way: we love Crawl, it's a fresh air, but we can also sympathize with the Warners. He is one hell of a culture shock. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is the classic Pauley Shore, there is no need for a big brain power to enjoy the movie, enjoy what you do, and even a "never judge a book by it's cover here somewhere moral here. Not bad, not bad at all.
