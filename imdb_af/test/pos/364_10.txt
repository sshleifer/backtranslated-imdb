This is another of Hitchcock's top rated movies and legally so. It is a story of two men meeting on a train and playing murder fantasies. One of them (Robert Walker) takes it seriously and it leads Guy Haines (Farley Granger) to wrestle with the law. Another fast-paced Hitchcock movie with very big scenes (the carousel scene and the tennis match is worth mentioning). Not a movie to be missed - it is a pity that no one will release it on DVD again with many extras. Just a cheap Warner Brothers DVD is already there.
