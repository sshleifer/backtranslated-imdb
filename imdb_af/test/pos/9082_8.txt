Although Flatliners are 15 years old, I was the first to see it tonight. I heard about the movie Flatliners, but there was never a buzz left to let me go and rent it or make a point of seeing it. Well, I caught it on one of the premium channels, and I have to say it was very good. <br /> <br /> This movie was about some brilliant young medical students who decided to explore death. They found a way to briefly kill a person and bring him / her back. Besides the all-star cast, this movie had some serious bites on it. Just the thought of exploring death is enough, but I really thought the author and director did an excellent job of giving another, but her educational, view. It was not a generic attempt to scare excitement, and to make your mind run. That was the right thing. <br /> <br /> Instead of making it an empty superficial, star-loaded thriller, this movie had dust. A nail-bitter, white knuckle, side-by-side, hard nosepiece. I give it an 8/10.
