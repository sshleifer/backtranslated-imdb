Of course, Talk Radio is probably not the best known of Stone's films, but don't keep it. This film is ripe for discovery. I testify to anyone not to enter. Along with the best performance of the 80-year-old Eric Bogosian theater, it remains for me (along with JFK) the best moment of Stone. Steen doesn't look much about this and hasn't made a director's commentary on DVD like all his other films. Stone has nothing to be ashamed of, most directors will kill to get a shot. A movie like this. <br /> <br /> The studio's claustrophobia is intense and Champlain's views are still very important today. The speech "legalize all drugs" is powerful and you may agree with him. In my opinion, the film about freedom of speech and how often people don't like to hear things they disagree with. The speeches and conversations with the listeners are very compelling, even disturbing, a cold running my spine when a madman Champlain said he had to rape again because the city made him mad, shocking. The tension is sometimes unbearable with a scene when Heavy Metal becomes Kent. Unhinged, of course, Champlain doesn't favor him by insulting him. Champlain (or should I say Bogos) is fearless in film and performance, totally enchanting, a shame th @ Bogosians. Another big role was the villain in Under Siege 2 (dear god!) One scene th @ wasn't true, was when Barry's boss Dan (Alec Baldwin) let him calm down, Barry didn't seem to be the kind of person on sit and do as he told him. It was a bit cut and clicked. The scenes outside the studio are being criticized for formulating Te, which is true because Stone is making the film more filmy and allowing the viewer to see Champlains' beginnings, but it doesn't quite work. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant movie movie with extreme close-ups, deep focus, extremely fast clips, a fantastic 360-set for the ultimate stunning monologue. Must see cinema, it hardly makes it because it has been ignored, but is now getting the attention it deserves so richly. A classic th @ must be studied by generations of film students. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for inventive use of "Bad To The Bone" for T2, brilliant supporting role, including John C Mcginley (Dr Cox of Scrubs) as the messy Stu, Leslie Hope (24) as Champlains girl, John Pankow and Alec Baldwin as the packs and Micheal Wincott who play three roles (a very underrated actor), the tension between the listeners and Champlain who are very sad @ times and of course kudos to the stars Bogoss and Stone for such fantastic piece of cinema. Enjoy it!
