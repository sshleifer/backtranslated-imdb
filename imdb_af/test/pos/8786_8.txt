Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is wrongly accused of sabotaging a hanger aircraft made for war. He goes on his way, meets Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) along the way, and joins him to find and bring the right criminals. <br /> <br /> There are many things wrong with this movie. Robert Cummings was a good actor, but he was completely displeased in this role; Priscilla Lane is beautiful but never a good actress; the story doesn't make much sense (and lasts longer than needed); It carries a lot of patriotism (but it was made while World War II was in full swing) and there is no end. It shouldn't work, but it does. <br /> <br /> It's full of bizarre lines and characters that definitely hold your interest. <br /> <br /> For example: Lane says to Cummings (while falling in love), "I wish I could have met you a hundred years ago" (???? !!!!); Lane pays a crook for her lunch and Cummings and Lane briefly join a circus group. Hitchcock's direction, too, was (as always) great - he throws in some wonderful shots and rows - especially the climate of the Statue of Liberty. <br /> <br /> It's not one of Hitchcock's classic movies, but still very good and worth catching.
