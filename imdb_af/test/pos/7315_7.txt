I found this one to be more chaotic than the average Stooges short (as strange as it may sound). There were several funny pieces, especially the running gags ("Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!", The glass door breaking, the Stooges walking in the store room and coming back with ... well, you know), but also many of them are included with things that just didn't make sense to me. I suppose it is generally attacks from scenes from the movie "Men In White", but because I don't know much about that movie, I can't say for sure. Maybe if anyone could explain it, I'd appreciate it much more.
