This movie has not been seen by me in a few years. It arrived on the Disney Channel in the early hours of the morning. I stopped seeing it, and found it even more entertaining than the first time. The story, the scenery and the characters are as good as they come. I know that if someone takes the time to watch this movie, it will definitely be worth seeing a second time. It is very memorable in more ways than one. I would recommend this movie to everyone, as it is both entertaining and educational for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> p
