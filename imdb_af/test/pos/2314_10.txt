As an ex (core) submarine officer I have to admit it's my favorite submarine movie (even over Hunt for Red October). Someone knew something about submarines when they wrote the movie. OK - not realistic - but it's a comedy - and has all the "inside jokes" of the submarine. A good role with the stereotypical surfers on the Orlando and our heroes on the diesel boat. Definitely "DBF" by the way = it means diesel boats forever. But they want 10 lines to put it. Jesus is the Admiral in charge here? <br /> <br /> Lightning 10.
