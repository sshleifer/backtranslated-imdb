A bit of a curate's egg, this one. I started hating, with the predictable 'Old Dark House' set-up, these are constant references to recent American horrors and regular journeys on and off, dimly lit alleys. <br /> <br /> But it goes on and it is moments of originality. <br /> <br /> I began to wonder when the murder began, how to get out with just a saucepan of six, but then we got flashbacks to a previous visit to the building and saw a whole bunch of gory kittens that are reasonably effective. <br /> <br /> Naschy is fine and at the end it's a nice enough movie. It just doesn't jump up and grab one, hard enough.
