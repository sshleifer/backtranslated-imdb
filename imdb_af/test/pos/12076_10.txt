I originally saw it at its premiere in the UK. I was enchanted by it and it had tears throughout the whole time. I dropped it off the TV for safe keeping, but over the years it's been exhausted. And TV never seems to show it. Therefore, it was a joy to find out that True Movies owns the copyright on their channels. This time I pasted it onto a DVD so I could enjoy it again. <br /> <br /> Lucile Fray (played great by Ann - Margret) discovers that she has cancer and is terminal. Her husband has arthritis, and while he loves, he is an alcoholic and will not be able to care for their children after she's gone. Therefore, she must get new homes for each of her children before she dies. <br /> <br /> What's more, the music is beautiful and it made the test of time wonderful (it still makes me cry!) If you ever get the chance you will be stupid be it to miss it. It's a great movie! A must see for everyone !!!
