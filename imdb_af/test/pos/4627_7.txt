At 14:37 in a bathroom at an Adelaide high school, a student takes their own life and the different parts of six teenagers are changed forever. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a brutal, honest and breathtaking movie centered on the pain of being a teenager. The film one day follows in the lives of six teenagers, all intertwined, all who handle their own personal plays. While there are some stereotypes in the mix ?? The beautiful, popular girl who deals with body issues, the remaining obsession with his grades, there are various horrors that are so far from mainstream than you can get, including a social wipe out of a cruel disease and a young girl trying to make sense of a devastating event in her past. <br /> <br /> The film is blended with documentary style interviews of characters, which some viewers may find a bit out of place in the otherwise seamless story. The pace is also a bit slow, but it fits in with the feeling of the movie. The young Australian actors are all stars in their own right, especially Theresa Palmer whose heartbreaking performance earned her an AFI nomination. <br /> <br /> The movie is very well shot, with great direction. Some scenes are a little difficult to watch ?? in particular, the five-minute-long suicide scene, but overall it's a movie that has a huge impact on its viewers. It pulls you straight out of the shocking opening scene and guesses which of the six main characters will be the one that ends up in the bathroom. Ultimately, it is a beautiful made, but slightly disturbing look at the teen life.
