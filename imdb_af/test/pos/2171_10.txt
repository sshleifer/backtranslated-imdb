Most other subscriber responses to this service were very pleasant, but some found it slow or ambiguous. Rather than ambiguous, it was complex and multilayer in its meanings. One can see it as a war because of the opening and closing tones and the folly of handicap greatness, such as how wonderful the cavalry men watched as they prepared for the great charge at Eylau, as opposed to its so terrible and disturbing conclusion when we see the bloody uniforms, the boy's death, etc. - but especially I see the movie as a moral man in an immoral community. In the end, Chabert chose withdrawal from the corrupt post-Napoleonic French world and opted for the simple pleasure that Derville (who himself is saved by his recognition of Chabert's basic decency and the morality of his choice of renunciation) - white bread, cheese, wine and tobacco - about the wealth he has left for his wife and her and society's dishonesty. In her case we see the film as feminist, in the position of women of that time, in which the only weapons that Mme Chabert has are her charm, beauty, will and finally money.
