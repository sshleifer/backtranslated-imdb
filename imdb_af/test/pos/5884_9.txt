So many great talents have been used in "The Best Years of Life", the result must be somewhat miraculous. Think about what his director, William Wyler, faced; In the aftermath of a military victory over statistical forces who committed abominable crimes and engulfed the world if there were fights, he made a film stating that US leaders were deeply anti-individual - that they were the best Years of the lives of those who acted or were deceived to fight the war - who, since ignoring the rights of individuals, were nothing more than an argument about the degree of slavery that men would undermine. "There are beautiful sets by Julia Heron, the cinema of Gregg Toland and a writing by Robert E. Sherwood, author of" The Road to Rome "and other defense of individuals against tyrannical ideas. Like Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo, Cathy O'Donnell and Hoagy Carmichael in a large-scale but thematic drama, the clever plot line was the experience of your "couples" after the soldiers (three of the spotlights) returned to a "victory culture." Their bitter experiences and their realization of their own need to fight against what is on the Homefront is a strong and disillusioned counter to the conventional idea being sold that "all right with America was. "March and his wife adapted a lot of time, and he drank. O'Donnell's young man, Harold Russell, had hooks instead of hands and wondered if life was even worth living and the worst of all Andrew's wife go owed him to a man with dough and he lost years and caused employers to ignore or deny his rights to a job, his individual merit, even to have what he had before being torn from his life and into the arena of risk - for nothing and loss of everything he ever had. The terrifying climax of the movie comes when each of the three must confront the oath to fight again, each for his own happiness; and all three succeed in finding the courage to fight - each one for his own happiness, now threatened by a peculiar anti-self, anti-reality indifferent to an un-American United States. Wyler's direction, especially from the scene where Andrews sits in a cab of a B-17, alone and the scene of Russell's wedding, is wonderful. It's a most powerful movie and a great one on its own terms. One woman and men can agree once. Music by Hugo Friedhofer and costumes by Irene Sharaff adds to its luster. One of the best and most unexpected movies of all time, in beautiful B / W.
