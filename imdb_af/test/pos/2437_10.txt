It was a lovely intro for the most intelligent Sailor Soldier, Sailor Mercury. It consisted of a new "in croud", Merciurios. At first he wrote a love letter to Ami, which will be natural, and now, Ami Thiks, he is a Chibi Estonian, and he is attractive. He finally looked like Umino (Melvin). It was a halarios (expedition Minako's scene, "It's no skin of my neck"!). Well, I really like the Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon Series, I personally think its the best anime ever! But this movie was nice, funny, but not as adventurous as sailor moon R. It was more like the S movie. I saw this @ Sailor Moon Univewrse, with the right player, and it was pretty good. (All over)
