This work is quite atmospheric, with some surprises some very creepy elements. I found this work more satisfying than I first expected, given the rude reviews it gets here at IMDb. The dialogue is about natural and honest (given the circumstances), although the overall run of the movie comes from predictable to cliché, with the heroines falling when they run, and investigating strange sounds when they have to close their doors. Typical horror movie fare. <br /> <br /> The local characters are among the worst clichés, depicting Appalachian natives as developing challenges. The characters of the kids and the principals are GREAT! The development given is sufficient, and Scout Taylor-Compton seems to be developing her talents quite well. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not going to say that it's completely original or the best thing since sliced ​​bread (which is not so good on the road), but it's interesting and I don't want to get me 107 minutes back. I wouldn't say it's an incredible movie anyway, but there are some very good horror elements in it. But there are also very slow patches where plot / character development seems superfluous for the director (or the film editor). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's good for a rainy night, but not so good. For a Friday / Saturday night viewing. <br /> <br /> It's a 7.6 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
