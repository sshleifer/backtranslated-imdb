I just saw this broadcast on Channel 4. After I have seen the previous comment here, I only think that I do not want to be the death penalty. With that I expected big things from this movie, but it just didn't work out. Dead Man Walking is done very clean, with good performances everywhere and good writing. It's actually hard to artificially blame it. However, I felt that it was trying to confront the issues surrounding the death penalty, but it seems to be placed by the religious / moral attitude (not surprising, since the main character is a nun). Although I am not a heartless individual, I have not really learned with any of the characters in the story. If you don't take religion seriously, you probably won't see much in this movie. I think Peter Medak's let him have It was a much more powerful and moving movie, and I would highly recommend anyone to consider seeing it.
