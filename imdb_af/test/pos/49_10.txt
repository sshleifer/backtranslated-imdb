Lackawanna Blues is a very moving movie that shows an era filled with different emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy. The film clearly supports "it takes a town to raise a child" and reminds one of the important time in black history and culture. I got an incredible amount of respect for Macy Gray as an actress. Her character was a little crazy, but lovely; We all knew everyone like Macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as Nanny. I never realized Epatha was such a great actress. Law & Order never showed the depth of Epatha's acting capabilities like Lackawanna Blues. I was pleasantly surprised and surprised! The music and the characters reminded me of my own childhood ... it was a sweet nostalgic step down the memory path. I enjoyed the movie very much and eagerly awaited the DVD edition to add to my collection.
