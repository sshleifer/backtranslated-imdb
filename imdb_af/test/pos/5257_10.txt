Yes, this movie is another remake. Yes, this movie can be considered a chick spot. And yes, this movie isn't perfect. The Women, however, are a clever modern update on the social behavior of all women, with an impressive A-list film, including Meg Ryan, Debra Messing, Annette Benning and Bette Midler. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around four chiefs, Mary (Ryan), her best friend, editor-in-chief, Sylvie (Benning), Alex (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Edie (Debra Messing) and the outside this world female being responsible for most of the movie's drama, Crystal (Eva Mendez). Mary tries to deal with her deceitful man (who has never actually been seen in the film), following the advice of her friends and her mother (Candice Bergen). <br /> <br /> Apart from Mary, there is Sylvie whose tear between her social life and her professional life. She has decisions to test moral and ethical values. Then there is writer Alex who is a lesbian, with many spunk, but knows her way with words. And finally Edie with four girls and another baby on the road, who loves children and has a heart of gold, with a hidden secret revealed at the end. <br /> <br /> Together, women live revenge, rely on each other, and give life lessons to each other. But that's the cameos by Bette Midler, Candice Bergen, Cloris Leachman, Carrie Fisher, and Debi Mazar, showing the cruel and ordinary behavior of women. Bergen plays Ryan's mother, she is tough, silver-tongue, and yet she can feel what her daughter is doing later. There is Fisher who shows how to challenge and test the bounds of selfishness, morality and betrayal. Mazar, the gossip girl, shows no mercy to what she says and to whom she says it. Leachman who plays Ryan's sauce housekeeper, she knows her place, when and where she is needed, and how to deliver a good one-liner. Finally, there is MIdler, who plays Leah Miller, a crazy eclectic but wise Hollywood agent. She is the one character that Ryan's Mary gives an epiphany about who she really is by discovering "what I want." Despite Midler's acting performance and memorable quotes, she was underutilized. <br /> <br /> But back to the movie, the women show what it means to live in the 21st century without knowing exactly what you want until the time comes when you answer that own question. It's about feminism, what it means to be a woman (fiery, relentless, bad, smart, smart, smart, smart, shy, proud, ashame, self-conscious, careless, beautiful, strong, independent); And also what women want, why women are like them. It's funny, modern and not a masterpiece. But the bottom line is, it's worth seeing money and time to see a veteran and younger actresses teach us everything about women.
