Movies aren't always supposed to be about deep, provolking thoughts. Sometimes they are simply meant to escape from reality. Out To Sea fits the bill perfectly. <br /> <br /> A romantic "golden year" comedy, Out To Sea, cannot be a big budget. You may be able to easily tell when they are in front of a green screen, but it is still a lot worth watching. A sweet movie that must be given a break. <br /> <br /> It's just a good, light-hearted fun. It's not meant to be a deep movie. It's something worth watching. If you have seen nothing else, you should see it for Brent Spiner's humorous and tight version of Oye Como Va. Gil is a character you love to hate and mr. Spiner pulls out the perfect evil comic foil for two beloved comedy films.
