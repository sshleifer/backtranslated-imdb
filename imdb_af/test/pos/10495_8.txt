It was the film that first showed me what a good actor Martin Sheen really is. He says modestly that Charlie is a better actor, Charlie can't keep a candle on him. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it excitingly and thoroughly enjoying the entanglement of the love story with the main plot (and I usually hate love stories). There is a big story that ultimately was my credibility, especially in the early 80's, and probably now too. <br /> <br /> The final scene had me on the edge of my seat. This film illustrates that betrayal is often deceived by those we trust, while declared enemies have more in common than they suspect, and ultimately human compassion can be found where we least expect. <br /> <br /> ireneration
