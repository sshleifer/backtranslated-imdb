This is exactly what the wine can talk about, but it can be the best movie I've seen in many years. Granted I spent a lot of the first half and wondering what the hell was going on, but as soon as I accepted that I would never understand the subtitles, I could enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> Can you really hate a movie where a staff becomes a herd of birds that suffers from the enemy? What does character development mean when it comes with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha carry a serious remnant of diamonds? Have any of these issues when confronted with the mere view of the visual and clever humor of the characters. Any battle for my heart was won when I saw the main character dressed as a spider - awesome! Many people will complain about a lack of story cohesion, but for a fun movie to laugh with a lot of friends, you can't do better, especially if you do an alcoholic shot every time someone says: "I will love you 10,000 years ".
