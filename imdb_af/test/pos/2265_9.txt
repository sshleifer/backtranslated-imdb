SPOILERS a Jewish Frodo? Yep, it'll be Elia Wood again. <br /> <br /> Since the conclusion of the "Lord of the Rings", Elijah Wood and Frodo have found it harder to get away from the big role. A soccer hooligan, a psychopath and now a young Jewish American, Wood plays a route he can to escape this type of test. Now, with "Everything is enlightened", he could eventually reach it. If he plays a role that is not as radical as other attempts, he really gets the soul of his character. Yet, it's not like Wood does it alone. Backed by a wonderful adaptation by first-time director Liev Schreiber and a wonderful performance by newcomer Eugene Hutz, Wood found a beautiful production to spread his wings. Jonathan Safran Foer (Wood), a young American Jew, goes out to Ukraine to find the mysterious girl who saved and helped his grandfather. He comes to America. In the country, Jonathan comes to all the talks, all dancers Alex (Hutz) and his racist grandfather (Boris Leskin). Over the country, the three travel more and more about the history and relationships that Alex and Jonathan never knew. <br /> <br /> It's a strange feeling when the movie progresses in its second chapter (it's actually divided into four overalls). The first part, sometimes occasionally funny, is usually serious and intense. So when we get a brief history of Alex and his family in the second part, it's a strange step to switch from serious to hilarious. It does not work quite well, but as the film progresses, it certainly teaches it lesson, as this mix of humor and sadness merges as time goes by. <br /> <br /> To the ultimate credit of everyone involved, than the story. go ahead, so we start to fall more and more for the characters. Elia Wood is wonderful, Boris Leskin is so intense and strong that it asks questions why Hollywood has never noticed it properly. Most notable of all, however, is Newcomer Eugene Hutz. Hutz is absolutely brilliant with an intensely troubled character. He shows the split between his family and the real world with almost perfect skill, and when his character communicates with Wood, you truly connect with him on a deeper level. Without Hutz, the story is so strong that the film will still be fantastic, but with him it will be the next level. <br /> <br /> As a debut for actor, director Liev Schreiber, the story also has a brilliant piece to start. A work of passion (Schreiber's grandfather himself, an immigrant to America), he manages to truly embrace the emotion of the content, and by offering us beautiful scenery and some beautiful shots, he succeeds really home. The last half hour has been created so beautifully that it is a challenge for a tear not to form in any viewer eye. This is a moving story, and with Schreiber's help it becomes even more powerful. <br /> <br /> Built with love from a passionate director, "Everything is Illuminated" is a beautiful piece. A road story with a difference, it was performed wonderfully and wonderfully written. It's a movie everyone should see, and it's the perfect way for Elia Wood to finally get Frodo to rest.
