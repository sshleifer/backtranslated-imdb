Actually, it's a very good movie. However, this is very different from Seagal's other films, but unfortunately some of its fans may turn off. Unlike some of the other movies, it doesn't feel like a Seagal vehicle. You also see many of the other characters and all Mr. Seagal's actions are not the same as we have seen before. The notion that he is an 'intellectual' in something other than bombs and other weapons is a good change. Although there are some unrealistic parts of the movie (some more obvious than others), you can usually make them slide, as the movie is nice to watch. <br /> <br /> It comes down: If you watch For a classic Seagal action movie, sorry, but you're going to be disappointed. Look it anyway for its pleasure. If you are open to seeing Seagal without the action, it's worth watching. Personally, I believe it is a bit of his best work. <br /> <br />
