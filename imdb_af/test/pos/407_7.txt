Red Skelton plays a radio detective known as "The Fox" in "Whistling in the Dark", also with Ann Rutherford, Conrad Veidt, Eve Arden, Virgina Gray and Rags Ragland. Wally Benton, aka "The Fox" finds his plans to marry his fiance Carol (Rutherford) when kidnapped by a leader of a sham cult (Veidt). Joseph Jones (Veidt) has just learned that his cult, The Silver Haven, is not a promised heritage because of the existence of the old woman's cousin, who will be absent from the interest. He wants Wally to set up a perfect murder site so that the man on the plane on the route can be murdered to meet with his lawyer. For the backup, and not sure who is Wally's fianc√©, Jones Carol and also the radio sponsor's daughter (Gray) kidnapped. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's a better movie for the second entry into This Series, "Flute in Dixie." The plot is better, the throw is better, there is less slapstick and less funny jokes. Skelton, if he doesn't make faces and rolls his eyes, is very friendly, and Rutherford is very good. Veidt always played these evil men to perfection. Eve Arden is Wally's agent, who arranges a date for him and Gray to make sure his contract is renewed. I only saw Gray in movies in the 1950s. She was always a pretty woman, but who knew she was such a knockout in the 30's and 40's? It's a fun movie with a neat roll.
