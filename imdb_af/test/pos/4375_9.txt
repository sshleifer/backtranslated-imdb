Mr. Carlin left our general forum in June 2008, shortly after coming to hospital for chest pain (he had a history of heart problems). The media and comics all covered the loss everywhere I ever expected. But he was the grandfather of observation committee. This recording was his last production and contains a great deal of devotion to the subject of death and the prospects of life afterwards. The filming of the project took place shortly after his seventeenth birthday, which he happily reached (observed?). I followed Carlin's career from the days of fuzzy black and white television and enjoyed his current record albums. <br /> <br /> It is a privilege for any Carlin fan to see at least (if not a copy) of this particular show. He was still moving fast, and with good timing, even at 70! As he would say, "he is not" from heaven on your smile. "If he does not do anything, he does not take hares, maybe he looks up !!!
