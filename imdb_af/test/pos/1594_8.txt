WARNING: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although this movie is moving slowly, the brilliant scenery, the richness of characters and powerful themes `Morte a Venezia 'make a rewarding experience. I didn't read Thomas Mann's book, but I'm sure Visconti's visual splendor, musical score, and powerful exclamation and desire to do so justify it. <br /> <br /> The study by Gustav von Aschenbach refers to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behavior and passion. This trend is demonstrated in the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes Music as mathematical - that is. quantifiable - and emotional. This conflict arises again at the scene where young Tadzio plays alone in Fuer Elise, in the lobby of the hotel and Gustav remembers his visit to a bordello where he is drawn to a prostitute who plays the same song. In his jump-back, after paying the prostitute, Gustav is clearly physically seized by the consequences of his actions. This response is a reminder of the moral response to the temptations that Tadzio represents. <br /> <br /> Finally, Gustav is forced to make his biggest decision: stay in Venice and thank himself for his desire and temptation? Or does Venice flee to save its own life? His early attempt to flee Venice to the station caused uselessness and extended the outcome of his stay. <br /> <br /> Complementing the fascinating character interaction, Visconti's powerful landscape (especially Venice at Dawn and the final scene of Tadzio walking in the water and pointing to the horizon) makes this movie a true masterpiece.
