This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever watched. No movie did me the way this one did. It's a good movie and you have to see for yourself. I am usually incapable of this sob story movie, but this one did it for me. I was in tears at the end. You will long for the friendship shown in this movie. If I can give this movie a billion stars, I can do it.
