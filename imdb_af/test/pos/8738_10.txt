Cactus Flower is what I call a "pizza movie" - a personal favorite that never meets. Ideal for an evening at home with a pizza. Because all the lines (and what lines!) Are heartily promoting the pleasure. <br /> <br /> Since so many others have reconsidered the plot here, I simply add that correction that Bergman's character, me. Dickinson was a nurse receptionist, meaning she was a competent nurse - and therefore an educated person - not just a receptionist. <br /> <br /> Bergman's performance in this film - and the film itself - was largely discharged at the time. but today's audience will marvel at her series; not only the impeccable comic timing, but the ability to make us believe her is unaware of her own feelings, while being so clearly communicated to Toni and us. While the general plot exerts credibility, Bergman's performance is compelling: honest and completely credible. <br /> <br /> Looking forward is Jack Weston's performance as the Matthau's old friend and co-conspirator, Harvey. No one could sing a singer like Weston, and I.A.L. Diamond's script gives him a lot. For example, "It's such a big, dirty, rotten lie, it's class." Weston excelled at some seedy characters for exiting a warmth that allowed you to forgive his characters' mistakes. <br /> <br /> The movie is a fairly straightforward adaptation of the Abe Burrows play (which itself has been adapted from a French play by Barillet and Gredy). On Broadway, Matthau's role was played by Barry Nelson. Bergman's by Lauren Bacall, and Hawn's by Brenda Vaccaro. It ran for 1,234 performances (three years) and was nominated for two Tony awards (Vaccaro and Burt Brinckerhoff, who played Igor.) <br /> <br /> For me, the movie's score, written and edited by legendary Quincy Jones is another highlight. The main theme (a time for love any time) is performed by Sarah Vaughn about the opening and closing points. It is also illustrated in various arrangements by the film, especially since the romantic piano music underlines Berman's speech to Hawn in the record store. Jones also created dozens of popular songs from the era (for love with love, I am a believer) for the nightclub scenes. As with all the elements of the film, there is a tremendous amount of talent, taste and professionalism. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, little modern romantic comedies can hold a candle to this classic. It's great to finally make it available on DVD. Time to call for a pizza ...
