STORY Chinese Tall Story tells the story of righteous monk Tripitaka who, along with his guardians Monkey, Sandy and Pigsy, made their journey on a quest to restore old Sutras, eventually reaching the final leg of their journey in Shache City. But everything is not as it seems the city is being attacked by evil tree demons. Monkey tries his best to fight them, but is overwhelmed by the fact that his master is in great danger. He uses his reliable gold staff to make Tripitaka safe. <br /> <br /> The monk is eventually eliminated when he lands and when he wakes up, he finds himself in the presence of a young lizard named Maiyan. He had a nice shine for our young hero. After many verbal misunderstandings, Maiyan is convinced. Tripitaka loves her, so when the monk decides, he must save Monkey and the other. , she insists on accompanying him. So the mismatched couple starts their adventure together. <br /> <br /> OVERVIEW Okay, this is another Travel to the West movie, which is not bad for me, because I love the story and the characters that accompany it, so I was a little excited about me get hands on the DVD. So I think I'll start my review with the story, which is all over the place. In the first place it was your standard fantasy movie, then it became a ridiculous comedy when suddenly became full of blast bikes, if director Jeff Lau was experimenting with mixing genres then he did a nice scatological work with this movie. I think it's a pretty unique approach by having the story center on a different character from the notorious Monkey King, especially to take a character as pacifist as Tripitaka and then put him in the heart of a love story. Overall, I like it. <br /> <br /> The play is mostly solid, with leaders Nicholas Tse and Charlene Choi performing very good performances, although Ah Char spends most of her screenplay behind some rather ugly makeup. The supporting role is well-composed, including all the usual EEG accommodation so Boy'Z and Isabella Leong perform. One of the actors I would like to mention is Wilson Chen, who plays the Monkey King. He did good work with the limited material he appeared to have played a version of the Monkey King that was still arrogant. I felt that he would withdraw Twins Effect II area, but fortunately this is not the case. I hope he gets a follow-up with himself in the central role, as the film doesn't open up to a successor. Okay, so come down to directing, which is again, Lau, giving too much time to the Stephen Chow-esquire nonsense comedy, which includes a scene where Tripitaka pulls him up as Spider-Man, supposedly lead to a lot of trouble as the movie is supposed to be in ancient China. He made some nice and enjoyable moments between the two clues and plunged into the juicy area, but this reviewer sometimes enjoyed a little juice, so it didn't hurt me in the slightest. <br /> <br /> Right, now at CGI, which is mostly portable, there are many moments that are likely to be on a PS2, as many other reviews have said, but there are some cool moments, especially the scene in which Monkey is fighting a flying minion. Many of the CG gags are provided in the form of the golden staff who are changing in a variety of things, ranging from a giant pilot to a mechpak that comes straight from the Matrix revolutions. So yes, it looks crazy, but I think you should see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Right, so in the lock A Chinese Tall Story is not a movie without being flawed, but it is long enough to entertain and generally an overall enjoyable movie to be. If all of the above doesn't swing you to see it, how's that going, then it's much better than Twins Effect II.
