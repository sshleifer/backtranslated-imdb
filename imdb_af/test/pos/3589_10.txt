This is without a doubt the most beautiful and amazing documentary I've ever seen! The images shown are absolutely stunning and amazing. In addition, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs you and doesn't let it to the end. You will be so addicted and enchanted by the fact that you will forget your home watching TV! This series is available for purchase on DVD and I strongly recommend picking up this one! With all the wickedness and death in this world, this documentary series proves that life is beautiful and worth saving and preserving.
