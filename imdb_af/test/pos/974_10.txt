I could watch this movie ALL DAY! I love it. Probably my favorite movies all the time. But by the way, "badger1970" there are some bad language parts, not too bad, but it's not exactly G rated. GREAT movie !!!!! I recommend it to everyone. Anyway, it makes me 10 lines of text, so I'll keep typing until it makes me comment. Well ... Tap ... It gets annoying. Ugh. I still have four more to go. Anyway, watch this movie! Even if you've seen it already. I do not care! Are they already 10 lines? Nope. Just 2 more lines left. I don't even know why I want it. I think I'm done. Wait a minute, I'm NOT done, SORRY, people. I know it's torture that listens to me. WEEL, I suppose you shouldn't read this comment ... But you have to, because I wrote it. I'm probably done now. Finally, goodbye.
