Initially I didn't think I wanted to keep this movie, but as it progressed, it got better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage can fake the movements of a mandolin. My son was with me and he also liked the movie a lot for his music and the story and the way the story unfolded - slowly showing how Corelli won the girl's heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. Initially, Corelli's bravado was annoying, but soon he grew on you. The twists in the plot were especially interesting for the relationship with the Germans. I'd love to see it again to follow all the margins. I also want to buy the soundtrack to hear the music again.
