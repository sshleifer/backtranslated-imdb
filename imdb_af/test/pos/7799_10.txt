The movie Andaz Apna Apna in my books is the top 5 intelligent comedies ever made in Hollywood, maybe even Hollywood. <br /> <br /> When the movie was released, I was an 8-year-old and I heard it was a flop, but I never understood until now why it was a flop. ... but let me tell you one thing ... this movie will have more money by selling home tapes and DVDs and by showing in TV movie channels as any hit player in theaters. This movie has been shown countless times in movie channels and I even think public love and the TV producers are holding the movie again and again. I watched the whole movie more than 80-100 times and I still love it. <br /> <br /> The show by both Aamir Khan and Amar and Salman Khan as Prem is blowing, but especially like the performance of Aamir Khan as a street smart man .... his dialogue in the movie is Hilarious ... the story is simple and why it goes ..... <br /> <br /> Amar and Prem are poor, lazy carp and come from a poor family toddlers and Amars father is a hairdresser . Then they both get a news that a millionaire's daughter from London comes to India to look for a suitable match. Both Amar and Prem think it's a great opportunity to become super rich. That's why they both have Raveena Tandon. .. (the millionaire daughter) ...... in their journey they hate each other and everybody tries to trick the others into marrying Raveena ..... the comedy screens in between are so hilarious that you need a glass of water has to stop the pain in your stomach by laughing ... and then there is Raveenas Oom (Millionaire's equal brother) Teja who wants to take revenge from Raveena's father ..... because he is broken and Raveenas father is a millionaire ...... his plans include abduction Raveena to blackmail Raveenas dad for whom he rent 2 butlers ..... but <br /> <br /> but later we learn that there is a turn into the movie (look at the movie to know) ....... then there is Shakti Kapoor as crime master Gogo who also incredibly fu ...... <br /> <br /> The something that came to me was the dialogue in the movie that became a legend of all kinds ..... Aamir Khan uses his "aaila" brilliantly and Salman goes like "Ooima" ........ and for Gogo there is "Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soota Nahi Hain to Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahi Gogo Aa Jaega "...... every scene is so funny ...... <br /> <br /> I especially liked the one in which Aamir Khan and Salman get goto Raveena from Teja and they go both in a Luna who has a "visit" money in a bag .... that scene is so funny. <br /> <br /> I recommend someone who understands Hindi or Urdu to see this movie ...... this is one movie I recommended to have a DVD and you'll never regret no. ......
