These exceptional 40's post-war classics tend to overlook this <br /> <br /> day. When it was released in 1945, it was suspended on the 1946 <br /> <br />. It was mostly at the expense of "This is a wonderful life." Both films were the best movie, best <br /> <br /> director, and best actor, all won by best years. Frederic March, <br /> <br /> and Dana Andrews play with an amateur actor Harold Russell (a <br /> <br /> real soldier who has lost both hands in an explosion) /> <br /> Return soldiers, find life very different, from what they <br /> <br /> remember. Myrna Loy is wonderful as March's wife, who has to keep the family together while he was away. The tear-performing <br /> <br /> scene where March and Loy are reunited is wonderful. All three <br /> <br /> find men having trouble resurrecting after war, <br /> <br /> least Russell comes with artificial hands and his finances <br /> <br /> (Cathy O'Donnell) trying to be helpful. Sam Goldywn is quoted as saying he doesn't mind if the movie doesn't make money at all, as long as everyone in America sees the film, so they will appreciate <br /> <br /> what these guys have gone through. If any movie is 10 out of 10, it's the one.
