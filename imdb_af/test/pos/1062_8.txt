Given the acting roles he played in the 1940s (Casper Gutman, Signior Ferrari, Peters, Jerome K. Arbutny, Ex-Superintendent Grodman, Count Fosco, Titus Semple), it surprised many of its fans to learn that originally Sidney Greenstreet A name for himself in comedies in the West End and Broadway. He was usually such a total villain, or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored. In fact, he actually made four comedy appearances (one is a ghost of his villains depicting his villain Peter Lorre in a cameo look). His best total movie show in a comedy was probably that of magazine publisher Alexander Yardley in "Christmas In Connecticut" (although his autocratic, half-tender soap bar in "The Hucksters" is a close second). Despite some problems with the screenplay, it is a good movie, and is usually revived in the Christmas season. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) writes a column in the American Housekeeping magazine for Yardley, where she gives household tips and cooking recipes. She is the 1945 version of Martha Steward, except that Ms Steward is a cook and homeowner, and she can try and test it. Stanwyck can't. Her cooking recipes are those of her friend Felix (S.Z. Sakall), a gourmet chef and restaurateur. The house she describes as her home (a model farm in Connecticut) belongs to her unofficial boyfriend, architect John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner). Gardiner didn't really mind getting married to Stanwyck, but she's not quite ready to consider a final commitment to him. <br /> <br /> When the movie starts, an Nazi is destroying an American. It's Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor. He spent two weeks in a raft before being saved. Greenstreet realizes publicity value, and decides to give Morgan a desire to have a true old-fashioned Christmas in Connecticut. He basically tells Stanwyck that she will entertain Morgan and Morgan on her farm for the holidays. Stanwyck cannot explain that the columns' image of herself (complete with her ability to flap jack flicker and a baby she supposedly had with her husband) is a lie - if she does, she will be fired just like her immediate boss Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne). In a moment of depression she accepts Gardiner's marriage proposal, and Gardiner finds that his Connecticut home is threatened to become Stanwyck's "real" home and himself and "their baby." <br /> <br /> Of course, Stanley and Morgan find themselves in love (largely for Gardiner's annoyance - he actually expects Stanwyck to still marry him). Complications caused by complications occur, as lies lie, and as baby's babies succeed neighbors' babies, before Greenstreet begins to wonder if he is missing something. But it's a comedy, so everything works well. Even Greenstreet, at the end, is amused by all the madness - his celebrated cordiality reflects that of Santa Clause for a change. It's not a classic comedy, certainly not a great thing, but enough to make the season worth watching in December.
