... and I'm so disappointed, because I can't find the DVD or VHS about it. <br /> <br /> It's a mix of Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald. fabulous like the spoiled teenager. It was made when Molly was still a brunette, just before she hit the big time with Pretty In Pink. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good, clean family comedy, with an edge! <br /> <br /> If someone has a copy of this or knows where to find one, please leave a message for me. It will be appreciated a lot.
