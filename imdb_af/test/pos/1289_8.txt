Christopher Nolan's first attempt, a year before he did "Memento", and it's almost as brilliant as this classic. He uses time differences in a similar way to tell his story, and it's a very clever one. <br /> <br /> Bill is this young writer who begins to follow complete strangers just to see where they live and what they are all about. One day he followed this man, Cobb, who turned the tables and confronted Bill, breaking and confessing what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Cobb is a burglar and he takes Bill along a few lanes to teach him the ropes. Both men are voyeurs of a kind and a band starts to grow between the two. <br /> <br /> But there is a reluctant motive for Cobb to nurture this relationship, and it all goes very cleverly to the end. No, I won't spoil it, but it's a very cool movie and I think Christopher Nolan is a genius. <br /> <br /> If you end up with suspicious movies with surprises, this one is a must see.
