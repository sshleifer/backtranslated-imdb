That's what porn was, it's a real classic. I mean, this is an x-rated music based on a real book! There is a real plot for that and how many x-rated movies can boast it today? It belongs to an exclusive shortlist of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with pornographic movies these days is that it's all about the "pornographic" and not the "movie". Alice in Wonderland has graphic depictions of sex, certainly, but it actually tells a story at the same time. None of the typical "Oh, Mr. Policeman, write me a ticket", it takes another step and makes it a musical! Fabulous! If you want to see an example of "good" pornography, it's one of the best.
