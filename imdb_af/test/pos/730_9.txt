Nemesis Game is a sensible film filled with puzzles, death, mystery and philosophy. In the simplest sense, the movie is about searching for answers and what happens if you finally found them all. The search for answers leads Sarah Novak to a darker road as it becomes more compelling. The final answer looks more dangerous than it's worth, but Sarah is so close to understanding everything. What would you do if you had the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life? <br /> <br /> The movie was written and directed by Jesse Warn. Although it was Warn's first feature film, the film doesn't reflect it at all, but instead shows Polish and an artistic approach to tell the story. Carly Pope starred and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to watch. I will definitely love to see more of her work. <br /> <br /> Based on puzzles, this is a very cerebral film. This is your thing, because it is mine, so I totally recommend seeing Nemesis Game. Rating: 4.5 / 5
