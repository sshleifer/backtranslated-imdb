I really enjoyed this movie. It was edgy without being sociopath. Vin Diesel brought the Riddick character to life and felt good and bad at different levels. <br /> <br /> I also saw Iron Giant and Vin is perfect. (The snowmobile movie - oh yes, it's called "Triple-X" or "xXx" - was a bad example of his work.) In Pitch Black he plays an anti-hero to the maximum. I don't think you can go wrong with Vin stars in a movie. Unfortunately, Hollowood can throw him as an adventure action movie star - wrong! I think the script for "XXX" was bad for which Vin couldn't think of it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Pitch Black is a good scifi - watch it! <br /> <br /> - Zafoid
