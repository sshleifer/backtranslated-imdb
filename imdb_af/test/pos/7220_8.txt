I don't think the world was ready for this movie. I know I wasn't. I was expecting a standard low-budget schlock exploitation pot boiler. Instead, I got the most intelligent rework from Shakespeare since Peter Greenaway's "Prospero's Books". It must be the definitive movie version of Romeo and Juliet. Of course it won't. But this is the world's loss.
