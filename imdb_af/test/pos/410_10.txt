While many leave it as a B-movie, it is indeed a first-class comedy that has been well written and performed. Red Skelton is wonderful as Wally Benton is better known as radio fans than The Fox. Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wally's fianc√© Carol Lambert. Conrad Veidt leads a very well-cast gang of criminals. I read one account of this movie stating that Vincente Minelli directed this movie, unless he changed his name to S. Sylvan Simon, who has directed all three Fox movies. It is a very entertaining film made when imagination is encouraged. So get over your black and white bias if you have one, sit back and enjoy a wonderful comedy. It was also Red's first lead. Note the climax of the reference to Orson Welles' World War.
