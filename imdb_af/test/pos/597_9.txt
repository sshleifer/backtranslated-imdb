This film is one of my favorite childhoods. If the Muppets (at the height of their popularity) look at Hollywood, sing and dance, with Mrs. Piggy googely-eying her beloved Kermit, Fozzie Bear doing his best as everybody's manager, and a generous cast of 'extras' delivering a movie Kermit's melancholy ukulele number "Rainbow Connection" was voted Oscar for the year, but was knocked out by Norma Rae's "It Goes Like It Goes". I will choose Kermit's song any day! Get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasy ... someday they will find it, the rainbow links, the lovers, the dreamers and I!
