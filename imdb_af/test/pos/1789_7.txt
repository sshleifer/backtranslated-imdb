What kind do I say about this movie. Good for starters, I thought this movie was good, not the biggest the worst. I said I thought the writing was big and original, very different and refreshing. Now I won't say it's the biggest movie I've ever seen from the scene. The actors who played every role seem to have played them without emotion, as if they took life out of them. When the woman laughed or cried, for some reason it didn't really seem like that, it's just an example, but all the characters have not really acted genuinely. I wish I could say more positive things about this movie so that you guys can see it at least once, but how can I do that, as I know I will not see this movie again. I rented this movie from the library of my school without hearing anything about the film itself or the director. I had a chance because the story described on the back sounded very interesting and it was really.
