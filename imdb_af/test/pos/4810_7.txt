This film is a refreshing change in the speed of the inexorable Hong Kong triad movies that I have become so tired. There are no spectacular gunfights. No car racing. And almost minimal action to talk about. The audience is usually kept in tension, although certain aspects of the so-called "jersey" by Andy Lau are very clear. <br /> <br /> The film was seen as a deviation from the genre of violent triad movies, and as an "intelligent" crime film. To some extent it is. But, to some extent, it still fails the "credibility test". One can hardly imagine a triad member being stupid not to see Andy Lau's female disguise in a second. It also seemed to have fallen if someone was seriously ill, said someone would often accumulate bloody blood. A Chinese movie seems to be forever. <br /> <br /> The subtle relationship between the two main characters is a refreshing change. <br /> <br /> All in all a nice movie, although the concept is not new and there are few surprises. >
