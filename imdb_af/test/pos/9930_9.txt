Horror genius Dario Argento is one of my personal favorite directors, and his films "Suspiria", "Phenomena" and "Profondo Rosso" vary high on my personal favorite list for all time. "Opera" of 1987 is another vibrant and brilliant film that no Horror lover can afford to miss, and it keeps you from the beginning to the end of your seat. This spectacular and ultra-violent Giallo can be well described as the master's nastiest movie. It is quite something that takes into account that Argento's films are not exactly known for the tedium of their violence. The violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes Opera a movie sensor's nightmare. <br /> <br /> - Warning! SPOILERS Ahead! - <br /> <br /> Only when Betty (Christina Marsillach), a young opera singer, succeeds, a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath starts off ... The murders are really brutal and especially sadistic. The murderer tied needles to Betty's eyelids. She then had to keep them open and watch while he was horrified by people approaching her. When the killer finishes, the killer Betty and leaves give up free to just come back for other friends of her ... <br /> <br /> As usual for Argento's films, violence is very graphic and very stylized. "Opera" is really a brutal movie, and what a stylish and atmospheric movie it is. This film is absolutely seductive and pure tension from beginning to end. The performances are very good, especially Christina Marsillach is brilliant in the lead. A beautiful beauty and great actress, Marsillach fits perfectly into her role of the talented singer, whose fears and terrible experiences make her slow. Other great performances include that of Ian Charleston as a Horror movie director directing an Opera director, and director Argento's real friend Daria Nicolodi, who plays a role in many of his films. The work of the camera is excellent as in all Argento movies. The great Opera House is an excellent setting that greatly contributes to the beauty of the film and the permanently creepy atmosphere. The score, which is partly classical music and partly heavy metal, is also good, although I have missed Goblin's brilliant Progressive Rock Soundtracks, which is such a characteristic feature of most other Argento movies. "Opera" is truly a scary and absolutely stunning Giallo experience. It is an absolute must-see for any Horror lover, and I recommend it to any other movie fan who is not too sensitive to extreme violence. Excellent and absolutely seductive!
