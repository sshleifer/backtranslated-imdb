STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is in this world but not of this world. His mind simply does not seem to understand things like an average person would and his life would be one long disaster, because he gets himself into constant accidents and distances, many situations he remains to sort out on his own when he looks do not mix with anyone and seldom speak. But he never gives up and, in spite of the simplest tasks that a constant struggle for him, she will one day pay for him to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> Looking to the pity of modern British humor, with all its focus on sex and general vulgarity, you'll be forgiven for forgetting that a show like Mr. Bean made at once. There is nothing unsuitable here, just good, clean U-ratings of the type Tommy Cooper and the like made in the 50's. And I find it just like in my early 20s, as I was a young boy in the early nineties, laughing out loud. <br /> <br /> Although I can see it a bit deeper and see it more, this character must be more than the eye. There must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to go wrong for him. As others have noticed, he seems to have some sort of autism. In fact, I am so convinced that I really think a professional psychologist was analyzing him. I think Mr. Bean can be the first known, fictional character to be diagnosed with something like Asperger's syndrome. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see hilarious British humor, it's best before it's all affected by sex and vulgarity, then it will be highly recommended. Shows like Little Britain do work because it is well-realized, but it's actually just as vulgar as the rest. Shows like this show were once more civilized and civilized, and hopefully we may soon be entering this kind of humor again. *****
