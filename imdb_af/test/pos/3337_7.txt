Excellent entry into the RKO Saint series with well-written original writing, good camera work and transitions, good direction to handle a few twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. George Sanders is suave and spiritual. Jonathan Hale is simply inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a gangster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he can't take the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. Story begins on an oceanic traveler to the US where the Saint meets but can't connect with Wendie Barrie. She finally hit the saint's charm, but she broke his heart in the end. The saint helps inspector Fernack name his frame. A few bodies fall on the road. Good entertainment and above average for this type of movie. Beware.
