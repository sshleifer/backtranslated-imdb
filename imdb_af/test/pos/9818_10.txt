Ettore Scola's masterful version of this epic of the heart deserves a much larger audience. It is a worthy successor to the risorgimento classics like Vischonti's Senso and Il Gattopardo, as well as Rossini's Vanina, Vanini. The 19th century is indeed a fertile source for Italian filmmakers. The period settings and bumps are beautifully realized here, but the story is timeless and can occur at any time. What is so intriguing in this story is that the hero is caught up in a claustrophobic situation in which he finds the powerful intended object of desire and is completely powerless to free himself from the worrying circumstances. Giorgio (Giraudeau) is frustrated by his inability to visit his lovely but light-hearted married mistress (Antonelli) and fall prey to the dangerous passion of Fosca (D'Obici), the ugly and sickly daughter of his strict commander (Girotti). The resulting anxiety and consequent tragedy that this unlikely pair undergoes makes them both understandable, pitiful and extremely sympathetic to viewers. Bernard Giraudeau's star performance will captivate and leave a lasting impression. Not to be missed.
