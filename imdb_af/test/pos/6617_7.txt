Let me first say that I spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before realizing that I was completely uncoordinated. I always thought it was cool watching cats knowing how to make fun, but they were never a skateboarder and never really followed the sport. That said, I thought it was a very informative and interesting documentary. Some reviewers said these dudes were kind of blowing their own flag a bit, but what the hell? It seems to me that these guys probably deserve so much credit than anyone to shock the skateboarding world and have provided a good picture of their innovations to restore it. It's great how viewers are allowed to watch these guys and now and the footage they shot while teens are growing up in California, offers some interesting nostalgia that goes a bit further than the sport of skating. I never knew where I had skating, but these movies keep all the pieces together and give us an informative documentary. I'm sure it's at least a little bias, but isn't all the documentary? Worth watching for anyone interested in the sport or, as I see it, anyone who grew up in the 1970s.
