This may not be the most exciting or incredible episode they've made, but I think it's one of the most original episodes of Star Trek and the Sci-Fi genre. Most of the Retro Sci-Fi series ideas, especially with Star Trek, have been repeatedly reused, but one side remains mostly a one-time triumph. It is among the episodes that impressed me the most to the end. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about this episode is how it has come to create such an exciting and engaging story with so few special effects. Now, without criticizing the episode, I have to admit that the effects are very dated, but again what can you expect from a 1967 TV show? But still the creature ("Horta") in this episode is basically just a mat with some colored rubber on it. Yet you forget about 1 minute and you start to think about it as it should be. Also the caves don't look exactly like rock, but again you forget it after a few minutes. This episode is a living proof of how well acting and a good story can ignore the visual effects. <br /> <br /> The play of the main throw is as usual good. This episode contains the series of second thoughts reported by Spock and is one of my favorites. To put it simply, Leonard Nimoy is definitely a playmaker here, and his play is excellent. Not that Kirk of Bones doesn't get their part of the episode, but Spock is the most intriguing in this one. I like the fact that the episode is not about one particular character, but evolves around the trio that is dealing with a stranger problem. It's also nice to see an episode that doesn't just happen on the business. <br /> <br /> Like most Star Trek episodes, this episode tells us to have an open mind. I won't spoil the story but develop around what looks like a typical monster story in the beginning. It killed several people and must therefore be murdered. But is it really all there is? I can assure you that the explanation will not disappoint you in the end. It's still my favorite Star Trek TOS episode and I'm giving it a 10/10.
