I remember remembering this movie in 1981 when I was 7. It was absolutely brilliant! I did the DVD just a few months ago. I almost jumped up and down with joy !! I bought it and showed it to my kids. They also loved it. They asked what words the seahorse sang (I didn't tell them, because I don't think the words 'gay' and 'ecstasy' to 6-year-old children are very good parenting). The songs are brilliant. I still remember them all. I'll still remember them when I'm 60! There, or near the area. Tommy Pender is (was) such a brilliant actor. It's a pity he gave it up. <br /> <br /> If you find the movie, buy it! You will love it!
