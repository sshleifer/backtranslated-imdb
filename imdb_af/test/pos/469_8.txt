This movie is like Happiness Meet Lost Translate with a Sixth Sense ending (or maybe a Crying Game surprise), and the best soundtrack I probably ever heard ... if it all makes sense. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds tell you pretty much that you're in a winding drive. (I was surprised no one came out of the Brooklyn premiere right away.) But from there, the film is in a talk festival between two people who are really damaged, Daphne and Buddy. <br /> <br /> They are lonely, mess and son talk to them about sex. Daphne brings her most interesting stories of escorting to life, some are pretty funny (Mr. Chang) a little disturbing (the Harlan scenes with music that tells us can now be what is going on or what Daphne really feels for), and because I have a friend who accompanied me, I can add, most really look. <br /> <br /> You're alone is multi-layered and mostly brilliant. Well, maybe a few minutes less of the talk, and I don't know we missed something. <br /> <br /> Then I have to see it again to know the end. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. <br /> <br /> (The director asked people in Brooklyn to write a review on IMDb because many people read them. Request granted.)
