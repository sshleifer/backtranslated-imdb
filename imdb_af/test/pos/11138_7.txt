I was surprised to catch it on TV on Friday and I enjoyed it. Between the presence of Bobbie Phillips and the numerous references to everything that can be considered "cyberpunk", it was a fun movie to watch. I enjoyed the story, which reminds me of a book I read ("Earth", David Brin), and was fun to watch on TV. Bobbie looks good, but I also enjoyed her performance as Kam because she looks different from everyone. But the biggest thing about this movie was the atmosphere described in books by Gibson, Sterling and others. It was just nice to watch it on TV.
