Low budget, but memorable, being shockers instead of the bizarre theater. Vulnerable, naive nurse Charlotte Beale comes to a secluded mental hospital and is totally unaware that the only sensible people have been murdered, despite the red flags being constantly raised around her. <br /> <br /> The lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers a little more than a sense of style, as well as a movie of wacky characters. The pleasure of this movie does not come from the shock of the movie, which is fairly soft, but from the strange atmosphere. First, we have the fraudulent woman who thinks she is a baby doll. There is also an ax murderer judge, a shocked war veteran, and old mrs. Callahan is like everyone's daffy elderly grandmother who is crazy. A young patient called Allyson gives the term "nymphomaniac" new meaning. A big man named Sam is just a little slow to a bototomy, and Jennifer suddenly falls between katatonia and violent outbursts. The only other wise person in the place appears to be Dr. Masters, but does she have a secret? <br /> <br /> "Don't look in the basement" is a good example of low-budget mining films. There's not much plot going on, but the cheapness works for the movie. Several role-players turn into memorable performances, especially Betty Chandler and Annabelle Weenick, and the way the director adds some peculiar details to the movie can really keep you up. <br /> <br /> The scene between Allyson and the phone man "is a classic for all time, and especially the facial expressions of Dr. Masters when she begins to cross the edge near the final of the movie. Brownrigg also makes good use of the inexpensive soundtrack, with several musical clues that make the characters that accompany them, my favorite cue is the "crazy" cue, a sitar that compels one of the patients to do something pathological. /> <br /> Also wonderful is Charlotte's way in which he himself falls into hysteria in the climax, with the patients revealing that Dr. Masters is simply another resident, and then suggests that CHARLOTTE is also a patient admitted to execute her delusions (she certainly has a turbulent grip on reality, why else will she not question or omit the ominous lack of service?) The scene where Charlotte manages the rare-living dr. with a toy boat l, must be one of the biggest moments in low-budget horror. Yes, "Don't Look In The Cellar" can very well be the "American Beauty" of Grade Z trash.
