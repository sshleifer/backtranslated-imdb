One of the reasons they call the 80's, "The Awesome 80's" is quality television. Shows such as the Wonder Years, World War (series), V, Amazing Stories, and many more have always left an impression on every "happy" one of us who will always find a way to recreate him . In addition, here come Monsters! A series that is unique of its own, and a theme fully dedicated to - samples. May it be the good, the bad and the morbid. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of classic performances or if you have the fascination of horror movies, then this one is for you absolutely. Provided you can find this rare jewel. <br /> <br /> Even the newer generations will be apprehensive with some of the episodes, that is indiscriminate use of gore effects or the story that tells power and simplicity. I guarantee because I am 23 :). <br /> <br /> Make sure you don't miss it! <br /> <br /> Although it is a show that is apparently forgotten by the modern world, it will always be. with those who can always remember ...
