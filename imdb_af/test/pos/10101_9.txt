This is not so much an overview of a story of two sisters, as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details. Therefore, I advise you NOT to read this review unless you have seen the movie, as it will be absolute. A few surprises for you. <br /> <br /> In one way, a story of two sisters is far from original, at least of a purely superficial aspect - some of his iconography is taken directly from Ring of Dark Water, while the storyline itself ( especially what Brendt Sponseller calls the "rubber reality" aspect of the story) reminiscent of films such as Fight Club (main character interaction with someone created in their minds), Mulholland Drive (character creates alternative reality in a psychological fugue), as well as others small aspects of Lost Highway, Jacob's Ladder, and basically every film under the sun that deals with mental illness, plus Amenabar's films (The Others, Abre Los Ojos), Memento (especially regarding the turbulent nature of memory), et al. Fortunately, all of these agreements did not detract from the film's overall emotional impact, and I have Personalized Languages ​​of Two Sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience. <br /> <br /> Many people commented on the "confusing" nature of the story, but I personally found the storyline to be fairly self-explanatory, even though it is partially depicted in a non-consecutive way. The story only becomes confusing to some because the story halfway through the last third switches from a purely subjective environment (ie Soo-Mi's distorted perception of reality) to an objective one, with a backlash that eventually becomes the origin of Soo. explained. -My nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness. The shift in focus is intended to wake some people, but I found it structurally somewhat reminiscent of the mentioned Mulholland Drive (although we do not handle a character of reality with a dream of a character, but rather, their own schizophrenic tendencies - something that, in turn, reminds me of another Lynch movie, Lost Highway. To be honest, I do not consider a story of two sisters as a horror movie as such, but rather a tragic story of a family's collapse, as well as an honest look at a character's mental illness of psychoanalytics theater will love this movie. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most beautiful movies I've seen this side of Wong. The cinematography in a story of two sisters is incredible and visual. Kar Wai's 2046. The performances are also fantastic without exception, and I expect to see more of the four key players in the future. Not to mention the music, but East Asian movies without a good soundtrack look more or less between these days. <br /> <br /> It is very likely that some people will pass the finer artistic points of a Languages ​​Or Two Sisters and simply reject it as "another Asian horror movie", unaware of its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytics approach. But then each to their own. If you can ignore some of the movie's platinum aspects and just pick it up for what it is, that is. An extremely tragic, heartbreaking story, then I see no reason not to recommend it.
