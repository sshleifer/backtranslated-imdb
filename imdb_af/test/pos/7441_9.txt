I usually like this movie. The animation is the highest: which means they have bothered to create hair and fur on animals and humans. And I'm an amateur with graphics and animation (self-studying myself through books. For those who are curious about the same thing, I use the program Gmax at Discreet. It's a high quality free downloadable application from the internet). that the quality of the animation is shown here of high standards. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie is good. Although this film has no character development, this story is still understandable. Overall, I believe that this movie should be watched mainly by people who are fans of the game as the plot now follows the game. As far as I'm concerned, I don't play the games and so I don't have the furious effect it probably has on the fans of the game. <br /> <br /> For those who like the game, I suggest this movie, and if you didn't play the game, I'd still recommend this movie.
