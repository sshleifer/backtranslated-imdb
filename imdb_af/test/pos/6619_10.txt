Back in the day I was one of the RN's in the Emergency Rooms, these skaters would sometimes go home. They were not treated well, and some of them were brought by their asian personalities - but we all knew they were a talented bunch of "wonderkids" even then. They deserved better care than they received, I'm afraid. They had an "attitude" in the kicks. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I caught this documentary on IFC this year. It will be back at 01:00 and I will look again! <br /> <Little attention was given to them until the rich dying child could speak to his parents to drain the pool. The movie really shows it as the point of departure. It was a wonderful time and deserved to be. recorded. Stacy Peralta is the result of all the praise on him, and the Z-Boys can long enjoy their memories and contribution to the real sport of skateboarders. Regarding the few "acid grape" reports in there, there has always been and there will always be "wannabees" and hangers that will never do more than dream. The Z boys lived and breathed it. br /> <br /> Nice to see the harpsichord and even the lonely girl, "Peggy", who spoke like the only woman who won their respect. <br /> <br /> Thanks to IFC, I actually get to take drug-free main outings from my youth and relive the heart excited excitement.
