There is an interesting split in the voice for this movie (at least at the moment). Those who expect a documentary are impressed, or at least not disappointed. I expect those who give the movie 1 out of 10 to have those who expected a war movie or a reaction from Gallipoli's invasion. <br /> <br /> So - if you want to see players, gun and gore, this movie won't suit you. If you want to see an independent documentary about Gallipoli, without any prejudice on the one hand (the only enemy in these events was the War itself) then you will both impress and sober. I got it a very moving movie, and even liked Captain Guy Nightingale.
