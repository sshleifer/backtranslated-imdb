I'm amazed at the questions and issues raised by this documentary in the reviews here, especially as they are interesting questions. Certainly, those who could best address it would be the creators of the film itself. Nonetheless, I think I can shed some light on something I think has been overlooked, which, in my opinion, is the purpose of the movie, what it is about and what it tries to convey. What is his message? With the risk of showing the very obvious, I'll start saying the filmmakers have an intention. They try to tell a story, extract meaning and get a point. With this in mind, we can shoot many of the critical points, especially those involved in what people expected as opposed to what the filmmakers are really trying to show. Causes and effects of violence? The movie is not about it. It's not "enlightened non-Brazilian audiences" about the Brazilian favelas issue? Well, what did it do? Is AfroReggae this or that and supported by who? It doesn't matter in this context. Not enough women in the movie for your taste? It's not about equality or the feminist cause. Every little detail about Anderson's life, mother, son, family and all the aspects and working of the AfroReggae movement? Well, don't be so picky, because it doesn't matter. There has been a story for so long before it can no longer become a movie. If the writers have to show everything that everyone expects, they will rather have to make a 6 month TV series. If you expect it all, you approach the movie in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> The movie is actually about two individuals who started a movement. Two individuals full of ideals. Two individuals who desire change. Two individuals are trying to do something about all the offenses that go around them. Individuals who went downstairs and wanted to get up. It's all about finding purpose in life, inspiration from misery, changing fate and something other than what they were destined to be - criminals and drug dealers. It's about performance and hope and not about the cruel reality of violence in Rio de Janeiro, though it's an integral part of the movie. This is what the characters are constantly surrounded by. Unexpectedly and not without reason, the film ends much more on Anderson's course through life problems. This is because they faced Anderson's accident while shooting the movie. I'm not sure about this, but they might even seriously consider ending the filming, and having gone all the effort. But Anderson wanted to stay. And so they had the danger of losing in a movie with a bit of an identity crisis, taking into account the sudden change of course, but of winning someone so destructively. It is very clear to whom it is seen that the film is about AfroReggae and about Anderson. It is very unique in this sense (moving the story line). Perhaps their only sin is not clear beforehand, which can initially produce expectations that will be unfinished. <br /> <br /> As far as Anderson's importance or habit is concerned, I would say not everyone wants to change the whole world, end all violence, feed all the hunger, be like Mahatma Ghandi, be known as Mother Teresa or any other celebrities there. It is much easier to join and inspire someone who, like everyone else, tries to transform his own hard life, create problematic children, deal with permanent injuries or diseases and even pay the bills the end of the month. Understanding the movie you need to see is about a past of involvement in drugs and crime, getting it up, and trying to persuade others not to go the same difficult way. Although you can criticize as the way they have decided to do so, it is effective and doubts the ideology of the method. You can't deny their intentions. <br /> <br /> The perception that Anderson has been specially selected may also be partly related to the fact that the filmmakers have become very involved in the lives of the characters they portray. So much as being friends with them. There is no way to tint the whole movie with Anderson more favorably. If a dear friend is paralyzed in an accident, it's not just a fact, you're making a big problem out of it. And it's not necessarily bad. It is not much that they treat him as a chosen one, as much as they are trying to show him much as a seed for transformation and inspiration. <br /> <br /> Finally, don't watch this documentary for the screens of the reality of poverty and crime it contains, see how much more it is, an inspirational story. <br /> <br /> Nike-Ad-like? Looks like it's done well and professionally to me and doesn't affect or detract from the intentions of the movie. Romanticized? Wondering about his credibility as a documentary if you want, but why not when it's supposed to cause and inspire reaction? Don't try to improve people's lives through music and dance - the essence of what the subjects are trying to do - romanticizing their own reality? Forgive me just the simple facts that reporters do and you can watch it every night on TV. <br /> <br /> If I want to be a movie maker, I wish my first movie would be so good.
