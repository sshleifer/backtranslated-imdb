I saw this movie many years ago and it absolutely hated. I couldn't wait because it would end and would have been, but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder. You know what? I've never forgotten this movie, and more, I'll say it's constantly haunting me with its images and music over the years. How many movies I cried over and laughed in the movie house and then forget as soon as I hit the street, like ... you see, I can't even think of one! Rarer is movies like Death in Venice that change your consciousness and work. The French would like to say film is an art, and movies like this prove they are right. I give it 10 stars, of the 3 I gave it, I saw it.
