Oh, Batman Returns, is it possible to be a sequel that is almost as good as the original? With Batman Returns it got very close! We have great actors and a huge plot with the dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton back as Batman and he is still fantastic than ever. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly thrown. As much as I love and such an amazing actress Annette Benning, she couldn't have been Catwoman, she didn't really have the look. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him as the penguin? He was just big and scary! <br /> <br /> Batman returns with a more loving community of Gotham City, celebrating Christmas time with Max Shrek, played by a creepy Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who abuses his lovely secretary, Selina, who hears too much in his office, causes him to emit her out of the window in the hope that she will die and never reveal the information to know the penguin and the attempt to love him Gotham. When she survives and wakes up by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go with her cats! But there is also an active villain, The Penguin, who is looking for his parents who left him and now he is looking for the new mayor of Gotham City! Can Batman stop both super-villains to create their hair and stop the mayor from destroying the city too? <br /> <br /> You'll have to see! Batman Returns is just as good as the original Batman, despite the fact that the first one remains the true classic, this one takes you another ride. And come on, I mean, we got to Michelle! Her classic moment to meet only Batman and The Penguin "Meow" is classic! There are unforgettable characters, lines and sets! You'll have an explosion! Trust me! <br /> <br /> 9/10
