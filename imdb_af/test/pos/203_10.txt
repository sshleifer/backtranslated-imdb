It is not surprising that this short (91 minute) B / W movie made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called "ottpel" or "thawing" is so much love and admiration among the movie lovers the whole world. It is sublime and beautifully filmed. Some scenes feel like they were before their time. Sergei Urusevsky's camera work and creative discoveries are included in the textbooks and widely followed. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but alive alive in the memory of a young woman. It is also the film about loyalty, memories, the ability to live if there seems to be nothing to live; It's about forgiveness and hope. The film receives (absolutely deserving) the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova is selected as a recipient of a special award in Cannes to play Veronika. The young girl is fortunately in love with the best man in the world at the start of the movie. After the divorce with her beloved who went to the front, the loss of her family in the bombing, and the marriage to the man she never loved and just wanted him to never exist, she went to her shade turned. She was dead inside. Her long journey to salvation, to eventually accept the death of her loved one and to learn how to live with it, is a fascinating and heartbreaking one and will simply leave no viewer. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie is very personal and dear because I was born and grew up in the city where his characters lived and were so happy in the beginning. I walked the same streets, squares and bridges across the Moskva River. Every family in the former Soviet Union lost at least one, but often more than one family member, to a battle or to the concentration camp or to the ghetto or to famine, colds and diseases during World War II and my family is not a exception. My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of the war and never healed pain from losses, just from the movies and the books. "Cranes fly" speaks clearly and honestly and touches me deeply. This is a masterpiece of movies, but it's part of my life - my background, my memory, and my past.
