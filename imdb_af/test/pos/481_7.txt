If you want to see a brilliant performance of Mikado, be played to perfection with expert timing and panache, don't look at this version. If you want to see a hammie version with Eric Idle that looks like the English men's private club association in 1930, this is the one that looks. It's great fun and a good intro for Gilbert and Sullivan, but after that, get the Canadian Stratford version out and rent. You will see the difference between good and good. No one does G & S better than Brian McDonald and the Stratford group.
