It is probably the best series ever made (here is no argument about this) about Aardman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov, and beautiful Dale Arden traveling in a rocket to another universe to save the planet. Along the way, Flash and his friends, along with new friends such as Prince Barin, Prince Thun, and the awesome King Vultan, haunt their sources to fight the evils and armies of the ruthless Ming. from Mongo and the jealous betrayal of his daughter Priness Aura (now she is a car!). This range is not just a cut above most ranges in terms of plot, acting and budget - it is miles ahead in these areas. Produced by Universal Studios, it has many former sets on its disposable such as The Bride or Frankenstein Laboratory and The Phantom of the Opera's Opera House to name but a few. The production values ​​across the board were advanced in 1936 in my most humble opinion. The costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and top notch. We get hawk men, sharks, lions, high priests, creatures like dragons, octas bags, orango pods and tigrons (oh me!) And many, many other great things. Are all of them promising and first-class special effects? Not at all. But for 1936 the most impressive. The musical score is wonderful and the chapter is well-written, long enough to revive and gain expert reminders of the previous chapter. Director Frederick Stephani does a wonderful job all together wonderfully and creates a worthy movie for Alex Raymond's phenomenal comic strip. Lastly, the acting is pretty good in this series. All too often, serials also have no names with no talent around one or two former talents. Here, most of them all have a little ability. Don't get me wrong, it's not a Shakespeare troop, but Buster Crabbe does a real, fun job like Flash. He is greatly supported by Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson, and the rest of the role in general with two outstanding artists. But before I get to the two, I have to add as another reviewer who noticed, it should be great for this series to get to the Hayes office. I see more flesh on Flash and on Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson than in decades later. The shorts Crabbe (and unfortunately for us all, Professor Zarkov ((Frank Shannon)) wears, is about a form of shorts that guys can wear. Talent, but she is a blonde bombshield. and sensual and beautiful, but for me, the two actors making the series, Charles Middleton as Ming: officious, sardonic, ruthless and fun Lipson plays King Vultan: boisterous, rousing, hilarious - a symbol of pure joy in life and every essence of hedonism, Lipson steals every scene he's in. The plot twists here, anywhere - but Flash Gordon is the penultimate serial, space-opera, and the base for many science fiction to follow.
