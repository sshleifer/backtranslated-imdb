I heard about this series in 2001, a friend of mine was off the television every week. I never bothered to watch the series familiar with the series I watched occasionally in bookshops. I recently purchased a DVD series and became addicted to this fascinating and original series. The characters initially seem unlikely, but it's amazing how fast they grow and develop into a united power. As they start caring for one another, it's easy to give what happens to them (keep in mind it's just a TV series and they're fictitious). <br /> <br /> But it's not Star Trek's computer world and so while each character shows a good feature, they each have their own mistakes and demons with which to act. Individual story lines mixed with an overall multiple story arc make this one of the most complex and rewarding television experiences I've ever had the pleasure of watching. I absolutely enjoy interacting with each of the characters. <br /> <br /> This strange new world with which we are introduced is depicted brilliantly by astronaut John Crichton, and as he learns and adapts to the other side of the galaxy, strange alien creatures, different cultures, being hunted through a character who wants to die and be treated by his comrades as inferior, we can easily relate to what he should feel. As he gets used to his surroundings, the viewers and his compassionate, courageous and brave character are a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> I just watched seven episodes of Farscape season one and look forward to continuing through two and four seasons and the mini series. Maybe someday we can all enjoy a season five. Highly recommended display and worth checking out time. Buy and enjoy! 10/10.
