Mute Witness is a modest but very solid piece that never really received the attention or good comment it deserves. The movie ?? written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller ?? is a tense action-packed thriller with black comedy and horror influences. No useless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twists ?? Just straight to the point mystery. Mute Witness maintains the fierce topic of "snuff" movies and is effective in Russia. *** SPOILERS *** Since the production costs are cheaper there, a US film moves to Russia temporarily to shoot a horror movie. An old hangar is used as a movie spot. The female makeup artist of the team is accidentally locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out, she sees the recordings of an authentic snuff movie! She was caught trying to escape, but as she was a dumb, she couldn't cry for help, nor could she explain what she had seen the police properly. The girl's life is now in real danger, as there is a whole hidden network behind these snuff productions and they don't want the witnesses to be alive ?? *** End Spoilers ***. Mute Witness contains several highly exciting action series and is rather bloody. Some of the mysterious clues are kept secret until the end. As for the similar subject, I say it's definitely better than the more well-known "8mm", led by Joel Schumacher and with Nicolas Cage. The play in Mute witness is not good, but the leading actress (whose Russian herself) looks really cute. Mr. Alec Guinness also makes a special look. And a very cool one, may I say. Certainly recommended with guaranteed fun and fright.
