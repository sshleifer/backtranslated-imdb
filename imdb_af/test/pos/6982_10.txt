(VERY LIGHT decay) <br /> <br /> I have to start by saying that I'm not normally impressed by science fiction, so Pitch Black (2000) was a pleasant surprise. It chopped me from the start with rhythm, intensity and visual eruption that fascinated me and glued it to my seat. I'm very happy to say that this movie was the best (okay, at least one of the best) science fiction pieces I've seen long ago. <br /> <br /> The plot In short, it may simply seem: a (space) ship falls on a so-called abandoned planet and captain, Caroline Fry (impressive Radha Mitchell), must lead the survivors to safety. Initially, a cold-blooded killer, Riddick (Vin Diesel, who plays the role of a very credible savings style) may look like the group's biggest problem, but when the twilight begins to creep, the creatures of the creatures begin ... a desperate attempt to escape from the bloodthirsty predators, which, as we all guess, does not lead to a happy family picnic. It's not the plot itself that makes the movie worth looking at - - Let's see it, if you deduce it on the basics, it's not * that * original - but the skill it tells . The story flowed forward, didn't let me in any stage leave (at least not much). The directing was fantastic work. It was a very visual, even beautiful film; the purple night view was a real surprise. Though, 'pretty' may not be the right word to use; Yes, the images shown were candy for the eye, but they also have a touch of unspecified grotesqueness, eeriness, as if something just under the quiet surface would erupt. (Not to mention that the monsters did really well, they looked realistically, and it looks scarce at present. [Maybe people just can't be bothered to really make them look ...]) <br /> < br> I not only enjoyed the visual side of the movie, but also the psychological aspect of the story. During the movie we see the characters unraveled - some of them fall, some of them rise - but what fascinated me the most was the development of Riddick's character. I enjoyed watching the change in him through the movie. To go further, the other thing I enjoyed very much with Riddick was the incredibly good and originally performed UST (Unresolved Sexual Stress) between Fry and him who didn't do it (you'll get what I mean when you see it). [One cannot deny that they have chemistry. Don't even try or I'll figure you out and let you listen to eating Chopsticks until you scream * grin *] It was fresh. As Radha Mitchell agreed (a modified quote), "Pitch Black is a very sexy movie with no sex," which makes it even more interesting. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize, I recommend this movie - even if you're not really a fan of 'space stories'. The tension was kept to the end, and what was important was we (or at least I was) who wanted more. If you can't be bothered to think of psychology, subtext and such (like my bad habit), you'll still find Pitch Black very entertaining. Just kick off your shoes and enjoy.
