This movie is all that a Tenacious D fans can hope for. Director Liam Lynch jointly with the "D" is a fusion of epic relationships. Of course, you need to understand the humor and format of Tenacious D. When I saw this, there was not too much laughter from the audience, but the reason was not a lack of humor or intelligent jokes. This movie seems to have been released to an unsuspecting audience who did not reveal themselves to the musical duo. This movie remains true to its roots. For the few of you who have seen the HBO TV series and heard the album, they have not forgotten what their audience loves. Like the TV show, people from the trailer have seen the JB and KG flat-panel TVs and, of course, the open Mic nights that start and end every Tenacious D episode. The soundtrack is phenomenal and every song blows you away. <br /> <br /> ... and Dave Grohl plays a fantastic devil. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect movie for those looking for a hard time and a rocking musical.
