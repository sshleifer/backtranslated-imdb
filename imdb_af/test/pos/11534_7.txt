So this is not an epic, but for people who experience anything similar <br /> <br /> (brothers or suicide), it can be an interesting way of therapy. A <br /> <br /> imaginative story and some good acting make it time well. <br /> <br /> spend. For some reason it's not really caught up in the audience, <br /> <br /> something I believe is a result of the main theme. Why did she <br /> <br /> commit suicide? Obviously, this is hardly anything that American <br /> <br /> filmmakers would fold up, if it were a European production <br /> <br /> it would probably have reached its audience much more br /> <br /> size. However, it is a movie that, although realism is embarrassed by a glittering romantic glow, impresses the viewer with a whole heart <br /> <br />.
