I just watched this movie for the first time, and I have to say I'm very impressed. <br /> <br /> How dark. How full of despair. How nightmare. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Visually amazing, several scenes are embedded in my mind ... the first appearance of the phantom car ... the soul of David Holm as it rises from his body ... his spirit on his knees, plead. <br /> <br /> This movie takes a simple story - that of the haunted driver of the ghost truck, doomed to collect the souls of the dead for a year - bring it into the current environment of the movie and then use flashbacks as a way to explain how David Holm ends up in his trouble. <br /> <br /> I'd love to see it on DVD so more can see it. Everyone should.
