A variation of the same plot line was used in a Simon & Simon Thin Air episode originally broadcast in Dec 1982. <br /> <br /> The gender of the victim has changed, the surviving spouse is one of Rick's "old flames". It is also interesting to note that Gerald McRaney played a role in this Rockford file section. <br /> <br /> Both episodes are based on a story by Howard Browne - as shown in the list of 'write credits'. <br /> <br /> Anthony James plays one of his classic TV bad guys roles. <br /> <br /> Continuing the concept between the Rockford files and Magnum PI to Simon and Simon is very interesting.
