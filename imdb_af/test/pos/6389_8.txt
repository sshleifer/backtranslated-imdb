The Psychopath (1973) A trip down memory avenue. I watched this movie many years ago on an old black and white tsv. A children's show host, Mr. Rabbey denies the brutal abuse that parents attributed to his kiddie fans. Mr. Rabbey (who looks like he's always about to lose it) finally breaks and decides to go on a hunting trip. Be aware of bad parents, because Mr. Rabbey is on trial! What happens next is invaluable. Finding this movie will be a bit. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie remarkable was the fact that Joe "Maniac" Spinell made a short promo for a movie based on this one. In his unfinished film he plays Mr. Robbie, e.g. Clown (who looks like a pudgy out of shape Edward James Olmos) who deprives his young fans of abuse by going to their parents. Unfortunately, Mr Spinell can never get the funds to complete the project. The film was titled Maniac II: "Mister Robbie". Rabbey or Robbie's agreements are too close for comfort. Very violent for a P.G. film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
