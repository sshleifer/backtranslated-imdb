Duckman was a show that turned on during the last hour or so before sleeping about ten or so years ago. It was a contrast to much of the child-type animation I was watching at the moment; I was still a little junkie for Disney and Looney Tunes, and most Saturday morning, cartoons were still the highlight of the days of Ninja Turtles and Batman. But also around this time I began to realize that the more racial, mature, surreal, obscene and (although I don't know the term in time) satirical cartoon programs were more creative than the things I was used to. Around the time of Beavis and Butt-head, Ren and Stimpy, and even The Maxx hit TV sets via MTV. USA performed two shows - one of which was Weird Science, and the other was Duckman. I've always remembered a few key pieces of the show, and some of the lines are very quirky for those who haven't completely forgotten it. Luckily, I recently found a band with about six episodes that I tackled long ago, and the jokes remained very fresh. And delivering the jokes is very fast in the better episodes. <br /> <br /> In the voice department, the choices in talent are, moreover, for story lines, which are usually just an excuse for crude, fascinating parodies of pop culture, politics, movies and TV shows, music, detectives, and the dysfunctional family unit. Jason Alexander is a great choice for Duckman, and his performances are a comic 180 out of his days at Seinfeld (even though there may be similar features here and there). Also the voices of Gregg Berger as the unmistakably monotonous and deadpan Cornfed, Dweezil Zappa as the hilariously inept Ajax, and Nancy Travis as the sex-enhanced, petty sister-in-law Bernice, all contribute to a full amount. Along with some good writing - even when a joke isn't sure, the white compensates for it - the animation style, which is far from the reformed, computer-made product from today, is resourceful and often abstract. It has that homemade, bad quality that Beavis and Butt-head or South Park will have later. And as it shows, if you're a kid, I mean a bit like younger than I watched the show. You may not understand most of the jokes (ie there are enough stripper and VD references to fill two shows). But it is resourceful to catch up on TV late in the evening, and it works quite well in that time slot. One can only hope for a DVD set. <br /> <br /> So, for anyone who has hardly ever heard of this program, here is a common note: think of this show as if Dashiell Hammett met Walt Disney and decided to join go from Vegas with a free mini-bar and combine the aura of Luis Bunuel and The Simpsons. Not to mention, it's by the group that Rugrats did. (Strong) A
