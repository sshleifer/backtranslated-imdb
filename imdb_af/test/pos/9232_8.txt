Someone once defined what the definition of an INTELLECTUAL is: "A person who can listen to" The William Tell Overture "without thinking of the LONE RANGER!" We warmly agree! It would definitely be a long time to achieve this, and one that Leopold Stokowski, Arturo Toscanini or Leon Bernstein would all find close, is impossible to do. <br /> <br /> There is no shame in this. The radio series and the television series, along with some movie series, feature films, syndicated newspaper and comic books, all played their part in the deep seed element of the "Masked Man of the Plains and his faithful Indian companion, Tonto". make. of our collective psyche and of our literary folklore. <br /> <br /> As with most legends, it all started gradually, first with a series of Radio Plays, written for local use in Detroit over Radio Station WXYZ. The Creator was one George W. Trendle and the lead author on the series was Mr. Trendle's brother-in-law, Mr. Fran Striker. The year was 1933 when the Ranger first drove to the Plains of Early Western United States! The Lone Ranger, Tonto and the Radio series have successfully led depression-era Americans through the late 30s to World War II. But the post-war era found the country in the midst of a Super-Nova explosion of invention and technology. There was a new communication medium ready in the wings but could not continue until VE Day and VJ Day were reached. Once reached, the world and America were ready to settle for both peace and prosperity. Of course, the "New Technology" was TELEVISION! And we'll certainly need something other than "Roller Derby" and "Wrestling From Marigold Arena" to fill the broadcast times. And the first time a TV station had nothing, except that portrait of that Mohican chief (Test Pattern, Schultz!) The Networks quickly and gradually started typing their existing natural resources, their existing programming! Almost everyone will be ripe for adaptation to the TV screen. <br /> <br /> So, the people at Lone Ranger, Incorporated, were very interested when producers Jack Chertok, Harry Poppe, Sherman Harris and Jack Wrather all approached them with an agreement on The Masked Man and Tonto on the to place television waves as well as the radio. <br /> <br /> They immediately went to work and gave us the first season, which made use of the considerable backlog of Radio Dramas, all possibly adaptable to TV dramas. They throw Clayton Moore, a very supportive film actor, with about a dozen years of experience. He also did some work in Serials at Republic Pictures, "Thrill Factory", which would be invaluable to do "THE LONE RANGER". Thrown as his "faithful Indian companion" and partner to bring Justice to various parts of the border, we had our perfect character in supporting actor Jay Silverheels. ** We have to mention that there was a gulf in about '53, when Clayton Moore walked and was replaced by John Hart. After a season, Mr. Moore missed again! Now, back to our story !! The first years of filming gave the episodes a glimpse and a sound of their own. They made good use of the screen Narrator, which gave these shows a sense of authenticity and an individual, outstanding one of a kind range. The actors employed were all the late-era era movie veterans until the 1930s and 1940s. Many were just about exclusive Cowboy Movie players. A good example of this is the decision by Glenn Strange (Bartender Sam on "GUNSMOKE") as the cruel, murderous Gang Leader Butch Cavandish. And it was the Cavendish gang's Texas Rangers massacre that led to the rise of John Reid (supposedly killed with the other Texas Rangers) than the "LONE RANGER". <br /> <br /> In addition to the old timers in the cast, you'll find many new and emerging talent in the cast. We see people like Phyllis Coates, Dwayne Hickman, Denver Arrows and others in the role from week to week. All this, along with an everlasting appeal to fair play, justice and peace in a Western world. <br /> <br /> The last few seasons have made major changes. First, the use of color filming. It made no difference if a color TV set was far from our household. The second was a new set of musical themes and queues. (Unlike Rossini's Final of "Your NO WUT!") The new music was never a big problem for us, because we chose the "old radio" inventory. <br /> <br /> With this series and two Feature Movies During this period, the Lone Ranger (Warner Brothers, 1956) and THE LONE RANGER AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD (United Artists, 1958), the character is permanent and indelible in our identity as a people, our Americans!
