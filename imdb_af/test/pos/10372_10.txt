After the funeral was absolutely fantastic, and by far the best episode of the season. I was disappointed with Cards On the Table, which started so well, but has declined significantly over the past half hour, and I didn't know what to think of the Taking After the Flood, although I remember being confused. After the funeral, as I said, one of my favorite Poirot episodes, with five little pigs, Sad Cypress and The ABC Murders. I was afraid they would destroy the story, but instead it is very faithful to the book. Now I'll say I don't care about changes to books, and try not to compare movies and TV adjustments to their sources, unless the book is a masterpiece and the adaptation doesn't do it right. That's why I didn't like some of the Marples, like Nemesis and Sleeping Murder, and so far from the Poirotte. The murder of Roger Ackroyd, taken at the flood and maps on the table, is the only one that really disappointed. Everything else varies from good to outstanding, even the recent appointment with death, despite the many deviations of the book, which I acknowledge is not a favorite, was surprisingly good, thanks to the wonderful production values, star ensemble performances and excellent music score. Back to After the funeral, the production values ​​are fantastic. It has a very cinematic feel to it, and the beautiful photography and beautiful scenery and costumes made it a visual feast for the eyes. The music was very ruddy and even haunting, and the whole movie gives great performances. David Suchet is, like Poirot, impeccable, and Geraldine James and Anna Calder Marshall are just as fantastic. But for me Monica Dolan was Mrs. Gilchrist, she is there with Donald Sumpter and Polly Walker as the best supporting actor / actress in a Poirot episode. This is how good her performance was. All in all, one should also see one of the best Poirot episodes by far and one of the more faithful people. 10/10 Bethany Cox
