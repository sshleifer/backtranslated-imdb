I had a few free tickets via the Times to watch this little, well-known Irish movie, called "Inside I Dancing" ... I didn't know anything about it, so I hadn't previously thought about it. <br /> <br /> The movie is about two guys restricted to their wheelchairs and living in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from Muscular Dystrophy (please excuse any spelling errors!). They form a connection, since Rory is the only person who can understand what Michael says. They eventually leave home to stay in an apartment in Carrigmore. They immediately use the help of an attractive girl (Romola Garai) to care for them. The two friends eventually fall in love with the same woman. It's the story in a nutshell, but there's a lot of laughter and tears along the way ... in fact ... unprepared like I was .. I found the tears flowing too much! In reality! I don't think I screamed so much to watch a movie since The Elephant Man !!! This movie is a BIG drain on the emotions ... both in fun things and sad things. The acting is absolutely spot on! James McAvoy is my hint of greatness ... he is a great Irish actor and I think he has a good future ahead of him. Steven Robertson, who plays Michael, was also wonderful ... and it wasn't until today that I found out he didn't suffer from Cerabal Parese and it was just a great play! Brenda Fricker is also in this movie, and plays the part of the Home Manager very well. The other big part must be Romola Garai, she was wonderful as a love affair, and I think we'll see more of her on the big screen in the near future! <br /> <br /> The thing that makes this movie work is not just the synergies between the two clues, but the writing ... that's just #### greasy it's literally on fire! I still can't help repeating some of the lines in my head. <br /> <br /> Photography is good, although it is very dark, but then it is a certain type of Ireland. The music is also nice in this movie as well as the choice in Songs. The use of the Johnny Cash cover of the Nine-In-Nails track 'Hurt' is inspired! <br /> <br /> If I had to sum up this movie in one word, it would be 'emotional'. This movie is very funny ... and then in the turn of a coin it is very sad! I still can't believe it was two days after I watched the movie and I both laughed and almost crying! This movie is incredible ... and I hope it goes far! Although I can't see it, its advertising budget is probably very small! <br /> <br /> That's how it looks! I encourage you ... you won't regret it ...
