This movie had a clear Woody Allen feel about it, so if you're not a fan of dry humor, dark humor or humorous humor, you'll probably find something else to do. However, if you are this, it is strange, with some nice twists and a smooth natural dialogue. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty tempting, not quite like a train wreck from which you can't disconnect, but close. I mean this in the best possible way. The intrigues are enough, the twists are enough to fully engage the senses, and the characters really love it. <br /> <br /> I had a good time with this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a 8.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
