Rowan Atkinson's mr. Bean is also there with Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and other comedy greetings. I have never seen people laughing out loud and literally falling out of their chairs, like when I told them. Bean suggested through my videos and now DVDs. I will never forget for the first time that my brother saw him. He was over for a visit and I asked him if he would. Bean ever seen. "Who?" he said. Then I got out my video and showed him the one where Mr. Bean in the church is starting to nod. My brother laughed so loudly that he fell out of the chair and held his stomach to laugh so loudly. He has a direct fan of Mr. Bean became. We all know how hilarious these episodes are, but the fun is to share them with others. I saw how many people laugh "to it hurt! Favorite episodes are: The Queen's visit, the hotel room remains late for the dentist appointment, the Christmas episode (a classic ... plus kids love it!) And The New Year Party Rowan Atkinson is a comic genius!
