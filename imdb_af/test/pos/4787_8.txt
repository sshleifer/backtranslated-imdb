I caught it on community TV a few years ago and was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable a movie was. <br /> <br /> While a bit of fun in certain ways, as the first function of being a mystery, it works beautifully, thanks to a manuscript that elicits an ingenious plot; This guessed me throughout and the decision was inspired. <br /> <br /> The movie is a star-studded one that contains a mix of those at the end of their careers (indeed Richard Long died the same year), or those on the edge of the stars. the TV series (Kate Jackson, Tom Bosley) was. They all do a good job, with the exception of Cesare Danova who sleeps through his role. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
