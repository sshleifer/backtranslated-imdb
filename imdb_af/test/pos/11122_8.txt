Fame is one of the best movies I've seen from The Performing Arts. The music and the acting are excellent. The script and Set Design is also excellent. My favorite part is when all the students start dancing and making music in the Canteen. I can see this movie any number of times and never get bored. I give it 8 1/2 to 10.
