An intelligent and well-earned movie that is worth exporting! <br /> <br /> In this exciting and really intelligent movie that is completely filmed in Bogotá, you can feel the total meaning of the word "Bluff" (although it is a Colombian movie, the title is presented in English) ; ! <br /> <br /> The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who finds his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine, then Nicolas without girl and leaving without work. Nicolas's revenge after Mallarino is to follow him and get pictures of him with his new relationship, Alexandra (Carolina Gomez), to blackmail Mallarino to get money in change not to show the photos to Margarita. <br /> <br /> The story is very intelligent and well-related, to the point that you fully understand the meaning of the title, the movie shows excitement with many comic scenes and characters, which gives a pleasure to someone who enjoys the movies focused on good writing. <br /> <br /> I can see that this film is different from the typical Colombian movies that show that it's a dark and violent image of our beautiful country, which is something really refreshing. Some critics say this story does not show the Colombian typical way of life, so it can be kept in any part of the world. I disagree: (1) the film is completely filmed in Bogotá, so you can see streets, and images of the right Colombian capital (I hope some American people and film producers see it so they stop Amazonic jungle, or Mexican small villages in Bogota, such as on some Hollywood movies), (2) the characters, dialogues, accent exception of Nicolas coming from Argentina) are completely from here, Rosemary (Veronica Orozco) has a distinctive feature of Cali , (3) you can also see social and cultural differences from the common people in Bogotá. I hope all these, plus an English title, move people from other countries to see this masterpiece of Martinez. <br /> <br /> Excellent performance by Veronica Orozco, Luis Eduardo Arango (detective Wilson Montes), Felipe Botero, outstanding as detective Ricardo Peres, and good acting of Mallarino, Catalina Aristizabal and Federico Lorusso. <br /> <br /> A worthwhile movie will surely understand and enjoy people from all over the world! Don't miss this movie 9/10!
