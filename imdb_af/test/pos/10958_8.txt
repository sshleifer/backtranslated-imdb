Seven months since a revelation of Faces, I finally found a rentable DVD copy of Cassavetes's first feature. Shadows was on a screen in Manhattan and in his acting workshop on ad hoc sets, Shadows was the highlight of months of improvisation rehearsals, in which (mostly amateur) actors developed ties with each other, invented their characters and polished their techniques giving their filmed performances is just the right thing about spontaneous familiarity. This intimate approach has led to an incredible brave work in Faces. In other words, Seymour Cassel cut his hands off Lynn Carlin's throat in an attempt to relive her from an overdose? Just like the actors' full conviction here, honest moments such as Lelia and Tony's post-financial evaluation of their relationship and Ben's aversion due to a black woman's touch as a manifestation of his racial confusion and self-denial. A best-in-class home-made production, out-of-sync dubbing and audio recording, and granular cinematography and up-close camera setup, build an impressive atmosphere that perfectly matches Cassavetes' nuanced vision of human relationships as eternal works that is underway, marked by desperate emotional fluctuations and volatile attempts at communication and understanding. Charles Mingus's largely improvised jazz score is an ideal complement to the movie's vision of life at the moment, a mantra that Cassavetes worked on and apparently lived.
