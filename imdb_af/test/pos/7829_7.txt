Snakes on a plane were such a well-filmed movie that it was both inevitable and a bit crazy to get another movie with almost the same title to get rid of in the same year, the same week. Read the other comments here. I see the results. Many people are crazy. Paint because it does not have the best special effects. Template because it doesn't have a star cast. Madam because they wanted to see Samuel Jackson say, "I'm sick of this M ^ * & * &% - Er F * ^ (^% - Include Snakes on this M ^ * & * &% - Is F * ^ (^ % -No Train "! <br /> <br /> Well, it's definitely not the Samuel Jackson version. And maybe it's good. <br /> <br /> Snakes on a plane are lost between police film and horror, a family action movie and a bloody gory movie of death Saturday night Live artists laughed while Jackson swore enough to cover a grandmother, and as far as children go, they will traumatize through violence <br /> <br /> Snakes on a train knew exactly what it was, it was a cheap horror movie on a train.Sure it had snakes and many of them were scientifically harmless garden hoses with fake rattler sound effects, it misses a step in his plot or intent, where the "on a plane" version throughout the self was off the first scene. <br /> <br /> I have the cute enjoy fun who had to offer snakes on an airplane and I admit the "... on a train version was a bit dry. But hey, in trade it was a cool and unexpected story. This little horror movie could have gone much more wrong than it did. <br /> <br /> It gets a 7 out of 10.
