A pretty interesting look at some characters from India's emerging middle class. Although India is modernizing rapidly, its culture does not stop. This film involves the patriarchal society, where women are not really free citizens. A land of regular marriages, men with mistress with total impunity, and women who will tolerate all of this, will eventually fail. I was impressed with Nandita Das, who was attractive and played her character with total seriousness. But I was even more impressed with Shabana Azmi, who I understand is a long-term game of Bollywood. Her quiet beauty and low-key psychic suffering were excellent. The lesbian subtext of this movie was never particularly erotic and never titled. (Darn!) A look for those interested in many different cultures.
