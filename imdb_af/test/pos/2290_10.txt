Restore the Oscars from 1992, and this movie may be nominated, or even win. It was so good to capture his era and dual cultures that belong to American and Japanese time capsules. If you wanted to know what was here or there, it was back then this movie will show you. As an American you will feel that you have been marked for an extensive Japanese holiday, and by the end of the movie you will be a difficult Dragons fan, as you accept the injection of Japanese tradition and culture into their baseball. Much like we did with our culture in our own game. <br /> <br /> Jack Elliot (Tom Selleck) is an obsolete Detroit Tigers slugger traded to the Dragons, perennial runners up to the dynamic Yomuri Giants, Japan's Yankees response. The Giants are admired for their success, but the success also has all that they want to surpass, something that is rarely done. The Dragons driver recruits Jack as the final piece of the winning winning puzzle, and we stayed with what Gung Ho could have been on a baseball field, but much more. <br /> <br /> The casting was excellent: Selleck proved that he could carry a movie as well as his television program with a good script and a character that fit him, and the Japanese role was just as good, to Mr. Takagi van Die Hard back as the image-conscious owner. The other actors, including the one who plays the love interest (also the driver's daughter), strong and independent, but at the same time a believer in Japanese traditions, beyond what was forced on her. She is a good and supportive friend to Jack. Even her dad never tells her to see him, almost sympathetic to Jack for what he holds off her and relieves a little, at least he knows the man she chose to love. <br /> <br /> The baseball scenes are huge, greatly enhanced by a pre-fame Dennis Haysbert as another American ex-patriate and Jack's western mentor. The usual fish-out-of-water elements are there and you can hardly find yourself struggling with Jack to fit into a country that doesn't speak our language, and don't practice our ways, but copy everything we do , including our national pastime. One of the cleaner scenes occurs when Jack, who holds a magazine, informs his manager that he has learned the tradition in Japan where you can get drunk and tell your boss and it can't be used against you and practice it right very humorous. The plots and subplots are tied neatly to the end, but not too neat, and nothing is unrealistically closed. <br /> <br /> To name it, a comedy is wrong: it is a pure comedy drama or even a drama with good humor. The plot is too deep to reject it as criticized as an actor from his league, trying to wear a lightweight film. The situations were amusing, but in their place against a much more serious, in-depth and precisely detailed background that resulted in one of the best movies I've ever seen. Baseball cinematography is in line with For Love Of The Game, for realism. Some say the movie is about baseball, or about Japan, but more than anything that looks like it's about the workplace and how people come to work from completely different origins, with different agendas, and somehow need to set aside differences for the sake of the business, or the team. <br /> <br /> A real, fantastic movie that should never have been disregarded. for himself the way it did when it was in theaters.
