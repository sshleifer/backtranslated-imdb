Highly politically charged drama that, while biased, is extremely well handled and one of the most intelligent movies ever made. It contains virtually no preaching, but rather follows a naive TV reporter who gradually realizes the threat posed by nuclear power plants, not because of inherent danger, but because traders are more interested in the bottom line than in the safety of that affected. <br /> <br /> Many have hated the movie because they saw it as a political channel made by ultra-liberals such as Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas, but if you only consider it a drama, gripping, exciting, full of well-developed, distinctive characters and ultimately a truly exciting contemporary thriller touching the house. <br /> <br /> Historical note: For some, especially those in the energy industry and residents of the Harrisburg, PA metro area, it may have been too close to home. As less than a week after this film was released, the devastating blast occurred at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility. <br /> <br /> Update, 04/08/2007: In the almost a decade since I wrote this criticism, I heard a lot of comments on the movie. One thing I think should really be noticed is that this movie is not the "ultra-liberal" anti-nuclear tirade, often called. <br /> <br /> While the makers and stars (or were) notable Hollywood establishments liberal, which these film attacks are not at the heart of nuclear power, but rather the idea of ​​human greed, corruption and fallacy to the potential dangers of compromise something that has already made nature dangerous. <br /> <br /> No one who accepts reality can dispel the fact that human exposure to nuclear radiation is at least fatal. Close friends of mine who worked for a number of years at a nuclear power plant even told me about their employer's official policy on the maximum "safe" exposure that their employees could handle. <br /> <br /> You don't have to believe those corporations are inherently angry to accept that individuals, in the pursuit of wealth and power, are greedy and often corrupt. And even if you refuse the claim, you can't dispute that all people tend to make mistakes. When we expose innocent people to nuclear radiation, we can't afford mistakes, and that's more than anything the argument this movie is trying to do. Damn it if you have to, but try to have a little perspective. We are currently engaged in a war whose ongoing results are completely different from those originally predicted, an incredibly expensive war with no end in sight. And whether you feel the war was needed to fight global terrorism, you can't deny the reality that the length, financial cost and greatest loss of human life exceeded the levels the "experts" surpassed . us from back in 2003. So even if no one is involved greedy or corrupt, "bugs are made," and bugs of a fairly serious size, to begin. The same kind of serious mistakes, if allowed in the nuclear industry, can make many of the earth's surface uninhabitable.
