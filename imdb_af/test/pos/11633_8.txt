I don't understand why everyone hates Barney. If you hate the show so much, you shouldn't see it! She's stupid how everyone changes the "I love you" boy to "I hate you." If you don't like it, it's good. Whatever, this is your opinion. But there's no point in humiliating the show when it's not even that bad. Okay, so she's corny, and yes, it has its faults, but it's a kid's program. Children do not want to be sad and unhappy, they want to be happy. And Barney helps it. And even in the show, there are moments of sadness and anger and so on. And yes, Barney uses magic. But the children see Barney as an imagination of imagination. Children have a place to escape to express themselves. The world is an unfortunate and difficult place. We all need a place to express ourselves and be happier. Barney does it for us. This show is wonderful. I watched Barney when I was younger. Yes, some people find it stupid. But I watched it, and I'm top of my class. It doesn't necessarily make you smarter, but it's not the point. I believe Barney's point is to provide a place where children can be children and the spirit of childhood can be expressed. Where imagination lives. So many teenagers are now unattractive and are afraid to express themselves. Barney helps it. Barney helped me not to be scared and just show me who I am. I am now a newcomer to high school, an AP student with a 4.0, a drama student with a love of theater and art, and a new baby cousin who loves Barney. I watch it with him and enjoy it and sing along with it. Yes, it's skinny and stupid, and whatever, but it's great for kids. Who wants to be an adult who doesn't have time to have fun? I am a child of heart and I like Barney. It's great for kids and those who are a child at heart. <br /> <br /> It's a great show for babies and toddlers. So stop with hatred. Say you don't like it, but stop it with the "Dumbest show ever" or "Barneys a load of bull" or whatever. Keep it to yourself. Take a cold pill or whatever. Here's something: I never liked Sesame Street. But you don't see me: "Grover is a cargo bull" or "Cookie Monster must die" or whatever. I hate all the BULLSS ** T people say about books or movies, like Barney or Twilight. If you hate it, okay, whatever. Nobody cares. Don't say that hate things are about it, cuz, you can just offend someone.
