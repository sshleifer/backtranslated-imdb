Niagra Niagra was definitely not the best movie I saw. However, I can't describe how the movie made me feel when I watched it and how I felt when it ended and also how I felt it now. Very few films have such an effect on me. I like them or I don't. I look at Niagra Niagra as a work of art. We all see something about it and it can remind us whether it can be fear or fun, etc. Cause ... This movie has me in the best mood. In fact, it made me feel empty in some way. I think that the lives of these two people were so empty in so many ways. They had no direction. Their only direction was to have no direction. They had a lot of trouble handling and I think it was necessary to get away from what could not have been a happy life. But on the way things just got worse. A steady decline from where it started. It was sad because it was so well behaved and I think we've probably seen someone in some situations that may somehow resemble the situation in which these people were. They might have had a good life if they had any idea. But it's clear they didn't know what to do. So they looked similar to where they heard. No real goal. They had no idea how to have a goal. They had no idea how to overcome the life ahead of them. I felt bad, but couldn't stop watching the movie. Only good actors can make me feel so much about a movie that I don't want if only someone played the parts. These two did a good job to the point you didn't just see. I am very impressed and want to buy the movie if it is available on DVD. You know. It made me feel like a Los Vegas exit. But again it is in a class of its own. Not a good movie, but worth having an hour or two. If you have a person with problems, I would not suggest you see it. It can make you depressed. It depressed me and I didn't have the conditions these people had. JimmyJoeJetter
