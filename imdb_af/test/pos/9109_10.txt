Call all D-sciples! Grab your friends, hit the theater and see hell out of this movie. From the opening order to the credits you will laugh your self. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wild ride through the history of the D, and not just a little bald list of the things they did, but a coronation of their rise to power. I'm a big fan of Rage Kage (Kyle Gass) and Jables (Jack Black), so of course I loved the movie. <br /> <br /> It helps to know the show they had and their first CD, but it's just as funny as you are. Of the hilarious and vulgar lyrics, the rocking rhythms, the massive amount of pot smoke, and the cameos, to the absolute madness of the story, it is a movie for D-skippers and newcomers. <br /> <br /> Many of their songs are referred to as Two Kings, Tribute and Kielbasa to their soundtracks like Cock Push-ups. Every fan in the audience will say that I remember that as well as new comers say "This is F a hilarious!" I recommend this movie to any body that has ever been eliminated. This movie is definitely in the high competition to be: "It is spinal tap." One of the best ever.
