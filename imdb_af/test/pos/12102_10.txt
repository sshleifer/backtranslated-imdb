If you are a fan of Turkish and Middle Eastern music, you are very lucky. This film is a documentary version of current music in Istanbul, which trains the traditional to the modern. It's very good. You can't do better if you went to Istanbul yourself. We interview Orhan Gencebay, concert clips of modern musical icons, a road show featuring a Romani (Gypsy) audience, Turkish Hip Hop (surprisingly good), and much more. Some of the best female vowels I've ever heard. A Kurdish woman singing in a hammam (steam bath) that will rip your heart. Very social and political background. If this is your thing, you will have a great time. I could barely sit in the theater. <br /> <br /> CD soundtrack is now available on Amazon. Expensive.
