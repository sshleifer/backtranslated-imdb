"Ideas are dangerous." Comments by one interviewer. <br /> <br /> DVD Score: B + / 4 out of 5/8 out of 10 / Time worth. <br /> <br /> A great story for adults / or teenagers, but not for kids. Not one of the stupid violent crime things so often ignored by Hollywood as "quality work." And it can be used as a training film about what proper boat preparation is all about, or not, before you sail the seven seas. The movie starts to slow down to develop the story as most documentaries do, but if it pulls the viewer into the saga, emotions start in your head! Emotions include anger, sadness and unbelief. The era: late 1960s. <br /> <br /> The solo that is dangerous around the world is not surprising. What is surprising is all the twists that viewers would not expect. It's not your average group of guys in a sailing race! Each boat was different as allowed by the racing rules. Each solo sailor has different levels of ability as allowed by the racing rules. There were well-known sailors among them and some not so well known. The one was regarded as a mysterious man, as no one had any knowledge of his ability. Each boat had to be allowed to leave as long as everyone was on a certain date. And it was, of course, for the modern electronics that allows boaters to communicate with shore over unholy storms, etc. <br /> <br /> Real video and audio recordings are interwoven with family and interview interviews. The mood of the interrogators is always gloomy, despite the years gone by. <br /> <br /> The main character, Don, was the focus of attention and how his journey was related to those he didn't just want to defeat, due to circumstances of his own creation. He had to win. The story was about what those circumstances did to his life, as he moved South West across the Atlantic over a year alone on the water. <br /> <br /> Do not leave the "special features" section of the DVD once the movie is finished. The whole saga is not fully understood, without seeing the 'bonus' things. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you watched everything on the DVD, you'll probably just shake and shout your head, "Wow." And remember, the story has lived alive for the past 40 years. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: DO NOT see the "special features" section of the DVD when the movie is finished. A sailor who returned to England after seeing the world, decided on the fly, no, he is going for another spin and the film shows his spouse's views on the decision. The opposite story unfolds as another sailor, because the race allowed two on board, so he could take his wife and show their photos a very hot union between them. The interview with a burley ex paratrooper, who actually had a boat across the Atlantic with a friend before the solo sailing race, was incredibly funny, as he described that he didn't even know how to sail and who thought the bad things were happening to him. 'Too many people think there can be a romantic adventure in the open sea without accident. Don't be one!
