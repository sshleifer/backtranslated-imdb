It is an OK early 80's horror flick in which a young girl (Meg Tilly) wants to shed her "goody two shoes" image and becomes part of a girl gang called The Sisters. Their initiation for her consists of the night in a mausoleum. Sorry, the mausoleum is the "final" resting place of some psycho-Russian psychologist and he is not yet completely dead. Seems like this man was found in his apartment, with many things holding his telekinetic targeting practice in the walls, plus there's a lot of young dead girls found in the cupboard. So all the evidence that walks can be dangerous is listening to girls. The man of the man (Reymar) is quite worried about her father's death and is confronted by a man who said he knew Reymar and also gave a band to listen too. Her hubby (Adam West, Batman's boast) is there to laugh and mock, and not much else. But it may seem that Reymar's daughter also has certain abilities she doesn't realize. Anyway, after depositing their unfortunate promise at the mausoleum, the rest of the sisters go out to get things (such as masks, sheets, etc.) to come back and scare the khaki out of her, but suspect little they keep going and they get more than the shit they scare. For even in death, Reymar is kind of a busy guy and he makes many bodies for entertainment. And it also seems as if he has a case for the prison bait. Overall, it's acceptable horror, nothing too intense, but not terrible either. The DVD of Media Blasters also contains a version of the movie that is a rough cut. I think I just looked at it a little so I didn't know how different it was from the theater release, but from what I saw, I think it's a "wart and all" presentation. 7 out of 10.
