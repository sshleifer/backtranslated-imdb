My kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got. it was fun a fun movie. We watched it as a family and all of us enjoyed it. It was a movie you could see without any uncomfortable spots you had to explain to the younger. my boys loved this movie and they would love to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my sons have crushed her. they loved her as the pink powerhouse and so we saw this movie to start with. (As you can tell, I run a bit to fill LOL lines). but seriously it is a fun movie and worth watching. Please give us a DVD or replay!
