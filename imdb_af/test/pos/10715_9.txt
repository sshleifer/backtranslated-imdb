Inexplicably, I watched this movie for the first time just a few days ago and understood from the beginning what all the fuss is about. This movie kept my attention from start to finish and ran me through the whole range of emotions (and helped me discover some I never knew.) <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman shines completely as Ted Kramer. He is absolutely convincing because a man needs to juggle at least three different challenges in life: a happy man, a work addict, an executive, and a loving father. Meryl Streep as Joanna Kramer was less central to the movie simply because Joanna was absent for a good part of it, but when she was on the screen, she gave Hoffman a run for his money. The real outlook, however, was (in my opinion) young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. Children are always the innocent victim in a marriage break, and Justin was completely natural and completely credible in this role, as with the contradictory emotions around his mother and his adaptation of life with dad, he was confused with why he should must leave his father when it was his mother who ran out on him. Young Justin did not leave a rhythm in this very difficult role. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an excellent Oscar-worthy movie, the only weak point I thought was a really disappointing decision to go for the juicy and happy ending, which was completely unrealistic in the light of the devastating conservation struggle that Ted and Joanna went through. But there is not much else to complain about. <br /> <br /> 9/10
