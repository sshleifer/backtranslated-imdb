This movie takes the voice of terror and makes it better. Holmes protects an inventor in Switzerland and is on the trail of Professor Moriarity, who became a Nazi. it is a better version of holmes in a WWII world. Rathbone does a good job with Holmes as a spy and a detective. see it if you keep the voice of terror.
