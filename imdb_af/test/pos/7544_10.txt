Alistair Simms is a wonder in this. He makes such a good headman. The role George Cole has given here is made for him. So, the decisive work on this movie was perfect. I think it was one of those rare occasions where everything was clicking. the story line was good, the comic dialogue screaming and the older prefect girls a pleasure !! Every character you practice, even the villains. Why can't we make movies like this anymore? Actually, it is a very English comedy with good movement and fluidity.
