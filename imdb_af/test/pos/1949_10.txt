I didn't expect much from this movie, it's just one of those movies I thought I'd just watch, because it was on television. I definitely underestimated this movie. <br /> <br /> It's about a man who kills his girlfriend and boasts his friends. I was very happy with the acting, they played the characters well. It was a special scene when Feck (Dennis Hopper) and John (Daniel Roebuck) talked about why John Jamie was murdered. It is disturbing to hear how he explains that he wants to feel controlled and that's why. But Feck loved the girl he killed. Feck felt remorse while John felt nothing. He was proud of what he did. It really makes you think of people. Keanu Reeves did a good job as Matt, and Ione Skye was good. It's strange to see her as a valedictor in Say Anything and her as Clarissa. Each actor did well to act. It was really nice for a change. It was a good movie and I would definitely recommend I recommend it.
