It was on the second night on Showtime, and I thought it would be another video for a video, such as "Earth vs the Spider" or any other HBO horror pants. Instead, I got a comedy / gore classic. It was legally funny, and surprisingly the play was pretty good. Even my wife, an overall horror hater, agreed and was laughing at parts. In addition, the FX was of high quality. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie felt like a parody of Joy Ride / Jeepers Creepers, and the 2 main characters reminded me of the pair of Shaun of the Dead. Definitely worth looking at, but don't take it seriously. <br /> <br /> The end.
