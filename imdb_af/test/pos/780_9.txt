I cannot agree with a previous comment that 'Driving Lessons' is more than a little two, but one man's charge is another's endorsement, I think. In my book, this film succeeds on pure charm, not a small thing in itself. <br /> <br /> I can't help but the story was a little less conventional given the amount of acting talent in it, but by the end the plot looks more than a background for character interactions anyway. Julie Walters's Lady Evie is a glorious top and over the hill actress. Although Evie did not have steady work for many years, it is unclear the last time she visited reality. As ever (think of AbFab's Edina at 65, one day she was even forced to take her kitsch factor.) Some may find her annoying, but I think it's the point to just emphasize how much she's reserved Ben's (Rupert) Gravel pushes buttons to force him out of his shell. Ben is equally isolated from reality, and his whole life lives under the thumb of his overly dependent mother, whom Laura Linney manages to breathe into life, despite being a fairly one-dimensional character (you are excessive religious mother). I was quite impressed with Rupert Grint, who I found to give a very honest and credible performance (not to mention so much love as all election). I can't think of many teenage actors I can say today. <Br /> <br /> The heart of the movie is what happens when Ben and Evie's world clash. Initially Ben is understandable for the time being, but also intrigued, since Evie is essentially the exact opposite of everything he ever knows. With the combination of Evie's persistence and Ben's helpfulness, a real sweetness develops between them, culminating in an unlikely road trip that Ben gives his first true taste of independence. <br /> <br /> Even though some short melodramatic bits are consistent, the tone is consistently light, but there was still a surprising amount of emotional resonance, a credit to the lead players. In short, I want to say if you are willing to sit back and love yourself with good performances, "Driving Lessons" should not disappoint. But if 'cute' isn't in your movie vocabulary, it's best to stay away. <br /> <br /> Another small note, the soundtrack contains the music of Sufjan Stevens prominently, a fun touch.
