You know you look softcore with the wrong attitude as the bad double bother you. I'm okay with the crappy lip synchronization, but the sound mix is ​​really too. Every time someone says something, it sounds like there's a narrator. Either way, it is almost the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly Joe D'Amato movie that includes cannibalism and what is not. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair amount of exploitation in this one, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser stars, and that's good because she's hot. It's a little freaky how you can sometimes see her leg structure, but she still rules over her white counterpart. You can also make a cool drink game of how often she takes her kit. Often. Every reason is good. Every person is good. Every place is good. One scene even involves a whole hockey team, which they do in Africa anyway. Sometimes the plot gets in the way, and the supporting role play consists of a few very dirty-looking people, but there is enough Laura Gemser for everyone.
