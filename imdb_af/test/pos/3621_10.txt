Incredibly hilarious mid-70's Italian Rootsploitation with many non-consensual S&M, lesbian sex, free racial cruelty, etc ... Some redeeming movie qualities, except for the pretty cool themed music with dubby "African" drums and flute. Brilliant example dialog: <br /> <br /> White Slave Owner (White Plantation Manager): "You're so stupid, I'll bet you forgot to interrogate that midwife!" <Br /> <br /> White Plantation Manager: "I didn't just question her, I did it so well, she died before I could get any answers from her!" <br /> <br /> All the black actors have 70's, and say "yes, mass" in a high voice. The female head has sex with everyone on the plantation. 10 stars for fans of tasteless slums.
