This movie is from start to finish about a group of fellow students coming together and literally killing each other by stopping their hearts and reviving themselves. They then investigate what happens to the "near death" experiences. As everyone goes through the experience, they are haunted by their deepest fears that seem to be reality. It ranges from dead children with hockey sticks to dead fathers who look at the top. <br /> <br /> The movie is the first time, and Oliver Platt is hilarious in one of the best roles of his career. I'm not a great Keifer Sutherland fan, but even he does a great job. It's a movie I can watch over and over!
