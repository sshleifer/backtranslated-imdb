After reading the other comments on this wonderful piece of TV drama, I was forced to balance things a little. If you like your murders, your signature and series, and your police are British, and scream a lot, and the gore is bloody and has a religious slope, then it hits every button. Not quite enough to scream the scream in the Sweeney's scarce heights, but otherwise highly regarded. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'policeman on the edge' and the guest stars are also well-cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended. (In response to previous comments, although I assume that 'Red' doesn't usually 'turn away' from a hit and run, he just arrested his brother for murder and I'm pretty sure he doesn't see the boy moving.) )
