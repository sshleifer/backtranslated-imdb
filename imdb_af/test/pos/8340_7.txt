It's one of those movies that seem so "dated" that it is, is part of the fun. You see and hear things you will never see or hear on the silver screen today. This is good; Some of them are too wheat for words, some of them are bad (depending on your views on certain cultural issues.) <br /> <br /> For example, in this short (68 minute) 1931 movie you have: < The grandfather of the family that appears in this story, which aggravates the value of patriotism, and why one should pronounce criminals for the good of the United States (see this in today's movies!) < br /> <br /> A district attorney (Walter Huston) almost begged for death sentences and the population rated it as 100 percent. (Again, show it in contemporary movies.) <br /> <br /> Along the way, you have found shocking violence, like a young boy several times, and the head literally thrown into a cupboard, and his father is picked up and repeatedly swung head-first into a wall. It's a difficult thing to say the least. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is comedy, mostly by the patriotic grandfather, played memorable by Charles's "Chic" Sales. There is a lot of laughter for everyone viewing this unique crime movie. And for soft touch, there are the two young boys, one of whom - Dickie Moore - became a well-known actor in his day. Here he is just a little of the age of 5, who is mentally far from a polished actor, but you can see stargazing for him on the horizon. In fact, he did it only the next year with a solid performance in Blonde Venus, with Marlene Dietrich. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is an entertaining movie because of an effective mix of violence, comedy and sentimentality .... and it has a good feel-good ending and a mind-blowing message . It was also an Oscar award for the best writing, original story. I'm sorry to say it's only available to watch on cable television, as it has never been placed on VHS or DVD. And this is a pity.
