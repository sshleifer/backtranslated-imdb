Why is there so much anxiety among the IMDb reviewers who hate this movie? This is not a masterpiece, but when viewed twice, it appears as a compelling drama in the world of network TV. Robin Stone is the symbol of every Dan, Phillip Stone, and Brian Wat's side name on NBC. A mannequin of a man who is unable to love, but who succeeds professionally, but fails in his personal life. I worked for eight (8) years in network news and Robin Stone's EXIST! <br /> <br /> The supporting role works for me from Cannon (which can be annoying but is not in this movie) to Greene who plays pathos just right) to Wexler (who is the young model in love with the image) decorated by Prince Charming and could not reconcile the image). Also, the note is the end that some IMDb reviewers claim is a cop-out. It's not! Listen to the song "He Moves Up" for clues about the bow moving the Robin Stone character bringing him to face his issues eventually. He realizes that the answers are not with the life he lived, and the symbolic leaving of those with whom he was associated is ultimately perfect.
