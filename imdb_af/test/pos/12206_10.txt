Surface was wonderful, I don't know how many Mondays I have survived at school, just thinking of the new episode of the surface. I loved it, sometimes I had to go home and tell my mom to paste it for me. I was pretty upset when I heard it was canceled, I mean your way of hanging us. So, they can have their new Tina fay comedy (you can't pay me to see it, I think the ads made me stupid). I'm going to miss Surface on Monday night, even though my sister made me happy. Though, kidnapped, it looks good, and they still have L&D: SVU (I think, I still have to check) (I just wrote the 2 lines above because they said I needed 10 lines).
