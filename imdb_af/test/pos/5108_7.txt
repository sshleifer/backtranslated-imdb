Thirty years after the 1939 classic movie, Robert Donat won an Oscar and Greer Garson starred, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" has overcome a number of issues before stumbling on the screen in this musical version. Original stars Rex Harrison and Samantha Eggar were replaced by Richard Burton and Lee Remick, who in turn were given the heave-ho in favor of - grateful - Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. Andre Previn's score was rejected, and the one eventually used was compiled by - unfortunately - Leslie Bricusse. First-time director Herbert Ross has transferred the monumental task to a simple love story - that of a man for his wife and students - turned into a huge exorbitant budget. Being so successful as it is in spite of the many stumbling blocks in its path is proof to its two stars. Arthur Chipping is a Latin teacher at Brookfield, a boy school in suburban England where he himself was educated. He is dedicated to his students and is unable to inspire them. Before the summer holidays, a former student takes him to a London music hall to see an entertaining role, Katharine Bridges, the young lady he hopes to bet. The post-performance meeting is uncomfortable for everyone, and Chips - as he is well known - goes out to explore some of the ancient ruins of Italy. Unexpectedly, he walks into Katharine, who has booked a Mediterranean cruise to allow her time to mourn a failed love affair and think of her career. In the time they spent together, she discovered a friendly and gentle man under the fertilized outside, and on his return to London, he was seriously seeking. When the fall begins, Chips returns to Brookfield with his young bride, and the two settle in a life of quiet household. Complications arise when aspects of Katharine's cover surface, and again when World War II enter their lives, but Chips is enhanced by his wife's support, and his newly-found confidence makes him a favorite among the students. <br /> <br /> In addition to some musical interludes - the wonderful music production number "London is London" and Katharine's love statement, "You and I" - most of Bricusse's songs, some of them in the voice surrender while the characters explore their emotions, are easily forgotten and do not improve the movie in any way. Eliminate the score altogether and "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" work pretty well as a drama. Terrence Rattigan's script retains elements of the original as it expands and updates it through a few decades. He has made several scenes between Chips and Katharine who have splendidly shared their commitment, and some dedicated with comic relief courtesy of Katharine's friend and cohort, excessive actress Ursula Mossbank (beautifully played by Sian Phillips, O'Toole's woman in time). He also lives at a British public school - the equivalent of a private academy here in the United States - with unparalleled perfection. <br /> <br /> Ross does well as a first-time director, who photographed the film with breathtaking moments - the opening credit series, echoed by the school song in the vast rocky outcrops of the school, set the scene for the film out. Costumes and sets are true for the period. The students, who were portrayed by non-professionals at Brookfield School, handle their various small supporting roles well. <br /> <br /> Top praise is reserved for Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark in the lead. O'Toole has long been established as a first-class dramatic actor, so his Oscar-nominated performance comes as no surprise. Clark, a veteran of about two B movies in the United Kingdom and last year's "Finian's Rainbow", is absolutely luminous as the music halls of a theater run in favor of life as a schoolmaster's wife. Her golden voice enriches her songs and allows us to see how most of them are, and more than O'Toole in their dramatic scenes. The chemistry between the two is tangible and leaves us undoubtedly in love with some. <br /> <br /> This version of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is not classic like its predecessor, but rare The disaster described many critics when released. Ignore the score, concentrate on the performances, and flame in the atmosphere Ross placed on the screen. It's a pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love.
