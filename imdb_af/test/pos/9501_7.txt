No more wheat cabbage and cabbage for her! <br /> <br /> This little romantic comedy cuts from scene to scene with some exotic twists (a few imaginary scenes and a costume party). All this is centered on Gloria Swanson's wife of the man who wants to break out of the doldrums (she is twenty here!). Both front men have a natural air that is convincing and of course Swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods, from frivolous to worried. <br /> <br /> Behind all the games and seemingly light heartedness, that old serious problem is to stay in love and not fall in love. There is a little bit of wheat, but director DeMille is also to keep it funny and credible. As with many films from this era, the captions not only tell what they say (or think) but often give some sort of philosophical insight, as if the tragedy (or racialism) is justified. And there is that higher goal here, probably better without the instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's kind of beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for visual or formal surprise, you won't find it here. But if a story, well-acted and filmed with precision and economy, is really a good example. The events may not come as a total surprise, but it is such a modern love story, which took place almost a hundred years ago, it's a gas. And did I see how Swanson was perfect?
