Finish me. Bobby died in the hands of his stepfather. Mike tried to get Bobby out. Only a child can think that it would be possible to build a machine that can fly. Bobby died. Mike survived as a child by creating an alternative termination in his mind ... about how Bobby's gone. Mike made a plane that fled Bobby. Children who are sexually and violently abused often create very different worlds in their minds to survive. <br /> <br /> Seeing my old housing area was also great. We call it San Jos√© Boulevard and I live right around where this house is filmed. It was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses ... not studios. It was my kitchen, bedroom and living room. And those hills ... we used to walk them as kids .... looking down at our little valley .... looking at the bay. Was a true nostalgia for me.
