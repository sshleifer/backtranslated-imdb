It's nice and fast, because one lie leads to another and the other to an inevitable, surprising conclusion. The tension separates this holiday movie from everyone else. One wonders how the pieces will fit, both in the film and in the future. <br /> <br /> The character actors laid the foundation and entertained us in the process. Sinkewicz (Frank Jenks) shows us what can be manipulated ... and finally what manipulation can cost! Uncle Felix (SZ Sakall) greets each person for us as we try to protect "Lishka" (Barbara Stanwyck), and it helps us decide who we eventually root. <br /> <br /> If we can reach a perfect world, imperfect humans will probably experience a series of events like this. <br /> <br /> A sharpened weakness is the false baby cot after it has swallowed Oom Felix's watch. I heard more authentic crying from a doll in a toy store. <br /> <br /> Look, and you'll really feel like you were somewhere there!
