In comparison, Tarkovsky is a speedy freak. <br /> <br /> By comparison, Bela Tarr is MTV. <br /> <br /> By comparison, the movie "Russian Ark" is a rollercoaster ride. <br /> <br /> I just described 3 of the sllllwwwwessesttttt experiences I've ever known, and this one holds them all. But it doesn't say it's bad. On the contrary, I really liked it. But it was a task. <br /> <br /> I won't describe the plot because you can easily find it elsewhere. That's enough to say that the plot is INSANE. It's one of the most creative and bizarre ideas since becoming "John Malkovich." I believe the interesting plot is the main reason I didn't like it (the humor was nice too. It's something we seldom see in slow, artistic films.) Here we see a bizarre turn of the norm. Most movies have little plot and little dust; Yet they fill 90 minutes with a lot of eye-catching images to keep us going. But "The Hole" has 100% plot / theme without pleasing the eyes. In this regard, I suppose it is a true intellectual experience, such as reading a painfully explanatory novel such as Thackaray's "Vanity Fair" (which I have never been able to complete!). <br /> <br /> If you are an Extra attention team, I think you will really like this movie. Despite its molasses-like fit, it is highly creative and imaginative. It's like Jean-Pierre Jeunet on quaaludes and with a sturdy, dusty camera lens. Best wishes.
