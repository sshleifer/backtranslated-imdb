One of Chaplin's longest films until that time, Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then "Prosper Merimee's" famous story of "Carmen". I was a little confused about the difference between the IMDb's 1915 Burlesque list on Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on the lead time, I assume that it was the 1915 version I saw, since the 1916 is a good 20 minutes longer, and from what I read, it's 20 unnecessary and relentless minutes. <br /> <br /> From the start, it is clear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplin's most complex and ambitious efforts to date, starting with a long story, telling through titles, about the tragic love story of Carmen. <br /> <br /> Carmen is sent by a band of gypsies (a band that put the GYP in the gypsy.) to deceive a Spanish officer so they can divert their smuggling operation. It's a clever, Chaplinesque band of criminals, the leader of whom, Lillas Pastia, "learned 50 years to steal, and thinks he might be offered a job in politics." <br /> <br /> On a synot I have seen almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of Chaplin's previous work, but probably no one as open-minded as in this one. Near the start of the movie, like the band of gypsies, there is a scene where the mules and women load, and an interstitium declares that the mules are those with long ears. If you couldn't tell, I think. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays part of Don Jose, the unfortunate officer to be tempted by Carmen. He is described as "a brave soldier and lover of women." Not exactly a piece for Chaplin who has removed any doubts about his ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few years later in the brilliant shoulder arms. And of course, he doesn't have to act to be a lover of women. <br /> <br /> What is different here, of course, is its polished military uniform and straight-backed disciplinary way, interspersed, of course, with some of its traditional flapper. He strikes me as a small man in a position of authority, struggling to maintain the respect of his subordinates by exerting a gruesome, stingy outside. <br /> <br /> Soon Carmen goes in ("Love of all men under the age of 96?), and she starts flirting with Charlie right away. I have to call it for a good majority of the movie, this is surprising True to the original story, which was full of jealousy and tragedy, Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover, who can evoke a jealous passion that I have never seen of him. is a little scary. <br /> <br /> Chaplin has some good sight-seeing in the movie, like a hilarious table dance and some classic sword fighting near the end, and his son-like charm and the role of a soldier is also definitely a winning combination, although there is another peculiar stunt that includes a group of men pushing a large door back and forth that was not very effective but just holding on and over and over, probably about five times longer. as it was worth, although it was interesting, it was clear as a movie always such glimpses at the old movie sets. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is the strongest part. It looks remarkable like Romeo and Juliet, but only when you think Chaplin is going to conduct a great thematic experiment deviating from its traditional style is a hilarious twist that is as vintage Chaplin as I have ever seen . Nice work!
