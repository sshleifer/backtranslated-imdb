This is another of Eastwood's many movies that mix intrigue, action and a romance doll, along with 'The Gauntlet', 'Firefox', and so on. Clint's acting series is already fairly well known. In this one he is quiet and a little outrageous, especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in his performance. But the movie itself is something of a surprise; it is above average. <br /> <br /> Clint is Frank, a secret service agent who may not, in a moment of doubt, capture the bullet that JFK killed. He then drank, which drove his family away, and now stands in the bureaucracy until he is contacted by John Malkovitch. He calls himself "Booth," which creates a kind of skewed relationship with him on the basis of their shared, disillusioned belief that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape threats and predictability. Rather, it is an offensive attitude for an artist like Clint to project, but he does rather well, less robot than usual. And he apparently carried around with him, like a rock-burden, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He is tested halfway through the movie. He hangs from the roof of a tall building, grabs Booth's hand, and pulls his pistol and shows it to Booth, who asks him if he is really ready to shoot. Of course, if he does, he saves the president from a CIA-trained murder attempt, but at the expense of his own life. Booth twits him over the situation if they hold hands in the middle of the hand. And Clint even had a short speech, with Renee Russo, about his failure to save the president in Dallas. "If I responded quickly enough, I could have taken that shot ... and it would have been good with me." It is underplay, but its voice slightly cold, its eyes water, and its lip trembling. This is one of the few scenes in any of Clint's films that can be properly named. We know from his new found that he gave the chance to take the bullet this time. (The irony is that he doesn't like the current president. Who can? He gives pumping speeches in Colorado about how they carved a desert nation. Didn't they do the same thing in Las Vegas?) <Br / > <br /> It's often said that a movie is just as good as its villain. This is not true, nothing is so simple, but an argument for its truthfulness can be made in this case. The reptiles John Malkovitch with his tartar eyes is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Talk about disillusioned. Okay, he can hammer it a little, sniffing with contempt, as he looks at two innocent hunters, but he is fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo doing little. Fred Thompson, the head of the White House, is now back in politics, a relief for filmmakers. If Clint's acting range is limited, Thompson's is slightly less. In every film he has been in, he carries the same solemn and dissatisfied expression, as if he is constantly being harassed by a kind of volcanic digestive system. <br /> <br /> The direction of Wolfgang Peterson is as good as Das Boot, "which is pretty good. There is a great deal of the usual tension in the final. And then Clint and Russo in" A passionate embrace falls into her hotel room and, like a two-heat heat to the bed, Peterson shows us their feet together with a succession of objects falling on the floor - not just the usual clothes, but handcuffs. Guns, beepers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wristwatches and other impediments. Interrupt, Clint leans back on the bed and sighs, "Now I have to put all those things back." <br /> <br /> Well written and worth it to look.
