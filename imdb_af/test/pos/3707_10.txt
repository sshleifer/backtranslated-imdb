This film is made right in the area where I grew up and now lives. I personally know most owners of the different places used in the movie. As a teenager, I worked in the field around the isolated road that appeared late in the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are residents of NC. I was lucky to see it at a local show. At that show, one of the people who helped select places and props was like the 1938 Greyhound bus used in the movie. The bus did not return and during the filming the driver missed his stop point a few times and had to drive a few miles to return to the right point. Those details of the technical issues added me the pleasure. The film accurately illustrates life in this area during World War II. A well done movie and I'm anxiously waiting for the availability of the DVD.
