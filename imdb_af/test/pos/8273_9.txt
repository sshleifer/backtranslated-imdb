When it first broadcast on the Masterpiece Theater, it had a profound impact on me. It was beautifully filmed and performed. I immediately read the book by Mary Webb, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. Janet McTeer is wonderful like Prue, and I expected her to be on the British drama regularly. I think she'd rather focus on the British scene. <br /> <br /> I hoped the movie with the American success of Janet McTeer will be available to us again years later (with Tumbleweeds). Unfortunately, it has not yet been released on DVD. If someone is listening outside, please make it available again!
