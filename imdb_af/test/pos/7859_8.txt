This super creepy South Gothic melodrama star Clint Eastwood as a wounded Civil War Confederate who was admitted by a rural girls' school and turned back to health. A strange clash of generations occurs, with the so-called "dangerous" man falling prey to a bundle of seemingly innocuous women proving that they are so brutal as the men are fighting on the battlefields. It is a classic spider and the flying story, but here there is one lonely fly and a lot of spiders. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page plays the lead of the school, and she gives a distinctive sensational display. Page is trained as a theater actress, and it shows in all her performances. No matter what role she played, she always dedicated her 100% to it, and never let her go out of character. So it is here, with this deadly spider, exercising her sexual oppression on this helpless man. Each of the other girls also responds in her own way. The two most prominent are the slothful girl who can't wait to throw him on him, and the virgin one (played by whoever other than the fashioned Elizabeth Hartman?) Acting as if she were to fall into a dead courage as someone so much like the word "penis" told her. The schematic Madonna and the whore storyline seem melancholy if the movie did not keep you so unashamed and so completely uncertain about what would happen next. <br /> <br /> The most memorable scene in the movie for me occurred when the group of women had an amputation of Eastwood's leg, which became infected with gangrene. Again, the spiders / flying allusion is clear: they bump him so that it is so much more difficult to escape for him. <br /> <br /> A classic chiller. Not a good movie, but a morbid entertaining one. <br /> <br /> Degree: A-
