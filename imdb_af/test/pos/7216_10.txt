This movie is great. It's funny, sexy, violent and sick, but it all goes together for a brilliant Troma version of Romeo and Juliet. If you don't mind giving up a bit (alot, but it's funny taken out), see this movie. It is worth the effort! There is not one level on which it does not deliver. I've seen it now three times, and it's still incredible. I recommend it. Go! Get it!
