Father Hood is an entertaining story of an unwilling Father who is definitely a WOOD! Patrick Swayze is playing Jack Charles, who is always looking for one big "score" that will put him on easy street. His wife died while in prison and his two children were in foster care. When he came out, did he think they were probably better off in foster care? Besides, he still had to win his fortune. His daughter, Kathleen Charles (played wonderful by Sabrina Lloyd), breaks out of a foster care institution that abuses children and abuses money that is supposed to be spent on children. She hunted her father down; tell him how bad the place was and that her brother Eddie Charles (played by Brian Bonsall) was "just a small 7-year-old child" moved to the institution she just broke out and convinced her dad to kidnapped. The three start on an adventure all over the country, Jack continues to tell himself that he must get rid of the kids! Patrick Swayze is really good at this comedy and plays a "hood" (probably a little understatement for this criminal character). He is similar to his Johnny Castle character of Dirty Dancing, except Jack is much more fun in this comedy and more optimistic than Johnny Castle. Swayze is funny and rally does comedy very well! Halle Berry plays Kathleen Mercer who is a reporter trying to find the truth of the foster care system that Sawyer's ally becomes. Diane Ladd plays Rita, co-artist of Jack Charles.
