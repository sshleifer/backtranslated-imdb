Family Guy has long been hilarious, but I feel it has lost six sharp and random humor at the beginning of the season. Although I enjoyed Blue Harvest, it seemed as if the remaining episodes were "packing" - episodes where producers made little effort to meet Family Guy's reputation of American social satire. <br /> <br /> I saw all the episodes from season 7 and I was totally surprised and happy that Family Guy found their true colors again. Season 7 delivers many fantastic episodes and with lots of jokes about the current situations in America, which is exactly what we need now - more fun. <br /> <br /> I feel the Simpsons have lost all their spark. Together, however, this show made a tremendous recovery from declining to prove how perfectly satirical they can be. Good work!
