Wonderful, one of my favorite movies is downstairs. Guess I can be proud of what does "what the general population" tends to do. Jackie Mason is hilarious in this movie, and so is Randy Quaid. I can never get enough of his "strong-arm" tactics, just like in Moving. He was also notable in National Lampoon's Christmas holiday. Love the guy.
