You really have to remember the Monkeys and have a clear understanding of where and how they fit in the second half of the 1960s to fully appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> There is no plot as such. Actually, it's a crazy, mixed surprise from several unrelated rows. But, it's interesting and entertaining in its own peculiar way as soon as you reach its wavelength. In short, it was a classic, clever design and well-crafted example of the late 60s experimental theater. It contains some good songs, some brand new movie art and many other ideas in terms of movie technique. <br /> <br /> I give it 7 out of 10 for various reasons. First, it had a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox movie in the commercial mainstream, where both its stars and its producers were solid. If a feature movie is at the cashier's office, the consequences for everyone involved can be severe. Second, it was largely a creative success. And lastly, as already mentioned, it is undoubtedly a classic of the genre and as such it is historically important. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Head" came too late in the Monkees career. But there they would not be allowed to do it again, because it was essentially a very sharp and cynical satire of their own image. <br /> <br /> It was clear that the members of the group just knew too well that the entire Monkees juggernaut just jumped over his race when they started working on this project. In a way it had to be their swan song and they were determined to hang it all out. They were tired of being treated as mere pawns in the high-powered corporate game in which they were manipulated and exploited over the past few years. In short, they "wanted out" and they were going to say a few things before they left. <br /> <br /> History, however, proved the band. Let the critics be condemned. The Monkeys left behind the best, most polished and successful pop records of the decade. Yes, they had a lot of help. But at the end of the day they stood in front of the studio, they stood up for the movies and TV cameras and they did the concerts. They were fun and just a little crazy. But, unlike some of their contemporaries, they were never threatening. You can safely lay a Monkey to your elderly aunt. <br /> <br /> "Head" probably borrows a bit too hard from the Beatles "Hard Day's Night", but it's still worth a look for those who were at the time. or for younger retrofiles that have the ability to appreciate its meaning. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
