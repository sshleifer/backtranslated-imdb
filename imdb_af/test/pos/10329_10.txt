Bugsap has changed my life. I know it sounds strange, strange, strange. But it did. I'm from England, Bug Juice never broadcast there, but five years ago I went on holiday with my family and saw it on the Disney Channel. As soon as I saw this TV show, I was addicted. I wanted to go. It was very convincing to my parents to allow my brother and I to go to Waziyatah. I went since I was 12 and it was my previous year this summer. When you read a teenager, it comes to this camp. It changes your life. you make life-long friends with Wazi. It doesn't matter who you are or if someone at home doesn't like you, everyone loves you at the camp. You have so much fun. If you want to look, go to www.wazi.com and see it yourself. It's so much fun I love it It's my home away from home
