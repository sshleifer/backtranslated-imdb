Getting to know Hartley's "The Go-Between" for a good while, both in its original book form and in its disappointing Pinter-Losey movie adaptation, was interesting things. "The Hiring" proves almost a mirror image at times; in a slightly less distant time for the lead role, with the exposure of the British Class system, and containing a fixed sporting match (boxing takes the place of cricket) which tells a lot. <br /> <br /> It refreshes in its small-scale character focus. You don't exactly learn Lady Franklin and Leadbitter in the Romanist sense, but this distance is played appropriately in touching body language and actor clash. Your distance from always fully sympathetic to any one true character reflects the dormant 'difference' that condemns the central relationship. Miles and Shaw are wonderfully subtle, and we see more in their 'less'; Never once are these actors, showy performances. They are appropriate Stanislavian interpretations that create the impression that these characters live beyond the limitations of the film. All other parts are handled very satisfactorily, although they are much smaller in this movie than I supposed in the novel and are indeed compared to "The Go-Between", a beautiful work on disillusionment. <br /> <br /> The disillusionment in the middle of this film has been so sadly and vividly conveyed in the late scenes where Shaw Miles coast and are rejected, and then confronting a drunk Leadbitter Cantrip and Lady Franklin. It's a shameful shame that would be an incredibly gripping end to spoiled, abandoned lives on either side of the screen, decorated with a strange little coda. One gets totally confused by the leap in the show, as Shaw's Leadbitter gets busy and ironically sings "Rule Britannia" and "God Save the Queen" as he crashes his car into things. The political point is heavily conquered by this bombastic, fairly operational end. All sorts of subtleties, so effectively transmitted so far, are lost, as the implicit point is made heavy and noisy. Agit prop certainly has no place in this kind of delicate drama. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, one cannot be too hard. While this absurd finale is a big mistake, the rest of the film should be praised as a sensitive, engaging film, of sad and detailed observation about how British society has been in the past. Hartley's cunning but crystal clear is a lot of evidence all the time. It's just a shame that we don't end up on the disruptive conclusion to Shaw's drunken scene. The tragic, deceived figure of Sarah Miles' Lady Franklin is abruptly denied her place in the epicenter of the film, as the excellent human drama is bizarre in the field of political scoring. Shaw also - the most dry and dearest feeling of actors - is betrayed by the excessive excess of the film. so, a fine, small-scale triumph is sabotaged; but we must remember the very good points. <br /> <br /> Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
