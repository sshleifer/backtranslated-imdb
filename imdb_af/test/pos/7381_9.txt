... this film piece had a dark sound (at least, as shown on the insufficient equipment of both the Seattle and Maine film festivals) and murkier plot, while Rickman suffers from an American accent, old tennis shoes and sachets. Nevertheless, he has moments of star-cold cold, and the film offers sinister ambiguity by Norman Reedus, the beautiful Polly Walker, and a surprising end (telescope for regular filmmakers), while taking a look at the physiography of both Maine and Rickman offers. Release in video release (to a cable air) in March. Not to be missed by any Rickman fan. Ignore the amanita hooey.
