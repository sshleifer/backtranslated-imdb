A devil, out of a tree, removes himself in the form of a human being just to love a young, honest girl for her to die. The devil's eyes freeze, two drops of blood fall on a bed that he created especially for his object of desire. The bed consumes the blood and it stays hungry. Everything that comes into contact with the bed is consumed! It is explained to us by one of the bed's victims, a painter whose soul is "trapped" within one of his last works, the artistic rendering of his last resting place (.. he was dying, blood to cough and decide to die on the deathbed). You see the painter, who we can see as if he is trapped in a small room that sees his painting, unfortunately a spectator at bedtime meals. The bed has a dark sense of humor, and we see it by allowing the painter to live, and even giving him jewelry and other belongings once eaten by victims. One victim's skull grows bright red flowers not far from the basement that houses the bed. The film features three young women who come across the house that contain the basement with the deathbed. The painter (Dave Marsh) may just have a method of destroying the deathbed, but it will include a human sacrifice to awaken the body of the one whose death first caused hunger. Patrick Spence-Thomas gives the soft, depressing voice of the trapped painter, tells the film, complaining about his current situation, telling us of deceased victims, and often moving the bed of the predator. <br /> <br /> A definite, true cult film. I expect now that DEATH BED: The BED who eats has found it an audience (like myself) who appreciates the bizarre and grotesque. The bed itself contains a liquid type of acid with an apple cider tint where we consume the objects and people who struggle for nothing. Many people may recognize a young William Russ (BOY MEETS WORLD, THE UNHOLY) in curls, looking for his runaway sister, find her in the basement, zombie-like and traumatized (of course, Julie Ritter was so much movie, in a trance, barely spoken a word) trapped with them. In one of the most demented scenes of the film, Russ just tries to hide the bed for his hands to get caught in the grip, the flesh sours with only skeletal bones left, the cartilage worsens. There was one long attempt at escape by a victim whose legs were trapped in the bed, almost out of the basement when it cut sheets back into the abdomen into her stomach where she belonged. The film almost feels surreal as if we were watching a macabre nightmare unfold. Director George Barry often knows gags about the victims who find themselves in the most unfortunate position of choosing the deathbed as their refuge. The painter gives us a reminder of all the different people who were eaten. There is really nothing like this movie, it's definitely one of a kind.
