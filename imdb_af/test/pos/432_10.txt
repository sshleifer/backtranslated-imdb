I'm not a fan of musicals, but I'm a big fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin. I rented this movie and was pleasantly surprised, and even expected him to have the greatness of the classic director. This movie is BEAUTIFUL. The shots are like oil paint with motion, for which many directors strive, but Renoir MASTERS. I can't express how much this movie surpasses him ... it's not really a musical, it only has a few well-placed musical numbers and a great dance finale. But there is something about this movie that makes you feel like you enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of foreign art films, but I am also a flesh head that loves things like Die Hard and Love. Black movies. I am easily switched off by things that are overly happy or in 'la la land', but this movie has an overwhelmingly positive energy that is just irresistible. Not to mention, every frame is wonderful and the plot is good. 10 out of 10.
