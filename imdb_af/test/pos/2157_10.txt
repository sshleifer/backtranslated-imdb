Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting, but it does have a very good vampire plot! For the people who say they don't make a shot and fight movies as they use it. Well, this one is very difficult! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie. Nicholas Guest was also very good and he probably steals the show! He really plays as a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think this very beautiful actress is much underestimated. Michael Cavanaugh was good. It was really cool to see Vince Murdocco in this movie! As for the action, it's really great with all the gunfights and the super cool fighting scenes. The battles in this photo are truly one of the biggest things I saw! There is so much that lasts in the 86 minutes. For the action fans you will be blown away by all the firepower and beautiful battles this movie has to offer! Night Hunter is a movie that is not easy to find and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale, buy it because this movie is big and the box is cool! There are a lot of actions to be seen to be believed! See if you can find some great deals on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com's Z-Shops and Market Place sellers! In my opinion, Night Hunter is one of the biggest fighting films I've ever watched and the characters are so neat. If you want Don 'The Dragon' Wilson and want to see Nicholas Guest in a good performance, I strongly recommend that any action movie fan that loves shooting movies, movies and vampire movies, and being disappointed by other movies watching to a real non stop action flick, but fail to deliver and buy Night Hunter!
