This movie is worth it despite what you may hear. The performances of Marie Dressler (I hope I agree it) as a drunk old fool, are reason enough to see this movie. It's a great achievement. She has long been in a drunken stupor in three screens and she never does the same thing. You can actually smell the alcohol when it's finished. Amazing. And Greta obviously speaks her first rules on film and shes. The Eugene O'Neill story is solid and like most O'Neill stories, deep and intense. It's not light entertainment, but if you appreciate those big character actors of the 30's and 40's, you'll love it. Some of the movies are technically vague, but everything is worth it.
