<br /> <br /> Horror movie time, Japanese style. Uzumaki / Spiral was a total freakfest from start to finish. A fun freak festival on it, but sometimes it was a bit too dependent on kitsch rather than the horror. The story is difficult to summarize briefly: a carefree, normal teenage girl starts face-to-face with extremely disturbing events, as the village in which she lives comes under the control of spirals. The spirals are everywhere, in the air, clouds, dirt and everyday objects. The spirals take control of people and bad things will happen to them. Oh, another thing, people randomly change snails. Why? Who knows or cares, people turn in snails, that's enough for me. It wasn't as scary as just creepy, because it doesn't have a lot of tension or attacks like horror movies often do. Uzumaki prefers to crawl and crawl (like a snail may!) Rather than shoot. A favorite scene: A woman is lying in a hospital room and sleeping in hospital when this long, thousand-legged legume comes into the room and slowly on the bed post, over the sheets, over the pillow and in her sleeping ear. I curled up and curled my toes. Uzumaki has a handful of scenes really violent, but it's also humorous. For example, a man is obsessed with spirals, he comes in his washer because he sees a spiral in it as it turns, joins a spiral suicide in the washer. The last shot we see from him w / his body is all rolled up and rubber like a human meat spiral with a can in the middle of the washer. A bizarre image. Uzumaki has a blatant psychodelic slope that adds to its charm and fun. I like horror movies like this. It's not about killing a lower movie, it's about a power of evil (the spirals!). It takes you over and tries to kill you, forcing you to kill others. Movies like Uzumaki prove that there are many ways to make a horror movie and thank you for it
