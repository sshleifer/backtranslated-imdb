Tromeo and Juliet (1996) are another jewel in the Troma Studios movie archives. Like the Toxic Avenger, Troma's War, Class of Nuke 'em High, Terror Firmer and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. this movie is an immediate Troma classic. James Gunn updates Romeo and Juliet a medieval tragedy and rediscover it as a modern street punk drama. If you saw or read the scene, nothing has changed, except that it is "tromatized". <br /> <br /> Lloyd Kaufman adds his own twisted vision to the screenplay and makes it a very enjoyable movie. The actors handle the writing very well. I was amazed at how well they were doing the dialogue, much better than some Hollywood-budgeted actors using a mundane budget and expensive sets. I really enjoyed this movie. Lloyd Kaufman does not disappoint because you know what to expect from his films and other Troma productions. I'd rather see one of his films and be entertained than seeing a boring expensive movie, pampering paid actors, lame scripts, lazy directors and the terrible C.G.I. special effects. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. If you enjoy fun movies with cheesy special effects, about the top-performing and inspired direction, then this movie is just for you!
