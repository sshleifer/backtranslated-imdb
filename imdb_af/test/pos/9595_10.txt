As a reviewer has already commented, it is among the best soccer parodies ever in TV comedy. But .... after I didn't broadcast it for the first time, I now find that it's not in any format. OK, so it has only searched 17 votes so far, but an average of 9+ seems to suggest something special. Basically, I think it's a case of hard luck if you've missed it, because it's no longer available to watch !! Aaaaaaaargh.
