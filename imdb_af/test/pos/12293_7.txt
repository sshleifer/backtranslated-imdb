I agree with "johnlewis", who said there is a lot going on between the lines in this movie. While I think the pacing of this movie can be improved, I think the complexity of the relationships between characters is fascinating. <br /> <br /> Examples: <br /> <br /> Pierre is getting married to his cousin, even though his love for her cousin looks great. <br /> <br /> Pierre and his stepmother have a little ... curious relationship. <br /> <br /> Pierre, Lucie and Thibault have a triangular relationship, and the real points at the triangle aren't quite sure ... <br /> <br /> Lucie's brother is a bit of a eunuch, or is he? <br /> <br /> And Isabelle, who's she really? <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it was worth my time. An interesting movie, and one that lets me read Melville.
