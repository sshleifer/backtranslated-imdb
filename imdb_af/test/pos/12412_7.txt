I can understand why others react, rather unpleasant to the climax, which gives a twist that is really difficult to take seriously. However, I think its build up pretty well. The music, quite threatening and spiky, really offers a ghostly aura that struggles with the unforgivable sound of a constant lute phone that the English actress, Joan Matlin (Jean Marsh) bonkers. She lends a lovely apartment to a friend while trying to start her career in New York City. (The city buildings outside the window look as realistic as David Letterman's) and are unmistakably welcomed by a noisy phone that follows a few rings aloud on the wall. Looking for answers to the one responsible for such negligence towards her common sense, Joan discovers that no one is renting the room and that a former tenant has actually hurt herself. Without the help of the manager, Joan will decide to find out for herself that hurt her. Joan discovers the room empty and the phone with a specific female voice that will haunt her. <br /> <br /> The episode, I think, is a one-way tour force for Jean Marsh. She is the only actress who is visible and we follow her through the crisis that slowly erodes her, the phone and the slap of the other room that causes her a lot of distress that grows into fear. Instead of departing Joan, so shaken by the noise and to the breakpoint where she just wants the phone (or who calls) to stop. The episode offers a possible answer to who Joan is harassing and why. A person named Beth comes in to leave the story, because Joan struggles to find out whose female voice was over the other line, who knows her name on the dreaded phone, she discovers in the room facing her. The fate of Beth can only tell the viewer why Joan is traumatized. I think this episode is an exercise in talk rather than credibility, some didn't love it, but I definitely did. I will admit that the phone, as a physical threat to Joan, is difficult to take seriously, not to mention the attack on her, but I thought the intense 20-minute opening before that was enough to relieve.
