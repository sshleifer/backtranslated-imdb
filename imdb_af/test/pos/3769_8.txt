Unprecedented no-brainer comedy in which comedian Mark Blankfield portrays Jekyll as an urgent doctor who is deeply committed to his research. As soon as he sniffed his experimental formula, he turned into the Hyde's destructive landscape. It does not cause any problems to anyone around him. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by this one. It has a really mad madcap approach; It is full of steam ahead with an exaggerated, but undeniable, hilarious joke to the other. Funny lines and siggats are in abundance; Blankfield plays every role for everything it is worth. A highlight burst Hyde into a song; "Hyde has nothing to do with Hyde" is tough and even now I can still hear it in my head. The climax even goes as far as spoofing old b & w horror movies. <br /> <br /> The supportive role is also very enthusiastic, with Bess Armstrong as the ditzy fiance Mary, Krista Errickson as the pointed Ivy, and Tim Thomerson as flamboyant fellow Doctor Knute Lanyon. I wish more could be done with Thomersons character, since I'm a fan of the man, but it's always nice to see him in something. <br /> <br /> A wide range of famous faces parade in front of the camera: Cassandra "Elvira" Peterson, Peter Brocco, Liz Sheridan, George Wendt, Michael Ensign, John Dennis Johnston, Art La Fleur, Lin Shaye and George Chakiris in a cameo like himself. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that if you prefer a high intelligent comedy, you can avoid this one at all costs. But for those who enjoy a beautiful, politically-wrong, enjoyable good time, it can only do the trick. <br /> <br /> One of the best bits is saved for the last. <br /> <br /> 8/10
