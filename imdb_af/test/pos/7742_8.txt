I can't say what the source of this movie is, but it is one of my favorite films by Paul Mazursky (director and co-author). It is a newcomer to the Shakespeare comedy, but completely removed from the stage. Without much text, Mazursky and star Cassavettes visualize a mid-life crisis of passion and purpose. Desperate to re-establish himself, Cassavettes pulls back to a remote Greek island - where the inhabitants and the island weave a bit of magic. With especially Raul Julia, Susan Sarandon and Molly Ringwald, it is a mature fantasy that is emotionally satisfying and visually beautiful. And funny. It wasn't a big box office hit, but when it comes to DVD, it will sell.
