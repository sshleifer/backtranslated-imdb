Traffic is a very well done 6-hour drama on drugs (about 1987). It tells three stories in parallel about how opium is grown in northeastern Pakistan, how drugs are smuggled from Pakistan to Europe, and ultimately how people are addicted to drugs spirally out of control. All three stories are told realistically and with empathy. You see enough of the characters who live to understand how ordinary people in a life that are unfair can suck. <br /> <br /> These are not cardboard cuttings, but the opium producer is trying to feed his family. a dry area filled with rifles and other opium producers. The drug smuggler is a rich German with no heart, but his wife (one of the three main characters) is just an ordinary woman who has to choose to give her life the old way or to give up. Finally, the main character, the Foreign Minister has the most difficult role, as he has to deal with the emotional destruction of his own daughter. She slips into the world of drug addiction and starts stealing, suffering from ill health, emotionally attacking her parents, all so she can satisfy her urgency for the drug (heroin) that destroys her life. <br /> <br /> Traffik is one of the best dramas I've ever seen on TV. The scenes in this show will stay with you for a long, long time. Highly recommended. - Colin Glassey
