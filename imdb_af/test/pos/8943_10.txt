I think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 because it's hilariously funny from start to finish. The plot is simple and straight forward, but it keeps you looking and there is so much laughter that you really start to love it. When I watched this movie, I didn't hear much of this and I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be an old ladies' kind of movie like Calendar Girls or something, but it totally surprised me. Although I am still a teenager and the film is probably not aimed at my age group, I found it quite excellent and I think people of all ages like it. I find it a pity that this is not known at all and it makes more publicity so more people will see it and realize what a good movie is.
