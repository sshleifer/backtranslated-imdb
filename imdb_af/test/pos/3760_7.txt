Mark Blankfield (from the old nocturnal TV program "Fridays") plays dr. Daniel Jekyll, a body surgeon who invents a powder that makes him into a drug-crazy party. Of course it wasn't his intention, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. It's actually a pretty silly movie, but it's nice too. Of course, as soon as the good doctor realizes what he has done, he is ashamed of him, but he is not above all to do it, and runs through Hollywood as a crazy sex machine with curly hair and gold chains. There are a few subplots like Jekyll's fianc√©, who is the daughter of the chief doctor at Our Lady of Suffering and Pain, Jekyll's employer. And there is Tim Thomerson as a plastic surgeon with seemingly little "real" parts and a taste for men and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of Howard Hughes, and who will make many people rich in a complete set of organ transplants, including testicles. Yes, the humor is rude and stupid, and overall the whole thing is pretty tasteless, but if you're not above a quick wall in the gutter, you'll probably just find it good. Now also available on DVD, for the first time! Woohoo! 7 out of 10.
