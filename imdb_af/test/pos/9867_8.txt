I personally love this movie amidst the Halloween series. I found myself enjoying it for many friends, or finding it absolutely unbearable. Personally, I watched it dozens of times, and it never gets old. There is a big story in the movie itself, and many different things are finally explained. It's a rather short movie, but only 90 minutes, but it's definitely a thrill. <br /> <br /> The movie looks pretty cruel in this movie, but the play is still there with the way he runs, stems and deaths. There are many neat screenshots with Micheal that appear in the background, adding more of a haunting element to the movie.
