I absolutely adapted this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say this is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I spent one year at our grandparents home during the Christmas holidays. They tied it off TV. Our parents were glad we had one night busy, but they thought we would be tired and ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We hypnotized. They couldn't have harassed us if they tried. It has become a cherished annual tradition. We loved it all: time, romance, battle scenes, villains, etc. <br /> <br /> Come on, who can resist to hate that psycho moves with his constant SIR! Classic! In addition, who can resist when he really falls out of the balcony? What a triumphant moment! I always had Orry and Madelaine a special place in my heart. They were so romantic. The theme song alone can tear me. This movie is incredibly moving and I challenge anyone to keep it to the end. It is worth the effort!!
