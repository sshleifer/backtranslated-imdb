I can't believe I enjoyed it as much as I did. The anthology stories were better than par, but the link story and the surprise loss hit me. Many familiar faces will ask you to ask yourself, "Where did I see them before?" Forget about the running time listed on New Line's band, it's not 103 minutes, according to my video timer and IMDB. Space Cast makes the campfire in its own special way and raises it 8.
