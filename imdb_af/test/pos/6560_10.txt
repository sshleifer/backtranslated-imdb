I'm a horror movie freak, and it has to be one of the most phenomenal horror flicks I've ever seen. The plot line is completely original (which would otherwise be a town that is completely obsessed with a certain symbol to the point of death and madness?), The special effects are great and the movies can't be better. Some find it disturbing, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It also makes a good point. The spiral symbol is similarly ubiquitous. The spiral notebook, spiral shell, spirals on cakes. Of all the shapes they could use (square, triangle, trapezium, rectangle) it was one of the best choices. If you can get this movie, you should definitely see it. It's definitely unique, and quite unforgettable.
