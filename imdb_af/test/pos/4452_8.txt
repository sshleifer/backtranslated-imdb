I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. Fulci was a master in creating horrific atmosphere using ingenious camera work, vibrant cinematography and yes - wonderfully explicit gore. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is no exception to its later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of Living Death, House at the Cemetery, etc.). The characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis is away from the supernatural and is more on the tension created by a classic created under the sumptuous hills of Italy. The scenery is at moments reminiscent of cherished folklore and then immediately contrasted by mud and blood-saturated terror shrouded by crumbling ruins. The gore in this movie isn't quite as common but apparently compared to Fulci's later films, but mocking and giallo fans will probably be saturated with some close-ups of eastern wounds and the last 5 minutes of the film. <Br /> <br /> Overall a fantastic and mature movie of one of our great Italian horror directors.
