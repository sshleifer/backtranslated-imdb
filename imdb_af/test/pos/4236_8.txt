I would say "Chucky bride" is a "return to greatness", but the series was never really great. Very good # 1 was, # 2-3 was cast, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best caption / tagline: "Chucky Gets Lucky." So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly renews this series as Jeri Ryan did for Star Trek: Voyager. Tilly not only created a presence; She added much-needed humor, backtracks, drama, suspense and a very small sidekick / play to Chucky. And as much as I liked her, she couldn't get the credit: the props (watch the first 1-2 minutes for horror homos), the writing, the inside jokes (again the opening + Pinhead) and Chucky lines was wonderful. "Indeed, if it were a movie, it would take 3-4 successors to just do justice." Graciously, Chucky and the series went on Andy's "Hide the Soul" quest, and just settled for a new way out of his body. He teams up with his ex, Tilly, which he transfers in a "Bride" doll and a few Bonnie & Clyde teens (Really Heigl?) To recover this pendant with Chucky's human body. It's for any Chucky fan, 1980's sniper horror fan or even those who have never seen one of the previous 'Child's Play' movies. It's funny, dark, harmless, stingy ?? but not over the top and despite Tilly's literal 20 minute screen time, it's always nice to see her. After all, you barely see her playing poker anymore. (Side note: of course, I picked up the Superman reference ?? Hackensack, NJ.)
