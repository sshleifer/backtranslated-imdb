These classics have so many fantastic one-liners and unintentionally hilarious scenes I don't even know where to start. If you want advice on dating, it's here. Just ignore the person you want, and then classic lines like "Chicken's good ... I like Chicken", and before you know it, you'll have a loner in a cellar (that's " a NICE basement with a NICE basement. woman who is 35 years younger than you. Bronson does it all in this movie. He buys a car for no reason just so he can kill two gangsters ... pay with "CASH" ...... chunnng .... He buys an ice cream, just because "it's America, isn't it It 's not "and finally someone wasting the name of the giggler - he laughs when he is running" just because he stole his camera. By the way, this "giggler" is so fast that Bronson' s regular gun cannot even catch up with him. , he has to order a special one just to get this elusive crawl, he just gets cleaned so that he can eat a BIG stinking meal (stuffed cabbage) in a fall with a few old people who like to get 90 degrees again heavy clothes He goes into the dental business, he always looks like a crow beam when he needs one (and that's the same!) And last but not least, he always seems to have a rocket guy at his disposal , only if he has to blow away Richie Cunningham's older brother, Chuck, who is now stretched out and in need of a makeover. Falling, this will make everyone feel as soon as you have seen these classics. All I can say is enjoy! "I owed you the one"
