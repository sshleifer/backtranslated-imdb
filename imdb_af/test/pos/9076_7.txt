It's definitely a good movie, unlike other people. Peline and I both watched the movie 3x and the end is cheesy, but it's part of the package ... to experiment with death is the same as trying to defend it, so the movie is cool. For those who want to see a classic Kevin Bacon movie, please see. take greetings from Istanbul. We'll write 10 lines if you really want us 2 but we think it's a waste of time. The rest of this review should not be taken seriously, as we just wrote it to fill the 10-line requirement (which is crazy), but we are friendly people and will therefore adapt to the rules set for us. So people don't look at this movie because we wrote 10 lines, but because it's good. and incidentally we write 12 lines !!
