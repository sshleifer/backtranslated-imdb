Friz Freleng's 'All Abir-r-d' is one of the best Sylvester and Tweety cartoons. Unlike the many repetitive cartoons in the series that transplant just the same tired gags into a new environment, 'Al Abir-r-r' d makes the most of its concept. Tweety and Sylvester are pets sent by train without supervision. With both a vigilant officer and an evil bulldog going, Sylvester cut out his job. The Sylvester and Tweety cartoons have always benefited from a few extra contestants and 'All Abir-r-r' is a good example of how much these additional characters help. Although they are not particularly memorable creations, they throw more obstacles into Sylvester's path and make them a more interesting battle. This early Sylvester and Tweety short press many of the right buttons and while Tweety is often particularly annoying with his forced twist, there are some nice violent crimes between Sylvester and the dog, resulting in a surprisingly brutal climax that unfortunately a final unfunny torture. non-quip by Tweety.
