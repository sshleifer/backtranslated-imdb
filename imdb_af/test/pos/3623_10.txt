See the film at the lock gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London (England). Enjoy it a lot. Although the Crow & the Chinese Police Officer does not appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the author (writer / director) pronounced / played by Lord Richard Attenborough works very well. <br /> <br /> The rumor is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (like Dr. Goldstein) are in the movie for just a pint of beer. <br /> <br /> Spike was shown the movie, on video before he died and through all the accounts enjoyed it very much.
