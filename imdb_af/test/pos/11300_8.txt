Hearing about this movie a long time ago and finally found it on ebay for five dollars. I didn't expect much, but I was ever surprised. It's a story of a boy and girl who is in love with an evil king who wants the girl for herself and goes to a big castle. I think of ICO for PS2, because some shots gave you a sense of vertigo. This movie is insane! It is hard to believe that such an original animated feature was made in 1952. The king was probably one of the most beautiful characters I have seen long ago, with a female walk, strange eyes (usually crossed) and a soft but scary voice. The only problem I had with the movie was that the boy and girl had no personality and almost even any lines, except for Mr. wonderbird (a big talking green bird) to save them. The animation was fantastic in most areas, but some cells lacked some scenes that sucked. It is incredibly original with flying police and giant mechs and even sometimes aloud, it's a pity that it's such a clear title because it's really a good movie. Will it be one day.
