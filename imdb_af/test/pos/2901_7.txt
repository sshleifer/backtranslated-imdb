It was the second Cinemascope show that Fox made to the Robe. Note how some of the Roman sets are being fixed to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all the first class elements, beautiful photography, moving soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can see which composer played specific scenes). However, the lead player is a little weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited set of emotions and is uninteresting to look at. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian requester "Nefer". I find this movie generally strong on plot that is scarce for these great glasses that were manufactured at the time. All in all, the film makes an interesting and entertaining work of social commentary on Egyptian society.
