This movie is a knockout, the fires on the plain being referred to are (burning off at the end of the harvest). A good memory for Tamura, he relives it in his mind a lot of time, and at the end of this dark movie, Like a man dying to thirst, he believes he is home and this last illusion is all he has left. Billy Wilder's The Big Carnival (Ace in the hole) is the only film to come out that is as pale as this little masterpiece by Kon Ichikawa. While I think the whole movie is brilliant. Two scenes that come to mind are when a platoon of Japanese soldiers tries to escape (Crawling's stomach) is captured and killed by Americans, True Horror. And as an American soldier and a pretty Filipino girl The soldier had a cigarette on the side of the road, she smiled as she fled with the flight, then changed her face. Furious, because she sees two Japanese soldiers trying to survive. She grabs a gun and kills them with joy. The American soldier is trying to stop her but has no chance, it speaks to me of the volumes of atrocities committed by the Japanese in the Philippines. It's all a good movie if you have the stomach for it.
