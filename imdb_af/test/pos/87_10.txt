It was years since I was privileged to watch this movie on TV. I just wish I could contact someone to see it again. I married a man with three children and two had fetal alcohol syndrome. I didn't realize it, but to see this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how I could love them and help them overcome their problems. My step-son is now 35 and thank God, he has blossomed wonderfully, but still has many disadvantages of the birth of an alcoholic mother. We talk to Rehab patients with alcohol and drug addiction every month and this part has made truly monumental changes in their behavior and attempts to start a new life that is not addicted to drugs and alcohol. Please let me know how I can get a copy of VHS or DVD from this movie or when they will show the movie again on TV. If you weren't in these shoes, you probably could never understand its value. Thank you very much.
