It was Bollywood's answer to fatal appeal and it is a classic film in its own right. Juhi Chawla was good and so was Sunny Deol, but it was Shah Rukh Khan who shot the fame as the stalker. Since then he has become a favorite of the Chopra's (Dilwale Dulhaniya le Jayenge, Mohhabatein, Dil to pagal hai, Veer Zaara and Chak De India). Shah Rukh initially seems to be a villain, but then you start with the sympathy with him. The dissertation was excellent and the songs were chartbusters. My favorites are Te samne and Jaadu teri nazar. <br /> <br /> After the unworthy failure of underrated Lamhe Yash Chopra fought back with Darr. The dialogues were unforgettable, the k..k..kiran dialogue is often repeated. Since Darr Yash Chopra slipped. Fall of pagal shark was bad, but he was releasing himself with Veer Zaara, which was much better. It was Yash Chopra's last masterpiece.
