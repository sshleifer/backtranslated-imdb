It's halfway to being a top movie. The opening section, which spoils Hollywood's "social message" movies, is absolutely brilliant. It is a riot from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The second section, which introduces us to the main characters of the story, is also very good. We get great comic setup, top performances, and the dialogue is really dynamic. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning!) <br /> <br /> The one thinks it really irritated me about this. movie is the end, which I think contradicts everything that went before. My interpretation was that this film is the microphone of all the stupid prejudice and insinuation of small-town gossip and national tabloid sensational. I loved that the movie was the cause of a person's sexuality NOT being determined by their hobbies, idiosyncrasies, fashion sense or whatever. And then end and end all gossip and stereotypes that have successfully illuminated the film in the first place. It seems that everyone was 100% right! (godamit!) It was very disappointing for what was actually a wonderful story.
