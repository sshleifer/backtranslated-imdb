What a good movie it is. I was full of the beautifully unexpected pain of being a single father of a teenage girl. And it's good in a tropical island paradise. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardeiux brings his special European flair to this story about a divorced teenage girl's father. They are on holiday together and she starts excited on the island in many unexpected ways. But you'll have to watch the movie for yourself to see all the hilarious situations they find for themselves. <br /> <br /> There are some cult classics that all teenagers should see. This movie must be added to the list. In addition to Dirty Dancing, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Rocky Horror Picture Show and Animal House, my Father needs a hero movie study. Look as if you were a teenage daughter and you will roll with laughter. Watch it with your teenage daughter and prepare to laugh for months.
