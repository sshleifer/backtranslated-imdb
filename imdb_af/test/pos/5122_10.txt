Logan Lerman & Dean Collins III of Jack & Bobby Fame have a good knowledge of familiarity with friends in this even though it is not as close as they can to Jack & Bobby, but the expression of young students taking their stand for a good case is very well expressed in this movie. Logan Lerman seems to be seen in the roles of "different" than solitude of here, as seen in this as well as in Jack and Bobby. The Movie also opens with a very nice song as a loser 45 "And I wonder where the lions are?" A song I've always heard on the speaker @ my old Job or ChristmasTreeShops and played it on my local radio program of The Lost45s presented by Barry Scott, but the last time I suggested with this movie as she commitment, but the dedication is omitted. Environmental demonstration is also expressed in this movie for the protection of green ducks as seen in this movie. What a hoot for this movie is. Hoot, Sogive hopes in the tradition of the Wo Odsey Owl Commercials of the 1970s as well. Truth, Stephen "Steve" G. Baer et al. "Ste".
