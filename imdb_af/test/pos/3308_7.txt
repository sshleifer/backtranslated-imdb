A very enjoyable screen version of Rona Jaffe's best-selling pot boiler about the trials and tribulations (and of course the love) of a group of women involved in New York publishers in one way or another. Directed by Jean Negulesco, fairly fresh from the success of "Three Coins in a Fountain" and the prototype for the so-called "Sex and the City", except that the generation is all on the screen. <br /> <The bright young female talents of the day, (Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Suzy Parker, Martha Hyer), are all well-cast while Joan Crawford appears as a Queenbitch of an editor likely to Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly can eat. and spit it out; With absolutely no trouble she steals the movie. The guys include Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan (if it wasn't Rossano Brazzi, it had Louis Jourdan), Robert Evans (before deciding to go behind the camera) and Brian Aherne. There are more soaps on the screen than you will find in your average laundry, but if you, like me, enjoy Desperate Housewives, not to call Carrie Bradshaw and company, you will probably like it. A very guilty pleasure.
