I enjoyed this movie well, it could have been just as much better. I expected more action than I got. It was more of a comedy than anything else. Granted, it was serious in parts and it had a good battle scene here and there, and it was mostly more romance and comedy with some action and no horror. It's difficult to do with a vampire movie. A vampire hunter loses his mate and needs to learn another, his sister is going through a tough break, but she is pursued by a vampire of all things. Granted, this vampire is quite tasty and not in sucking blood. So that's all there really is, except for a plot from another vampire to certain royal vampires, so he can get ultimate power. Some of the problems with this movie are that his plot went there and there and the film had a very uneven flow in it, and it seemed to have moved a lot of genres. One minute action, the next pure comedy. However, the girls were cute, there was good action, the comedy was a nice or two and Jackie Chan earned an energetic look or two. This movie probably only needs more development in some areas, such as the villain who is actually not being explored. So for a movie with some good fights and a visit or two, it's pretty good ... but why was it R rated? I've seen things we've made, it's PG-13 that's much worse than that.
