In England, we often feel very attached to British films we want, because we are so accustomed to the usual American institutions and accents. Being from London, where virtual sexuality was introduced, I had a strong emotional attachment to it. The characters in Virtual Sexuality, especially the women, are exactly what British teenagers are, I felt I was almost in the movie. Immediately related to Alex's character from the movie, his shame is very common in most British teenagers, especially around girls. Virtual Sexuality made me feel like it was one of the only British films that didn't go about gangs or middle classes, but about the people watching the movie, average teens. Americans will not actually feel the emotional attachment, but every British teen should see it. Anyone from London will recognize the parts of the city from the movie, it definitely has a special place in my video box!
