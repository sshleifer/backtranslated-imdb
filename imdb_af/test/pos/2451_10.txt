I have to agree with the previous author's comments on the excellent performances and plot. Start watching this movie by accident ... (lazy Sunday afternoon watching channels to see if anything was good). And was captivated by Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Wow! Gut wrenching! Kudos to everyone (always admired Martin Sheen) but was especially impressed with Emilio! Excellent work of acting and directing ... just fantastic! So why have I never heard of this movie? I'll have to spread the news.
