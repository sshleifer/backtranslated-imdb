This is my favorite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) Play twins, of whom one has committed murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you an idea of ​​which one it did! Peter Falk is as usual written in this episode by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favorite episode). Supporting role players are especially Julie Newmar (much underestimated) and Jeanette Nolan as the housekeeper who just offends Columbo. Martin Landau's characters in this are 'Paris'. This was the name of Leonard Nimoy's character in Mission Impossible. Coincidence? Or a Steven Bochco joke?
