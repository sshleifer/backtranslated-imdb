<br /> <br /> This movie is a summary of Visconti's obsessions: the decadence of nobility, death, aesthetic quest, homosexuality ... Already mixed with melancholy mastery. Slowly, just to enable you to consider all its beauty (which is in the music and the images as well as in the story), it is the type of movie that we no longer enjoy powerful, brave, deeply personal and intelligent . The real fruit of a genius like Visconti.
