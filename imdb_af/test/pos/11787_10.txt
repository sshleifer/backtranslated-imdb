After my daughter was born in 1983, I had to lose weight. I tried the 20 minute workout and I was addicted. I lost about 50 pounds. It was the biggest weight I ever lost in my life. I can't believe this show is forgotten. It would be a blessing if you just started a cable channel for exercise and included the 20 minute workout. I think it was the best workout video ever made. I wish I could buy it somehow and somewhere. the routine was easy to learn and you worked out pretty sweat. The training sessions they have today are too complicated and too difficult to learn. Please do the best to get this video in circulation again. I pray that it will be a blessing to all who see and use it.
