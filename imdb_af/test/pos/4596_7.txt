Many things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically funny than actually funny (though it does have a bit of lazy moments), but much of it is because it is cut through the studio to better address the idiots it is mocking. Many situations are not allowed to develop. There is clearly overbearing of display material, and the worst of a narrator explains EVERYTHING (most of which need not be explained), probably because some previews did not understand what is going on. In other words, a movie about dumbing is ... you guessed it. <br /> <br /> One hopes that a longer, better version of this comedy will eventually spill over to DVD, and that will be the cult fave. It deserves it, but even in this crippled and somewhat comical spirit-reduced form, it is one of the more memorable films of the year - a rage of aversion to our culture and all the ways in which it is devastated, astounded and renamed of calling on the yahoos. I managed Land of the Dead, George Romero's latest milk of the single idea that consumers = zombies, who are basically the same point the Judge makes; But where Romero's counter-culture point of view (now zombies = the lower class who has to rebel against the rich) is hopelessly outdated. Judge's take is fresh, dead and disturbing. Just listen to the yahoo in your movie hearing it for President Camacho's state of the Union just like their peers on the screen, and you'll know we're all doomed.
