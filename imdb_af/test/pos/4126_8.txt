It occurred to me while the final scene of the movie was frozen to reveal the slender detail of Buddy Holly's death that there are still people today who were in the spot in Clearlake, Iowa, who remembers it alive. It has to be a ghostly memory, and has even more poignancy published by the lyrics of American Pie, as it pays tribute to the day the music died. The world lost a lot of talent that day, lost lives shortly before their first, and one can only wonder what would have happened if the trio of musicians who died that day survived to become an even bigger musical legacy. create. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie today about thirty years after the original theater release. Thirty years have I struggled to relieve my thoughts about it. I forgot much about it, remembering the little things, like the cricket in the wall that became immortalized with the band's name. But most of all I remember the music. It's hard to just sit there and not hit the beat of "Oh Boy" or "That's The Day", and you just have to wonder where the threat to our morals came from those songs. At least with Buddy at that point, how can they be hot rhythms when he arrives with them? Funny how each consecutive decade poses its own threat to the composition of society - The Beatles, Motown, Disco and a whole host of other forms of music. We still listen to the rhythm and dance, so I think they couldn't have been so bad. <br /> <br /> There was another take away from the movie I forgot. That's where I learned to put a phone on the table when the person on the other hand didn't see my stuff. I've done it a few times over the years, but the source has now forgotten. Well, I've been so good for thirty years. <br /> <br /> You should definitely give Gary Busey credit for his portrayal of Buddy Holly. If he sees him today, he can never imagine himself as the rounded rocker with the horn, but it was a tour character and performance that Busey earned an Oscar knot. Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith are skilled as Buddy's band members, although their characters are mostly in the back of the story. I enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends have seen in the picture, Sam Cooke and King Curtis, without ever living in their presence. <br /> <br /> I will always be a fan and follower of music from the fifties and sixties - they are called "oldies" now. I think it also makes me a little bit of a boy, but you can't replace the experience of the music history it now makes on the big screen. It's just about strengthening the idea that I will enjoy the music until the day I die.
