The stage music isn't really much more than a group of sketches stripped with some entertaining musical numbers; However, for film director Milos Foreman (who won an Oscar for directing ONE FLEW ABOUT THE CUCKOO'S NEST) and the authors took the basic premise of the play and the score and built a true story to make the performance more user-friendly. make for the big screen.

Treat Williams light on the screen like Berger, the unconventional and generous hippie that does his best to get Claude up and the scene for the scene by Savage as Claude, who brings a beautiful sweet to Claude's role. Annie Golden is a charmer than Jeannie, the pregnant hippie conceived by Wright or Dacus, does not know which one the father is and does not seem to care.
