Look at the faces next to the entrance to the prison. They are not the faces of Hollywood extras. Someone in production was really smart to film Oxford, Mississippi, because you can't get that kind of studio backlash. Stretching out of the nowadays roads, the frozen earth beneath, and the skeleton trees barely hang on. No wonder the faces look hard and unforgiving; they only reflect the ground from which they jump. The old man Lucas (Hernandez) is a better fear of his life, but then he jumps from the same hard earth. <br /> <br /> The movie works because it tells a good story that doesn't preach or sentimental and even has tension. Old man Lucas is not very nice. He is a victim and we are sympathetic, but he is also haughty and unfriendly. Sensibly, the writing refuses to look after him. In this way, we are forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the less sympathetic. The writing also avoids being wise to work with racism, as it tends to become preaching and less effective. Instead, we are shown how easily prejudice can convince an innocent man and condemn him to a terrible death. So, it is by our general instinct to see justice affecting the effects of racism, a much more effective path. It also makes the sheriff's and attorney's actions more understandable because they are otherwise part of the Jim Crow system. <br /> <br /> Notice how the movie does not attack segregation. It is doubtful that the old man Lucas wants to mix with whites anyway and there is no indication that even Adv. Stevens (Brian) wants to cross the color line except to see justice. No, the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future as symbolized by the child (Jarman) whose head has not yet been filled with "notions". He is not exactly friends with Lucas, but he encouraged common humanity to become friends after falling into the frozen creek. The last line of dialogue also shows him with his uncle, the lawyer, instead of his more hidden parents (the table tennis table is important and easily overlooked). The lawyer may not act in future civil rights, but the child may. This is the movie's realistic hopeful side. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of racial-themed movies during this short 3-year period, 1949-51 (The Well, No Way Out, House of Brave, Lost Borders). Even famous loosened MGM mingled with this jewelry. Unfortunately, the McCarthy clearance in Hollywood has put an end to "problem" movies that may not end the Cold War. Still, each of these is worth catching up, not only because it's good movies but because it's even relevant over 60 years and Jim Crow is still relevant.
