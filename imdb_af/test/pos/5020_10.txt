This movie is an all-time favorite of mine. I'm sorry that IMDb is no longer positive about it. I hope they don't like those who haven't seen it. <br /> <br /> I've always loved this movie. I watch it once a year and am always happy with the movie and especially the star performances throughout the cast. <br /> <br /> I have always wondered if Jean Stapleton actually did the final dance with Travolta? ? If someone knows this piece of trivia, please leave a comment. <br /> <br /> Thanks and enjoy!
