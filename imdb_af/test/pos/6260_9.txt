`Shadow Magic 'repeats the joy and amazement of the first film audiences. It also shows the power of the film in its ability to bring the world a little closer, to overcome cultural obstacles and to preserve us for generations to come. Certainly, anyone who really loves the art of the movie will enjoy this movie. This is an excellent first attempt by author / director Ann Hu, who will hopefully follow many movies.
