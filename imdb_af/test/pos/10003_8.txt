Bill Paxton took the true story of the American golf wave in 1913 and made a movie that deals much more than an extraordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tension of the early twentieth century and touches on the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both the British and American institutions. But in the heart is the film about that perennial favorite of the triumph at odds. <br /> <br /> The acting is an example of throughout. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual, but the revelation of the movie is Shia LaBoeuf, who delivers a disciplined, dignified, and highly sympathetic performance as a French-Irish kid of the working class who walks through the New England WASP premise combat. For those who are only familiar with his slap performances in "Even Stevens", this demonstration of his maturity is a wonderful surprise. And Josh Flitter as the ten-year-old caddy threatens to steal every scene he appears in. <br /> <br /> An old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: fine acting, clear direction and a wonderful story that grabs To the end - the last scene, a loving nod to Casablanca, is just one of the many pleasures that a good movie fills.
