I was 13 when this mini-series (and its successor North and South, Book II) was first broadcast. I was already captivated by the personal interests in / around our American Civil War, which interested me to watch this TV show. <br /> <br /> I loved it. And now I'm 29 years old and I just love it. It's full of history, beautiful costumes, real characters wrapped in and out of fictional characters' lives. Everyone you care about. There is intrigue, love, loyalty, betrayal, family, extended family, lust, battles, victory, defeat and reconstruction. <br /> <br /> Although I had the full range of episodes on tapes, I signed back when it was originally aired, a few years ago I had the full set of both N&S and N&S II of Columbia House bought when they became available. Once every couple of years I take a whole weekend and look back at all the payments - and I'm sad when the last episode comes to an end, because I find myself watching the story of the life of these characters. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this mini-series any more.
