After a little further thought about this movie, I find it too easy to dismiss it as the boy's dream. I actually got spiritual power from Northfork ....... Angels exist ... we are definitely entertained by Angels .... most of the time we are not even aware of it ..... On " a point of spiritual and emotional turmoil in my life, I personally need this movie. Yes, as I wrote before, it speaks so much ...... can't wait to go to heaven. <br /> <br /> "So sick of all the FX and Formula stuff, I found this movie to be a real Cinema. All I can say has touched me so much that I still have it North Fork is a wonderful movie, one that is the viewer's mind from the gut and the heart, the spiritual aspect is very interesting to me. to follow the story, I think it may be a bit over some, but I feel it is the individuals that are the most important ones, I want to see it a few more times just to take it all . <br /> <br /> The industry must study this film to realize that we exist. </b> <br /> My thanks to everyone involved in making this movie.
