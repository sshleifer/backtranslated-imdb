I was referred to this movie by a friend. I never heard it, but I thought it had Christopher Lampbert, and I rented it. Let's find out that it wasn't Christopher Lampbert, it was Thomas Jane, who was the movie. I love that almost the whole movie is in this suburban home. The characters were great all of them and the script was wonderful. I really wish Woods would be writing and directing another movie. In my book Thursday is the flawless story of the man trying to do the wife and child after a shady past, but then his old drug dealer friend appears and it gets quite Thursday. It's one of my favorite movies and it shows a real potential in Thomas Jane. But this movie is very rare, but I found it in some Hollywood videos on VHS. So knock off the old video recorder and pop in Thursday because it gets Pee Wee's seal of approval
