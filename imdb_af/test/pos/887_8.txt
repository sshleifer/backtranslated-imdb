I watched the movie at the Fantasia Festival at the North American premiere (July 14, 2004). I was a little disappointed because I expected a more epic ensemble movie according to the lines of Musa the Warrior. Instead, the film concentrated only a much smaller number of characters. Yet the film was solid, thoughtful and visually interesting. There was some linkage between the dominant and realistic tones of tangled loyalty, plot and blood, to the lighter, more flamboyant, martial arts sequence. It almost seemed as if the filmmakers couldn't think whether the film would be a movie or a historical epic. The story is well addressed about the need for loyalty to the need to adapt to new situations. Is it really worth your life and your friends to be loyal to your master or is there a time when one has to submit to the winds of change? Is there perhaps greater courage to leave the old ways for new ones? How does one decide? These questions are raised in this movie, and ironically, the suggestion is that the answer given may be the wrong one!
