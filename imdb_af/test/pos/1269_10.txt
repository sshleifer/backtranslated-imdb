An excellent debut film for the director of Batman Begins, comes the following, a movie about a man who follows other people for inspiration of characters in stories he writes. One man he follows decides to go further and the man seems to be more than he has negotiated. <br /> <br /> Using a role of non-actors and his uncle, write the direction to produce and otherwise completely make film entirely on its own with virtually no budget and independent manufacture, this movie is much more as you would expect. <br /> <br /> For anyone who likes Memento and complex twists, turns, shocks and knives with time, it's definitely a movie for you.
