The Mayor of Hell has the feel of an early Dead End Kids movie, but with a much harder edge and very few spots, which precede the first appearance of the Dead Enders by four years. James Cagney has a full screen opening credit, though technically, the 'mayor' of the film's title is actually portrayed by Frankie Darro, one of several boys sent to reform the school during the opening scenes. Darro's character is Jimmy Smith, a young harsh friend of 'Patsy' Gargan (Cagney), and is preferred to the position when Gargan takes a chance to satisfy humanistic conditions at a state formation. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers has many of these types of movies, which try to give a conscience of all sorts in an era that only knew too well about the effects of crime and poverty. This movie is pretty keen, with no excuses for ethnic stereotyping, such as in the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a Jewish child gets a candy store in the reform school. The rules at the Reformation are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut; Step out of line and you answer personally at Warden Thompson (Dudley Digges). <br /> <br /> Cagney's role in the story looks somewhat ambiguous, though, while he is seriously trying to improve conditions within the reformer, on the Outside he is still nominally in charge of a criminal racket. The film's attempt to juggle this dichotomy falls short of my estimation. The final is trying to pack things into a neat package, as Gargan is waiting for the results of a rare deadly shooting by one of his henchmen. Not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in such a movie. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers would be some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake title "Crime School", with Humphrey Bogart in the Cagney role, and Billy Halop in the Frankie Darro section. If you're partial to the Dead End Kids, you'll probably find the latter movie better, as it also offers familiar faces such as Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan and Gabriel Dell. However, the end is also a bit in the one, with Bogart's custodial character involved in a prison outbreak cover. Both films offer a romantic interest in the main characters, in 'Mayor', Madge Evans is a reformed nurse who falls for Cagney's character. <br /> <br /> Oddly, many James Cagney's early films aren't commercial. available, so you have to make your eyes shine for a show on Turner Classics, or the movie from a private collector. Personally, I can't get enough of these things, and find interesting points of interest in the films of all the genres from the Thirties and Forties.
