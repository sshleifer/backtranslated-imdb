Sally and Saint Anne are a very funny movie. For the first time, my mom told me I was 7 and Saint Anne was just the Saint I had for Holy Communion. My mom knew it, so she told me to see it with her. I've seen it many times because it's really funny. Aunt Bea from the Andy Griffith Show was in there and Sally's grandfather was the man who played Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th Street. So, there were many actors we saw on TV shows as well. There is a bad man trying to steal the house away, and Sally keeps things up with St Anne to help raise money to keep the house. It includes a boxing match with Hugh O'Brian who plays her older brother. It's a good and funny movie I still love.
