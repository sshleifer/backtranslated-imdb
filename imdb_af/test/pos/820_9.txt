Once I got the wind from this picture, it was just called "Shepherd" and it had to be the movie that JCVD ​​would put in the chance to play theater. I was very excited about the whole piece. <br /> <br /> By the time it was titled "The Shepherd: Border Patrol", I was in the thrill of this movie. With Isaac Fluorentine at the helm and JJ Perry hitting stunt coordination, I was almost exhausted for the time being. Photographs were released by JCVD ​​who kicked 8 different kinds of asses, as well as Scott Adkins I thought the villain was, and I was excited. I thought it would be another epic martial art situation like Lone Wolf McQuade. <br /> <br /> Then it came out. I ordered it for Blockbuster online for $ 20 and was ready for anything. The reviews of vandammefan.net kinda have changed my ideas slightly, but I brought myself. The mail arrived on day 4 and I tore up the parcel. My initial plan was to chase up, rip the face of the cardboard packaging, and then smash the case into the right dynamics so the disc would land in my DVD player. However, I watched the case for 10 minutes and placed the disc in my player and watched the movie. <br /> <br /> By the time it was over, I was cool like a fool in the pool. The Shepherd is definitely one of my favorite direct-to-video movies ever, and makes Derailed even more of the toilet bowl it is. Certainly, some of the battles ran a little short, but they were still VERY awesome. The shooting was excellent, like Scott Adkins, who had to be the villain, unlike the forgotten Steven Lord. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. Seriously.
