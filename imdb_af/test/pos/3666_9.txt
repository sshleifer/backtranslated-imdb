The movie is not perfect, but it is fun and fun to watch. I'm the first to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and that his music and style is pretty cheesy. I also agree that the movie has some strange distractions and some scenes don't work well. Approximately? If it makes you smile and you enjoy what cares? Should every movie make sense? Should every movie be perfect? No. One can get rude and admit that they love this movie. Again, so what? It has lovely characters, it is well shot, the acting is mostly good, it never gets too maudlin or dramatic, it's strange. See how many people love I Dream of Jeannie. Is it perfect? Heck no! And while it's very different, I say, check it out and you'll be in a good mood after you see it.
