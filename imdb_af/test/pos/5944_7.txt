If you want to spoof James Bond, it's a brilliant idea to find a leading man who looks like Sean Connery and Leonard Rossiter, such a step forward Jean Dujardin that perfectly captures the Connery cut, which illuminates as a smile , plus the self-delusion of Rossiter thinking he is suave. Dujardin plays it like a Clouseau who can keep her karate. The plot has been looking for Our Man In Schtook who has mysteriously disappeared and includes such unlikely things as a Nazi cell hidden within a pyramid. If there is a frightening note, it is the leading lady, Berenice Bejo who has all the sensuality of a suckling pudding and is obscured - just by - by Aure Atika. It's good for one show, but it's about it.
