When I saw Gone with the wind, I thought there would be no better actors than Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable to play Scarlett and Rhett, but then I saw the movie Scarlet. I fell in love with this dramatic story. I love Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler, he is fantastic. It's a movie I could see a thousand times and it won't endure me yet.
