You can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; that layer was hacked. Or you can find a value-neutral remark about the madness of the war (stripped of the "judgment"); This layer is totally uninteresting. <br /> <br /> You can see for the darn good entertainment value of Duvall's one-liners, but it's just a layer for commercial mastic. <br /> <br /> You might try to consider it as a 'realistic' Vietnam War movie, but ask any veteran and he'll swing that idea - most veterinarians will say it stinks. <br /> <br /> Or consider it a will or don't play morality - nothing rich there. <br /> <br /> Wherever I found, the value was in excellent self-referencing. Coppola needs a large enough container (war) to play the great multidimensional actor who plays a great man. <br /> <br /> Brando the man was so much of a maverick as the Kurtz character. The studios were uncomfortable with his acting 'method', but he always got out and achieved awards; the 'generals' are uncomfortable with Kurtz's 'unhealthy methods', despite his strategic genius. <br /> <br /> So Coppola makes a movie all about Brando's greatness. To make a hammer, he puts himself in the movie (like Hopper, a manic photo journalist loaded with multiple cameras) to express his praise. Brando himself is only seen in half light and silhouette - brilliant cinematography by Storaro that only increases the actor's power. And he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation. Oh yes: "the horror ..." <br /> <br /> Other interests: the widespread use of stand-camera perspectives, including "in the firefight" long before "Private Ryan"; the groundbreaking use of sound, especially the ominous flirting cattle and the sonic representation of an acidic journey. <br /> <br /> Don't be caught in outer layers; The rich part you have to remember from this is the brilliant core of sound, vision and self-reference.
