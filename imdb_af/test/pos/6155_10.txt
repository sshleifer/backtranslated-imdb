I saw this movie in Wales in July. It deals with the courage of Czech pilots who flew several missions for the RAF after their country was occupied by the Nazis. In this film, action takes place in the early 1950s when these pilots were beaten in political prisons in Czeckoslavakia and during World War II in Britain. They were imprisoned after returning to their homeland because the Communist government regarded these warriors as a threat to their occupation of Czeckoslavakia. The pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous air battles against Nazi pilots. This film contains a love subplot that makes sense because it helps us understand that both civilians and soldiers made great sacrifices to maintain democracy. The end of this film suggests that the heroism of these Czech pilots was eventually recognized in the early 1990s following the restoration of democracy in the country known as Czeckoslavakia. This powerful and moving film was made with financial support from the Czech government. I recommend this movie.
