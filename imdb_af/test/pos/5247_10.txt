Contrary to the comments posted directly below, The Big Trail (1930) was not filmed in a three-camera process, "much like the later Cinerama." This was the final for Napoleon (1927), another movie entirely! The Big Trail is shot simultaneously in both 35mm and 70mm (Grandeur) versions, and both versions are shown on Fox Movie Channel from time to time. So it's easy to compare the one with the other. The Grandeur version (broadcast in mailbox @ about its original 2-1 ratio) is more impressive films with its wide-angle panoramas, but suffers from the same problem that occupies early CinemaScopes, a lack of close-ups that forced director Raoul Walsh due to focus problems. Scenes involving individuals, rather than crowds or long shots, are far more effective in the standard version, as the camera can move closer to the players, thereby achieving a greater sense of engagement with the viewer. If you watch the two versions simultaneously, you get an accurate idea of ​​which shots Walsh prefers to shoot near, in the standard version, but couldn't, in the Grandeur version. There are also some series that include El Brendel: a shell game with Ian Keith, and a business with his wife and a jackass that is in the Grandeur version, but is lacking in the standard version. <br /> <br /> For The Record, The Big Trail is the only one of three Fox Grandeur movies that survived in its original wide screen format. (The other two are Fox Movietone Follies of 1929, completely lost, and Happy Days, which survive only in standard format.) Other studios have also experimented with wide movie at this time, but the only other one still in both formats is The Bat Whispers, filmed in both 65mm and 35mm, and released by United Artists. Other wide films were MGM's Billy the Kid (1930) and The Great Meadow (1931), RKO's Danger Lights (1930) and WB's The Lash (1930), all of which can be seen in their standard format versions at Turner Classic Movies. WB's Kismet (1930) is also widely and standard filmed, but seems to have disappeared completely; It is rumored to be lost. <br /> <br /> Why did the wide movie fail in 1930? Theaters were under the impact of the stock market crash of October 1929 and the increasing cost of installing sound equipment, and it was negative to accommodate the additional costs of installing additional new projection equipment and new wider screens. just a handful of movies, photographed in a variety of different systems that were not always compatible. It won't be until 1953 when Fox, now Twentieth Century Fox, tried again, and this time it succeeds in launching wide-screen CinemaScope.
