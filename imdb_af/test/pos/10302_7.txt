This movie is based on a play and is the second adaptation of this work. Paul Sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players who took the championship 20 years ago. They all met for a reunion. Terry Kinney plays James, a junior high school principal, and will quickly get on your nerves with all his whining and feel sorry for my role. Vincent D'Onofrio, like Phil, plays a silly businessman with just the right amount of money. Tony Shalhoub is George, the current mayor of the town, apparently on the verge of some fall. Gary Sinise plays Tom, an author, became alcoholic and I think is excellent in the role. While they are all planning to celebrate their championship, conflicts, jealousy and battles are plentiful. As the men with what was, and now, they are forced to look at their lives in a non-pleasant way. It is unusual for a group of men to talk and cry about what might have been, and I found it interesting to see if they were related. It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely good enough for a viewing.
