No doubt about it. This is the animated short that Uncle Walt puts on the map of success. When Walt's older brother, Roy, suggested the next Mickey Mouse had to include short sounds, Walt jumped at the chance. The result: Steamboat Willie was a runaway for 1928. After all, it was the first animated short box with a synchronized soundtrack (mostly music and sound effects, such as dialogue was minimal). Not like a wet blanket, but the short is far from perfect. Animation before 1935 was insane and rather recognizable (but once equipment made improvements and better artistic techniques were created, the rest was sailing smoothly) and the sound was primitive (Disney wanted to use the well-known RCA Sound System, or the Western Electric Noiseless sound system, but refused by both companies, prompting Disney to use the photo phone system that PA Powers experimented with at that time. The plot (here is a real plot line about this?). Mr. Mickey (like the aforementioned Willie) is the pilot of a steamboat, which is affected by Black Pete (Captain Pete to you) and decides to have a jam session on the ship. The various animals on board as musical instruments (ASPCA, note). If you don't think too much about the technical shortcomings, Steamboat Willie can be fun for eight minutes (and a piece of history).
