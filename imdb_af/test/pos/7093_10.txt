It is not surprising that the majority of voices were delivered by women of 45+ years. This is the time frame in women's lives when they become the caregivers of the elderly and sick parents. In June, I lost my mother to cancer complications and, through most of the same emotions, portrayed Zellweger in this film. Yes, it made me cry, but the tears were real, the characters were real, and plot development was very accurate. Kudos for the entire cast and crew for a wonderful portrayal of life and death, and the promises of tomorrow.
