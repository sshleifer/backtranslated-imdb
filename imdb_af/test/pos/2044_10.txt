I love this movie ...! I saw it 1000 x on DVD and I can't say enough about it. It has everything, comedy, great action and amazing stunts / fx. Samuel Jackson steals the show big time. I don't think there is a moment he is in that he is not funny! "Everyone knows that if you make an assumption, you make a claim from you and dream" !! The f / x is great! The bridge / truck explosion is incredible, although the sound is not so good! When Samuel drives out of the truck, the sound is a bit off and he thinks he's priceless !!! For those who own it on DVD, put the sound in French !!! It's halarious !!! Even emotional moments are great if the bad guy discovers that Sam's / Charlie's daughter is she is wonderful ... It's a good movie that can't do any action ... I also recommend Cutthroat Island ... Except all the negative publicity, it kicks !!!!
