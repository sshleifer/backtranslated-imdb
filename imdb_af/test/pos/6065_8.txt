First, I'm an American. I have not seen any comment on IMDb about this series, but of an American viewer. Secondly, I work in the television industry in development. So I turn into a lot of slime that comes from American broadcast programming. "Unity One" is an example of television that is a setback to what I would characterize as a 70s scripting. On behalf of those films made by young authors, who had free adversity to make the plays, feel realistic and make organic character development possible. It sounds more like star British dramas such as "Cracker" and "Prime Suspect" as well as Australia's brilliant "Underbelly". "Unity One" has separate cases that are dedicated, then resolved, every week. The mysteries are not extraordinary or particularly byzantine. They are usually around one turn, usually in 40 minutes, and the resolution is neatly wrapped in the 15 minutes. What gives this series a fresh air is that it contains main characters you're linked to and that are related to episode 2. These are real, breathing, living characters who have personal luggage, but it is not a spotty, kind of baggage. that American flotsam like "Gray's Anatomy" or "Desperate Housewives" spoons out. These are realistic individuals whose backgrounds unfold over the course of the series as if you were working with them daily. After the sensible decade of "CSIs," "NCIS's," and "Criminal Minds", along with their subsequent spawns, it is refreshing to actually sit down to see friends you want to spend time, such as at Unit One. "The fierce banter, the ominous wooden dialogue and the overwhelming threat that the American series I have blown with us every week is absurd compared to the nuances and the silent resonance you get with this remarkable Danish series. I'm on episode 7 from the first season, but I have been buying and selling for four seasons. If you need explosions and hidden testosterone, along with The Who's music and fast, neon-lit, bitter disability cam action with cryptic main characters As your main diet of television drama views, I suggest you stay away from this series. If you are an adult with hunger for subtle, attractive, thoughtful and, indeed, straightforward, straightforward crime dramas, I'm going to check this exhibition.
