Nothing short of beautiful photography / movies in this movie. The fact that you keep looking and hoping for more flying rows tells you they just got enough. The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly interwoven, and the dogs are beautiful ............. <br /> <br /> a must rent, see or see. <Br /> <br /> Don't be afraid of captions ....... <br /> <br /> It is worthwhile to appreciate a little aversion therapy. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br />
