I saw this movie when I was a kid and have been looking for it since then. It is there with Cabin in The Sky, Stormy Weather and Carmen Jones as a must see in movies depicting the incredible talent of African Americans. In the 60's, local Los Angeles TV stations will have a movie of the week and some stations will show the same movie for 5 days. Porgy and Bess were one of them and my whole family will be there for 5 nights in front of the TV and just moved on the commercials. South Pacific, Oklahoma and The Sound of Music are all musical classics that you can add to any video store. It will be a pity that this collection of the best talent that America offers is forgotten or locked in a safe. Please make the movie available to the public.
