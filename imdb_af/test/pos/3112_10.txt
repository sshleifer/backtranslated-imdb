I finally got my DVD today, watched it and am pleased to announce that it is the original theater version of the movie. As you may have read in previous reviews of "Rich and Famous", this is for the TV version of the movie made in VHS somehow in the late 90's, but now WB has fixed the error and completed on DVD with the plane grid, Matt Lattanzi's bare buttocks and the scene in the hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) Merry (Candice Bergen) calls, a C ** t! It's all there and looks better than ever! A sharp clear digital transmission, wide screen and special features that include original theater cars and a 1981 feature set known as 'On Location with Rich and Famous'. If you like this movie like me, you won't be disappointed with buying this DVD. Glad to finally have it on DVD? Well the wait is waiting! Thanks Warner Bros!
