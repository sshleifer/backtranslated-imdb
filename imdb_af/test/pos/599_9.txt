Who doesn't like the muppets? It is impossible to look at them without getting into a warm, fuzzy feeling. So, I think what's important is that this movie looks very successful in capturing what makes the muppets so special. I don't remember much of the details of the plot, but the different moments and characters in the movie, I remember quite fine. In fact, there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere for the whole movie, but without being badly self-conscious. Refreshment for someone who might also get depends on careful detail and technique; the "magic" surpasses all those other things. 'It's actually what movies are made. <br /> <br /> So how does the movie achieve this? Hmmm, good question! Am stomped? Let's look. Really, I feel it's pretty simple. The filmmakers believe in their material and don't take themselves too seriously in the process. I probably won't say the movie has really inspired moments, but it does have a certain life (it's hard enough to miss a large number of "real people" movies). A shave. You really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures. They also have some innocence over them which makes them even more encouraging. <br /> <br /> Overall, I get the impression that the people who made the movie were not afraid to try what they were at the time the whole thing felt pretty loose. Similar to a very accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session. A lot of talent, little predictability and very warm personalities come through. The comos were, of course, a lot of good surprises. Maybe I don't feel like I want to say much about it, because I was half asleep when I saw it (and / or as I write this review). Anyway, I remember myself here, but I really had the feeling of family that had the movie. Full of love, I suppose you can say. Again, a feeling of nostalgia does not feel that many films reach so effectively or effortlessly. <br /> <br /> And to repeat myself, one of the best charms of the movie is the relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Like the Nathaniel Hawthorne quote about the happiness of being (like) a butterfly, the Muppet Movie is very successful partially by not attempting to do so. The same with beauty is best undiscovered or untouched or unconstrained or something. Anyway, if it looks juicy, I think it was hilarious too. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie was very funny, touching and hard to smile at. Plus it contains great music! Highly recommended to all people, both young and young at heart.
