Not the movie to see if you want to be intellectually stimulated. If you want a lot of fun, however, the theater is the one. Very tasty bitter (and a bit tasty). Mos Def and Seth Green are very funny than the comic lighting. Exciting and creative lifts and chases. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron (sexy) are very attractive. And Donald Sutherland!
