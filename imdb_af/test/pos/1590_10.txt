Enjoy every moment of this clever spectacle of music to suit (Mahler's 5th is beautiful, but listens to the vocal part of the 3rd symphony that is so beautifully used in this movie). There are many aspects of this film, but the major is the overwhelming power of beauty, its spontaneous nature, the absence of logic for love and worship. I am also a fiery fan of Bogarde and believe that he was seldom so wonderful (try him in "The Servant"). Note: I repeat several views.
