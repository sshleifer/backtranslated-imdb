Two years after 'plane!' Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker threw one of his stars - Leslie Nielsen - into this hilarious television series, a wonderful run of old American detectives like Dragnet. Nielsen played Frank Drebin, America's answer to 'Clouseau Inspector'. It has the same style of humor as 'airplane!' Had; clever visual gags in the background, unnoticed absurdities, and repetitive characters like Johnny the shoe-clean boy who knows everything about everything. Guest stars (including William Shatner!) Were killed in the opening credits. 'Police group' was the first American sitcom since 'Batman' to have a laugh track. Many have complained that only six episodes were made, but I think it was right. The concept could never have undergone a full 24-episode run. Five years later, 'Police Squad' made a successful transfer to the big screen when the first of the 'Naked Gun' trilogy was released. Jim, Jerry, David and Leslie had the last laugh.
