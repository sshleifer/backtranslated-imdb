With the fairly recent release of Carlos Saura's "Fados" in the United States (albite limited house-only release), it is high time for a re-release of this fine documentary on Amalia Rodrigues. This film is a treasure trove of cute Amalia movie clips on Portuguese and American television, as well as several other movie clips, including one of her and her Mother who can easily tear the maco man. I only saw this fine documentary document a few years back when it received the unjustified "art house" release (it earned much better). Fortunately, there are several recordings of Amalia's best recordings on several "budget line" recordings (commonly available in places like K-Mart or Best Buy), or if you're looking for some, you can get some of the original versions refined. , either on E-Bay or one of those distribution services specializing in expensive European imported CDs. There are at least two versions of this documentary in circulation (the original Portuguese version, without English subtitles, and the American version in Portuguese with English subtitles, except the European version cannot be played on most USDVD players, due to the PAL color line system). Not rated by the MPAA but contains nothing to offend.
