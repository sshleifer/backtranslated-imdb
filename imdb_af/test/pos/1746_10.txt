Wow. I saw this movie and "Up" the same day within several hours of each other at different theaters. I first saw "Mr. Bug" and was then completely disappointed with Up's follow-up. What a beautiful and enjoyable movie! Movies from the 1930s and 40s to us today can bring their melodramatic acting and dialogue, but as animation, the same melodrama and groaning humor can be wonderful. And the soft "organic" lines of 30's drawing AND the music just puts you in a nice comfortable atmosphere and you can enjoy the show with all its characters: ladybugs, locusts, bees, snails, stinkbugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, cricket and more each with all their own cute little (but not offensive) idiosyncrasies. The interaction with the human world, of nemesis (cigar smokers, high-heeled carriers, innocent kick-the-can children) to the kind-hearted, and the unknown destroyers, is realistic and fascinating. You care about the mistakes, AND Dick and Mary. The protagonist Hoppity is not a perfect superman who comes to fix things, but a star-eye optimist who leads everyone along the garden road (literally!) And every time you think it'll be happy in the 1930s style, Nog ends a roadblock ...! I was on the edge of my seat much more than with "Up." I grabbed out of the movie and clapped it: something that has not happened long ago!
