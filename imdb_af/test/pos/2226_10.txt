I watched this movie in a theater while on vacation in Pablo CO. I just closed my biomedical engineering at a hospital. I see the writing as an exaggeration of the right kind of things going on in hospitals. <br /> <br /> The idiots who put it on production value are not getting the point and are probably never hospitalized. And never worked for sure. Billy Jack (the same era) was very poorly crafted, but had significant social comments and was a very good movie with a real social message. <br /> <br /> I've been looking for this movie since it's the first site. I found where it was called.
