COMING on the heels of the 1970s "Blackploitation" Era, CONRACK (20th Century Fox, 1974) offers audiences a low key, sincere and everyday kind of drama. Offers a very different audience to his audience (much more common than those "Gansta" flashes); to be a downward dose of realism that provides a lonely balance to those shooting emotions. <br /> <br /> REPLACEMENT OF Lead Characters that were bad-ass detectives, super flies and megs / macks / pimps (choose your terminology), was a lonely, humble and gentle teacher. The academic we speak to is the main character, Pat Conroy; who is the only one-time teacher appointed to accept the responsibility of a kind of old schoolhouse on an island along the coast of South Carolina. <br /> <br /> "CONRACK" (Jon Voight) The name the young people keep with him finds conditions in the school terribly deteriorating. In addition to the physical characteristics of this "Little Red School House", any systematic and progressive graduate education system was completely absent. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, incidentally, we mentioned further complications for any successful educational venture manifested in two indisputable facts. It was that Pat Conroy was both an outsider and he was white; with almost the entire population of this off-shore quay black and very poor. <br /> <br /> To prevent these unacceptable and deplorable conditions, the agents of the local education council were; being the principal, Mrs. Scott (Madge Sinclair) and the superintendent, Mr. Skeffington (Mr. Hume Cronyn). Between the two, we understand that the teacher, the low man on the totem pole, is in most cases powerless to influence any significant, long-lasting improvements. <br /> <br /> But not 'You tell a' Young Turk ', like Pat Conroy, he can't. (Nothing can do, it's). "Conrack" spends a year of unorthodox classroom performance and makes real progress; but unfortunately, the strong-minded teacher will not enter and acknowledge the authority of his superiors. While he is by law and unknown to him, he serves you very much; he doesn't like mr. Skeffington's specific order and prohibition to take his classics on South African mainland on Halloween for some tricks or treatment; even go to the Skeffington residence after the bad act. <br /> <br /> NEXT we see a West Union Telegram messenger singing happily while going from the Carolina mainland to the island. where he transfers the telegram to Conroy who carries the news of his dismissal from his position at that school and district. <br /> <br /> No one left to fire, Pat files tackle Mr Skeffington, Principal Mrs. Scott and the Education Council protest his dismissal as illegal. The judge asks Skeffington to review the "offense" and the law impartially if there is less punishment that can be replaced for Conroy's separation of the school system; to which he receives a negative response. The judge dismissed the suit with his hammer, saying: "It's very simple!" <br /> <br /> The story is brought to a bittersweet conclusion, as the 'Conrack' students see it to the continent's launch, while a phonograph record gives us with BEETHOVEN's fifth symptoms; which played an important role in the Conroy educational agenda as well as our story. <br /> <br /> In this author's opinion, the story (which we believe was at least semi-autobiographical, and even the main character the author's name), was much more than a story of a localized event. Both my pals Schultz and Myself; It is a kind of portrayal of a microcosm that represents the overall deplorable state of affairs that the government schools penetrate throughout the nation. (Just an opinion) <br /> <br /> AS FOR THIS MOVIE, it was just one of the movies depicting the shops of ordinary people; leading their lives of "silent despair" in the great interior of the country, located outside the DC Beltway and the urban centers of business and communication, located on the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean. <br /> <br /> IN HIS OWN LITTLE WAY, this is a fine movie that will soon be joining such great works as NORMA RAE and BREAKWAY WEG in the movie vault of the 20th century. (both from TCF in 1979). <br /> <br /> SEE this if you are not yet. Recommended by both Schulz and his buddy. * <br /> <br /> NOTE: * Why, of course I am! <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
