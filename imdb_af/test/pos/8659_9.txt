first real movie this year. incredibly long shots, sometimes with a fixed camera, so specific to the Nordic theater (leave Dogma away). A true author movie I find it. Athmospherique :-) It only delighted my senses and remembered how the image became violent and painful at the scene when he tried to kill himself. This is the point I don't think it stands up in the whole plot. Why, if it was an ideal world, could you not die, but still keep your conscience? The real world was also with "custom" rules or was a "fantastic" world, but in this case there were no accidents like people remembering how it could have happened before. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of Kafka and maybe more, of Huxley's Brave New World, especially in that part where sex was actually available to everyone, as it was considered a right to pleasure. It lacked a plot, but I think it was better like this, as you realized and observed all the strange actions of everyone, the absurdity and the lack of true sensations in this "happy" world. <br /> <br /> I also think the end was brilliant. True world is indeed a homo homini lupus, you are eaten if you are not strong enough.
