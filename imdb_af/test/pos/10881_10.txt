definitely the best game for N64 ever. Most of the time I said I was very disappointed with tomorrow, never dying, but the world is not enough promises to be better than gold (according to the website). I love Goldeneye so much, I find something to do every time I play it. I even set up my own missions for the levels. Multi-player is the best of any game out there, and the graphics are amazing even now. The first day I got it, I remember wishing they would go back and make all the bond movies in games. Can you imagine driving and speeding that speed boat and making those incredible jumps, or fighting ninjas or fighting jaws in the spy that loved me and moonraker? (I think he will fight in those games, will be more fun than in the Aztec), how about Sanchez in the trucks or for Stalls for your eyes. Oh, let me come back to the game at hand. All levels are unique and make for fun fun lethal environments. There are lots of places to hide, so you can cut people (especially statue park). This game is not worth renting, you really have to buy it today.
