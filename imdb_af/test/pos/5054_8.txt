I was delighted to see my husband renting "Labyrinth of Passion". I love Almodovar's movies. We both loved the movie. We can't both stop laughing. We especially enjoyed the scene in which the transvestite shot a photo novel, and while being suspected of being hit by an electric drill, was told to answer the phone and say, "I can't do with don't talk, I'm attacked by a sadistic serial killer. If I survive, I'll call you back. "(This will make a great answering machine message to think about). We also loved the woman telling her new loved one," I went to an orgy after the concert, but I couldn't stop thinking. " I'm waiting to use that line on Twitter. "Labyrinth of Passion" is a rolling farce with very high jinks, hilarious dialogue and eye candy for everyone. The movie is well-dated: adding the costumes and hairstyles of the 1980s to the I will give it a 10 out of 10 rating, but I give it a 8 for two reasons, the first being the scene that includes laxatives, which includes a shot of a lady who pollutes herself: it is completely unnecessary and this brings the scene of the movie to Hollywood for a moment.The second is the suggestion that Queti sleeps with her father: shocking, yes, but again, it ruins the tone of the movie, yet I would recommend the movie everyone who wants a sophisticated, spicy and fun time.
