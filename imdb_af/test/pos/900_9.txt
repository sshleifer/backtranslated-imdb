Gen-Y Cops ... since I heard that the movie is released, I want to see it because I loved Gen-X Cops. I was a little disappointed that A) Nicholas Tse didn't return and B) too much slapstick. Still, I enjoyed the sequel because it can't be as good as the first movie, but it's good in its own way. <br /> <br /> Stephen Fung returns as the ultracool man, Match, who is a steady girl in Oli (NOTE: Where is Haze?) And Sam Lee returns as the mad Alien (this time a mohawk and speaks lots of English !!!!). The real star of the movie is newcomer Edison Chen. He's a good replacement for Nicholas Tse as ... Edison. I also enjoyed Paul Rudd's performance of Agent Curtis. He looks like the nails, smartmouth FBI Agent you'd like to hate ... but soon you want his character. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes are much better in this one ... although there are very few, but they are big, thanks to Jackie Chan stuntman Nicky Li. <br /> <br /> Look for a Ron Smoorenburg cameo as a loft fighter who has a teenage little match with Match. Smoorenburg is also the stunt double for Rudd. <br /> <br /> If you like GEN-X COPS, you'll love GEN-Y COPS!
