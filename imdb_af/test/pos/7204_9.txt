I was fortunate to see this successor in front of the original, because I'm not sure I would have seen it if the opposite was true. I found "Mission Cléâtre" better than predecessor for various reasons, but most importantly, it was almost word for word an adaptation of one book, not an amalgam like the first movie. The physical likeness of some characters to their animated self was very funny, especially the bad guy (whose name is me, but he is the other architect). I don't know how this movie played in English; My first language is French, so I didn't have that problem ... I think some of the jokes were not so easy to translate. I've learned something over the years, it's better to see a movie with the captions than with the dubbing. Perhaps you will not understand what is being said, but you will not lose the rhythm and I think it is important too. I would recommend this movie to anyone who really loves Astérix et Obélix.
