In the dramatization of Wilde's novel, John Osborne condensed, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than Dorian's essential evil. If you want a more explicit version, see the 1945 movie. Wild and Robert Louis Stevenson lived about the same time, but were certainly many different men and writers. This story really covers a theme like Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, while RLS took the scientific route. Both protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil, with the bad victory eventually. <br /> <br /> The actors in this BBC movie also take a different route from those in the 1945 movie. John Gielgud says both the same bite and cynical quips as George Sanders, in his role, Wilde himself, but with a subtle difference. You would suspect that Sanders really believed what he had said, but Gielgud could say what is expected of him, rather than what he truly believes. Peter Firth also shows the two sides of his character in a limited way, but then we don't see as many of his escapes as Hurd Hatfield had a chance to show. <br /> <br /> It's a very good production, with the dramatization reflecting the creatures of the novel, if not all its effects.
