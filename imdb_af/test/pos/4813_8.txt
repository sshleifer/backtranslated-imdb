Not high art, not even extremely innovative, but an enjoyable movie. Funny, fresh, intelligent - there are still people out there who don't need millions of dollars to hide out of ideas. <br /> <br /> When you compare it to your average Hollywood action movie, compare a home-made meal with a large Mac.
