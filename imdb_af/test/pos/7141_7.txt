True, it's not John Sayles best movie (brother of another planet), but it's not completely forgotten, if not for any other reason than his message. Like Batman, Wild Thing's parents were murdered in front of him. He killed him in 'The Zone', a corrupt part of an unnamed city where greed and violence prevail. Instead of falling in like Chopper (Robert Davi), Wild Thing fights for justice, uses his powers of Tai Chi and ominous cat pressures, sometimes raises him. He becomes something of an urban legend, a modern Robin Hood, and a hero for centuries. 1987 on his most beautiful, Wild Things
