I watched it because a friend told me it was good, and I watched a video about it, so I really watched it. I watched it, and, damn, the fighting tones are really good. If the guys can't fight that way in real life, they surely mislead me. There aren't as many battles as I want, I have to say, but the battles in the movie are pretty spectacular. They don't show much, but you can say it's violent and cool. But there is also the plot, which goes around a love triangle between the main characters, even though it is a little twisted. Tae-sung is a carefree man who seems to love in trouble as well as fighting. He is the leader of his school, and is the rival of Hea-won, who is the leader of his own school - a bit of a playboy, hothead and rich boy. Then there is Han-kyung, a girl who doesn't go much for her - her father just died and she went back with her mother, the man she liked was her old friend, and then she met Hea- won, who goes to her school, and Tae-sung, who calls her "nuna" (older sister). Eventually she discovers Tae-sung is her brother, fruit of one of her father's affairs, and he loves her despite their blood relationship. Meanwhile, Hea-won falls for her and takes her as his boyfriend. But she was torn between her boyfriend and her little brother, confessing her love for her. Overall, this is a wonderful movie, but if I was really depressed after the end, and I just couldn't help but think, Damn, is all Korean film I look at fighting / death / depressing / incest? For this was probably the case with Old Son and Temptation of Wolves. It's a very good movie, but people need to be ready to cry at the end.
