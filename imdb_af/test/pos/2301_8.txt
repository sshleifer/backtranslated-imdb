In the Realm of the Senses is a beautifully filmed, well-written and wonderfully filmed film. It tells the haunting story of a woman killing her husband after falling in love with another man. The ghost of her husband continues to haunt her lord after his murder. This movie is really good, anyone who is interested should definitely watch it.
