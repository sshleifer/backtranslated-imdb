I saw Anatomy when it came out and bought it recently and the 2003 successor. And if I watch many foreign films in different genres, you should definitely see movies in their original language. Not only is it annoying to know that the voices do not belong to the actors, but they always look cheerful, as the whole movie is one big long toothpaste commercial or something. It makes an otherwise fantastic movie look terrible and I had to convert many of my friends who thought foreign films were not as good as North American movies - it's not Hollywood enough. Also, their translation is never right, it's too literal, and screws the vibe of the movie, even if it's basically the same thing. I watched Anatomy myself in German the other week, with subtitles with my roommate, because he was on his laptop and didn't want to miss parts, as he couldn't see the captions because he was typing. 30 minutes and he asked me to finish and start the subtitle movie. He loved it! Both movies are great as intellectual horror movies! Kelly
