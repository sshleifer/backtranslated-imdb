I'm a Christian and thought this movie was pretty good! :) While the play was not the Academy Award Calibration, I thought it was good, as the cast at the time this movie was made had limited acting experience. <br /> <br /> The gospel message and the transforming power of Jesus Christ have been declared wonderful. The message the director is trying to overcome (which is the important thing, not how the characters dressed!) Definitely came through. The theme of the main characters involved in illegal drag racing was also a good idea (cool muscle cars, VAT). I think this movie will definitely reach out to many young people. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie, it's a good testimony! :)
