I also joined IMDB for the sole purpose of commenting on this movie, but to sing my praise. I have never heard of this movie (it's so terribly packed that it's easy to see why it might come by) but a good friend suggested it to me and I'm so glad she did. It's a jewel of a movie. The actors are great (especially Kathy Bates and Meredith Eaton) and seem to have a real time. Certainly at times it was a little over, but I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard or so much in the course of two hours. If you love to laugh, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
