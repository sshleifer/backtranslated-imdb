When I see LAUREN BACALL, CACTUS FLOWER dreamed on Broadway that one day I would see an actress like INGRID BERGMAN playing the Bacall role on the screen. But here Ingrid really leaves her hair for some good comedy moments as the dental nurse pretends to be WALTER MATTHAU's wife so he can continue with the fiber he told GOLDIE HAWN. <br /> <br /> This is a story played for laughter from start to finish, good-natured things that never run through dry humor and whites. There are many one-liners or gags that are beyond the ordinary situation. Comedy stuff you hear on TV. The lines are true, because they mix well with the characters and their motives. <br /> <br /> As the daffy girl who initially committed suicide over her unhappy relationship with Matthau, GOLDIE HAWN (fresh from her days as a star on TV's "Laugh In") has a stupid blonde role to perfection. Easy to see why she won the supporting actress Oscar. <br /> <br /> Ingrid surprisingly comes in a rare comedian, but there are times when she looks just a little too matric. In any case, she is a surprising choice to play the nurse who places a freezer at the office, but is much warmer from service. <br /> <br /> As Goldie's neighboring neighbor, Igor, Rick Lenz makes himself wonderful, and makes a suitable match for her in that final scene. <br /> <br /> Matthau plays the kind of character she has become in the trade in all the Neil Simon roles he had - a lovely caddy trapped in his own mess when he tells lies to lies. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of rib-tickling comedy that will make you laugh aloud on some of the amusing lines that Abe Burrows and IAL Diamond have managed to cut together, based on a French farce.
