John Carpenter's brilliantly exciting movie is a great fusion of Sci-Fi and horror, and captures the classic body-swap theme and takes it to the limit. A remake of the Howard Hawks made 1951 original. Carpenter holds the Cold War themes of paranoia and confidence as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending punishment in the madness and isolation of the Antarctic. Carpenter's direction as always is excellent, as his camera moves through the lonely world of characters, whose habitable environment is about to be damaged by the ancient fear of body names. But here and there, like the work of David Cronenberg, Carpenter does not hold back on the incident, because through some fantastic special effects we are witnessing bad moments of surrealist gore. Yet, he never loses the human side of the story, as everything that is shocking before us, is left behind with concepts of trust and suspicion. <br /> <br /> 9/10
