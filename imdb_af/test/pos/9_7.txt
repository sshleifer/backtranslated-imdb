I saw this story before, but my kids didn't. Boy with troubled past joins military, past faces, falls in love and becomes a man. The mentor this time is played perfectly by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with common everyday problems living an extraordinary conviction to save lives. After losing his team, he takes a teaching position that trains the next generation of heroes. The young troubled site is played by Kutcher. While his scenes with local love interest are a bit stiff and do not generate enough heat to melt butter, he compensates Costner well. I never really understood Sela Ward as the neglected woman and felt she wanted to go from Costner to solve his safety as opposed to her selfish needs. But her presence on the screen is a pleasure. The two untouched stars of this movie are the Coast Guard and the sea. Both powerful powers that should not be taken for granted in real life or in this film. The movie has a few slow spots and could use the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the character ratios. But it still works. The rescue panels are intense and well-filmed and edited to provide maximum impact. This movie deserves public appeal. And the applause of my two sons.
