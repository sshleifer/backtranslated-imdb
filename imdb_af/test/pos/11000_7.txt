General Trelayne is a superhero who wants to play a small game with the crew of the Enterprise. Very unlikely and careless things appear, and Trelayne seems obsessed with the human practices of warfare and murder. He seems necessary to experience what he thinks is an excitement and created a human environment (though a few hundred years out of date) to play his fantasies. The environment is subtly uncomfortable and the crew immediately starts the inconsistencies. Soon it becomes clear that Trelayne is not just an immature god, but a lot of cases. No matter how you feel about this one, hold onto the Twilight Zone-like end. It is worth the effort. <br /> <br /> As many pointed out, Trelayne's character inspired the more developed and amusing sequential character Q. And you can do more than just shades of Campbell's Trelayne in John DeLancie's construction of that personality. It is nice to compare how the four chiefs we saw deal with Q handle everything so radically differently with him.
