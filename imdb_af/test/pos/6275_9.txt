Miles O'Keeffe again accepts the role of the powerful Ator in this first sequel to the original film. <br /> <br /> What can I say? - It represents pretty much B-Movie Nirvana! <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the writing is awful, the acting is quite complete, the special effects .... let's not even go there! - All this movie is a real delight! <br /> <br /> Highlights of the film include Ator and Thong (his dumb companion, not his underwear) attacked by invisible attackers in a cave (certainly saved on the fx budget there!), Ator struggles which must be the most unconvincing giant snake ever dedicated to celluloid, and of course the infamous hanging scene! <br /> <br /> There is one question I already have ...... At the end of the movie, we see a huge atomic explosion when Ator supposedly destroys the Geometric Nucle (as the narrator tells us). .. .. How did Ator destroy and manage it in hell? Has he formed a form of primitive timer / detonator or something? <br /> <br /> Oh yes, such an illogical end really only adds to the movie's overall charm - they just don't make it like this!
