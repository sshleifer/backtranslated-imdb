During his career, Lucio Fulci made many fantastic films and led the way many of them had a bucket load, the title "The Godfather of Gore". While a duck is not tortured, it has become known to Fulci before gorehounds, and not everything is greedy; it is definitely a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best movie ever made by Fulci! Don't torture a duckling. In fact, head and shoulders above the Giallo genre in terms of production values ​​and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this Giallo is wonderful. The plot focuses on a small, rustic community where the bodies began. The murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys. Shortly after police found an innocent man guilty of the crimes, a reporter named Andrea Martelli came to town and decided to investigate the murders. Martelli will soon meet several suspects, including a sexy young lady named Patricia, a sinister priest and a local witch who likes to make wax effigies and pins in them. <br /> <br /> While this movie may not contain much of it, it does have two of Fulci's nastiest rows to make it up. The nastiest involves a woman being brutally slaughtered by a group of men in a cemetery, while the image of a man falling off a cliff and hitting a number of rocks on the way makes it possible to turn stomach. Don't torture a Duckling trait, an absolutely fantastic Italian cast. Barbara Bouchet (a personal favorite of mine) is incredibly sexy in her role as Patricia, and gets her acting muscles more than she did in many later movies. Tomas Millian is excellent as usual, while the rest of the cast is very good, such as Irene Pappas, Florinda Bolkan and Marc Porel. The on-screen cinematography is stunning and Fulci gives the viewer the impression that he takes great care and effort into every scene. The story slows down, and it's always interesting, as Fulci never allows the movie to deviate too much from the central plot line. There is not much secrecy about the identity of the killer; but Fulci hardly succeeds in guessing us to the end and do not torture a duck, but climb to a climax. Overall, it's a pity that Fulci didn't make films like this anymore. Don't torture a duck, its best and best work and I insist that every Giallo fan see it!
