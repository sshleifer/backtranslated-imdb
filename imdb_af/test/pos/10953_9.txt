slowly moving but smart. go through as if you were alive. filled with thought-provoking ideas art race and is cool. that one thing hit me hard was the ideas about rock-n-roll ways of life. <br /> <br /> All the performances are improvised. I'll say it again. ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS IMPROVED sound like a gym, but it doesn't really make the characters really like someone you will adhere to. It's also a great thing when you think about how strong the character is in this movie. right from the start in the title sequence, it instantly establishes Ben as an erasure by the way he moves the crowd <br /> <br /> Well, it breaks like this if you are a person who is the jazz / rocker lifestyle of cool living. you will like if your smart and good movie of total crap understands, you will love it and if you both, then it may be your fav <br /> <br /> but if you are not one of these, you will probably his boring and say it doesn't follow 'one line' and write a crap review like Ben_Cheshire
