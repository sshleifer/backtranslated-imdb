We are all in agreement. It was an excellent show and made the way ahead. I decided that if I really enjoyed a show, it was often the shit. I like the strange, ensemble cast shows, and a good environment always helps. I really expected to see many of these stars in other television productions, but short of Mariska Hagartay who played Crazy Girlfriend of Fisher Stephens, I didn't see many of them except in the case of an upcoming role. What a shame. <br /> <br /> Key West, Northern Exposure, Gilmore Girls and Veronica Mars ... all the good performances, everything is sad before their time. <br /> <br /> Hear us out loud And clear, we want Key West on DVD ..... please.
