This adaptation for TV was a wonderful vehicle for Bill Irwin to show his ability to perform physical humor. With the backdrop of an actor and writer / director battle, Bill uses his clowning antics to present a variety of skills, including hat sticks, pantomime, dance and various physical devices. <br /> <br /> Whilst it is a great sweep at the entertainment industry and its craft, it is exciting for people of all levels and ages. <br /> <br /> This work was requested as a PBS specialist. Bill did some of it on the Tonight Show, but out of context it didn't perform well.
