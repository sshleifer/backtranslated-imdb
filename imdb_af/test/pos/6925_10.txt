Although the plot of this movie is a bit far-fetched, it is worth seeing only the performances of Michaels Caine and Gambon. The latter gives a wonderful Dublin accent. Caine obstructs it ... which is exactly what the character he plays must do. Entertainment and fun, it's an hour and a half easy to watch.
