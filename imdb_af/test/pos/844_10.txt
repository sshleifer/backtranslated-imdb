I loved this show. I think the first time I tried rocky ice cream was because of this show. Wasn't the store right on the beach or something? I've been writing to Marci with Marci back and forth. I lost contact and wish I could connect as adults again. Anyone know where she is now? I wish they would put it on DVD. I seriously doubt it because I think there may be five or six people who even remember the show in the first place. They just don't make such shows anymore, do they? I wonder if it will still remain in this day and age. Do you know all who can burn DVDs from the show they've bound on VHS? I will be willing to pay (within reason).
