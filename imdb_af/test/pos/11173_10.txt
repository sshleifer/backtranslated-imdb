Currently the game's guy, right? <br /> <br /> The jokes were done. It's all over. The creative genius that driven this game for the first two games was gone. <br /> <br /> Wrong. <br /> <br /> The game is still unsuitable, the jokes are here, people. Sure, they were all rehash, but it was also Monkey Island 2. And 1, for that matter. <br /> <br /> The trouble is well placed, somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the ridiculously hard 2. The ship fighting sub-game is badly improper, in the tradition of sub-games. And this game has the best joke of the whole series. When asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach, always select "You don't need to see my identification." This is worth the price of the game itself.
