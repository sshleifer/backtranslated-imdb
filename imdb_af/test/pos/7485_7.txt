We are taken to a convenience store where Nick looks at the coins in his hand to see if he can get the special, a 69-cent 20-ounce cup of coffee with a free dough. He decides to go for the bigger size, which is, of course, more expensive, and it doesn't qualify for the cake. He is trying to argue with the Indian clerk in the register holding her land. With her, this is a principle. Well, Nick is annoyed not to get his own way and continues to kill her. <br /> <br /> The tone of the story has been set from the beginning. The people we are going to meet are not nice guys. There is Nick, his girlfriend, Dallas, and their partner, Billy Hill. They are drug dealers. Nick decides to visit Casey, his friend and former crime partner, in Houston. He wants to make another transaction and then go to Paris with the profit to sell the drugs he offers. What he doesn't realize is that Casey went straight. He is an architect, married to Christine, and wants to adopt a baby. <br /> <br /> Casey doesn't appreciate his former friend bringing drugs into the house. He decides to get rid of the stuff by rinsing them in the kitchen. The untimely arrival of Ice, a pizza deliveryman, surprised Casey. This man was sent to kill him, but before that Casey brought out a few weeds to share with Ice, who has a talent to beat. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jarvis, the man of the adoption agency, arrives. Casey's application shows a two-year gap that he can't justify. Jarvis is beginning to doubt the prospective father. At this stage Dallas is making an entry. She is a woman who asks questions, shines, like when she demands to know if Jarvis likes to watch porn. Jarvis, who is excited, ends with a bum. Dallas has decided to seduce Casey at all costs. There is a surprise in the store when Billy Hill enters the picture and he doesn't like what he sees and shoots Dallas in the process. Billy Hill also comes from Casey, but he's overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> Casey gets Kasarov's visit, wanting to get Nick's money; In his absence he will take it from Casey. Kasarov gives a deadline and Casey makes his thoughts out of smashing all these low lives. He came to his house at a fixed hour and the various factions would take care of themselves. In the end, Casey has a better plan that includes taking Christine for a stay in Paris. <br /> <br /> Never heard of Thursday, we were pulled by it because of the talent in it. Skip Woods directed his own material. It seems to be a movie with good intentions. Sometimes the movie remembers others of the same genre, not a sin by any form or form, which seems to be the main object of the negative comments left here on the IMDb website. For the first time, "Thursday" shows a witty Skip Woods who went to write other films, especially Swordfish. The script is divided into chapters with suggestive titles related to the action. Denis Lenoir does wonders with mostly domestic photography. <br /> <br /> Thomas Jane makes an excellent contribution to the film with his Casey. Although hard to think, he beat the odds and made something out of himself. This actor, recently seen in the television series "Hung", is one of the actors not tired of watching. A dark-haired Aaron Eckhart is a welcome addition to any movie. He is a greasy criminal who shows no redeeming qualities, or something close to remorse and does not hesitate to involve his former friend in his scheme. James LeGros has nothing to do. The same goes for Paulina Porizkova, a beautiful creature who is just a distraction or a memory to add a sexy angle. We enjoyed Glenn Plummer, which appears as Ice. He does an average audition on the phone. Michael Jeter and Mickey Rourke also appear.
