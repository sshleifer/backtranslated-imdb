Well, it's new ... The famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci shoots a film about a famous Italian horror director named ... Lucio Fulci. After years and years of horrific horror sequences, it becomes difficult for Lucio to separate the reality of fiction and he often swayed about committing violent murders. He quickly descends into a seemingly endless spiral of madness and immutable poison. Even the dedicated psychiatrist cannot stay on track for Fulci ... Now, when it comes to pure fun and entertainment, Cat in the Brain is probably one of Fulci's finest movies. The gore is overwhelming and abundant, to say the least. The amount of awkward massacre is impossible to describe, especially if you get your hands on the completely unsalted version (refer to the aka: "Nightmare Concert"). Decapitations everywhere, the intestines of the victims are scattered on all sides of the screen and the chain saws work overtime! The movie is also unknowingly funny (as it is so exaggerated) and a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when there is beer in the fridge. From a more professional point of view, this production cannot actually be called a masterpiece! There is not the least tension or atmosphere to find and the characters are completely empty. To make more room for the gore, characters are entered only 5 seconds and then killed a terrible death. Especially when compared to Fulci's highlights - such as "The Beyond" or "Do not Torture a Duckling" - this movie looks like a quick-warmed snack. The best way to interpret "Cat in the Brain" is like a personal statement by Fulci and a direct attack on censorship. Perhaps after seeing so many of his films? especially the latter? He is cut by censorship committees and based on pseudo-artistic critics. He wanted to avenge himself by delivering a greedy mess that simply cannot be cut! If you take out all the explicit violence and the really sick makeup effects, you only have 10 minutes of photos left! Especially because the bad murders later appear in the movie, as Fulci re-sits on them. You can almost hear our director thinking things like, "Let's see how you're going to censor now!" Even the whole development of the murder investigation happens in the background. Are the victims missed by any of their friends or family? Are there police officers looking for clues that will lead them to the killer? You don't know and Lucio doesn't bother telling you, because it will lead to rows that don't need cutting. Oh, and it's also beautiful, pretentious! The name "Mr. Fulci" or even "Lucio" is exactly every 3 minutes (34 times throughout the film) and our director is clearly in the spotlight for a change. Hey, I definitely don't know him ... After more than 30 years of delivering amusing movies; He deserved to have some extra fun. You're a God, Mr. Fulci!
