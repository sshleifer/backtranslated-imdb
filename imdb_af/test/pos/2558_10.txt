My girlfriend, as we walk in the cold London night in Leicester Square, says the following: If they didn't speak English and they didn't show the stadium, you might think it's the slums of a South American city or another slum all over the world, not Queens in NYC. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahrani is now my official hero because he devoted his work not to the other face of the American, but the right face of America. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahrani's movies are like Ladri di biciclette, or Germania anno zero, or Roma citta 'aperta. Chop Shop has become reality in a movie, is more realistic than a documentary. I think Ramin Bahrani's films are more realistic than documentaries. It's a good movie, but don't expect any car hunt or shoot. This movie is about tragic lives on the edge of the richest, richest country in the world.
