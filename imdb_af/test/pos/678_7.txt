The single-set, minimal cast movie and straight photography (except for some short special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60-minute drama dramas so popular during the early years of the TV. Nonetheless, the tension is heavy on the poor warrior widow, Ida Lupino, while trying to handle her semi-psychic handwriting Robert Ryan before one of his mood cheeks kills her. And who better to play the difficult part than that big actor Ryan. He wasn't very versatile - to see him, the setup comedy is almost painful. But no one was better at wounded idealism (On Dangerous Land) or the psychic pain of this movie. Few actors can express as much with their eyes as this lean and tower figure. <br /> <br /> Lupino's problem is that she is locked in her home with a man who is friendly and gentle for a moment and rages the next. The tension comes from her various punches to keep him happy while trying to escape. It's a nail-bite all the way. It's not one of Lupino's very fine "soulful" parts she was so good at. Instead, it is a role that many less actresses could handle well enough. My favorite scene is with Ryan and bratty teenager Margaret Whiting. Ryan already has problems with his masculinity and what others say about him. Then, when Whiting enters and finds the handsome Ryan sanding the floor, she starts to soften and flirt with her burgeoning sexuality. Ryan feels difficult, Ryan suddenly shoots her. Finesse is not his strong suit. Insulting, Whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work "women's work". It does. Until then, he was polite and professional with Lupino, and tried to get him on a normal road. But Whiting hit his raw nerve. Now there is honey to pay, as Whiting emits the door and leaves Lupino to pay the price. It's a sounding scene. It is one of the twelve films produced by Lupino and her husband at a time when the audiences of these little black and white people moved away. favor with wide screen glasses. Sorry. What a very talented figure she was both behind the camera and before. She deserves at least an honorary Oscar from a film industry to which she has contributed so much.
