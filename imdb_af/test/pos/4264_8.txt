This documentary focuses on the events in Gothenburg 2001. In the Swedish media, the protesters where they were proposed as criminals who stood for anarchy and violence. This movie shows that there are, in fact, intelligent, articulate people who have something to say - and say it through the power of bricks. They believe in a better world, a world where people can think and say what they want - without aiming. But are their beliefs about the possibility of changing society realistically? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> This documentary gives us relief in the issues of greed, capitalism and the future it may bring. This is a great documentary version that is not propaganda because it is not shown as they say it is right. All it shows is what some individuals think and it is up to the viewer to decide whether or not what they stand for is right or wrong. <br /> <br /> I heard many people call it a propaganda and therefore choose not to see it, I think they make a bad decision because even if you believe in the police or the protesters, is everything you get more facts to trust, for example, the child who shot, says he thinks it is good to throw a brick through a McDonalds window, because it is the step between thinking and acting as you think. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie provoked me because you can't really deny the fact that the few policemen who fought violence were not convicted or even arrested, but proving they throw bricks at the march (and in some cases hit people with trunks, though they lie on the street without resisting) wherever they get. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10 - Very good, but not the best!
