It's one of nine shorts on the anime disc, "The Animatrix." This is my favorite. The artwork is wonderful. The black-and-white, somewhat grainy texture determines the mood that the segment is trying to portray. The story is stiff, and the end is true on film noir. <br /> Overall, I gave The Animatrix a "7", but this particular segment deserves a "10."
