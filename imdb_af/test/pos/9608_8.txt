A somewhat typical movie film from this era. It is clear that it was only developed in this world for stage, yet a good movie from start to finish. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get their stage performance on the silver screen and both do it effectively. There is very little in the way of the story and anyone who is not familiar with this type of a deviant character study can be a bit of it. All in all, a good film in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York are overworked.
