The hilarious team that brought you 'CNNNN' and 'The Chaser Decides' returned to the ABC with their new series, The Chaser's War On Everything. Filmed in front of a lively audience, the Chaser team does again, what it does best, with key political figures, international celebrities and media personalities. <br /> <br /> The satire is simply priceless and nothing is sacred. . In recent weeks, the Chaser team next to the Queen (during her visit to Australia) rushed to make John Howard disappear and Kim Beazley (East opposition leader) threatened to kneel. <br /> <br /> A particularly funny segment is Mr. Ten Questions', which shows an exaggerated enthusiastic reporter who celebrates celebrities (recently Charlize Theron and The Backstreet Boys) and asks them ten such questions as "what is your optimal length of rice grain?" Just for the record, Theron ignored and ran away, and one of the Backstreet Boys got angry and "refused to appreciate it with a response." <br /> <br /> Recently, a segment that had me in stitches was when one of the team decided to become a "statue shrubber" to earn extra money. When he realized how hopeless he was, he had a real image in his place. THE PERFECT SCAM! He had thirty dollars in twenty minutes! <br /> <br /> A brilliant satire of everything in Australian society. Two thumbs up! <br /> <br /> (Incidentally, the show won't be shown for three weeks after Easter, because "though the team is all atheists, they are also hypocrites.")
