WARNING: Potential Spoilers For! <br /> <br /> "Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toon Adventures" has always been one of my favorite cartoons growing up (heck, it's still). And this movie perfectly holds everything I love for the show, and puts it in full length. <br /> <br /> Beautifully animated by the Tokyo Movie Shinsa studio (WB outsourced every "Tiny Toons" project, and it was the best studio to handle the show), starting the movie at the end of the school year at Acme Looniversity, the well-known cartoon college where Buster and Babs Bunny (no relationship) and their teenage peers learn from the masters of animated lunacy, the Looney tunes. After the last clock, the movie divides into five different plots. Buster engages Babs in a water rifle battle that ends with a burst dam and a tidal wave, which Buster, Babs and Elmyra's dog Byron downriver are looking for on a overturned picnic table for adventure in the deep South. Plucky Duck talks to Hamton Pig and his family to leave him with them to Happy WorldLand, "The happiest place in the Western Hemisphere", but he has to set up a turbulent car ride and the threat of a chain hook wielding hitchhiker. Elmyra's cat Furball eventually runs away, but she is not tortured ... not when there are enough "aminals" to play at the Acme Safari Park. Fifi la Fume spent her summer hunting her heartbeat, movie star Johnny Pew, hoping to get a signature. Of course, the hotel he is staying in is almost impenetrable. And Shirley McLoon puts on a fortune story on the Acme Acres Boardwalk ... And let her wake up on her day when Fowlmouth takes her to see the scream "Skunkophobia". <br /> <br /> All these story lines are side-by-side hilarious, and some of them even overlap in the end. The only complaint I have with this movie is that it doesn't make full use of the Tiny Toons grid. Dizzy Devil and Mary Melodie have just one scene. Gogo Dodo only appears at the beginning and end of the film and Montana Max, Sweetie, Calamity Coyote, and Little Beeper are nowhere to be found. Yet it is excusable errors in an otherwise perfect movie. This movie is pretty scarce today because it is over 12 years old and has never been released on DVD, but I advise you to find it. Anyone who is a fan of Warner Bros. animation, whether classic or contemporary, should see this movie.
