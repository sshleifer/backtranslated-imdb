This film revolves around an Arab leader (Amir) who dies and wants to live. So a dr. Lloyd Trenton pays to transplant Amir's brain into a "willing" participant. But in the doctor's cellar, his assistant Dorro (Angelo Rossitto) drowns young girls blood for doctors' purposes. Meanwhile, Doctor Llyod pays a man to kill the people who helped Amir in the country (which is Reed Hadley, Grant Williams, and several unknown bodyguards.). Grant is the only survivor when his car breaks down. While this happened, doctors sent out other assistant Gor to get a body for Amir and hurt him so much that Dr.Llyod couldn't work. Meanwhile, Grant finds Amir's "girlfriend" Regina Carrol and tells her his story. Grant saw the man who drove him off the road and killed Dorro. Then since Gor didn't get a body. D. Llyod puts Amirs brain in Gors-smothered body. Then Grant and Regina go to the doctor's lab and <br /> <br /> ------------------------ SPOILERS ------- - ----------------- Find out his secret. Soon Amir (Gor) is killing people and in the confusion of what I think is a plot. Dr.Llyod has a brain-ray gun that has hurt Amir. It seems that Dr.Lloyd wants a country where all scientists can work without law. So Regina dies. And at the end of Amir's new body (I think) it would be a new blah blah. <br /> <br /> I'm still not getting the end, but it was a very nice piece of smelly cheese. This film features Grant Williams in his second to last film role. I recommend it to any fan of Al Adamson or if you like Brains.
