Just before dawn is an excellent horror movie. It's atmospheric, filled with excitement made by wonderful shots of wild nature, in which few young people meet their punishment in the form of two crazy, thick bastards, which they kill. Jeff Lieberman is a very talented and intelligent director, who is unfortunately underestimated. He managed to build tension, not with gore, but with a dangerous natural environment. Lieberman manages to build a tension in a very linear, simplistic way, which is also the best way not to show the viewer, but to remind him of the worst thing about characters . <br /> <br /> Just before Dawn was always compared to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Salvation and Hills had eyes. It's as good as Rescue, better than Hills, I mean rarer and better, and it's creepy than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. <br /> <br /> JBD is one of the best horrors of the past few decades, which eventually comes on DVD!
