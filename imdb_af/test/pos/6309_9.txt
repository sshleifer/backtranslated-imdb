I was a little concerned about actors and acting in Italy when "Le conseguenze dell'amore" and Toni Servillo came. It was a long time since I hadn't seen such a charismatic actor on the screen. Paolo Sorrentino wrote a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has made one of the most memorable characters in movies over the years. The movie is not quite perfect, but 'Titta Di Girolamo' stays with you for a long time in the vision of the movie. Toni is playing in movies, because you are probably the coolest actor today (and not just in Italy, she deserves international acclamation). I rate this movie 9/10.
