Can't say it's not done well. At a recent film festival, the director acknowledged that some scenes take 30. And there's not the slightest indication that he didn't get exactly what he wanted. But it is a strange non-Spanish film in the same way that West Side Story was, many years ago. Both leaders, a brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts. The neighborhood, a kind of underground car range in Queens, is quite strange to most people and is the price of recording itself. But there is something unsatisfactory about the core problem in the film, namely what the sister feels she needs to do to get there. I can understand the brother's reaction, but it just seems a little too easy to come to me. The film suggests that people like this don't need our help, that they will find a way to survive without the usual support systems. I do not encourage anyone to believe it. There will be much more resistance to the choices made here than portrayed. Unlike entertainment, it works well. As an accurate portrayal of a culture, I don't think so well.
