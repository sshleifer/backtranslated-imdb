I thought I had previously commented on this movie, but I can't find it here. Anyway, I'll write it again. I accidentally found this movie from my college library collections. It was free to watch, so why not. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I watched it. I love this movie. I've seen a few Russian movies, most of them have serious topics. I'm surprised this one was a good comedy. I had a big laugh while I watched it. And this is a movie I want to buy. this thing is so funny. and they are not just stupidly funny, the plots were very original and well thought out, so they didn't seem stupid at all. I'm surprised this movie doesn't attract many viewers. This is a classic you can see it over and over. <br /> <br /> These actors were also very authentic, their acting really, not fake. if you didn't watch it, get a copy soon! definitely recommended.
