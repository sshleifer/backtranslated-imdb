A group of thieves led by Mark Wahlberg rob a golden safe in Italy and grateful to them for the lift and they get away without any major problems. Before the group can celebrate, Steve plays through Ed Norton deciding he wants the gold all to himself and pulling a Cout De 'Ta on the group and shooting one of the members. He and his accomplices think the group is dead, but fortunately the group is not dead. A year later we come back in the story where the group of Norton has found and decides to steal the gold back and spend the rest of the movie, and they plan to steal their gold and score. <br /> <br /> - It was a surprise to me, it has all the make-up to be a typical forgetful summer movie, but it was actually memorable and really fun to watch. What I like is how smart and good the plans are in the movie and how the film feels realistic. Looking at the trailer, you might think it's an unconscious action movie, but in reality there are only two action scenes in the movie and they're all really well done. The latter action scene is a very long 20 min. scene that one of the best car hunters ever did. I love how real the chase is and how everything is done without the help of CGI. I personally enjoyed this car chasing more than the CGI filled chase in "Matrix 2". I remember watching music videos by director F. Gary Gray and always noticed how good they were and thought he would make a good movie maker. It seems I was right as always, and he proves it here. Can't wait to see what he's doing with the successor. <br /> <br /> The actors also do a decent job, as Seth Green is my favorite of the group. The other thing I loved was the excellent score of John Powell, since I heard his score for Robots this year, I was a fan of him and paid close attention to his music and the guy is really good. He does a great job of avoiding all the typical summer action movie cliches and offers a very good score. I didn't see the original on which it is based, so I can't really say how good it is for one. <br /> <br /> So yes, it's a good popcorn movie that actually has a brain. unlike most of the summer movie shit that comes out. Has good characters, is funny like hell and has a wonderful score by John Powell. If you love movies then you will love this one. <br /> <br /> You know if I was in the group, they call me pretty Mike
