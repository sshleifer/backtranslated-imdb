It is a strange film / hail movie, one that seems to be predictable, then remains surprising to the last scene. The protagonist is a small carnival vulture, where he is paid to kill the driver's belly dancer, wife Divana, and eventually fall for her. She is tempting, troublesome and deadly, and she disappears and resurrects like a magician's trick. The movie's other props include her dual man / employer (played by the talented Armand Assante), some nasty Dominican shooters and most importantly the plot, a suitcase full of money. Just like the old "shell game", the one where you have to guess which one the pea is underneath, you will guess who has the money, and like the victims of the hucksters performing such games you will probably think wrong. Dagma Dominczyk, like a beautiful Divana, is a talented artist and eye-eye, whether she is dancing with the big snake around her shoulders or comforting all the unlucky men in her job. Norman Reedus is good as the young guy killed by the elusive beauty he paid. However, do not pull him out, because he seems to be smarter than someone credited to him. This oddball movie is worth a look.
