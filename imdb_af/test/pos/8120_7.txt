It was a fun movie to watch. Although the chance of it happening in your street is small, there are still many recognizable situations that will call a clock. The simplicity of the film and the humor DO work. I have to admit that you don't have to see it in a theater; It will do very well on a small TV set. Tip: See it with some good friends.
