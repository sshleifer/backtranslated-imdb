From 1950, a neat thriller has come across some smuggling diamonds from abroad and also the infectious disease pox. Evelyn Keyes withdraws as the essential victim of this film noir. Once back in the United States she is unaware that she can spread the disease to everyone and everything she gets in touch with. Eventually she is pursued and must be stopped before an epidemic occurs. Other than Keyes' striking performance, there is good support from the shameful Charles Korvin, William Bishop, Dorothy Malone, Lola Albright and Whit Bissell. The final is a humdinger with Miss Keyes on the edge of a building with spotlights and hundreds of spectators below. A good B movie!
