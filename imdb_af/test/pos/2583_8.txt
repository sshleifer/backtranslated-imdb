If you're looking for a movie where an out-of-control nymph is chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man, look no further than Paramount Vantage's latest version of 'Black Snake Moan'. Not exactly looking for what I just described you, say? Well, you get the best to keep yourself up to date and watch your local theater and still see it as Samuel L. Jackson's character that Lazarus would say. As long as you are open-minded and do not take everything seriously, there is no reason why you should not leave the theater because you have seen it. <br /> <br /> In the third presentation of Craig Brewer, director, we were taken in the deep south, where everything as rule demands the film. While we were introduced to the Godfearing bluesman, Lazarus, as previously played by Jackson, and almost always half-naked Rae; performed a role bravely by Christina Ricci. In the film, this unlikely pair of crossroads is long enough for their characters to teach each other a lesson. Both lessons ultimately convey the message to us that is not the case, we are all human. Nobody is perfect, and if everyone will realize it, then we'll be much better off. The question of whether it will be understood or accepted by everyone who sees the film is another story. <br /> <br /> One thing that is not debatable is how big Jackson and Ricci are both here. You'd think with the role of a sex-mad woman, too much will be a given, but no, not here. Ricci breaks through and shows true talent with a raw display that also doubles as her best to date. Then we have Jackson completely disappearing and for the first time in a long time let's forget who he is. Unfortunately, the third star of the movie Justin Timberlake who plays Rae's military boyfriend is not so good. At first, he failed miserably as he apparently tried too hard. Later he picked it up, but he was far from the level he reached in January's "Alpha Dog". <br /> <br /> The other thing 'Black Snake Moan' boasts a wonderful soundtrack. With tracks from The Black Keys, John Doe, pieces of the score Scott Bomar did, and of course, four, count it, four songs by Jackson himself. It's actually one of his songs, the main achievement of the movie, "Stackolee", which is the fuel of this great collection. That alone is worth the ticket price. Other striking musical treats from the soundtrack are Bomar's 'The Chain', 'The Lights Go Out' by the Black Keys, and the title track which is also one of the most memorable scenes in the film that Lazarus on a stormy night after. Raee sings. <br /> <br /> However, Craig Brewer's efforts cannot go unnoticed. His latest film 'Hustle & Flow', which ultimately surpassed low expectations and received critical praise, put him on the map. What he did with 'Black Snake Moan' would be that set him apart from other newbies for the industry. Not only did he address 'Moan', but he also wrote his script. The end result is a surprising and clever story. As you look, you feel that you know exactly where it is on the head, despite its brave calm. Just as you think you have predicted the next move, Brewer's gears are wider and take a completely different route. However, there are some stains in the script. The background characters are dead and flat while the end is slightly disappointing. It made me look for something more exciting. After so many highlights, I think the final scenes were a bit poor compared to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think most people who see 'Black Snake Moan' won't enjoy it because of the Facts, they won't be able to stop themselves thinking how unlikely the situations are. The depressing part is that there are many other films with just as unlikely, even more scandalous, widely accepted scenarios. These are the issues of race, religious motives, and sexuality that the film exhibits, which will have more effect on opinion than anything. The idea of ​​a black man connecting a white woman in his home is enough not even to consider most people to see it. Simply put, it's not for everyone. As I said, to fully enjoy it, you have to go into an open mind, or else you waste your money. For those who can do this, I strongly recommend it.
