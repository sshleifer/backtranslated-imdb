I like the phrase "British post-war suburban paranoia" that one of the judges used. It describes so well the kind of movies John Mills excelled between "big" pictures ("Scott of the Antarctic" (1948) and "War" (1947), "The Long Memory" (1952) and Peace "(1956). <br /> <br /> This clear Eric Ambler style played John Mills, Dr. Howard Latimer, who promised his friend Charles to meet a visiting German actress, Frieda Veldon (Lisa Daniely) at the airport. A Greek "reporter" Jeffrey Windsor (Lionel Jeffries) was in his consulting rooms at the time and offered him a lift, but while he was finding the actress, Windsor told him she was already in the car! Howard has been dropped for his date and no longer thinks of it. <br /> <br /> The next night he finds her body when he comes home from work, further he finds his friend, Charles couldn't arrange him if he is still in New York and Windsor does not appear to exist, Ambler (Rene Ray) who was referred to him by George George (Mervyn Johns) earlier this month A patient tells about her recurring dream about finding a dead body and a copper candlestick with a square base. This is a nightmare that happens to Howard, but of course when detective inspector Dane (Roland Culver) maintains her, she denies any knowledge of the conversation. The candlestick is later found in the luggage of Howard's Daimler. <br /> <br /> If Howard is low, visit Robert Brady (Wilfred Hyde-White). He calls himself a "friend" - he has a photo of Windsor that he wants to exchange for a boxing match. Frieda gave Howard the airport. Howard returns to the apartment, Charles rings and while Howard is on the phone, an unknown attacker jumps out and steals the games !!! Who can trust him - who doesn't have anything to hide! <br /> <br /> It's a top thriller - not quite in the same class as "The October Man", but with John Mills he does best - ordinary men play in impossible puzzles! <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
