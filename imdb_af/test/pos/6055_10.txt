I saw for the first time in the late 60's and tried to see it every time it came on TV, which unfortunately isn't often. Now I have TCM and FMC, I hope it will be at least once a year. Like Louis Gossett Jr. In an officer and a gentleman, Jack Webb delivers an incredibly good performance as a Parris Island Drill Sergeant with the classic screw yard, and the story line in this one, though dated, touches and dealt very well. And with the actual jug heads in the role play, it certainly also helped in the realism of the movie. It's a great movie with top acting and a great story. See it if you have the chance. It is worth the effort!
