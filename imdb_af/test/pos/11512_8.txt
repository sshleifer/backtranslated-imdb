When I read the other comments here at IMDB, I had very high expectations before I saw the angels of the universe. I was not disappointed, and the movie an 8, I would say I can justify that degree. <br /> <br /> The movie has some amazing plays, especially by the main character, Pall. The supporting actors also do a very good job like the patients in the spiritual institution, the parents and the brothers and sisters of Pall. The music is also worth mentioning, supporting the film by giving depth and feeling. <br /> <br /> Although the film is very scandalous, it does not leave humor and has some kind of objective authorship about Pall's life. Still, if you want to see a cheesy comedy or something lightweight, it's not for you. This is a story about people with mental problems, about how they are dealt with in society, but above all, a story about Pall. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all movie experts. It is one of the best movies ever to come from Iceland, if not from Scandinavia.
