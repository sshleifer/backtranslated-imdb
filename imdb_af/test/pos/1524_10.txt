The film deals with universal themes and does not mention a specific country as context: it can happen anywhere - and essentially if it does not. Those who are concerned about the 1st change issues, censorship, etc. - but do not want to be bored with lectures - have art such as this to illustrate, dramatize, teach, inspire. <br /> <br /> Rickman is definitely a valued character actor; He shines in this movie and points to several plays that you should see (I haven't seen him yet, but even in non-big movies). Stowe might give her best performance (and prove she owns one of the most striking blue eyes in Hollywood) - in two words: stunning, convincing. <br /> <br /> The set design fits perfectly with the situation, in function and mood. The sound editing increases to appropriate effect. The total contrast conveyed by the animation sequences is a perfect symbolic device - and the welcome and only respite for most of the story's essential place. The writing is strict and necessary, with a dramatic and yet realistic dialogue (ie, as it may be and should be). Perhaps the most incredible aspect we are facing is the fact that 1) it is the first time the director is; and 2) he is the author. In one phrase: a tour the power - with three recommendations: see it, own a copy, see it repeatedly to understand all its secrets and understand all the geniuses.
