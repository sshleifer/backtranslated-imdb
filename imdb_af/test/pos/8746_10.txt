It's a wonderful eager drama that sets out the various sides of the international heroin drug trade. Of the hills of northern Pakistan where the tacitly permissible opium poppy cultivation takes place on a large scale; to the jetsetting "Euro-Trash" in Germany and England regulating the import of processed heroin in the supply of smuggling vehicles; trapped at the end users in the web of addiction and the crime needed to support their growing habit; And lastly, all levels of international government corruption and hypocrisy to police police efforts to control the drug problem are depicted with a wide variety of profoundly rounded characters, full-fledged plot, and excellent character activity and location shooting. <br /> <br /> It puts Hollywood story like "The French Connection" in their place! <br /> <br /> Traffik is a deep-thinking and exciting story of modern drug-related espionage, and the international efforts of many to eliminate it. <br /> <br /> Contrary to many "drug drama" revolutions, Traffik focuses strongly on the discovery of societal reasons * that people move into drug addiction. As one of the characters put it ... until we, as a society, create a world that people want to participate in, rather than escape, we can't stop people from using drugs ... "<br /> <br /> It's a fascinating and completely staggering drama, I recommend it!
