Mr. Bean formed the face of British TV comedy. He proved that you don't need bad words or words, a massive budget, a great deal of intelligence or even any intelligence to make something brilliant. And Mr. Bean is one of those characters you just can't forget. Some of these episodes had me in stitches - yes, they are not realistic at all and they are all beautiful, but frankly, realism is one of the stumbling blocks. Bean broke on the way to greatness. Rowan Atkinson and co. Always get new interesting ideas - and hilarious new gags - remember when Mr. Bean drove his green Mini while sitting on a bench on the roof? Mr. Bean is one of those things that never gets worse - the movie wasn't as good as this, but Bean has set a clear new sense of humor for the world. And kids and adults will marvel at their wonderful fun factor. "Extras" and "Little Britain" can be condemned - this is the British comedy at its best and most original. These escapes are never old! 10/10
