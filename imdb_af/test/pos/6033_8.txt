Storywise this is not one of the best or most successful Columbo movies, but the movie is extremely well-crafted, with excellent directing and truly fine acting. <br /> <br /> Especially the acting in this movie draws attention. Director Nicholas Colasanto did a good job with the actors in the movie. Applicant he allowed Peter Falk and John Cassavetes plenty of space to play with, as both are credited as unreasonable directors of this movie. Must be part of his direct style to allow the actors space. It works great for this movie. Perhaps he did this because Colasanto himself also worked as an actor. Perhaps he is best known for playing the role of Coach in the hit series "Cheers", from the beginning in 1982 to his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> So, Peter Falk looks better than ever before. in his role as Lt. Columbo. Veteran actor John Cassavetes also does a good job as the film of his killer and is a good game for the lieutenant. Besides them, the movie also has Myrna Loy. A big star from the silent film scene and also Pat Morita, in a small early role. <br /> <br /> But not only the acting in the movie is really good. Visually and technically, it is also a very good movie, with long shots without the use of any cuts. Also why this movie is longer than most Columbo movies. It really takes time to set things up and tell his story. The movie also has some nice artistic and experimental shots. Of course everything is really suitable for the 70's. <br /> <br /> But as I said before, it's not just one of the best Columbo movies. Also, the clues left out for the lieutenant are a bit too obvious this time. This makes the killer look a little stupid, because he didn't think his plan was good enough, while the character was obviously an intelligent man. Columbo also tries to annoy the suspect and other characters a little more than he usually tries to solve the crime. This and Peter Falk's different acting approach is a reason why his character can appear as different as he does in other Columbo films. But otherwise it does not mean worse in this case. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a very good musical score by Richard DeBenedictis, who then became the steady composer for the Columbo movies. <br /> <br /> A great Columbo movie to watch! <br /> <br /> 8/10
