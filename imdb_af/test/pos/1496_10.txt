Mr Bean was very nice, I loved it, every episode was really funny, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he is a funny look and his facial expressions were hilarious !!! <br /> <br /> The series was so successful that even in 1997 they Bean movie made. It was also pretty funny! <br /> <br /> It is funny to see all the adventures and situations he comes into himself. This series was certainly a classic and I still see an episode. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is worth a 10/10 in my book, fans of cute comedy have to investigate it.
