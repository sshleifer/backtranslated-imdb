This movie is unbelievable because the fact that the real people are portraying themselves and experiencing their real life and doing such a good job is as if they are almost in the past. Jia Hongsheng plays himself as an actor who keeps everything apart from music and drugs that are struggling with depression and looking for the meaning of life while angry with everyone, especially those who give him the most. There are moments in the movie that will make you cry because the family, especially the father, did such a good job. However, this movie is not for everyone. Many people suffering from depression will understand Hongsheng's problem and why he does the things he does, for example, keeping himself in a dark room or walking or cycling himself. Others can see the movie as boring, as it is just as real that it is almost like a documentary. Overall, this movie is great and Hongsheng deserves an Oscar for this movie, so his father did.
