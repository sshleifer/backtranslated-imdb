To keep it as simple as possible. It's a very good performance. It's well written and has a fantastic role to play. It is not loaded with blood and intestines. And the centers around a shameful cop and his relationship with his ex-wife, his son, his former partner (Andr√© Braugher), his childhood, now a priest (George Dzunzda) and finally the person who comes into his heel. that episode. You probably find something in your city NO. Is this another good story YES. And it is nice to see a man portrayed as a good father despite his defects. See more than one (2-3) and you'll see why many of us are trapped on this show. And thank you David Morse for making this character so interesting. Another good job!
