Well done. Photography, sound, music and performances were the best. It's also an entertaining storyline that smiles at your face every stage - I loved it and I'm a 60-year-old heterosexual guy. Each character looked their part at a tea. That's the best thing I got from Mrs. Capshaw seen. She was in more movies than I thought, but it was a great achievement. I think it's a plus to have Spielberg money behind you, which offers a bold budget and all the best that money can technically buy. Two of the role players now have successful TV shows of their own. It's easy to see why. Tom Selleck does his usual good job.
