Although it may not be as entertaining as some of Herzog's work, Little Dieter is another fine film by one of the world's greatest film artists. Little Dieter, who departs from Herzog's usual themes, is a fascinating and uplifting character study about a brave man and his efforts to proceed to a life-changing traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Dieter Dengler wanted to fly from a very young age, and the Vietnam War gave him the opportunity, but instead of spending the war in a cabin, he based most of it as a POW. Dieter speaks most of his story eloquently and passionately, with occasional help from Herzog. Herzog does very little voice over this time, but adds very subtle powerful sounds and visuals. Dengler is a fascinating and extremely enjoyable person. As a human being and as alive as they come, I considered the story of his life and his imperishable exciting personality as inspiring. Thanks to Herzog for introducing him to us. <br /> <br /> The scale of the film is not over, and the drama is not as fiery as many of the early films that Herzog made a force to be. reckoned with. Nonetheless, I strongly recommend it to its fans and to those who enjoy documentary programs. This is a very interesting and well-executed film.
