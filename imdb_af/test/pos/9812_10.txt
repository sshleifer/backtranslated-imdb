Simply an incredible bittersweet film depicting a side of life is often conveyed in good movies. I saw it as a child and recently returned and fell in love again. <br /> <br /> As a child, it has exposed my interest in building an airplane. As an adult, it caught me in the dark world and a young man escaped from the world. <br /> <br /> The portrayal of the King was wonderful, the camera style chosen with low shots and shots that focus on action and hand movements, I was well thought out, I can personally repeat nothing done in that style not and adds to the character and portrays him as a force that is almost non-human (which may not be far from reality) makes it interesting developments. <br /> <br /> One has to wait any day
