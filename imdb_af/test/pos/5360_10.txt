Being a "Wallace and Gromit fan", I was looking forward to this full-length movie. Surprisingly, I saw this at the world premiere in Vlissingen (NL) at the Film by the Sea festival. A wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this very amusing and cheerful movie. It's about Wallace and Gromit (who I don't really need an introduction) with an own pest control company in the city offering a huge vegetable match in a few days. Everyone, including an eccentric baroness, hopes that his or her huge root or melon will win the Golden Root. Unfortunately, the town is plagued by many hungry rabbits. That's where W & G comes in. They have their own creaking contraceptives to control these cute creatures in a human way. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny and colorful story. Anyone who likes the three short films of W & G (which is more than just!) Will love this full-length movie. Nick Park really did a wonderful and original result with a good sense of humor. Just as in the Chicken Run, it really amazes me how he can capture so much story and emotion in just a few frames. "Work well done, son" ;-) Oh yes, the music was fantastic! It really completes the ride. Enjoy it!
