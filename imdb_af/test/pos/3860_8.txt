The first Disney animation film without the strong involvement of Disney itself is due to the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting (it is, I believe, the only animated Disney movie since the 1940s, which was NOT on an earlier date). based is not book or other work, but rather an original story). Like others have noticed, the plot is essentially a cross between the romance in Lady and the Tramp and the kidnapping / traveling home story in 101 Dalmatians. <br /> <br /> But to overcome this mistake, the filmmakers have successfully used many of the better features of most of the previous 10-15 years of Disney animation films: Phil Harris (from The Jungle Book) which one portraying the main characters, she follows Louis du Prima in the previous movie with another here with Scatman Crothers. The quality visual appearance of this film is almost transmitted from "Dalmatians" (with a few nice nods for French Impressionism, it seems) and the villain here (the butler) also reminds strongly of the henchmen in that movie. (This is probably one of Disney's least memorable villains.) The main story goes back and forth between the cats and the butter's continuing problems with two rural dog dogs (with great voice work by Pat Buttram and George "Goober" Lindsey "). Animal characters are also known to those who have seen "Tramp" and "Dalmatians." The owner of the cats, while having a striking visual resemblance to the wicked stepmother in Sleeping Beauty, has nothing of that character's peculiarities and comes over as very hot and generous. <br /> <br /> The real strength of the movie is the tuning, and after the first use of mostly well-known actors in The Jungle Book, the tactics here are strongly held with The Jungle Book's Disney veterans Harris and Sterling Holloway, and Eva Gabor (who would do a very similar character in the later film The Rescuers), as well as Crothers and Nancy Kulp, are all excellent here, especially Harr is and Gabor in the lead. Atie is as excellent as you would expect, with a variety of emotions. <br /> <br /> Smaller children may be upset by a few short episodes (an escape from the path of a fast train, a close drowning by one of the kids), but this doesn't happen on a Very scary or dark way and very fast. Overall, there are very few such terrifying scenes that occur in many other Disney classics. <br /> <br /> One small strangeness is the way some visual aspects of 60's culture are portrayed among jazz-performing cats. Paris; One cannot help but wonder why the story has not been firmly set in the present, unlike much, Paris has changed much of its appearance in the intervening time. It would really have made more sense that way. <br /> <br /> The songs, while being enjoyable and sometimes pleasantly performed, are not particularly memorable. Nevertheless, the general energy applied here contributes to the excellent voice and fine animation all to overcome the relatively small and small weaknesses. Far from the magnitude of classic "10" s such as Pinocchio or Aladdin, and not quite to the 9s one can give to Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians, it's probably a fairly marginal 8 out of 10; maybe a 7.
