Antarctica, the winter of 1982. The team on an American research base is surprised by some crazy Norwegians who chase a dog with a helicopter and try to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the Americans are left nothing, but a dog, a few bodies and questions. This is the start of the biggest horror / thriller movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and alone in nobody's country. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie award for his score. Why I Don't Know Because as far as I can see, his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really gets you in the right mood. <br /> <br /> The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog who is just amazing. As far as Russell and the other are concerned, I can say nothing less. <br /> <br /> You might think 1982 and special effects aren't the most impressive? Well, think again! You didn't see it until you saw it. Bodyparts fall off and creatures are changing shapes ... Rob Bottin has done a good work witch today as a milestone is special effects makeup. <br /> <br /> The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit. big screen due to other alien movies at the moment and so it's not very well known. In fact, you can almost consider it an unknown movie. No one I asked heard of. However, the film has survived for over twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and except for the hairstyle, the film is still very up to date. This movie is considered a classic. <br /> <br /> The movie is without a doubt one of me, if not my favorite. I've seen it several times, but it's as good as the first time I've seen it. If Norwegian is the only thing I don't like about this movie, MacReady calls the Swedes from Norway!
