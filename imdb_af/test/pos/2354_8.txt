I can remember seeing this movie when I have been very young and several times on TV ever since. I've always liked it. I noticed the pressure shown on local TV that one scene movie was reversed. This is the one where they hide behind the rock (it looks like Vasquez Rocks near Los Angeles) to look at the Indians. If you look carefully, you will notice that all the soldiers are suddenly left-handed! It's just a short segment and I have to admit it took years to notice it. <br /> <br /> As far as history is concerned, there were often expeditions to save white prisoners from the Indians. The direct link for the final battlefield is the Battle of Beecher's Island. In that action, a group of volunteers equipped with recurring carabines (Spencer Carbines not Winchesters) were surprised by the Indians and retired to an island and held various charges. In the last charge they killed Roman Nose, one of the more famous Indian Chiefs. I have no idea if the author of the script had it in mind, but it fits in pretty well. <br /> <br /> There are several Guy Madison movies that I come out on DVD one day and that is one of them.
