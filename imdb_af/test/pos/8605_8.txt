After the atomic bomb strikes Hiroshima, charred bodies are lying around, deformed victims attempting to communicate with family that they cannot even recognize, and one after another die from radiation sickness. This black and white film, no matter how sad and scary, is not without humor. The story revolves around a young woman, Yasuko, who was hit by black rain after the explosion. She tries to get married, but everyone stays dead, and people are worried that the same will happen to her. After finding a suitable mate (who lost his mind after being in the war for a long time), she ended up with signs of radiation disease. This film is an excellent portrayal of the atomic attacks on Japan, it will scare you, and may cause you to cry. The acting is good, not too dramatic like many other ww2 movies made.
