'Nemesis' was the last book in which Miss Marple was written by Agatha Christie (the official final case 'Sleeping Murder' was written in the forties) and I have always had a very soft place for it. I loved the characters and they are lovingly brought to life in this excellent BBC adaptation with Joan Hickson, awesome as always, like Miss Marple. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is very true to the book. A few characters are dropped, the first (new) murder is slightly different and some new characters are being launched. Personally, I felt that the added character of Lionel Peel was unnecessary and rather annoying. Tour guide Madge was irritating in a different way, but often amusing. This is mainly due to Lionel not awarding 10 out of 10! The other characters are beautifully done, especially Helen Cherry as a worthy Miss Temple and all three evil sisters, but especially Margaret Tyzack who gives Clothilde a high performance. She threatens to go over to the top, but just avoid it. The female bodyguards are also good value and the episode contains one of my favorite Hickson lines ... an Archdeacon?! <br /> <br /> It's another relatively early BBC Marple that looks wonderful and has a glorious nostalgic feel to it. Highly recommended.
