Although I watched this film about 4 years ago before commenting on IMDb, I decided to revise it now, which is unusual for me, as I have previously reviewed something just after I saw it. What can I say? Well, the best performance is that of the late Peter Boyle as the title character who, after finding out about a man who kills his daughter's drug-trafficking boyfriend, wants to join him, though he is a Madison Avenue CEO. in general with the much lower-class conservative Joe. In fact, there are many funny scenes from Joe at this guy's party and make clever alecky remarks there. Oh, and it should be noted that the actress who plays the daughter she's looking for after she's gone out of hospital after she's overhauled on drugs is none other than Susan Sarandon who makes her debut! It was a very difficult movie for the time it was made (late 60's and early 70's) and was compelling work by author Norman Wexler (later of Saturday Night Fever) and director John G. Avildsen. Tiger, Rocky and The Karate Kid). Surely the end ends another mural after all these years! Highly recommended for anyone who is curious about the counterculture of that time. P.S. Among the cultural artifacts seen here is a Raggedy Ann doll, a boxing Ritz cracker, a bottle of Heinz ketchup, and unique to the era, a Nixon poster that asked, "Would you" buy a used car from this man?
