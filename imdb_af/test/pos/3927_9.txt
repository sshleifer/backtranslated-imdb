I have never seen the original "House of Wax", so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a preview of the new movie. After a somewhat wobble start to introduce our young characters, House Of Wax changes gears and becomes an extremely effective horror getaway. <br /> <br /> The plot doesn't matter too much here - I think most people know about as these stranded children meet a nasty killer and find some terrible things in the titular home of wax. It's all about the special effects here, and they are. Viewers who enjoy their horror movies with lots of blood will be happy here, but there are also other ghoulish effects. The production design and set is excellent, and the role players make the most of their underlined roles. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people just wonder how Paris Hilton is performing. To be honest, Hilton announces herself very well, and she doesn't represent "herself," as so many people predict. Her character is sexy and sweet, and I think her good work will hopefully change many people's opinions about her. Elisha Cuthbert is also good, what about her previous film, The Horrible "The Girl Next Door." Her character is being overtaken much, and Cuthbert is a demanding heroine. Chad Michael Murray, like Hilton and Cuthbert, is great to look at, but unfortunately it's not very convincing as the group's "bad boy". <br /> <br /> I predict good things for "House of Wax," As the audience at the show, I attended, shouted and clapped many parts of the movie. Congratulations to the team and the crew for a good job. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Paris Hilton for proving many people wrong. As she always says - "It's hot."
