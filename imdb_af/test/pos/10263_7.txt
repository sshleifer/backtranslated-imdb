Dr Sayer (Philippe Leroy), a wealthy doctor with psychological issues about the opposite sex, kidnapped an employee, Maria (Dagmar Lassander), a free-thinking liberal woman who believes people should be the ones tied to women. Sayer returns to his beautiful estate and runs Maria through a humiliating series of thought games, threatening to molest and kill her. Sayer's desire seems to dominate her body, mind and soul, make her his sexual slave, obey his commands, fulfill his wishes and dedication. After resistance, Maria first started his mission, but had his own plans. She says she wants to help Sayer to abandon his sadistic behavior towards women, so that he can love and do not want such desires. Sayer seems to have her under his grip, and agreed with some embarrassing features (such as insulting his toes, "making love" for a pop-up doll that is a recreation of itself, often time topless, and even to rinse off. if she blows him hard over the face and brings blood out of his nose) that almost breaks her, but something happens if the troubled doctor falls in love with Mary slowly. And by what apparently a desperate attempt to end the madness, Maria gets an upper hand, playing with Sayer's desire for her body. <br /> <br /> More from a battle will, a kind of sexual warfare where one seems to be in control if the other really has the top. hand. Through much of the film, sayer mistreats Maria, forcing her to submit to his series of psychological games of a sexual nature. Her attempts to escape fail because his home is such a well-designed fortress. It is a typical European art deco type palace, formed and orchestrated by a man who preserved this weekend for "walls and doors open at his command, with an area quarantined for his" victims ". But if Maria apparently repels a bottle of pills because of her anxiety at his hands, turn the tables around and she has him where she wants him. He finds that he really wants her, and Maria uses it to her advantage, playing hard to get when Sayer embraces and destroys her. (And I could understand his frustration because she has this action that can make a man crazy). <br /> I felt the movie finally worked as a war cry for women, their empowerment and rebellion against men who had the idea that they should always have control, sexually and spiritually. The "twist" finalizes this ideal. I couldn't relax Sayer's fate because of his strict cardiovascular activity and exercise regimes. We see how he develops his colored athletic figure and how this regime is part of the normal routine every weekend before the real ghost games begin with his victim. If he fits so well, and if he spends so much time developing himself for the extra-curricular activities that his regime follows, how can he end the lot that follows his dealings with Maria when she stops resisting his progress? <br /> <br /> Mary, whom he would later admit, was the first to be kidnapped; others of the past, call girls, were paid for their services so that Sayer could dominate the domination of a woman, even though it was a fictional charade caused by a deeply troubled person, with an inability to with the opposite sex. The spontaneous decision to do so, to take a leap from the norm, costs him more than he could ever know. <br /> <br /> All these psychosocial subtitles are quite fascinating to see, but Dagmar Lassander, such a nice sex cat, was my reason to enjoy it. With her I could not have loved it so much, because she is essential as a victim who has the worth of getting. Perhaps the highlight of the film, the fun dance like Lassander, is in gauze (!), The wardrobe exposes to expose her breasts to a jazzy score. It's the kind of sexually seductive moment that makes your mouthwash and forehead sweat. Dagmar Lassander must have been a joy to fashion designers because she wears clothes so well. She has this kind of cool, sophisticated and screen presence, along with her beauty and seductive power, Dagmar stretches over the part to create an iconic character that would define her career even if the movie is not known. (I got mouth-to-mouth). The challenging nature of the script and risqu√© topic may not appeal to certain crowds, as it deals in many different forms of sex (and pain), the dialogue very illustrative and comprehensive. Sometimes I can't help talking to Sayer's comments on Maria's prison, how he enjoys having women suffer and the excitement he gets in forcing them into some kind of slavery (in an attempt to make the words poetic, it feels everything hokey). But Dagmar is the real reason to see it, and the film works for me as a fetish movie, a possible male fantasy with this apparent primacy and proper idealism being captured and wanted to be held against her. situation, its fate possible to the grace of a complex and possibly dangerous masochis. Her presentation, and how she responds to his aggressive behavior with her (... there are times when she unfolds into a shaky desire to embrace him, revealing a possible attraction to him who in itself can scare some who see it). most fascinating highlights of this exploitation feature. My other favorite scene, besides the dance, is the piano concert with Sayer fondling Maria as she plays a soothing melody.
