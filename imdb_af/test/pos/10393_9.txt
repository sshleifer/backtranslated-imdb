Beyond the Clouds is the strangest movie I have ever seen in many ways. Not for his Cult appeal, gore or even for his ideas, but because of the elements that combine to make it a masterpiece of theater. Beyond the clouds is directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, one of Italy's best-known directors. However, if you just gave this movie a quick password, it passively means that it is one of those melodramatic and often pointless novels. This movie deserves great attention, to the point of embracing all its cheese. With cheese I don't mean a cut, but a whole brick cheddar! The music looks like it is from some Italian porn, the story and dialogue, as they are from a wheat-Japanese soap, and the metaphors are so obvious that you want to hit yourself on the head. <br /> <br /> But as soon as you get all this done, you are doing an existential artwork. The cheese feeds in the subtle filming and draws our attention, perfectly, to what needs to be known. The basic plot is of four chapters, unrelated, and all about love. What we learn is that it doesn't matter what happens or what is being said, people can't communicate with each other. Instead, they can only communicate through each other. I think that's why the dialogue and the plot are so cute, because the conversations are too irrational with a lack of causality and people's reaction to melodramatic. <br /> <br /> I thought that movie to myself; Perhaps all life is a great melodrama. We judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful. I hate because I have reason. But what do they hate? Maybe they think my hatred is stupid and arbitrary. In other words, melodramatic. <br /> <br /> So melodrama is actually an existential feature. A Corny romance is simply human interaction under a magnifying glass so we can see the futility of who we are and what we do. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, I recommend it to everyone!
