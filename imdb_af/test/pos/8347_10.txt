Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure is a cool movie that many kids can really have today. It's a well-presented story about a child who longs for the freedom to do things, and how he goes to get this freedom is just a part of what makes this movie interesting. Just forget about the disappointing disappointments, such as the fact that only adults in this movie are based on a pup's point of view, as it is only 0.5% or less of the movie's wonderful effect on the viewer. Great music, lively acting, talented animation and directing and a powerful story tell a story of the difference between freedom in the streets of New England and a cozy home with your family. And no matter how bad things look, your family and friends are always there to help you, although you have a solid place. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to get the soundtrack!
