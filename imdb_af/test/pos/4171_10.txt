Wow. We watched this movie in the hope that it will have at least some decent rock climbing scenes. We were disappointed, but it was still a good movie! It was so cute, it was wonderful! I didn't laugh at a movie for so long. If you are in rock climbing and you enjoy cute movies, then this one is for you!
