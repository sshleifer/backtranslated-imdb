The Last Dinosaur was one of the movie-of-the-week films of the 1970s which was particularly exciting for the time, especially for fans of Japanese Tokusatsu movies. Originally split for a theater release (around when the Dino King Kong was last December), it was suddenly pulled and made in a Friday night ABC movie of the week. Rankin Bass, who was no stranger to Japanese co-productions, was the rifle behind this production, along with Tsuburaya Productions of Japan, the people that brought us Ultraman into various forms. With an American film, including the late Richard Boone, Joan Van Ark and the late Steven Keats, it told the story of a prehistoric bag of time that had an overheated volcanic caldera somewhere near the frozen arctic circle with dinosaurs. It plays a lot like the films The Land Unknown (1956) and The Land That Time Forgotten (1975) in feel and fit. Probably the dinosaurs were guys in suits (a triceratops with ankles!) But they were so filmed, the music and the score was done so well, and the throw did a good job not having much for many of us on Godzilla raised. The film has a lot of class, from the opening ceremony of Nancy Wilson "The Last Dinosaur" to the overall "great" feel of the film. The hot spring sites in northern Japan were excellent and lazy and the unmistakable feeling of Kaiju Eiga to this. There are some amazing pieces, the T-Rex's "leg farm" and a track that shows us deep in the jungle to see the T-Rex a giant fish of a stream. Tsuburaya's FX people did their job here in style and apart from a few dodgy matte shots, they do their job well. This film is considered the best cabin of the 1970s from Japan, even over the five Godzilla films made during the decade. Rankin Bass made several other co-productions with Tsuburaya providing the creatures or miniaturies - The Bermuda Depths (1978) and The Ivory Ape (1980) - but did not measure the epic appearance of this movie.
