I saw this movie and anyone who has been to the Marines or any branch of the service can appreciate the accuracy of this movie. This is a must have for any collection. Jack Webb does an excellent job as the hard drill instructor. My dad went to the Marine Campsite at Camp Penelton and says this movie is so accurate he feels he is back in basic training. There is a line in the movie where Jack Webbs's character gets angry at a shoe to kill a sand dune. Well, let me count you, there is nothing but sand fleas at the camp. I was there and can appreciate it. In fact, the exit to the camp is Las Puljas, which in English means the city of the fleas. you have to watch the movie to appreciate what I say. Anyone who is in WWII movies starts all the battles with the drill Sgt. A must have for your collection
