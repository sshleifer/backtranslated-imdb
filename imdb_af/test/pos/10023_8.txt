Felix looks at an actor rehearsing his lines: a ham, a ham! My kingdom for a ham sandwich !!! "The dramatic man Felix is ​​telling will" sacrifice my art and go into the movies. " He's a tear. Felix just looks at him as if he is nuts and shows his shoulders. The old man tells Felix to go "out" and get money to fund a trip to Hollywood. Felix thinks, "How does he expect me to get the money?" In minutes, of course (it's a cartoon), he sees a shoe business owner selling a "bankrupt" at his store. Felix comes with a plan to sponsor him and the man promises the cat $ 500 if it works. <br /> <br /> Well, do it but the man wants to go alone and leave Felix at home. In an outrageous scene, Felix turns himself into a briefcase and that's how he comes to Hollywood, and changes himself to the cat when they get there. <br /> <br /> We then see Felix's efforts to enter the business. His audition scenes are very funny, especially with his imitation of Charlie Chaplin. In addition, there are caricatures of some well-known silent movie stars and drivers. A little material is in this 9.5-minute cartoon. It's amazing how much more you can get in an extra 2.5 minutes, as most animated shorts are seven minutes long. <br /> <br /> In any case, there were a number of laughs and more things you could only see in a cartoon, as Felix has a sword with giant mosquitoes! Things to do.
