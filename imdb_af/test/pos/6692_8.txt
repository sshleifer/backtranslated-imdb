K-PAX is exactly what a heart-warming film should be. The story is about a mysterious spiritual patient Prot, played by Kevin Spacey, and his unbelieving psychiatrist Dr. Powel, played by Jeff Bridges. The two have a very friendly bond, and if their relationship grows, Dr. Powel does not help but wonder if there is more to his mysterious patient, insisting that he is from another planet called K-PAX. This movie is very funny, and Kevin Spacey draws well-placed one linen as if it were his second nature. K-PAX is a clever movie, and I didn't expect it to go where it did. Eventually I thought about the little things in life and the wonder and magic of everyday life that we so often take for granted. I left the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling inside, and for families and couples on a date, K-PAX is a beautiful movie that won't disappoint. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in something more than the monotonous releases of glorious, action-packed, gore festivals.
