Well-known Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský, especially known in North America for his lead role as Jacob in the original Est German / Czech production of Jacob the Liar (Jakob, der Lügner 1974), gives us a last brilliant performance as an 80- year old prankster who refuses to admit that he is about to die. <br /> <br /> Jirí Hubac's script is beautiful. Funny, moving and well developed. It explores both the subject of advanced age and the motivation of characters who are extremely strong and fragile, happy and untouched. <br /> <br /> Frantisek (Vlastimil Brodský) and his best friend Eda (Stanislav Zindulka) are up to all kinds of shenanigans and make sure they make the best of their dying days. Meanwhile, Frantisek's wife is preparing for their death, storing for funeral money and chastening Frantisek for his endless childhood and irresponsible attitude. Their son is about to take over their apartment and sit in a retirement home, but Frantisek doesn't want to hear about it. He wants to enjoy life and make people laugh around him. He wants to help and love and give ... but at what cost? <br /> <br /> Certainly adults of all ages, this great piece of film by talented director Vladimír Michálek is getting busy and funny. It makes you think how we live our lives and why we lead our lives. It brings the simple story of a charming stubborn old man to the forefront and allows us to reflect and feel what life is about. <br /> <br /> After an active career lasting more than 40 years, it is somewhat bleak for knowing that Vlastimil Brodsk died in April 2002, no longer in terminal cancer. However, it is uplifting to think that he had the chance to be part of such a moving script and to be the transfer of this ode to joyful age, not even the waves in the North American repertoire create, not cinema. After the international success of Jan Hrebejk's "Divided We Fall (2000)", it begins to be clear that Czech theater does indeed offer something to the world. This movie is at least a must see.
