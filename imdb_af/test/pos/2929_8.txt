This was another major episode of season 11 of South Park. <br /> <br /> Cartman is failing with Tourette syndrome to say what he wants without getting in trouble. He can swear by the other children at school. Kyle tells the principal that Cartman is expiring. But she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen plans to be Cartman on the date line to talk about Tourette syndrome, alive and uncensored. But later, Cartman began to become so addicted he could say what he wanted, which he later accidentally started to embarrass. It was a funny episode about Cartman faking Tourette syndrome. I recommend it to any South Park fan.
