I wish I could have met Ida Lupino. If people ask you if you can have 6 extraordinary 20th century people for dinner, I'll be one person for me. I think she is now one of the great unhealthy and unprofitable personalities in the film industry. Her life story would make a big tele movie (Hey, Mr Bogdanovich ........). Ida Lupino is the driving force in many fascinating noir films of the 40's and 50's. I remember being sad to show her a horrible part in a horrific AIP movie, the late 70's. She was bitten by a large worm at the kitchen sink. Ugh. Then I had to contact her because she didn't die long after that. More of the part than the worm too. From High Sierra, Roadhouse and the extraordinary RKO thriller On Dangerous Ground, Ida Lupino was often the producer and lead. Later, with her husband Howard Duff, they produced very timeless noir dramas that are still very exciting today. One of them is JENNIFER I think is the last movie with a Monogram Pictures copyright. Monogram formally changed the company name in 1953 to Allied Artists and JENNIFER both have company names on the opening credits. It is a superior haunted house that is just as frightening as the Innocents and The Haunting made 8 years later. Really chilling and very creepy, this little movie is exactly the kind of really good movie Ida Lupino made and was responsible for. Try and find it ... you'll always remember it and as I feel, much admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress / producer.
