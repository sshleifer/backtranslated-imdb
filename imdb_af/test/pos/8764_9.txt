"Traffic", despite its title, is not really about drugs. Traffic analyzes and morals in the best tradition of British TV drama about its harvestable subject, which is not a mythical plague, but a matrix or process with identifiable social, economic and historical roots, causes and effects. There is something almost scientific in the way the film uses four sets of characters from spectacular separate world and class limits. A Poppie producer was dedicated to poverty and a cynical government in the Pakistani underworld. the English, former Olympic swimmer of a drug baron for trial for human trafficking; The two police officers who are trying to convince the German policemen are coming out of class justice as much as any faith in the law; and a Tory junior minister whose daughter of the Cambridge student became an addict. <br /> <br /> 'Traffik' is unapologetically didactic - from the early scenes of Jack Lithgow in Pakistan, and examines government's success in eliminating drugs before applying more sanctions. British help, we are bombarded with facts about the problem. But these 'facts' come from a variety of sources - discipling government representatives; left-wing lawyers with established (ideological and domestic) interest in corruption; poor farmers who have to grow poppies to survive. <br /> <br /> Facts, usually reassuring markers on a map, are clearly not enough - the more facts we get, the less controllable the situation looks. It's not up to Jack, the film's moral center, the man who connects all the narrative threads, actually travels at the heart of the drug darkness, learns to hide his tory hypocrisy (deceive drug use, but refuses To give serious money to tackle the problem and create conditions through several free market initiatives, where drug traffic flourishes. Just as the anti-heroes of the old Warners gangster movies were actually American capitalists, traders are the ideal Think Thatcher and Reagan) that at least the reality of the problem can be recognized. <br /> <br /> As I say, Traffik isn't really about drugs. As Jack finally admits, drugs are not really the problem after being dismissed as a Tory minister. It is a society broken down by a woman who said there was no such thing (as demonstrated by Jack's non-existent family life), depriving most people of hope and happiness systematically. <br /> <br /> What is most worrying about "Traffik" is not the graphic, seductive depictions of drug abuse (the technical detail that ironically reflects the presentation of more "legitimate", verbal factual information), but the dystopian Vision of a Britain stripped of any joy, beauty or community, a pale desert of deserted dwellings and stupid modernity, a society of addicts ready for the traffickers and barons who do their trade. <br /> <br /> It's not just a contemporary British story - it points to the decline of a trade-oriented empire that is reduced to lawless drug trafficking. It is certainly important that the other sites in the program are Germany and Pakistan, important agents in the decline of the Empire. Here comes the old imperial amorality at home, the former addicted victims, their bodies being abused by the power of their masters, returning to the imperial center, London. The seed of its decline literally carried in their bodies and the fears of all the late 19th-century Gothic novels. <br /> <br /> "Traffik" is one of the great achievements of British TV, and in many respects is better than the recent Hollywood remake. The political focus is apparently sharper. Jack's decline is far more effective than Wakefield, as he, as the government's policy of policy and a bad father, is a lot of the problem, while the American's only true political mistakes are smug. In virtually every case, characterization is stricter and much more acceptable (compare Lindsay Duncan's Steely Helen, who has already been bitten by experience and failure, and her flashy superficial counterpart). <br /> <br /> Unlike the questionable racial undercurrent of 'Traffic' (Mexico Dark and Others, the ultimate WASP horror is black man's sex), the portrait of Pakistan is rich, tragic, with appalling arguments about drug protection played by scenes of atrocious violence. Throughout is the inextricable link between public and private experts. Visually, the movie is remarkably inventive, without ever being flashy or "filming" - especially in the last episode, where buildings and d√©cor seem to move as the system closes. As 'Traffik', such as its remake, the need for shore fragments, the prevailing sense of waste and loss is far more damning, Jack's speech bitterly desperate.
