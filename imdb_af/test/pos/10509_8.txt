I don't see why everyone is bombarding so much. I thought it was a wonderful time that unfortunately wasn't popular enough to be that celebrity. Believe me I saw much worse than this. If you want a bad movie, see shotgun or stranger dead or something. So what's normal, but better than most. And it is watchful. This movie also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard. Some of the music is very exciting. And the dead scenes are also cool. We see a very bloody body in a bath with the words SOLD written in blood on the mirror, and we also get a cool double knock through a toilet pump! with razors attached! It was a good fun 80's skater that is definitely worth it, despite what others say about it.
