This film does not have the exceptional footage presented by American Beauty or The Ice Storm and, because it is made to these films, it cannot be marked as very original: the music, although subtly brilliant, sounds like American Beauty. <br /> <br /> The story has some similarities with especially the Ice Storm (as well as Sigourney Weaver). Without the intention, the film seems to be trying to recreate the success of the two movies mentioned. Sometimes the story tends to stay a little more level than it is, bigger, more successful "brothers" by going on too much or by not delivering the most effective dialogues. Here, writing cannot be measured with that of American Beauty. But it can be said about most movies ever made, even the best, and there is still a lot to keep: music scores and (expected, given the movie) effective performances. Of the note is Emile Hirsch who will shine in the outstanding "Into The Wild" a few years later. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can recommend this movie if you like suburban dramas, but it's not the first on a list. of must-see, which will cover the following: 1 American Beauty 2 The Ice Storm 3 Little Children. <br /> <br /> After you have seen and kept it, look at this one.
