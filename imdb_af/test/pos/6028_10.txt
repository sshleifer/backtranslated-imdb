I must tell you the truth. The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because of Rose McGowan. I think that part definitely worked out ... pretty well. However, the movie was also very good. Some parts of this movie are really good. <br /> <br /> The movie also has good action. The mystery is pretty hard to figure out and Rose [McGowan] does an Oscar-worthy play by the end of the movie, but I don't want to give anything away. Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow are also fantastic in the movie, along with some of the other stars. <br /> <br /> If you like secrets, or action movies, or like Rose ... I totally think you want this movie.
