Oh, Hitchcock! It is difficult to find a bad Hitchcock movie until he loses it after the BIRDS (1963) and SABOTE have proven the point. After admiring most of this director's work for many years, I was able to overshadow one, perhaps from lack of interest in Priscilla Lane and Robert Cummings as lead actors. Of course, I was familiar with the climate of the Statue of Liberty because he had seen it repeatedly in film retrospectives, but I mistakenly assumed that the story indicates that it is not my interest. Was I wrong! The thrilling plot gets a chance to just cook off the bat by a casual encounter between the bad Guy Saboteur and the Good Guy Wrong Accused, and continues with a series of further casual encounters and narrow escapes. Well-known Hitchcockian elements are all there: the innocent person wrongly accused of a crime; people are not what they seem to be; dramatic or unlikely places that make the exciting scene play inside them (a plane hangar, a ranch, a bridge from which the hand-held hero shoots himself to escape the police, a cute charity ball in a palace house, top floor of a skyscraper, and eventually the torch of the Statue of Liberty). Through humor is provided by supporting players, generous pop-ups from early WW2-old social comments, moments of human warmth where people find suffering in themselves lend a hand to help a fellow human being, to get nothing back? In short, there was always a basic humanity at the heart of Hitchcock, but a sensational role-players of supporting players, especially Otto Kruger as the smartest villain on the side of George Sanders (his Broadway credits include the male lead in Noel Coward's PRIVATE LIVES ?? and it says everything) and weaselly Norman Lloyd as the titular saboteur, not to mention Alma Kruger ?? no relationship with Otto? as a prominent society involved in the fifth column plot (her character predicts that of Claude Rains' mother in NOTORIOUS). Priscilla Lane does a good job with a difficult role. For most of her early scenes, we can't tell if she believes the hero is innocent or guilty and she continually shifts her opinion, not to his side fully until late in the proceedings. One cannot determine whether her actions are guilty or whether we should be in a state of uncertainty, but the plot developments are so fast, fun and clever that we don't care what she thinks. <br /> <br /> Then there is the strange Hitchcock that has nothing to do with the plot. Twice the Lane character breaks to get a quarter change? once to compensate her kidnappers for an ice cream soda and again to make a call from a telephone bank. Why are these plays inserted is someone's guess, perhaps to make the movie look more realistic and thereby increase credibility and tension? Or maybe give the audience a moment to breathe? Some characters are at the top? The truck driver, the impossible type and confidence of the blind man, standing alone in a stainless-maintained cabin, the political philosophy-jumping human skeleton and other members of the circus caravan hiding the protagonists of their persecutors.
