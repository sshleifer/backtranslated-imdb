I just got the chance to dig in old Austen movies, and I picked it up because Persuasion is, and always will be, my favorite work by Jane Austen, and Anne Elliot, my favorite Austen heroine. So it was with great anticipation that I put the slide in my player. <br /> <br /> I wasn't disappointed either. I knew there were some withdrawals, so I would point them out and try not to be too fat over them. Anne Elliot is the most introverted of Austen's characters; she is the least spoken and the least witty. There are sections in the book where Anne says nothing - only her feelings are described. It works well in print, but how to transfer it successfully to the big screen? Shortly after doing thoughtful voice remnants (which would be boring over four hours), you have a long sequence of shots where the heroine says little or nothing and communicates everything through her facial expression. This may make the movie feel slow and lacking in purpose. If you need a more overt Austen style, then this movie is definitely not for you; but if mute is more your style, and you tend to pick up on unspoken 'vibes', it will meet all expectations. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Anne Firbank (like Anne Elliot) is an actress whose face can convey a lot. She watched as I always thought Anne Elliot would look: not a knockout - Anne should not be the elegant one of the family - not even in her first youth - which is also sometimes illuminated by the lighting and makeup. What you see is someone who is very much like Austen's character: someone whose appearance you pass once; but hear her speak, and look more closely, and she becomes more attractive the better you know her. This is Anne Elliot, who was brought to life by Anne Firbank. <br /> <br /> Bryan Marshall handles Captain Wentworth's portrayal very well. The bitterness is never obvious (except at the concert scene); And yes, I found it hard to believe he was wounding. Louisa Musgrove is interesting as she has been shown. But it's another point in Austen's book: he didn't find her interesting, he tried to find her interesting and eventually failed. So it also fits with Austen's original story. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the portrayal of Lady Russell, whom I thought in the book, was not portrayed as VERY bad; It also comes in this adaptation. <br /> <br /> So it's a movie that followed the book; I could write a lot more about how faithfully everything has been reproduced, but I will get rid of the space here. Charles Musgrove was one of the most lively characters (good fun), Mary, the most annoying (I went to just keep her closed - but I had that feeling while reading the book), captains and the admiral also thought of charm. <br /> <br /> The cinematography thought to me, a piece of stiff. There was little or virtually no fading from one screen to another. Maybe it's because it's a TV movie. A scene - CHOP! - The next scene, the actors go from the right, go left, and - CHOP! - Another scene, where the same thing happens. It was the only part of the movie that I had a bit of a visit. A low budget has to imagine somewhere. <br /> <br /> And, as I said earlier, if you want a little bit of Jane Austen, don't struggle with this one, as you'll find it too slow. However, I enjoyed it very much, as it had a wealth of detail (the sets were richly elegant!) To an excellent adaptation of my favorite Austen novel. I recommend it!
