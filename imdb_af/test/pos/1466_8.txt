A strange relationship between a middle-aged woman and a transsexual soon to be a woman. Charlotte and Venorica, both trapped by their ominous lives and don't know how to get them out. Charlotte is the owner of a beauty clinic, she broke up with her aggressive ex-husband, alone in an apartment packed with all the furniture except her large bed. Veronica stays with her poor dog. She is sensitive and desperately bothered by her mother's visit and the bad relationship with her father. Her only hope is that the upcoming transsexual operation will turn her into a real woman and then everything will be fine. All she can do now is waiting for an approval certificate. <br /> <br /> Then these two individuals get together by chance and they are all gradually involved in the lives of others. There are some sparkles between them, but no one is brave enough. Confronting the truth because they are not willing to accept the change as most people do. Eventually the end is very satisfying and let's have a little imagination to think about. <br /> <br /> The directors' great work gives me a good impression, she handles character development very well, the emotional atmosphere is completely full and intense. Also I am so obsessive with the bleak lights everywhere in the apartment, Delphic but full of desire. <br /> <br /> Two main characters are played by Trine Dyrholm and David Dencik. They are wonderful in their roles, a very impressive performance and the chemical reaction between them is right and convincing. <br /> <br /> Whether you are homosexual or heterosexual, male or female, the strangeness of life everywhere, this Swedish indie film is about meeting and changing. But don't be afraid, follow your heart and choose the right way.
