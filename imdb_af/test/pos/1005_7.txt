In this TV special Jon is the one who needs a life. The highlight of his day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging his base. Not happy with that, Jon takes Garfield to a self-help group to meet people. How many people will be interested in a loneliness 20-something whose best friend is a cat? <br /> <br /> After several failed attempts to get a girl, including one cringeworthy dance scene that opposes David Brents' merger of Flashdance and MC Hammer in the office (Disco's death ?, Says Jon), is more than shocked to find a cute girl who is as much as a bump. <br /> <br /> Of course they are going, but Garfield is worried that John will forget about him and choose to have a cat. Fortunately, Jon's new girlfriend is allergic to cats. <br /> <br /> With slicker animation than past TV shows, it feels like a longer episode of Garfield and Friends.
