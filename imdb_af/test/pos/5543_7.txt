First, don't be deceived by my family name. My mother was purebred Italian, so I know Italian families, and I love mobster movies, even the funny ones like this. <br /> <br /> For those who made this movie bad (you know who you are) you must have taken your movie privileges because you don't know what is good. It's a damn, funny and well-styled movie. The fact that almost no one is Italian is part of the joke, as far as I can see. And what red-blooded straight male can complain about spending an hour and something with like Michelle Pfieffer? Puh-lease! When I watched this movie, it conquered me with the opening song of Rosemary Clooney, who was so Irish as one can get, but her pronunciation of Italian words in Mambo Italiano is flawless and sets the tone of what should be perfect . (Hell, I even bought the record the next day because it.) Just the look of every crazy thing in the apartment I personally saw in my family's homes, but not in the same place (which I found hysterical) sell it to me. <br /> <br /> This movie is like Goodfellas on gas. I just wonder why there is no Citizen World and what happened to the food these guys had to get? My guess is that the crew had eaten it. "The Fries are crispy. The shake is creamy." My mouth is almost as much water as it does to the beautiful Mrs. Pfieffer think. And the three best things about this movie are Mercedes Ruehl's painful, funny baby, Dean Stockwell, like her writer, Tony, The Tiger, and last, but ultimately, the overnight of Oliver Platt to get more comic roles. And notice myself: find out where that black chick went. Ouch! Why does she work so rarely? This photo is right next to the big mob movies as it should be.
