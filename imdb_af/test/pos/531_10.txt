I just came back from seeing this wonderful movie !! I can love it so much ... It reminded me when my sister had to go to college, we had to move from place to place and my mother acted like Adele Augustus! Boys may not like this movie because it brings tears to your eyes. One of the best real movies I've ever seen !! and Natalie Portman rules !! 10/10
