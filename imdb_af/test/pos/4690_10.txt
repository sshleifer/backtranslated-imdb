Used to see it when I was very little, then watched my videos. Now I look at the DVDs, I love this one. Ray Winston is 'The Dude', the rest of the cast is all good and even with the change of Robin Hood it all works. Big stories, twists and the way it's shot - after the untrained eye (not that the mine is trained) can be misunderstood as coincidence, but it adds to the film's recording of the audience. With the green hills and the contrast of the lush, sun-drenched forest to the dark corridors and dungeons of the castles. Personally the definitive interpretation of the Robin Hood legend. I can't stress how much I think you should see it, if you get a chance, you should see it.
