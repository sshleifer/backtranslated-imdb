I just gave these nine stars instead of ten because I didn't approve so much of pornography. pornography has a useful purpose in society (can't say I can always think of one), but it probably does. <br /> <br /> Setting aside personal views, I really thought this movie was pretty funny. I didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, I bought it because I'm one of the 'Alice' obsessive people who will look at Alice in Wonderland. I own just about every version on DVD, so it was a clear choice to complete my DVD collection. I have to admit that I was out of my expectations and the whole thing would be offensive if it wasn't so funny. Besides, the music is really good and I like musical. <br /> <br /> Not everyone can make a good nudie musical. anyone who saw 'The First Nudie Musical' knows what a stink bomb was. Considering what a low budget Bill Osco worked for, "Alice" is pretty remarkable as a musical (it's better than some musicals made on expensive budgets). <br /> <br /> The movie can't escape the filth of pornography. . I usually look at the XXX version for full shock effect and some of the scenes are scandalizing (scandalizing because we're talking about Lewis Carroll). I felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed at the scene where 'Alice' (Kristine DeBell) started masturbating. it made me feel like a voyeur. and the free lesbian plays with 'Alice' and the kitty cats were a little too rational. <br /> <br /> However, the movie has a good sense of humor about everything. There is a particularly funny moment during the Queen's orgy when one of the actresses gets up and says, "Who should I get F --- K to come out of this movie?" Hilarious. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure I'm buying the whole family, it's good for you, but your gender is out of the philosophy here, but sex is human, and nothing of people frightens me. (I don't know if I really feel that way, but I couldn't resist it). Some people think everything should be about sex. I do not know. Jeez, just show a few frick'in responsibility and decorum. This movie definitely gives points for the attitude, but I will not push your luck, next time you can really upset someone. I mean we go here about children's literature.
