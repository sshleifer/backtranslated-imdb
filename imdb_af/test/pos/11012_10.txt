When I saw this movie, I was very impressed with the atmosphere the director created for the first time. It is also very interesting to see how they present the near future in 1974. If you watch the movie, you will see many sets and uses that are freaky and modern again today. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film is about the old question "What is real and what is illusion?". If you see the "Matrix" you will find many similarities. But the two films are not at all comparable, because "Welt am Draht" is art and "The Matrix" is entertaining. If the first one chooses. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I lost my video copy of it. <br /> <br />
