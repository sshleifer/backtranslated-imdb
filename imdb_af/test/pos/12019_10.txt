Richard Norton really highlights the screen in this Portland, Oregon based martial arts masterpiece. Norton, an Aussie heartthrob, plays the evil man. Milverstead, which runs a successful import and export business, operates both smuggling weapons and female meat trade participation. Usually the women from his favorite dance club are picked up with the help of a group of goons, the most famous of whom is Bolo Yeung, who plays the role of Ice. Trouble comes for Milverstead when a new policeman in town, John Kim (Britton Lee), will avenge his murder of dead partners on the hand of Milverstead's organization. If you have the time to watch just one martial arts movie this year, don't miss this classic.
