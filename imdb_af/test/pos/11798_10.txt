I have never heard of this movie when it was given to me to translate, so I did not know what to expect. I checked it on IMDb and became curious. It didn't take long to realize that it was a gem. Outstanding performances, good story, and both well-directed and well-written. It is difficult to compare it with other movies, but "Stand by me" comes in mind, although it has so many differences from "The Cure" to similarities. The story of an extraordinary friendship between young boys, plus the dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this movie and "Stand by me". Other than that, the healing is a good movie, and it's worth it for a wider recognition. It's dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also humorous. I can't think of one thing that bothered me about it. To say this, I do not want to give the impression that it is a "perfect movie", whatever it means, but rather that I enjoyed it very much, was much moved and wanted nothing to change. I will not go into a detailed description of the story / plot, partly because it is too general or too revealing, and partly because you can find the information elsewhere on the site. Eventually I can only say: Wonderful movie, see it if you get the chance.
