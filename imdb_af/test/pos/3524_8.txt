Five teenagers decided to camp in the Oregon desert, and despite being warned by the park keeper, they soon realized that something was lying around in the backwood to strike. <br /> <br /> When it comes to old horror movies, the only thing that pops up in every conversation is Friday THE 13th, so I took it myself to find those good old horror movies that were just for comparison. with Friday. The 13th, just before the day just happened. Be under the one I found, and was very impressive, it wasn't as filthy as some of the things you find today, it was very sharp in terms of character development, as it was quite nice, and it has a lot comfortable fit, it is not in a hurry to get to the hack and slash pieces, it takes its time to set the right mood and tone and is very atmospheric and build a few killer tensions by always having that feeling of fear, like what's out there, but you don't know where it is or when it won't be trike. <br /> <br /> Wherever I live, it's definitely a jewel donated simply because people have never heard or given it a chance, but I will say it's not a Friday. The 13th rip off, The two concepts don't even get close together, but in my mind it's totally one of the more impressive slashers I've seen for a while.
