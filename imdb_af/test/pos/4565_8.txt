The 1970s saw a rise and fall of what we became known as Blacksploitation Films. The term is a reference to the kind of broad catch-all, rather than a true genre of film. In short, any comedy, drama, adventure, western or urban police and robbery em-up, built and thrown so as to address the large urban black population of the mid-20th century. It can indeed embrace the widest kind of movies, as long as it has a slash towards the black black population. <br /> <br /> It seems that the idea of ​​producing these films of particular interest to black Americans originated with the Eastertime Release or 100 RIFLES (Marvin Schwartz Prod. 20th Century Fox, 1969). Formerly the Syracuse University's All American Footballer and several times, All-Pro Fullback for the Cleveland Browns, Jim Brown, had a competitive bill. As already mentioned in a number of films, RIO CONCHOS (1964), THE DIRTY DO (1967), (ICE STTION ZEBRA (1968)) and others began to make more sense for the Studios "that Jim was a hot property <br /> <br /> Now these 100 RIFLES bring record numbers of Black Protectors to the major cities' central business areas on Easter Sunday to see Mr. Brown, these adventure epics and other kinds of movies with more Black Players and Stars? not, indeed. ** We've seen a succession of Cops & Robbers, Bad-ass Private Detective Movies, Comedies, everything the route goes along, along the way, we finally had some family-oriented, wider movies The filmmakers were treated to SOUNDER (1972), THE TASKS (1974), CONRACK (1974) and finally CLAUDINE (1974). <br /> <br /> In CLAUDINE we find no stigma or easy classification as "Blackploitation" , since the story is universal and easy as a story about people of a New Origin, any where, and not just in the 1970s USA. <br /> <br /> The story of an ENING mother, Claudine (Dianne Carroll), is struggling to keep a family together after ".... two marriages and two almost marriages." is a far from a shooting-up Harlem Style. The problems that everyday citizens of our nation plague are confronted with and investigated under the sociological microscope. <br /> <br /> But we also consider Claudine's psychological and physical needs as a woman. For "Women must have man and man his measure", *** and we recognize this point. (It's SEX we're talking about, Schultz!) Claudine meets a very masculine, broad-shouldered athletic type in Private Scavanger Garbage Man, Ruppert B. Marshall (James Earl Jones) and they go on a date. /> <br /> The Great Welfare State interferes with the Couple as Claudine's Welfare Worker, Miss. Tayback (Elisa Loti) comes around to see just who this unattached Man is, who suddenly gives so much attention to Claudine's family. <br /> <br /> Having a humiliating experience with the Welfare Bureau's auditing and deduction, which is the norm for the family, the two decide to marry Big Brother without or with the blessing. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Claudine's older son got involved with some big talks, but little black activist group. But with Ruppert's help, he and they all come through. A.O.K. <br /> <br /> It ends with a happy, excited and hopeful note. We know that it may not be exactly "... happy ever!" But rather it will all gather! If there is a single criticism that we should point out, it is sometimes in a movie like this, a misconception spread to much of Urban Blacks. And this is the seemingly implied myth that all Whites are rich, with none of their kind ever needing help, out of work or any disability. <br /> <br /> Well, people, it's just ain This is true! NOTE: * At one stage, Jim Brown's career was a real hit as a rough action. He was even as "... The Black John Wayne." PLEASE NOTE: ** The idea of ​​making films with All-Black Casts filmed for All-Black consumption was not a new idea. In the 1920s, '30s and' 40s, we saw productions of people like Noble Johnson, Spencer Williams, Jr. and Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> NOTE: *** This is "As Time Goes Through", you know, Schultz, this is from CASABLANCA (Warner Brothers, 1942).
