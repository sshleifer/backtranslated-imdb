After returning "horror movies" (come on Scream is not scary!) I don't have very high expectations for this low-budget three story horror movie. But I was pleasantly surprised! Man this is scary !!! The first 2 stories are simply brilliant. The first one about a new rider who is riding in a dark forest with their RV, when they stumble into a fiery ........ (watch the movie)! The second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl who is home only one night. I know this doesn't sound special, but it's Scary. I promise you. The last story is not scary, but at least not bad. It's about a biker and a haunted house. In fact, the stories are based on real urban legends (I think Kevin Williamson can also steal ideas.) Keep this movie, it's good !!! I want to say I'm the scary three-short-story horror movie ever made!
