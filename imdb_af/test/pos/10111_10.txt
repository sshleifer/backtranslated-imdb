The recent history of Hollywood remake of ghost / horror films from the East is a pity. This movie will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or similar. <br /> <br /> It is well photographed and the sound is excellent. Watch a good screen and with a good 5.1 or DTS-enabled sound system is recommended. Obviously it is subtitled, so if it turns you off, I won't bother with it. Dubbing seldom works and simply won't do it here. <br /> <br /> It's also really scary, with excellent performances of a role that will be unknown to Western audiences. I would especially outline the stepmother character, which was absolutely brilliant. The end will want you to watch it again, if you can handle it. The plot is relentless and offers no comforting moments of release under the road. <br /> <br /> If I have a small criticism, there may be a detectable impact in some scenes of the Japanese version of The Ring. However, for many years we have taken direct copies of other people's ideas for Western films, and so my point is a limited one that didn't stop me from giving it 10/10. I believe most fans of this genre will get a great "pleasure" from this film that I will be going to for a class as a classic.
