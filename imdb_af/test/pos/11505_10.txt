The movie Angels of the Universe is a pure masterpiece and it once again proves that you can make a brilliant movie on a low budget, such as American Beauty and Blair Witch Project. Director Fridrik Thór Fridriksson gives the novel Englar alheimsins a new life on the white screen. The film is a breakthrough in Icelandic film production because it is the largest and largest film ever made in Iceland. <br /> <br /> The music in the movie, played by Sigurrós, is very symbolic of the film, it is absolutely brilliant. I recommend everyone who can think to watch as soon as possible, but you won't be disappointed. I will bet on this movie to win the best foreign film award next year ?? all over the world!
