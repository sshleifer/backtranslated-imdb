This movie was different. It has a sort of typical thriller story and reached for a more interesting, in-depth look at an individual character's struggle with faith. This, of course, helped the top performance, by Andrew McCarthy, to be very good. The other performances were also very interesting, though not so consistent. The end was a bit of a lay, but there were very good moments. The filmmakers tried something different here - they not only went for the obvious chills and fright. This is a dark film (not for everyone), but if you want to be entertained and not talked, try this one.
