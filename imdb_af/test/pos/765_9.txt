I heard about this movie but didn't see it until my daughter, who saw it on a flight to Australia, told me it was a good movie. I was interested to see if Rupert Grint, away from Harry Potter, shows the promise you see in the Potter movies. I was not disappointed. He became a good actor, showing a variety of management lessons from a shy boy beaten by a transmissible obsessive mother, to a young man who finds himself as his and others' appreciation. Going over lines from plays and poetry with his parent-actress employer, it's clear he's ready to tackle much more complex roles in movies and stage. But the jewel of this movie was Julie Walters. I saw her before in the Potter movies, Billy Elliott and Calendar Girls, and loved her. In Rylesse, like his lines from poetry and Shakespeare, I was awake at her timing, command of language and body language. I hope this is makeup / costuming, as she portrays an older woman with osteoporosis, although no mention is made of it in the movie. As a nurse I can say she did it perfectly and portrayed a woman. This is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time, and I wish I first saw it in a theater - but I've seen it. doubt it will ever be played here in Albuquerque. We miss so many of these types of movies here.
