Tonino Valerii see "Il Prezzo Del Potere" aka. "The Price Of Power" is an excellent and exciting Spaghetti Western that reflects the Kennedy murder. A great leading performance by Giuliano Gemma and an excellent score by Luis Bacalof are just two of the reasons to see this movie. <br /> <br /> In 1881, Texas is divided into those who appreciate the abolition of slavery and just want to live in peace, and those who still want to install the confederation after 16 years. Despite warnings, President James Garfield, who wants to establish a new equality policy, decides to visit Dallas, where corrupt law enforcement officers are planning his murder. Bill Willer (Giuliano Gemma) and two of his friends, a black man named Jack Donovan (Ray Shaunders), and a disabled man named Nick (Manuel Zarzo), are determined to prevent the president's murder. <br /> <br /> Since James Garfield was not murdered by racists, who wanted to re-install the confederation in Texas, but in Washington DC by mentally unstable Charles Guiteau, the story of "Price of Power" is, of course, historically nonsense. However, since the movie, it does not claim historical accuracy, but tries to refer to the Kennedy assassination in Dallas, but the fact that the story is fictitious is legitimate. <br /> <br /> Giuliano Gemma performs excellently as the lead character Bill Willer, Benito Stefanelli is wonderful as the shameful and corrupt Sheriff Jefferson. Other good performances are those of Ray Shaunders such as Bill's black friend Jack, Warren Vanders as well as Arthur McDonald, the president's advisor, and Fernando Rey as Pinkerton, a shameful rich businessman. Luis Enr√≠quez Bacalov's score is wonderful, the movies and locations are wonderful and (as in Valerii's earlier "Day of Anger"), Sergio Leone, who Valerii's assistant director worked for "A Fistful Of Dollars" and "For a Few Dollars More". <br /> <br /> Already said, "Il Prezzo Del Potere" is, after the Day of Anger, another excellent Spaghetti Western showing both the great talent of Giuliano Gemma as an actor and Tonino Valerii as director. "The Price Of Power" is a must-see for Spaghetti Western fans, and I also recommend it to everyone. 8/10
