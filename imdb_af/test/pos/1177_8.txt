Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, who both unfortunately missed, once again proved that they were a team dedicated to crafting hilarious moments on the screen. This movie is just another example of this. <br /> <br /> This time they are playing two in-laws who land on a ship as dance instructors. <br /> <br /> Of course, their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named Gil Godwin, who is just struggling with these boys. It is hilarious how Lemmon gives a quick lesson to dance to Matthau and how the latter owns a turbulent rumba with Mr McLanahan. <br /> <br /> Too bad that fellow dance instructors, Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor are given. so little to do, but their parts call on it. Matthau falls for Dyan Cannon, aboard her fellow gold digger, the usual outrageous Elaine Stritch. Unknown to them, Matthau also has no money. The widower Lemmon falls to Gloria De Haven, who looks better than ever. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Matthau and Lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers.
