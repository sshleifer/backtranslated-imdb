Nazarin by the award-winning surrealist Bunuel is undoubtedly an attack on the Catholic Church and the loss of values. It's not a visual movie and I think it would have played better on stage. Bunuel takes us through this man, the Nazarene living as Christ lived; a true follower, ie in poverty, and without caring for property and bringing the next day. Some may call it a parallel with Christ's story, but any follower and practitioner of the word, life must be like Christ in some way. But in essence, Bunuel also asks for the eternity of man's egoism and must sin and how goodness we can all save. It's a brave statement to make this possible, or to remind the movie of some. Truth, says the Nazarene is also selfish because he gives without returning or asking. His egoism is his folly and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coin, with the same face on each side. Many people represent sides of a coin in this movie, all with both faces the same. But the movie is not exactly memorable when it ends and one can attack many of its ethical perforations and effusions in the film's own learning. Not Bunuel, but a "surrealistic" series of dreams that contain the bunuel stages where the movie's message is framed and it's worth noting, shows you the ability of the director, Bunuel.
