Sleeper Cell is what should have been 24. 24 is a cartoon. (I look 24, but with every stupid episode, feel four or five seasons so far, cheated. Who can keep up, because they are all the same. Jack gets into trouble, Jack gets out of trouble and gets into the trouble and then ...) Sleeper Cell is really well done and is much better. Unfortunately, they blew it off at the end of the season. I can think of a half dozen better end of the top of my head that worked better for the author's obvious goals and didn't confront them. Scan the authors for the destruction of what has ended so far, which ends a very good series.
