This movie was the second movie I saw as a kid at the theater. It frightened the living shit from me. So much so that I asked my dad if we could leave halfway. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, the only people leaving halfway are the ones who have a good taste in movies. <br /> <br /> However, I still have good memories of this flawed masterpiece of horror. Doug McClure and Peter Cushing in the same movie! Great! Samples made of polypropylene replacement. Scary things. A rubber sample, if you think of it, is even scarier than a true monster. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing about this movie is how good the score is. There are also many prehistoric titles. <br /> <br /> There are also many prehistoric titles. Nice.
