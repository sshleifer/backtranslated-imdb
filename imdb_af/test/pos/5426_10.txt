This movie is about people. This movie has been a favorite short cartoon for many years. <br /> <br /> Isn't this the simplest thing that makes life so much more interesting? Our people are so gentle, compassionate, funny, caring for one moment at a time - we find the most beautiful and wonderful machines to kill as many people as possible with the least effort. In our short lives we destroy our world, each other and often our own lives, than we spend the rest of our lives trying to restore what we have destroyed. Sometimes there is nothing more to fasten! <br /> <br /> This movie can entertain, educate, and even help us realize what is wrong in our lives! Life is short and can even be shorter! The end is too optimistic. I am scared. <br /> <br /> I love Richard Condie's thoughts and what he makes of it! <br /> <br /> Enjoy <br /> <br /> H.K.
