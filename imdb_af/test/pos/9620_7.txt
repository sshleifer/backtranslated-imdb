The Hong Kong film producer Chang Chang Ho's 1972 martial arts epic "Five Fingers of Death" is widely regarded by a large number of film experts and kung-fu movie fanatics to be the martial arts movie that starts it all. <br /> <br /> It was released in 1972. It was phase two of the three-step process that would lead to the explosion of martial arts films in the West - Billy Jack (1971), with his well-known Hapkido action in the park, was released. The year before, and Bruce Lee played two years later in "Enter the Dragon" (1973), thus strengthening the martial arts movie spot in Western theater. <br /> <br /> But what is the hoopla about "Five Fingers of Death"? The film, with its terrible dubbing, explosive (if not highly unlikely) action and technical flaws and all, has a plot, though very thin. Chih-Hao (then Lo Lieh) is a young and dedicated student of Chinese gong-fu chosen to represent his school in an upcoming martial arts tournament. His teacher offers to enable him to practice himself in the "Iron Fist" battle, a deadly style that can easily kill a man with just one stroke. <br /> <br /> Additionally, Chih-Hao's arrival at the school coincides with a violent conflict with a competing school, its students and a trio of murderous heavy heaters from Japan. Before you know it, a major setback threatens Chih-Hao's training and ability to represent his beloved school in the upcoming tournament. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that "Five Fingers of Death" is actually the movie that started it all. As another viewer mentioned, 'Five Fingers of Death' helped set many standards in martial arts films for the next three decades - Asian, European and North American martial arts movies. Such standards include the dedicated student, the learning of patience and endurance, conflicts between competing schools, the intense ethnic hostility between the Chinese and Japanese, and learning a system of fighting for the good old-fashioned action motif: revenge. "Five Fingers of Death" will also be a major influence on American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies (Tarantino borrows quite liberal from this project, among many, just as you know). <br /> <br /> The play is pretty good, seeing the fact that it is a martial arts movie from the early 1970s, the best of which is Lo Lieh. As the atypical student of martial arts, his performance is pretty groundbreaking, but at first glance in this movie you won't really know it, because it has killed so much character so many times over the years. He is fairly humble in his acting and does anything he can to persevere over his enemies and not to fight in anger, or at their level of stupidity or arrogance. Even if he is experiencing his big setback, it makes your heart a bit, because it is so cruel and you wonder if he will recover enough to realize his lifelong ambition. <br /> <br /> "Five Fingers of Death" is a classic in every way. It's not perfect at all, and viewers will love to expect something from the caliber of the "Godfather" of martial arts movies. What it offers you is the ultimate example of eastern hand-to-hand battles from the time before Eastern theater was an important game in the West. <br /> <br /> 7/10 <br /> PS: "Enter the Dragon" Bolo Yeung also appears as the Mongolian street fighter near the start of the movie.
