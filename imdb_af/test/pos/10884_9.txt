What can ever be said about one of the best N64 games ever? That the action is fast enough to really even keep a seasoned FPS veteran sweet bullets literally? That the graphics are great after the explosions that everyone loves to see? That nothing is so much fun playing multiplayer mode, and shooting your friends and brothers and sisters in the back with submachine guns? Very small beats Goldeneye 007. The only thing missing was voice action and a little more intelligence in the enemy soldiers. If you have a N64, and you like to shoot people and things that are spied on, you get a copy of it.
