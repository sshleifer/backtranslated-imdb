I agreed on this movie because there was nothing else to look at. I was immediately sucked in by the characters. <br /> <br /> Robin Tunney is nothing short of spectacular in this movie. Her depiction of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100% credible. Really, this kind of thing is not easy to do. She pulled it off wonderfully. <br /> <br /> We know well in advance, this movie will end tragically, but you can't take your eyes off it. The characters do stupid things, but unlike most Hollywood movies where people do dull things because the plot demands it, these people do stupid things because they are not right in the head - and the things they do are completely in match their characters. /> <br /> It's just a good example of making IMHO. Great writing, great play, great directing. A movie for people who think film can be more than sensible entertainment.
