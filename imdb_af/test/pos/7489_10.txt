ONE GOOD THING: This hidden treasure of a crime drama is incredibly entertaining from start to finish. An example of low-budget movie entertainment at its best, writer / director Skip Woods apparently uses everything he can find (for example: Lamborghini, supermodel, cow phone) and an ear for dialogue to level satire to plot. Add His Camera Setup. <br /> <br /> Another good thing: This movie looks like the DVD era, with several segments containing a larger story (similar to the work of Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's Desperado). Each chapter of the movie features Thomas Jane's main character who spent one day at home and quickly and unforgettable performances by Aaron Eckhart, Glen Plummer, Mickey Rourke, Michael Jeter, James LeGros and a memorable role by Paulina Porizkova. <br /> <br /> Even another good thing: Not really a good thing, but incredibly shocking and memorable. Every person watching this movie remembers one important scene. Much as liberation will always be remembered for the terrible rape of Ned Beatty. Thursday, the film goes down as a woman raping an unwilling man. Unforgettable. <br /> <br /> ONE BATHING: The title lets people think it is somehow related to (or derived from) the "Friday" series of films featuring Ice Cube. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A +
