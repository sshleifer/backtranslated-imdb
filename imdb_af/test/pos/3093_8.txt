Werner Herzog is indeed one of the most interesting filmmakers of the past 50 years, but the boundaries of the cinema may be more like any other commercial filmmaker. I've been familiar with Herzog for a few decades and I've never been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to Rescue Dawn and was a little surprised at how relative the mainstream of the film was. However, it can't help but Herzog takes his actors and crew into the actual jungle not only to make the movie but to live it. No other filmmaker is so fond of the purity of the film-making process, and the subsequent songs of such productions as Fitzcarraldo are forged into the film. <br /> <br /> Today I sat down at Fata Morgana, a 1969 Herzog movie, described as an allegorical film postcard. Without exploring the real places, I assume that it was shot somewhere in Africa, both coast and desert, a region that once was the cradle of the infant, the baby civilization, the baby's life on earth. It is this origin, the biblical notion of the Garden of Eden and the Apocalypse about which Herzog is concerned, as spoken by the narrative during the 79 minute walk. <br /> <br /> See FM I couldn't help but feel I was a passenger on a deep voyage. In the opening order, the title is translated as "Mirage" and Herzog replaces this translation with several repetitions of commercial jets landing on a landing strip. These images are distorted, their 3-dimensionality is knocked down by a long lens, which sits low exhaust gases, heat waves and light deviations all at one another. The effect has distracted me: things are not as they seem. <br /> <br /> FM is divided into 3 very clear chapters: 1) Creation, 2) Paradise and 3) The Golden Age. Chapter One, open with countless, shaky images, where pale, arid landscapes flutter through, dead animal rot, broken shells of crashed planes and deserted cars slowly disappear into the desert sun. The people who populate this inhospitable landscape are dirty, indifferent and apparent prisoners of the desert. The narrative speaks of a time before life, a time when the canvas of the earth was empty and all that existed was the heavens. While the narrative is listening to a simpler, pure era, portraying a young boy holding a fox-like animal to his throat, a different representation of man's cruel, relentless effort to rule over nature to maintain. <br /> <br /> In the next chapter we are introduced to more of the same, but the images and people are more animated and look like a life force and vitality. We listen to a checkered biologist who talks about the trouble a shackle is looking for in a lifeless environment. While holding the shutdown monitor, the tongue flickered on flies, he also describes how difficult it is to capture these creatures in the grinding 140 degree heat. The parallel is properly listed and Herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated, candid portraits of individuals hit by the sun, the desert and the laborious efforts needed to exist in this harsh world. He also pushes the theme forward that, if not in control, man claims his control over his environment and not always in the pleasant ways. <br /> <br /> The last chapter we take from the desert's blast furnace and populated in the more famous Herzog area by eccentric and absurd behavior. No one has a more effective symbiotic relationship with the oddballs of the world than Herzog. Maybe that's where he feels most at home. Like Errol Morris, Herzog chooses to set his camera as seemingly objectively a position as he can before he rolls the film. The subsequent flirting of Herzog, with his subject, resulted in him still being able to shoot if most directors suddenly shouted. As Morris does, this extended role pushes past the "moment" that the subjects feel compelled to offer and, by their discomfort to be overtaken by overtime, gives their facade room for something real. The most humorous portrait in this chapter is of the 2-person band playing a strange, polished song that Herzog recovers throughout this chapter. The band's drummer wears the same glasses as the biologist. Just like another man doing a magic, the question begs: What are the glasses? They certainly added some delicacy to the movie, but one has to wonder if their deeper meaning or meaning is, or is it just another example of Herzog's playfulness. <br /> <br /> The story separately, Herzog uses folk and blues music as the experimental documentary soundtrack. Leonard Cohen grabs most screen time, two of his beautifully melancholy songs, "So Long Marianne" and "Suzanne." perfectly accompanied by the movie landscapes, adding to the convincing feeling that we are really together for the ride. Towards the end of the journey, Herzog returns to one of the many shots repeated by the film: the distant framework of a lonely vehicle that penetrates the endless desert through a watermill that fills the horizon. Despite the overall darkness of FM, the film's crescendo and the mirage motif leave you with a hopeful spirit, believing that life will persist and possibly even thrive. <br /> <br /> After writing this post, I referred to FM to discover that Herzog shot just weeks after a bloody coup in Saharan Cameroon. In his legend, Herzog and his crew were arrested, beaten and captured. While she was imprisoned, Herzog fell ill with Schistosomiasis, a blood parasite. It's really hard not to love such a hypnotic and tough movie as Fata Morgana; knowing that the filmmaker was willing to die to make it, just make it more respectful. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
