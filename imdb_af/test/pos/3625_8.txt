If you've never experienced the thing that Zasu Pitts is, here's a Zasu singer! In 1933 characters Mae Questel Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the popeye cartoon. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does her best "Olive Oyl" personality running around and letting her hands ring or sit on the policeman's layman. I was waiting for her to say "Ohh myyyy", but instead it is "something always happens to someone." The first time I saw this movie, I loved Zasu and found her character very funny. I've since seen her in other films, where she does the same, impenetrable, reckless routine. So, when I watched this movie again, I got a little irritated with the constant whining and near hysteria over a piece of dust. But there are some funny comedy bits here, and it's also a riddle. It's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that actually works. The secret plot fits well through the camp of Zasu Pitts and James Gleason, which Arthur Crimmer plays the policeman. The haunted house is fun with a lot of secret passage and even a skeleton on the attic! Well worth the watch. Read more public domain movie reviews at: http://pdmoviereview.blogspot.com/
