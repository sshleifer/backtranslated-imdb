I saw the movie for the first time about ten years ago on a sick day of school. Compared to the Lifetime movies I usually watched, it became a moment, but obscure favorite. <br /> <br /> I've seen it twice. I think some parts are small cheesy, maybe the plot can use a little more action. <br /> <br /> However, it captures the fantasies and realities of children with uniqueness and warmth. The magical realism is similar to that of Amelia, and the heart of those of the wonder years. Despite the particular development of my taste, I still find the subtle magic of this movie, the lovely characters, and its simplicity magical.
