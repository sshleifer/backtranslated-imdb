Romuald et Juliette is one of the French romantic comedies where they seem to break all the rules, rather like Trop Belle Pour Toi. The beautiful Daniel Auteuil learns about true loyalty and love when his life threatens to topple his ears. The film is not a prehistoric morality story, but a wonderful story that lasts you to the last. Firmine Richard (as Juliette) is a heroine who will cheer women - her laughter is my lasting memory of this hot and witty movie. The downward way she includes all her children through their different fathers - especially the birthdays - gives the film an edge that lifts it above your average romantic comedy. But it is always the French that shows us how easy it is!
