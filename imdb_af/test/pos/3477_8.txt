In Dublin, the lame rebel Rory O'Shea (James McAvoy) moves to the Carrigmore Residential Home for Disabled, affecting the lives of residents. Roy can understand the incomprehensible speech of Michael Connolly (Steven Robertson) who has been left in his shelter by his distinguished father many years ago for his cerebral palsy and they become close friends. Rory convinces Michael to move from Carrigmore to a Dublin apartment, and they hire the beautiful Siobhan (Romola Garai) to help them. Living with Rory, Michael faces a new world, finds friendship, love and freedom and learns to survive. <br /> <br /> "Inside I'm Dancing" is a wonderful story of friendship and freedom in a beautiful story. The acting of Steven Robertson and James McAvoy is wonderful and I don't understand how they were nominated for the Oscar with such beautiful performances. Romola Garai also has excellent performance and is very beautiful and sexy. The roadmap touches, never curly and without redemption, and the exact direction of Damien O'Donnell is very sensitive. Unfortunately, the Brazilian title of the DVD is shamefully ridiculous and gives the wrong idea of ​​this excellent movie. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Melhores Dias the Nossas Vidas" ("The Best Years of Our Life")
