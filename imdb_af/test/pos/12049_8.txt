Shahrukh Khan and Yash Chopra movies have never been disappointed. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a romantic classic. Dil To Pagal Hai was fresh and perfect to watch. Mohabbatein remains one of my favorite movies ever. And Veer-Zaara was magical. Darr, though not the best, is a romantic thriller that differs from the aforementioned movies, but definitely worth watching. And SRK, who blew me off with an excellent performance in Baazigar, repeated a villainous act. And this time he gets an experienced Juhi Chawla and Sunny Deol to support him. <br /> <br /> Before I comment on the acting, it's not just the play, but the wonderful script it makes a watch worthwhile. This is the writing that complements the great acting. The story is tempting, but the characterization is what stands out. The comedy track goes well together. But the movie tends to be romantic. The viewer is obliged to lose interest and you will make some yawns. But the movie is still good. <br /> <br /> Shahrukh Khan is brilliant in his author-supported role. Shahrukh Khan is once again sympathetic and cruel. You must cry at the end. Juhi Chawla is decent. Her screaming will be irritating after a while. But in facial expression she is excellent. But her final scene is brilliant (though she is overshadowed by SRK). She has a writer backed up role that makes her very enjoyable. Sunny Deol is sufficient. His character was very nice, but too perfect. And it gets boring after a while. He does a good job. Anupam Kher is really funny, but his role felt a bit out of place. Tanvi Azmi supports well. <br /> <br /> The songs are enjoyable and come at the right time. Jadoo Teri Nazar (Magic by Your Sight) is my favorite song, and the presentation is many 90's movie like. Tu Mere Saamne (You are in front of me) and Likha Hai (written here) are lovely love songs. Darwaza Band Kar Lo (closes the door) is also a decent love song. The instrumental song is danced to perfection, as well as the naughty wedding song Solah Button. The movie may not be perfect, but it's worth your time, especially if your favorite actor is in it.
