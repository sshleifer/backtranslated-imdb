I only saw the movie for the first time fifteen years ago, and I've been captivated by it ever since. It's such a good experience that I can look happily at any time of the year. For me, however, it is the ultimate Christmas. <br /> <br /> The fact that it's in B&W is irrelevant - although I often wonder how it will be in color. You can only get that warm, glowing feeling to see how the Christmas events unfold. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck and Morgan are perfect together, and Greenstreet is the antithesis of his usual character, Sakall is a joyous joy to watch. <br /> <br /> It's light relief and definitely not taxing the brain, but let yourself feel like you've seen it. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for it to be available on DVD in the UK. I will definitely be in front of the queue to buy it.
