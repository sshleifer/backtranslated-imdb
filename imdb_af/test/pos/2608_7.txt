This is a cute movie featuring Spanky, Alfalfa and Buckwheat from the "Our Gang" comedies. In the Southern Cape in the Civil War it may seem a bit strange to see Bokwiet as Spanky's slave, but this film is as charming as the best of the shorts with the same cast. This was the only Our Gang movie, and I strongly recommend it to The Little Rascals remake from 1994.
