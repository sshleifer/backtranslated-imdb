Collected a lot for this remake which unfortunately was a checkout failure despite a good soundtrack. I can't say it was never entertaining, nor a cure for insomnia. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie - it was the escape I was after one afternoon. A good look for those of us who are looking for ideal life, even if it is a fantasy. Expect some choppy moments, little excitement and occasional laughs.
