The best Batman movie of the 90's has no doubt about it. This movie takes place in a city with insecurity and nightmares. <br /> <br /> Though the villains are somewhat cheesy, they fit perfectly into the movie's colorful but nightmare cinematography. <br /> <br /> The performances are really great and the comic scene behind them really offers expectations. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the cute outfits, it's a pure style movie in Burton. It cannot be described; Burton is a sui generis director who took the Batman franchise to another obscure level but did not forget about his comic strip. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of action theater and best of all, if it is about superheroes.
