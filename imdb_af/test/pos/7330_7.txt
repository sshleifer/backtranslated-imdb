I like this movie. I can be biased because I love dolphins. But my 3 and 4 yrs. guy will sit and watch the whole movie .... It's not Oscar material, but definitely entertaining. The dolphin cinematography is well done with a beautiful backdrop of ocean views and sunsets. My favorite scene is when Flipper flips the pop knocker out of the streaking Sandy in the head. It's an engaging funny moment that makes me laugh every time. On the other hand, the villains of the bully boatman (forget his name) are a bit difficult to take. And the shark scene is far from reality. Question: Do dolphins make so much noise? Or is there some serious dubbing here? Bottom line: My kids love it and it keeps recycling through our video recorder.
