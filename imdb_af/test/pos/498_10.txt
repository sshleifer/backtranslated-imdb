this movie was brilliant! I absolutely loved it! Wesley Snipes was great for this role - and I'm sure blade 2 will be just as good. <br /> <br /> blade is by far one of my favorite action / horror movies out there! And if you haven't seen it yet, like vampires and blood (all those things), you really have to rent it because I assure you you'll love it!
