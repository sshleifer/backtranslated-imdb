We enjoy a movie like 'Fame' because we think we are there ourselves - music, dance and drama students enjoy our self-expression. This movie has humor, entertainment and should be an inspiration for young people to have a march in the performing arts. Bravo "Fame". Surely 8 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Chris
