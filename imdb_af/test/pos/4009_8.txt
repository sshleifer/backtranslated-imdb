Most of the criticisms of "Attack of Show" come from people who compare it unfairly with an old computer program called "The Screen Savers." People are upset because G4 decided to cancel the "Screen Savers" and replace them with the pop culture-based "Attack of the Show." To compare the two shows is to compare apples to oranges! <br /> <br /> "Attack of the show" is a unique hour-long program that covers the current Generation X / Y culture. It features segments on movies / television, panel discussions, video games, new DVD releases, sex advice, new gadgets (MP3 players, mobile phones, etc.), comics / graphic novels, magazines and internet fads. <br /> <br /> It's a fun show, definitely worth checking out if you're in your 20s or 30s. I give it an 8 out of 10.
