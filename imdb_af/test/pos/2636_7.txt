Against this magazine (January 25, 2006), I'm sad to hear about passing by Chris Penn in the past few hours. Other than Footloose, The Wild Life is the movie I remember most about Chris. <br /> <br /> I still remember in the movie, with a slight love, of Chris's wrestling character and teammates sitting in their favorite restaurant with a large plate of fries in front of them, drown in a whole bottle of ketchup. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my comments relate to the title track sung by Bananarama. After these many years, I still remember the rumors (Canadian spelling - lol) that Bananarama was called on the very LAST moment to compile the song for the movie and that they tied the song on the plane to the recording studio brought the song up and just after they recorded the song, they shot the low cost video for their title track. I heard that this whole process (from start to finish) took 4 hours to do! If that is true, then it is really worthwhile to be the most successful female band of all time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's just a rumor I've heard in the day and remember another generation later. Perhaps anyone reading it can comment and explain. Thank you.
