Jimmy (Heath Ledger) gets a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown) an underworld kingpin to deliver money to a specific address, but when nobody answers the door, Jimmy decides to take a dive on the beach a while, but he notices that his clothes are spilled on the sand and the 10 is gone. Jimmy phoned Pando to tell him the problem, but he didn't want to hear it. Pando and his sons are trying their best to find Jimmy, who no longer means Jimmy when they get their hands on him. So now Jimmy is going to hide to organize a bank robbery to get Pando's money back. Also in this mess he meets the innocent sweetheart Alex (Rose Byrne) and together they are in a hell of a ride through Sydney's King Cross. <br /> <br /> "Two Hands" is simply a captivating pick-me-up movie that is lively, exciting and incredibly fresh. What you got here is almost an urban gangster movie with a cunning background and violence in your face? what, how is it fresh you ask? Well, because it brings us to the underworld where Australian culture shines with criminals wearing flip-flops and footy pants, cars and a can of beer in hand? And don't forget the Australian sense of humor, dry and sarcastic. You can say it is very grateful for the likes of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Goodfellas' (a fave of mine) and 'Lock, stock and two smoking barrels' for his inspiration, but for me it still stands on its own . The film has a real blend of light moments, but also a mean stripe with a few unexpected shocks and black humor that can actually be disturbing. You just don't know what's coming and it has a fun touch of funny irony (especially the end) and good timing with his humor. One scene in which a bank robbery is involved will have you in stitches, I guarantee you. The plot's outline is really an age story (or the road not taken), with a pushing love story added and then the gangster element to shut it down. Most of the subplots are cleverly built and interlocked, perhaps it could have been without the supernatural element of Jimmy's dead brother, but in the overall context the divergent plot seems to be all clicking. Intense, natural and sharp dialogue filled the exuberant colorful writing, with Aussie snake / twang fast jabs - I'm honestly thinking! <br /> <br /> What really made the movie was that of Bryan Brown's performance of Pando. He just gave his character such a very charismatic / nasty persona that when he wasn't on the screen, his presence was still felt. He gave his character two sides: one is a stitch, but the other is such a good look. A young Rose Byrne glows with her nervous sweet / cute character Alex. She looks radically beautiful and adds a bubbly personality. Then you have Heath Ledger that fits like the naive Jimmy the goat. Great supporting role involved in the likes of Susie Porter, Tom Long, David Field, Steve Vidler and Steve Le Marquand. Such raw performances are achieved and from there you get sounding, fun and credible characters. Pump soundtrack protruding at the seams, such as Powderfinger and Alex Lloyd, offers a cool vibe. Shot on the spot in Sydney's King Cross, it really helped to keep out by keeping one's own life and showing the Australian way of life. Gliding camera tricks captured the city's backdrop, especially the breakthrough nightlife. It was a movie when I was finished, I was completely satisfied with what I got. Overall, a gourmet crime thriller that reached what it meant to do ... a fun, smart and crazy roller coaster ride of excitement and excitement. <br /> <br /> I say, this is a successful Aussie, take 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' by director / writer Gregor Jordan in his debut film. If you come across, please do not hesitate to leave it don't go.
