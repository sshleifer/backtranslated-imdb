Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He makes a good performance as the title character. It is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, beautifully played by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice on love. This movie is not to be completely predictable. This movie also makes it possible for Cruz to perform a performance as a strong woman who knows her own thoughts and hearts. As soon as the film warms up over the opening sequence, this movie will keep you focused on it. Again, Nicolas Cage did not disappoint.
