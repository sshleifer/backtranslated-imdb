The film, although not true to the original novels, manages to create modern gothic vampire vision. Someone tried to insult QotD and call it a 1.5-hour music video. Actually, it's a supplement. The everyday Gothic music combined with the music video-like shots made the movie so amusing - and 'Queen of the Damned' is a mood-driven story. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the mortal supporters who do not complain about the changes of the story. The plot has changed to be less confusing to viewers who don't know the novels. The number of characters has been reduced and I have no trouble changing Lestat's manufacturer or hitting Mekare's character. The biggest change - the romance of Lestat and Jesse - was a great addition to me. <br /> <br /> Actually, I think a faithful adjustment would be a complete failure. Perfect for the XIXth century New Orleans and Louis' anxiety, the slow and gloomy mood would not suit Lestat's uprising and his music. And while the book can be slow, descriptive, combining several elements, but still capable of conveying it, the movie simply can't do without changing chaos. "Vampire Lestat" and "Queen of the Damned" can be divided into at least three movies. The creators had to choose something. <br /> <br /> Some of the special effects, like flying or flaming, were the only things I didn't actually have in this movie. But Akasha's death was very nice. The game was good, Stuard Townsend was convincing as Lestat, especially at the concert, but I chose Banderas as Armand. However, I loved Jesse, Maharet and Marius. And of course, Aaliyah was perfect with her quasi-ancient Egyptian accent. <br /> <br /> So if you're in Gothic Music and Vampiric dillema of loneliness and eternity (and you don't see books being movies) "Queen of the Damned" is one of the few movies that vampires like something show more than blood sucking samples. But please don't compare it to the "Interview" movie. It has a completely different style, exactly as much as Louis and Lestat. Personally, I find it exciting to first see a vampire's existence from Louis's "bottled hungry" point of view, and then switch to one without moral, but surprisingly outgoing for a vampire, Lestat. <br /> <br /> I'm giving Queen 8 out of 10 because it had some technical flaws, but I decided to give it 9, as it is much underestimated by people who just hate it because it does not match their vision of the books that can be clearly seen by looking at the voting distribution.
