In the late eighties and early nineties, the decline and death of independent video companies such as Vestron and Media effectively shut down Italian horror films for many American people. Coincidentally (?) Italian genre films also declined in quality and profitability. <br /> <br /> Sometimes movies like Primal Rage, "sequels" such as Beyond The Door III, Troll 2, and some Dario Argento movies are poured into video but most remain unexplored for about a decade or more (to DVD) in the USA. Movies of these lost years have become very sought after and talked about horror fans. <br /> <br /> Of these movies, Cat In The Brain is probably one of the most amazing of the whole world because of the legions of Lucio Fulci fans and the fact that it is not just aimed, but also their idol, Fulci himself died. <br /> <br /> Although Fulci is not the best, it is still better than most of its later efforts. His racial fan base will probably love it. Italian horror and giallo aficionados can also enjoy it, depending on their taste, but I'm not sure of anyone else. People who are just watching Hollywood might not want the word of many glowing reviews here. <br /> <br /> One thing I personally found fascinating was the scenes that Benito Mussolini's only lasting contribution to Italy, Cinecitta Studios. The name is immediately recognizable by any fan of Italian movies. Until I saw it here, I could only imagine what it looked like.
