Valley Girl is the definitive 1980s movie with traps filtered through this wonderfully activated movie. The characters are so convincing that you forget it's a movie and not a video of a real "day-to-life" of any high school, USA. This movie is until the 1980s that is the Brady Bunch TV series until the 1970s. If you don't like it, then, "Spoon me with a spoon."
