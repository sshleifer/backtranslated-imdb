I was aware of the Buffalo area that the movie has read many articles in local publications. I was most impressed with the movie, especially its clever plot, acting and local scenes. Fun to see so many older, quality stars in different roles. I feel that especially those of our over 50s will find the movie excellent and you can make the theater feel your time is well spent.
