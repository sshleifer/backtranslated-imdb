I only saw it a few years ago while sitting on the couch and holding onto HBO. With the remote control out of my reach, I decided to go with it and wait for an unhappy movie I avoided for a year. So it started and I wasn't very optimistic about it, but after about ten minutes I laughed. The complete opposite as I expected. The comedy was clever, the acting was pretty good, the role-play was very good, and the story (although slightly uncomfortable and false) was actually quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> Three guilty brothers succeed in escaping their sentence and eventually seeking their fortune. The film was in the 1930s. So they experience a number of funny and interesting characters. Everyone has a different story or performance that they strive for. In fact, the majority of the movie may look random. Some may say it is pointless and boring, but if you look at the clever comedy (and sometimes silly) integrated into the movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one. <br /> <br /> I liked the performances by George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson. Everyone worked very well in their roles, and they worked well together. But to finish it off, "Oh brother, where are you?" is a clever, funny and a movie adventure that I will not succeed.
