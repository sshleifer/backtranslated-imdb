Anyone who has seen Ali G before should be well prepared for the full movie 'Ali G Indahouse'. <br /> <br /> Although I prefer Ali G when he is the rich and well-known interviewer, his mark is completely off the wall comedy also from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, all making this movie a riot for Ali G. fans <br /> <br /> If you saw him and didn't like him did not, avoid this film like the plague, because it is definitely just the same; for everyone else - watch it Aiiii! 10/07
