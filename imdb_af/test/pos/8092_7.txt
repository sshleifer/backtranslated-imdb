It was Chaplin's first all-talk picture, and the results were mixed. The movie is a biting satire of Hitler and Mussolini, their henchmen and their fanatic way of life, especially with regard to the persecution of the Jews. It was constantly and forward for 1940 and had to tear many people down. <br /> <br /> Compared to Chaplin's previous works, it's quite pale in comparison. The sweet, funny style of his silence is, in my opinion, much better than his first talkie. There are many meaningless bits that drag. If it were a silence, it probably wouldn't have happened. <br /> <br /> I find one of the funniest moments to be the musical barber moment and the world dance. Of course, one of the most beautiful moments is the speech at the end. <br /> <br /> The Great Dictator is an effective and sometimes moving movie that is a huge part of both Chaplin's history and film history. It's wrong, but Chaplin is in good shape.
