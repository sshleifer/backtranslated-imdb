A girl starts to notice that people in her small town are fascinated by anything like a spiral. Soon the fascination becomes obsessed and things become deadly. While I will not say that "Uzumaki" was an excellent movie, I would say it was different from what I saw before. During my view, I felt I was watching a cartoon. There are funny faces between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes. Later, I noticed that the movie is a modification of a manga comic, so it makes sense. But just when you think you're looking at something that a kid's movie can be, you're bombarded with nasty and greedy figurines! The story often loads and the end is somewhat sudden and then anti-climatic, but in retrospect I appreciate it more for its originality. My rating: 7/10.
