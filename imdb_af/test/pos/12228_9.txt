I came across this movie while the channel is navigating one day on the internet; and decided to give it a chance. To my surprise, I enjoyed this dark-haired movie. I felt a real chemistry between Challen Cates and Malcolm-Jamal Warner. It was such a sad and hot movie that I was excited. Certainly, this movie was predictable from the start, but I give it high marks for the way it makes me feel when it was over. I have to admit that I have never seen Challen Cates before, but I feel she can definitely act. When you combine her good play with her cute face and attractive figure. She has the ability to become at least a famous star.
