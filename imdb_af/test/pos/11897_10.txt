This movie was a contemporary scarface. It had me on my toes. This movie is one of those rare epic movies that lets you follow. I especially love Damian Chapa's performance deserves an academic award he earned for his performance in blood in blood. The only thing I didn't like was the behind the scenes, because it didn't show the intensity of the movie, and I'd love to see less told scenes. But the movie was great and it's in my top ten movies of all time. Only the acting was wonderful, there wasn't a bad scene in the movie, I loved it. Jennifer Tilly was perfect as well as all the cast. I can't see anyone doing it It doesn't like this movie. It's definitely a must see.
