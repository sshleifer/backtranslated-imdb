This movie is hilarious. I'd say much more painful and disgusting than the previous movie. The entire film from the previous movie and series is present. <br /> <br /> This kind of movie is great to watch in the MovieTheater because the whole audience is crying with laughter, especially with the terrorists who were damned. I wish they made more of these movies. <br /> <br /> Strong stomach needed! This time they had bad stunts. Warning: Include lots of snakes! I would like to write about it, but I can't spoil the fun. Check it out !!!
