To start, this is my favorite of the ST OS. <br /> <br /> In addition to StuOz's critical comments, I will throw in a little more: Technical, when the business burns, it's photon corps at a blind target, they must be very close to hits (I believe ) to cause any disruption to the Romulan vessel much less, with the vacuum of space to fight. <br /> <br /> I have somewhat of a problem with the Romulan commander questioning his belief in the Romulan "protocol" or their leadership unless it relates to the attacks of vulnerable targets (outposts in the neutral zone) that is not in war. Nor do I think commander would fall for the basic or simple tactics played by Kirk, such as killing or falling for the fold that the subordinate surrenders to him or not to attack the enterprise if it does. is not. play dead. <br /> <br /> On the Enterprise: I'm surprised that after the Romulan vessel's approach was seen earlier, that Sulu would say, "Are they surrender?" when it attacks the business for the first time. <br /> <br /> Funny how Spock can only do the gun control recovery when the emergency is over. <br /> <br /> Also in the final attack, I thought the Romulan vessel was too long (so long that Spock could walk a few corridors and go back to the armory and turn on the photo spiers. I would Phasers used at this stage, but I'm sure it had to do with the technicians and the budget. <br /> <br /> On the positive side: It's a good drama played on the Romulan vessel, to introduce us to the Romulans, great scenes with Stiles who tell a lot about the human knowledge of the Romulane, and his conflict with Spock is right there, I wanted Stiles's character to stay on the show for a while, as he has nothing but the energy he has added. <br /> <br /> It's just fun to show the negative and goofs, surely there's more). But for me it's as good as it gets !! "Terror Balance" is always the one I put in my ST rankings.
