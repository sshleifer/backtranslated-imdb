Charles Bronson is back in his best-known role. In my opinion, this is by far the best movie of the series and my favorite movie ever. This movie does not take him seriously, because the filmmakers knew that all the social commentary needed was crossed in the first movie. Golan and Globus made this movie for Bronson fans, not for the critics, and it works. DW3 was unfairly criticized as "trash" and "a tired entry in a worn series." These statements would be true if the film was made to be taken seriously or to make a statement, but it was not. If you take it as it is, DW3 is just a fun, action-packed skirt, with Charlie on the street that we all wish we could do. The action is not stopping, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the movie is just out and about the best Bronson movie ever made. You can see that the penny-pinching cannon group spent a lot of money on this one. It is believed that Bronson thought this movie was too violent, and that was why Winner did not order any of the following entries. I can understand his concern, but as always, you have to push the envelope even further to pass a previous entry. Anyway, this movie was no more violent than any other movie made during this time. What makes DW3 the best of the series and my favorite movie ever (not the best, just my favorite) is the action, Charlie's presence, unforgettable villains, and it's the ability to make the viewers jump on the train. The first movie can be made the most technically good, but this one is the most fun. For once, Charlie has clever lines (though he doesn't say much) and a half-interesting story, photography, action, and direction to recover. Charlie has never been more intense or super cool than in this one. Yes, it's exploitation, maybe it promotes stereotypes. Perhaps it is the same story as before, but Bronson's films always have and will always stand to defend the ordinary man and to hear what they want to see. Many argue that the DW series manipulates his audience, my answer is that the movies don't manipulate us, the fans are the ones in charge. We demand that Bronson earn earnings, and Winner and Co deliver the goods. And for those of you who still want to lay down, remember a few things. DW3 was the # 1 movie in America when it came out and was one of the favorite of millions of people on video and television, realizing that not all movies should be emails, they just have to be fun. ********** / 10 You can't get better.
