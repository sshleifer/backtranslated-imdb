Gary Busey played a beautiful job playing rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly (1936-59). He has a spit image for the man. To be a garage band in the 50's is definitely different from today. Having a group of three is usually back in those days. I bet Buddy Holly (Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Ever since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was a quiet village. His parents were Christians, although his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work. This is one of the reasons why he didn't act like Elvis. He held onto his children's roads. It really makes him good! When he went to Tennessee, he saw how bad the producers were. They hated rock-n-roll, which turned Holly away from time to time. Getting used to the different atmosphere was a challenge for Holly and his friends. He went with Sam Cooke, went to the famous Apollo, which the all-African American audience quickly accepted, I liked it! And Sam Cooke made sure that Holly and his group had some service. I call it tolerance. It is sad that he, Ritchie Valens, and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson cut their music career in 1959 shortly after a plane crash. At least their memories will continue in our hearts. I don't know what inaccuracies are in the movie, but I do care that Buddy Holly won over the barriers of music and politics at that time and the music is almost perfect. For Gary Busey he was perfect in the role and made the music as well. God bless you Gary BUSEY! 5 stars!
