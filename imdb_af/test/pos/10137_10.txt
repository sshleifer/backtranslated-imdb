EXCUSE ME!!! HellOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!! CUBA GOODING, Jr. Must have been an Oscar for his portrayal in this movie !!! He was the movie! While the film is missing in some areas, Cuba was awesome ... and for me it's the best role he ever played! The scene in the movie where he found out that his mother died, made me cry in the theater! I think I could really relate to this movie because I grew up with the same treatment of people as it did at my own school ... what a tragedy! Seeing the "right" Radio and coach at the end of the movie was also very special! If you can see this movie and not be moved to tears, you need a heart test! If you like "Simon Birch" and "The Mighty", you'll love "Radio" too! I wish they made more movies like this ... Radio is the Real Deal!
