This movie is a gem! This is the story of Juliette, a complete cleaning lady working in the big corporate office of a yoghurt company, and Romuald, the president of the same. He does not take notice of her, he does not take any notice of anyone until several concurrently turn his company away from him, all of whom are hit simultaneously. He is lost, no one to turn around and no one to trust when he discovers Juliette. As a cleaning lady, no one pays her attention, so they say and do incriminating things to her that she is smart enough to catch and use to help her helpless and careless boss. <br /> <br /> For years I've been watching the DVD of this and to see a previous comment on the release in September 2007, I have hoped. Oh, I can't find a DVD, does anyone know if there is one?
