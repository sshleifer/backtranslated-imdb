I recently saw it at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival. The film's title and in fact much of the sketch of the film is from the Robert Graves poem Beauty in Trouble. Jan Hrebejk leads a script by Petr Jrchovský from a story of Hrebejk and Jrchovský. The story began in 2002, when Prague was hit by one of the devastating 100-year floods that destroyed the household of Marcela (Ana Ceislerová) and Jarda (Roman Luknár) and their two children Cuba (Adam Misik) and Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova). Because of the moderate conditions in which they now live Cuba's asthma, it is life-threatening. Marcela works and Jarda drives a hook from the garage to which they live next door. Jarda's shadow occupation leads him to justice and one of his theft victims is being disregarded in Marcela. Evzen Benes (Josef Abrhám) is a rich businessman who divides his time between Italy and Czech Republic and offers to care for Marcela and her two children. Jana Brejchová is Marcella's mother who, along with her common-law man, Uncle Richie, played by Jirí Schmitzer, probably plays the role of the film. To complete this excellent role, Emília Vasaryova is Jarda's spiritually fragile mother who gives money to the local religious charlatan. There's a lot going on here for a small movie and it's a good story with a good screenplay and lots of comic relief. Ales Brezina offers the music score with additional music from Czech singer Raduza and Irish singer Glen Hansard. There is a lot to keep about this movie and I'll give it a 8.0 out of 10 and recommend it.
