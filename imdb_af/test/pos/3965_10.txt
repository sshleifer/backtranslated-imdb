If I watched this movie when I hit the rock bar, I would probably have sunk into the deepest depression of my life, and might have been almost desperate enough to try it. The only thing is in the right world when you rob millions of dollars Of unsuspecting individuals, everything does not come to roses (unless you are an investment banker or government affiliate), so how does that matter? I was rejected from school to school, and it was ironing, so it is a brilliant subject for a movie. And if you give yourself the imagination to watch this movie without using real world senses, it can really touch someone that situation, and let them know they're not alone. Excessive soliloquy completely breaks out the established education system as we know it. Really, all I can say is that, as I am now in college, I look back to where I was, and look at this movie, I really appreciate it in a way I could never have otherwise. it is youthful and unfair yes, but it is an emotional and constructive fantasy about freedom, and I can't think of a better way to end my night.
