It is a beautiful film that challenges the future of all indigenous peoples, especially nomadic tribesmen. Focus on the Saltmen of Tibet, moving the movie at a pace that may make some Western viewers uncomfortable. For some people, life is still at the same pace as for thousands of years. This film follows a group of tribes on their annual two-month search for salt. Their tribe lives traditionally (slow by modern standards) and always count on their very gods. This is a remarkable film, which preserves a piece of what may be unfortunately history. Well worth the time. Don't be in a hurry if you see it.
