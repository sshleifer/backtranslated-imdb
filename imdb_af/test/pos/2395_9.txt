Eddie Monroe is Hooooot. He's a good actor and I can be his girlfriend anytime. He's so good. I was so sad at the end. I'm not going to ruin the end, but wow. Girls are so dirty. His girlfriend was wrong. If Eddie was my husband, I would never have respect. The people were creepy. The story of the story is Trust No One. Your friends will hurt you if they can. Oh, and Eddie tells your girlfriend that you are moving me, she must ova! I suggest watching the movie. Why? Becasur I said so. It kept my eyes on the screen. My sister loves it too, so I'll see it again, because now my friends want to see it and it's worth seeing twice. Peace, happy new year!
