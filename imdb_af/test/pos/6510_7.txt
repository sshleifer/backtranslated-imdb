All right, I think we all agreed that Michael Jackson was the low point. <br /> <br /> And also the special effects. But, please remember it wasn't a big-budget movie, okay? Not every movie gets as much of a budget as Harry Potter or Star Wars. <br /> <br /> But I thought it was quite funny. B? Nothing that I think would waste it. <br /> <br /> Parodies are always fun to watch, and just because it's not big budget doesn't mean bad. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good movie, if it was poor on some points. <br /> <br /> Hope these comments help. ~ Angela
