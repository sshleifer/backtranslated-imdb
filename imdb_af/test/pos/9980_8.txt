Shia LaBeouf previously impressed me with his acting ability, but I can honestly say I'm looking forward to his next efforts ... his portrayal of Francis Ouimet, a 20-year-old caddy who ignores his father's insistence that golf is not his no place in life and enter the 1913 US Open tournament in his hometown ... the start of the movie goes a bit, but it is necessary to set up the subdog subplot that Shia works so well ... the whole cast is well-chosen and they work very well together in a story that, on the basis of the real event, has ended that everyone can discover before they see the movie ... but even to know that information does not spoil the fun. Josh Flitter is delightful like Eddie Lowery, Francis' caddy, who keeps him on the ground while at the same time a valuable part of Francis's effort. Stephen Delane is excellent as Harry Vardon, the legendary British golfer who is still Francis, is not afraid. .. and who knows the background Francis comes from? as he also had a humble beginning. Bill Paxton takes a formal film and makes it worth it ... bravo mr. Paxton and bravo rolling ... of the images to the story to the people who make it alive, it's a movie to enjoy, enjoy and enjoy ... it's nice to have movies so well can watch ...
