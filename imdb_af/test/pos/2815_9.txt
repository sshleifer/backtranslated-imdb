I have a cable vision and no longer have 'DirecTV'. Such a rural resident I have to wait for DVD release. Of course, to love blondes but not to blame, I don't just have "Barb Wire", but I have "Stripperella: The Complete First Season". I haven't found "VIP" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the "Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding" DVD. I have the edition of "Playboy" that Pamela Denise Anderson positions. I can go on. I love Pamela! There is no one or something that makes me feel guilty about enjoying Stripperella. But there are some elements I don't like, but live together, because other ranges also show smoking and alcohol consumption. But these are my personal peeves and I'm not trying to ruin the fun of a series like this for me. I was also surprised at the change in animation style, but I adjusted. However, the amount of female nudity has diminished, and this is a huge disappointment, as one is expecting it a lot in a range with a starting point like this. But then I adjusted again. One of my favorite episodes of "Mork & Mindy" was when they met Robin Williams! So of course, one of my favorite episodes of "Striperella" is when Pamela and Tommy visit the club and start comparisons! If there really is a season 2, I hope I can find it, because as a complete I have to complete my collection. I recommend it to other admirers of the female form and lovers of blondes. (Hey! Psst! "Blonde" and "blondes" are the female form for the game "blond"! Your software should already know it!)
