After the success of "Muppet Babies" Warner Brothers calved "Tiny Toons". Instead of making Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and the rest of the Looney Tone gang children, they created new animal characters that have children with their own different personalities, but personalities that still reflect their predecessors. The leaders included Buster & Babs Bunny (no relationship, which became their current gag or catch phrase), Plucky Duck, Hampton Pig, Dizzy Devil, Shirley 'the' Wage, Elmira, Montana Max, Furball, Sweety, the rats and different animals from Perfecto Prep, and the original Looney Toons throw themselves. The "Tiny Toons" lived in Acme Acres and attended Acme Looniversity, where the Looney Tone gang worked as teachers who served as mentors for the younger generation and out of the comedy. <br /> <br /> During the show career, several shots were taken at the Bush SR. administration, pop culture, and along with several other gags and spoofs. <br /> <br /> Buster & Babs, probably the show's main characters, mentioned above, were in some ways similar to Bugs Bunny, but they also have their own different personality and comic styles, namely Babs' tendency to anyone and all to personalize, while Buster, who is able to be a great goof himself, usually plays a straight man (or straight rabbit) to Babs's antics. Plucky Duck was a virtual copy of Daffy Duck (not Daffy Daffy but Egomaniac Daffy), with almost as much an ego as Daffy and just as much of an obsession with the uproar of Buster & Babs as Daffy with Bugs' actions but he usually fell. flat on his face in his efforts, but he left quite strange. Hampton was an even more shy version of Porky Pig, and he had the ungrateful job of playing Porky at Plucky's Daffy. Shirley, the blonde duckling gal, was a new age valley girl who went to Plucky in and out of mockery or pity for her feelings. Dizzy was the press version of the Tasmanian devil. Furball was the silent Sylvester and Sweety was the pink Tweetie bird. There was also the purple female skunk looking for a boyfriend and pint-sized versions of Wile Coyote and the Road Runner. Evil is defined as Montana Max, a rich child who was always out to make a goat or make people's lives unhappy. There was also Elmira, a depraved animal lover who feared everyone. And then there was Godo Dodo, a strange thing-a-ma-gig creature who didn't have clearly designated species, except that he was of 'Wacky Land' or something like that. <br /> <br /> Pop culture references include Batman Michael Jackson, Vanilla Ice, Dances With Wolves, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, Supergirl, Fast Food Joints, Ten Commandments, Twilight Zones, Saturday Night Live and even the Simpsons. <br /> <br /> Not only funny but it also managed to get hot and touching, something his successor "Animaniacs" has never achieved. Also followed by "Taz-Mania".
