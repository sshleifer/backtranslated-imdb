I saw the world prize at the Toronto International Film Fest, it's a good movie. Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star as Charles and Emma Darwin in the middle of their struggle by writing and deciding to publish the origin of species. Considering the consequences it can have for their family and the future of man, it is conveyed in such a way that one can only attain a fencing party. <br /> <br /> Jon Amiel (who launches a heart-feel) and John Collee are doing great work to bring Randal Keynes's biography to life. They created some very striking and human moments, great cinematography and sets, and a generous interim aid over the ever-dividing evolution theory. <br /> <br /> The surprise star is Martha West who plays Annie Darwin, the character around whom much of the story unfolds. She plays the preliminary young girl at a tea. If this show goes something to her star, it should increase. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie, and while it's a drama, the problems it's managing today are still alive.
