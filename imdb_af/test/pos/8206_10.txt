Wow! In my opinion, the NET is an excellent, nail-biting, side-by-side techno thriller that will make you feel good. When I first saw it, I felt good for days. When Angela (Sandra Bullock) went to Mexico, I thought to myself, "It's a very nice place to vacation." From the moment Jack (Jermey Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) started hunting her, I thought to myself, "Don't do anything bad to her!" I also took quite a few deep breaths to prevent me from screaming more than I already had. On the bright side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. Finally, I give this excellent, nail-biting, side-by-side techno-thriller four stars.
