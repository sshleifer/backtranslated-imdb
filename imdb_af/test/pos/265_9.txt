A vg Brit rom-com, one to see if you can get your hands on a copy. Quirky and often surprising, it's not the best of Brady's movies (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest), though it does have a unique charm. Well written, the story jumps to a few dead spots, but mostly surfaces with a new plot high. You know from the beginning how it is going to end, but when it comes, it is honest and very open, a realistic and credible end, the end looks like a start, enjoyable and makes me want more.
