It's one of those movies I can watch again and again and not get tired. This is by far one of the best comic strip adjustments ever. I even liked this one more than X men. In fact, this movie is kind of a cross between X men and the matrix and it also came out before. Wesley Snipes does a good job with the character of Blade. He's just not an emotional superhero. Also, this movie is not sugered to get a pg-13 rating. Certainly comics are mostly for kids, but I like a little more in my movies. Let's face it, if we were in these situations, we would get a storm so it would be more realistic. This comic book adaptation also has something that doesn't. A good fight in the end between the bad old and good guy. Let's see it, none of the Batman movies had a very good final.
