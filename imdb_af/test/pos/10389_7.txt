This is the final feature film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, with the help of Wim Wenders, and fits his short story collection "That Bowling Alley on the Tiber". Beyond the Clouds features 4 short stories featuring familiar themes that we've become accustomed to his previous works, and summarizes the themes in vignettes that are interwoven by Wenders's focused screens that include John Malkovich's The Director character. However, most stories look as if there is little or no depth to which we are accustomed to an Antonioni movie, while Malkovich's narrative of presumed depth came up with unclear thickness that sounded a little pretentious and out of place. <br /> <But all four stories seem to be happening at casual encounters, and extremely fast-paced novels that at first sight expressed more like lust, perhaps due to lack of time (because it is short stories anyway) for a more layered approach to accurately define and produce the characters as we know of a typical Antonioni movie. And the obsessive approach here is for the characters to eradicate to show a lack of deeper bond that is sacrificed for the immediate gratification of the flesh. Perhaps this is the point to convey with an observation of the more modern relationship? <br /> <br /> The first story, the story of a love affair that never existed, tells the romance between Silvano (Kim Rossi Stuart) and Carmen (Ines Sastre), who meets when one others ask for directions to a hotel, and later meet at a cafe. It's as if the Fate plays games on them when they meet, but share and meet again much later, but like the games people play, it's almost like an L'Avventura or a La Notte with the lack of communication and the expectations of the man. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich's director plays a central role in the next short, which has a very nice look to a girl working at a shop, played by Sophie Marceau. She was deeply disturbed and made uncomfortable, but somehow got the courage to approach him, and in what I thought to scare him, he told her background that she had killed her father by 12 times. pitch. But in a flash, these two down to bedroom gymnastics. <br /> <br /> The next short, don't look for me is the longest of fate, with Peter Weller playing a cheating man who has to choose between his mistress (Chiara Caselli) or his wife, played by Fanny Ardant. Perhaps the more star-studded fate, with Jean Reno also ending up for a coda, is expanding the small universe in which these short-lived ones exist. Unfortunately, Reno's involvement has also been a bit lazy as it is in the indisputable domain of laser fast-paced romantic developments. There was an important element adapted from L'Eclisse with a kiss between a pair of glass panels, while the introductory story about the soul story was interesting. If there is a negative theme that wants to play this short, it's the double man. <br /> <br /> Between these short and the following was a small scene that reunited our couple from La Notte, Marcello. Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau, where the former is a landscape painter reminiscent of the Red Desert. Eventually we got the final shot This Body of Dirt, with Vincent Perez as a young man going to a girl (Irene Jacob), whom he just met and fell in love with her, just to realize that it was also a love is late. It's a relatively talkative piece, just like the first story, with the characters talking while walking in the streets of the city they are, keeping in mind Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise. <br /> <br /> While Overall, the movie has passed as individual pieces. They never measure right, as a joint effort has given the excuse to link them to a film director's exploration of possible stories and an inspiration for his next film.
