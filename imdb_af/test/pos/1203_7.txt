(May contain coils). I find myself disappointed by the criticism this movie receives. Although definitely not perfect, it is much better than credit. The acting and photography are excellent. Some of the musical numbers are wonderful; including the title number, "Where am I?", "easy to be hard" and "black boys / white boys". While I did not see the stage music, I think it is the judgment of many clouds. It's not the musical you see in theaters. Don't try to compare them. The theatrical musical could be sensational to watch, but it would never have had the same effect on film, such a plot had to be added. And the end that's been added is just amazing. The movie made me feel like I was actually looking at something important, unlike most of today's movies, which only satisfy one level.
