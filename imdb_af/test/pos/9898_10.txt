I just saw "Check Out" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. What a tremendous combination of a heartwarming story and a good role. Director Jeff Hare did an excellent job inviting the audience into the unheard-of but hilarious world of Morris Applebaum and family. Family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy the crazy antiques, but feel the real pain and concern they have for each other. <br /> <br /> Typically I'm not a Peter Falk fan, but he is Morris Applebaum and plays the role with great humor and humanity. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone will see this great movie and enjoy it as I did. <br /> <br /> Hats off to Director, Cast, and Crew for a job well done!
