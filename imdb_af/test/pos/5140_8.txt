I took a group of young people who were the same age as the protagonists and that addressed us all. I agree with the other post, the Wilson man worked an ungrateful manuscript in a great minor character. It's good to have a movie for a certain age demographically (too old for PG, too young for R). It also shows how they think and maneuver in junior high school. You had to love Jimmy Buffet as the cool teacher. He kept our adults awake. The level of child interrogation authority was reasonably kept. Their motives were specific and not like some A.D.D. rebel. The environment and music were beautiful. Overall, if you enjoy Holes, it's really the same.
