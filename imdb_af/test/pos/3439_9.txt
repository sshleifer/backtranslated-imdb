"Jaded" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In less hands it would have made it an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. However, this director succeeded in subtracting a colored multi-layered study with a distinctly different point of view. <br /> <br /> Given the fact that the director / writer is a woman and the chief detective and D.A. is also women, it could have turned into a very anti-male movie. It's not. Being a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this movie is not erotic. The rape is brutal, not sexual. We look at victims and not titillations. <br /> <br /> The gift movements are true. For a film so little known, I was amazed at the quality of the performances. They are good. Carla Gugino and Rya Kihlstedt are incredible. <br /> <br /> Somehow, this movie was lost. Maybe it's too clever for his own good. This is a "must see". Highly recommended. A thinking person's sexual thriller.
