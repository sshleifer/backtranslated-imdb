Jolene (Heather Graham) runs a nightclub in NYC and lives with her husband, Carl (Luke Wilson), a photographer. After about 500 days of marriage, Jolene comes home to get a note from Carl that he needs a little space .... and a bouquet of daisies, her favorite flower. Jo immediately puts the daisies in the blender and press the button. Shortly afterwards she started on a journey to find Carl somewhere from the west, because she was "dedicated" to Carl. But when she finally found him in Texas, Jo came home, hopefully to find clues to leave his decision. She meets a beautiful sculptor neighbor (Goran, can't spell his name!) But Jo discourages her appeal to her. As she learns, Carl can have a new girl, and decides to consult a Mexican-American mystic (Alfonso Arau). Jo is dedicated, but does that mean Carl? It is a very imaginative, fairly humorous look at the promise of marriage. It is strange writing and a horrible style is contagious. Graham is as good as the swollen woman who leaves a hard time. Wilson doesn't give his best performance, but suffices as the mixed man. The rest of the role-play is quite nice, with Goran the wonderful one wonderful as the sexy neighbor. The scenery, both in New York and Texas, is beautiful and the costumes are fresh and fun. If you like romantic comedies and independent movies, this one is made to order for you. It goes to another partner that is the most attractive, but still delivers in the ultimate happy final class.
