As a big fan of horror, I gave up on the vampire subgenre, because the vampire in most vampire flashes became female and non-threatening, benign and basically weak. This was the attitude I watched at Soul's Midnight and I'm happy to say that the vampires in this movie are at least hungry to kill old ladies and sacrifice babies! Armand Assante, one of my favorite actors of all time, was born to play the charming vampire with fierce intensity. <br /> <br /> Another thing that interests me is that the central location is the Borgo Hotel. It's cool because (and I returned to my high school to look it up) in Dracula, the Borgo Pass is where Jonathan Harker must pass to go to Dracula's Castle. <br /> <br /> Finally, take care of anyone who made the decision to make the creature a real effect and not a fine CGI! It's the one thing that's good about many low-budget movies, they can't afford the rubbish bin effects that many Hollywood monstrosity plagues. <br /> <br /> Bottom line ... it's better than the underworld, especially if you're purely a vampire. Cheers, YES
