By his return, John Travolta played a slightly twisted angel in "Michael". He may be a messenger of God, but he is not the most beautiful man, as reporters Andie MacDowell and William Hurt discover. When I first saw this movie, it was before I started looking "Everything in the family" so I didn't recognize Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker. Now that I recognize her so, I try to think that Archie is attacking her to host an angel (who he probably will be next to blacks, Jews, etc.). <br /> <br /> It doesn't really know. related to the movie. But I just like to associate things like that. Anyway, this is a pretty interesting movie. Also starring Bob Hoskins, Teri Garr and Richard Schiff. <br /> <br /> What John and Paul said ...
