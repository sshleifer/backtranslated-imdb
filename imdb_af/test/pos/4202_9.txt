Very good 1939 movie where John Garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he has committed a murder. Trouble is that the murderer and Garfield's girlfriend, Ann Sheridan, are murdered in a short but good performance while trying to evade the police. <br /> <br /> A rogue lawyer convinces Garfield to flee NY He lands in Arizona and meets with Dead End Kids. They were sent there through a funding program to keep them out of trouble. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garfield finds a new love interest, but has to be hidden from identity. He thought he was not just the killer, but was the victim of the car accident. <br /> <br /> May Robson be wonderful as the grandmother type manages the live youth. Claude Rains is also effective in the role of the detective who suspects that Garfield is still alive and pursues him when a photo of him is broken in Arizona. <br /> <br /> The movie really does deal with Garfield's relationship with the boys. While the end is good, you want Garfield to go back to N.Y. to declare his innocence.
