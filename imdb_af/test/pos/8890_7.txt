A nice nasty black comedy about a middle-aged club (Danny DeVito) who wants to bump his mother and make a plan to do it with a bitter divorce, which his ex-wife wants to bump. The film is completely unapologetic in its cynicism, and we give no one to love, but once it works in the movie rather than turning it off. <br /> <br /> Anne Ramsey, as DeVito's battle mother, steals the show in a mostly funny show. Although she is an abomination, you end up ending up with her, as she seems to be able to kick both DeVitos and Crystal's asses simultaneously with both hands tied behind her back. <br /> <br /> Degree: B +
