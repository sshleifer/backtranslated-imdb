What a great movie! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. It is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950s. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fantastic as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the movie is, but at least for the most part accept it is accurate, making the movie more interesting. The music throughout the movie adds the pizazz to this biography. I don't think I will change anything in this movie, it was all good! What a difference in the stars of the 50's to today's music stars. How can you compare someone like Buddy Holly with Justin Timberlake? or any of the other popular singers of this generation?
