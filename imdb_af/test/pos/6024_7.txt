I own this movie and I love Canadian movies, but rent an actress like Rose I don't understand. She is completely useless in this movie just a name that is everything. The rest of the cast is good enough to make this little thriller work. . I was surprised by the plot that wasn't the first time it used it. But those unfamiliar actors did very well, even Jergen, but I'm not a big fan of her, but I enjoyed him in this movie. If you get the chance to see it go for it.
