"2001: A Space Odyssey" was introduced in 2001 and the main character is HAL. Computer. That's right, a computer that speaks and thinks entirely on its own. It was made in 1968 and to think after 2001, it would be conceivable that computers would speak, is a joke. If it were in 3064, a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be just as moronic as this. There is nothing in this movie that causes any kind of emotion. It causes two reactions and one is called sleep. It starts with nothing, but a pitch black shot for over two minutes. Then, the first shot we see, has a kind of lighting, is the "Dawn of Man" series. So, if it is in chronological order, is the blackness before it the birth of the world? <br /> <br /> During "The Dawn of Man" sequence from no where does a large monolith come from? Out of the ground, out of the air, we will never know where it comes from, but for some reason it is there. The apes go Apesh! T as soon as they find this monolith just man could make, but it's the catch? Man has not yet developed. So, who made it and where did it come from? What is its purpose? The monkeys find a tool. The monkeys use bones to fight an opposing group of monkeys. The monkeys with the weapons are now the dominant group because they used their minds to take advantage. The more advanced monkeys, and more importantly smarter and more innovative monkeys, are the predominant group if they took over the waterhole. <br /> <br /> We soon jump into space, millions of years later, where we wander a lot of space ships around to classical music. We can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe and for a film made in 1968 the visual effects are amazing, but obsolete. The score is legendary. The cinematography is spectacular. The editing is horrible. There are numerous shots of boxing quest for spacecraft swinging in outer space, which feels like an infinite amount of time. Once we are on board the ship, there is not much to talk about. For the next hour, Kubrick shows several shots of life in outer space. Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut, who is very boring, and we get the message completely. The indoor and outdoor space houses are bulky and outdated. Remember what the first cell phone looks like? Neither do I, but it looks like the future in 2001. All the characters have clothes and hair styles that looked like in 1968. The chairs are decorated in bright red colors and oddly shaped because we all know that we will be sitting in strange chairs in the future. The computer screens are spectacular and this is of course for HDTV because the brightness is frightening. All the TV sets look like they were from 1968, so it's not as futuristic. Like all movies that are more than 20 years ahead, it looks awful and unconvincing. Just because it's Kubrick, we shouldn't say, "Well, that's how you think it looks." No, I don't want to. Just as I didn't think a computer would have spoken to me in the year 2047. It won't happen and if someone has made a movie now, set 30 years in time and had a talking self-thinking computer, I would laugh at its stupidity. Just as I did with "2001". <br /> <br /> HAL is the liveliest person, shoot ?? I just called him a person. HAL is a computer, but he has more life than any of the muted characters in the movie and he actually thinks he's alive. HAL is the only thing alive and he sees the people as his maintenance men who take care of him while doing all the work. HAL "reads" the lips, one of the few conversations between Dave and Frank, and he "sees" that they plan to shut him down. This is where the only dramatic part of the film goes. A consequent battle between a red light and a man in a spaceship trying to get into the bigger spaceship. Oh, the drama. As soon as HAL thinks he has the upper hand, Dave makes his way back into the spaceship, proving masculinity skill. Dave continues to end HAL. HAL, pleads for his life, because he disappears slowly, which, like everything else, seems to last forever. <br /> <br /> The final act is just as boring as the first two. Again, the monolith found by the Apies appears at the end. It comes from nowhere again. Then a baby is born in a placenta-like shield that looks out of space. What does Kubrick say? Is it about transformation? Dave to a baby? Will man be developing again? Is Kubrick saying this is the end of man and the beginning of? What that stranger is looking for? Maybe I'll go crazy and try to find out what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more I think the more the beginning and the end make sense. There are so many questions unanswered, especially for the purpose of the monolith. If you can make it through the movie, it should be considered. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie struggles to get where it wants. The first act and the third act are strong, but the second act winds around and moves in one place for what looks like eternity. There are some interesting things in the movie that will be a little thought out if you give it a chance. As soon as the beginning of the movie makes sense, the end works much better, even if you don't do what Kubrick tries to say, which I don't.
