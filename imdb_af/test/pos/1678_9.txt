RIFIFI (Jules Dassin - France 1955) <br /> <br /> For me it seems a very risky idea to try a Hollywood remake of Jules Dassin's 1955 classic RIFIFI. Al Pacino plans to release in 2007 and apparently plays the role of Tony le Stephanois. Risky business ... How are you doing? <br /> <br /> Ironically, Dassin was listed in Hollywood and tried his luck in France and made this little masterpiece by some "The Grandma of All Capers and Chicks". In my opinion, it remains a one-of-a-kind classic, beautifully filmed with one of the most memorable endings ever to be put on film. Whatever the film's opinion is. <br /> <br /> In recent years, RIFIFI has been dangerously overwhelmed. However, these French noir classics should not be forgotten. Before the remakes are out there, it will have ammunition to compare the two. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
