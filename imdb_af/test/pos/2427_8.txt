What I find remarkable about this wonderful movie is that Altman, the crazy and wild man he has, took the novel THE COLD DAY IN THE PARK and the Sandy Dennis character was originally a man in the book. He was a sensible, elusive gay who watched his apartment window when he saw the hustler. It's strange that Altman fans are unaware of how smart he has to change the gender of the main character; and thus avoiding the gay-erotic taboos of gay life in the 60's and actually making Dennis' backdrop of madness work even better in the transposition. If you see the movie again, it will be clear how difficult the Altman mind works ...
