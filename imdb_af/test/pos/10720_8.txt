This is probably the best movie depiction of life in a Manhattan agency: the pressure to perform; client and agency claims; the parties; the creativity; the money; the cool surface with powerful corporate undercurrents. <br /> <br /> Pull in Dustin Hoffman's parenting. <br /> <br /> The movie is texture and deep. It follows his internal relationship as he tries to understand and live with what is going on; his relationship with Meryl Streep (and her friend, who becomes his friend), and his relationship with his son. <br /> <br /> While Meryl Streep was great, did she set the record for the least screen time to win an Oscar? She can definitely deliver when she is on.
