In my never-ending quest to see as many quality films as possible in my lifetime, I stumbled across this movie on the cable. I tried Hitchcock three times, and I never felt the man's work led to his praise. I always felt he was good, not good (from what I saw). It was the best of his films I've seen. Robert Walker is completely chilled, his performance takes the movie where Hitchcock wanted it to go. Even an average performance damages the overall product here. My favorite scene was his obsession to get the lighter out of the drain (how exactly does he get his arm from there?) Bruno is a compelling character, but I also loved Patricia Hitchcock's performance as Barbara. The rest of the Morton family as well as Guy were a bit dry and boring, but she added a little flare to the movie, but also some of the better lines in the screenplay. <br /> <br /> Finally, in any suspense movie, you will live and die by your end. This one holds water, unlike some other Hitchcock movies I've seen. I was really uncertain about how it would end, which kept me on the verge while I watched and waited.
