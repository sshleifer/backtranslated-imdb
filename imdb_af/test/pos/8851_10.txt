People with a dislike of gore can run some scenes, but The Thing is by no means just a horror classic. The fact that the extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern CGI is only a small part of why this movie is ultimately regarded as a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in his camera work and editing, excellently written and performed, one of the best openings, one of the finest ends, excitement and paranoia sustained (with many views), an excellent soundtrack and open to multiple readings and analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this movie justice. Absolutely essential viewing.
