This is one of my favorites. Betty White and Leslie Neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy. One is a business executive who revalues ​​life based on the expectation of her death within a year. The other is a playboy who is tired of digging young women and is looking for a relationship with an important adult woman. If you have silver in your hair and / or romance in your heart, aim the popcorn, curl up your honey and prepare yourself for a surprise.
