Simon West's pg-13 thriller about a babysitter who gets disturbing prank calls while sitting at a home is not original or exciting enough to be called a good movie. Although there are some elements of tension, good eye cakes and decent characters, the movie is just one I know what you did last summer, as it's not serious. The performances were good, but nothing special about this movie, I say hitting, unless you are looking for a mediocre movie, sometimes you can find better movies than it at times, okay maybe not lifetime, but at least the USA or whatever, haha. ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
