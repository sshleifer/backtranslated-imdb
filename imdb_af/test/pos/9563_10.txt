I saw the movie recently for the first time. I enjoyed it so much that I went straight out and bought the DVD. This movie is pure genius and just gets funny with every look. Anyone can write jokes or funny dialogue and memorize actors, but the basis of this movie is better! How do they do it? Thanks, Christopher Guest!
