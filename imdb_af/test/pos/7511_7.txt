This movie is funny, funny, funny, my favorite quote from the movie, "I think I saw a half-naked Indian in my room. Last night there was no hallucination. It was an Indian in your room." And the other is about, but what are you talking about hell? But if I am ever admitted to hospital, I will be prepared to write my will on the spot ... I would say there were three very funny characters in this movie in this movie, but three are the funniest to me , although their lines were low. And don't start me on the cartilage patient, the one I also keep secret and stay faster.
