When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, it was a harbinger for most of the film that was public, that he was at the top of his form. From 1946 to 1950, his films were not successful in business offices, and his contractual arrangement with David O. Selznick ended. In fact, during the period he made very good films, such as NOTORIOUS, SPELLBOUND, UNDER CAPRICORN, ROPE, and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. But while NOTING AND SPELLBOUND was hoping, the audiences were turned off by Hitch's attempts to experiment: his use of a dream series by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable, just like the psychiatrist institution. But the experiment with a long built-in ROPE confused the public (the merits of that movie disregarded) and Hitch's willingness to seduce the audience by a lie told by a leading character in a backlash was not kept. deserve to be - in STAGESTRUCK. An issue of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released just as the scandal of his star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) seemed to be a failure (which it wasn't). THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that had very little in its favor. <br /> <br /> With stricter on a train, Hitchcock raced away from the special tricks that interest him in recent movies. Instead, he concentrated on his favorite shared debt and wrong identity themes. Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, the story of how Guy Haines, a professional tennis player, a fan of his - a playboy - met with the athlete on a landline. Bruno speaks and speaks, and Guy sees him as one of the typical supporters he met ... as a little eccentric, with his talk of what he wants to be on the first rocket to outer space. But Bruno knows everything about Guy's personal problems. He is married to a ravenous young woman named Miriam, and is in love with Anne Morton, the daughter of a senator. Bruno knows that Miriam will not separate her successful celebrity. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather, who constantly criticizes him. Then Bruno (kind of the cuff) mentions that he has about two men - technically aliens - exchanging murder for one another and then committing two perfect, insoluble crimes instead of failing them. Guy listens to the idea - and agrees that this is an interesting idea. The train reaches Guy's destination, and his last comment is like a validation of the idea. He just didn't realize that the "eccentric" Bruno is a sociopath, and believes Guy has just agreed to kill the other's enemy! <br /> <br /> It's actually a wonderful simple plot. Bruno, of course, kills Miriam, but he expects Guy to meet the murder agreement and kill his stepfather. Guy is horrible - and worse, he thinks he's the number one suspect of the police. When Bruno, Guy calls, calls, he has the latter's lighter (he tied it to the train) and can plant it on the murder site. Guy finds himself in deeper trouble - how to avoid the police and how to control (if possible) The mad Bruno? <br /> <br /> Hitch has always planned the shots of his movie so we both see our "heroes" from their feet on their way to their fateful train encounter. Continuous cross-contacts are used that are used in the film to show how the two men are drawn in each other's lanes. It's like a lot they pull together. Yet both have their own personality - and Hitch, with a typical twist, actually makes the crazy Bruno more of an attractive figure. His scheme can be dirty (it will kill two people if successful, and he will make Guy the deal, no matter what), but he has a nice life. One suspects that once Guy had one, but his marriage's failure, along with now having a socially prominent woman, made him more careful and dull than he was. <br /> <br /> The throw is also good. Robert Walker probably played his best role in this film (just a year before his death). It was a nuisance from the home-next-door of the time you were away or the clock. His shiny figure also played fairly elegantly in several scenes. As Guy Farley Granger acts as a cousin of his co-murderer in ROPE, especially because the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious of the authorities (as his earlier role has increasingly made suspicious action for Jimmy Stewart). Regarding the ladies, Kasie Rogers is quite sloppy as Miriam - so the audience can be prepared for her demise (shot in a well-known series in the reflection of her glasses) so they actually hear Bruno in his act of evil. Patricia Hitchcock appears as the younger sister of Anne (Ruth Roman), who does not agree with Miriam anywhere and coincides with Bruno at a social event. She plays this rare role well. Ruth Roman is quite supportive of Granger, but her role is limited because she is based on her background, and a little low key. Other supportive artists, Leo G. Caroll as Senator, Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Bruno's dotty mother, and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of Walker violence are all shown to the best advantage - all based on " a master.
