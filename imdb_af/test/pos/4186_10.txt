A very strange, psychedelic, esoteric (and I said strangely?). <br /> <br /> But at least on one level - this did exactly what it was supposed to do. It bridged the gap between the stupid, crafted Hollywood look over teen pop-idols, it was the Monkees TV show and the adult, musically growing and evolving, yet a little stupid Monkeys of the 70's and beyond . <br /> <br /> The most important line in the movie is Mike Nesmith's, "If they think we're plastic, wait until they see how we do it." That the Monkees were tired of all the negative comments about their image and their work is a matter of record. They said it over and over in interviews. They had to make themselves again, and what better way to cover it and hilariously lampoon the machine they created. And at the same time, they commented on our entire society (news, movies, art, everything) and said, "Hey, why do we choose - not all these things were produced at some point." This is the Orwellian "proles" (the Monkees represent the persecuted "allman", even in their silliest in the TV series) and pull off "Big Brother's" pants and kick him in his very earnings shot. <br /> <br /> Love The ideas, loved the music, loved the effects, loved the movie! But then, as Peter Tork says in the movie, "But then why should I speak, because I don't know anything?" :)
