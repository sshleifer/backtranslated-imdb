It's a fantastic movie! If you haven't seen it yet, you should do it well. Certainly, the plot is slow to develop, the special effects are laughing, the scene is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed, but like the wrestler DDP would say; It's not a bad thing .... it's a good thing! Everything about this movie is hilarious, especially if you get the shorter version, which even has worse actors. There are many laughs until you come to the end, craving for the successor, where the mummy fights to wrestle women. So I give it ten stars. Unless you are one of those 'discriminating' and 'smart' people with good taste who only keep high quality movies of the highest quality, I recommend this absolutely monkydellic film!
