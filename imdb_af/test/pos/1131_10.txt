I must say I thought the show Greek would really be ridiculous and stupid. Being part of a sadness, I didn't want them to look like Greek organizations. <br /> <br /> But I think Greek is hilarious. Yes, they have the stereotypical tournaments and fraternity, but it is not ridiculous, but just cute humor. <br /> <br /> All the characters are pretty much less Rebecca Logan (I can't do her), Casey and Rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister. Then there's Cappie. Who doesn't love a guy like Cappie haha. His character brings so much to the show. Rusty's roommate, Dale played by Clark Duke, is also hilarious. <br /> <br /> It is definitely fun to watch seasons for season 2. I can't wait until it's back!
