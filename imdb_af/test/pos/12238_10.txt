Basically an engaging chintzy and moronic $ 1.50 version of the ninety-eight early 80's underground creatures feature favorite "The Boogens," these entertaining schlocky cheapie centers on a nasty, brutal, winding monster that makes a direct meal out of any unfortunate soul, foolish enough to go pussy around the infamous limits of Gold Spike Mine. Your standard edition-greedy assortment of intrepid legs heads - Hectoring, stubborn my boss, cute but indifferent blonde babe, feisty lady geologist, boozy, inexplicable Aussie-accented (!) Seasoned old hand, shameless deaf, hunky, cute, and probably the most annoying character of the uniformly annoying bunch, a naughty particular aspiring writer who is inclined to speak in floral, melodramatic utterances - pulling in the dark, unobstructed cave in search of gold. Obviously, this intense insatiable imbecile discovers that the allegedly abandoned mine is home to a lethal, ugly, multi-tentative beast that in time honors loud B-flick fashion continuing to horrify the group one at a time. Directed, co-authored, co-produced and co-edited with dumbfounding maladroitness by Melanie Anne Phillips, acting with the dismay of platitude by a rank no-name cast, further devastated by hilarious pacing, a drably meandering story, dark, under-illuminated, a chubby, stick-like, stop-motion animated worm-thing that only appeared at the end of the movie, these are extremely clunky, amateurish and therefore very horrible horror horrors all make the necessary bad movie missteps to qualifies as a true four-star stinkeroon.
