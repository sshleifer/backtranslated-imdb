I doubt whether the real story of the Western Union's development would ever have been a true audience. Instead of talking about building the telegraph system from the west, it was the story of boardrooms dominated by one of the most interesting (and disliked) of the great "Robber Barons": Jay Gould. Gould picked up the struggling company and turned it into a communications giant - and part of his attempt to give a national rail system to Vanderbilt's rival. But this, while interesting, is not as exciting as the story of the telegraph lines themselves. At least, that's how audiences will see it. Jay Gould died in 1892. If he lived in the modern era and invested in Hollywood, he would probably have agreed to the review. <br /> <br /> The film deals with how the laying of the telegraph system is compromised. by Indians, fueled by one Jack Slade (Barton MacLane). Slade, a desperado, is not happy with the development of a communications system that will certainly shrink in its ability to evade police in the areas. He is confronted by the man in charge of the laying of telegraph wires, Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), Creighton's co-agent Richard Blake (Robert Young), and a quasi-adv. Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott), who is Slade's brother. Blake, an East-American with little understanding of the West, is Romney Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), but finds it hard to get used to his new environment. But he is becoming a good friend of Shaw, especially trying to confront Slade. <br /> <br /> Slade was a truly Western criminal, incidentally, and the subject of part of Mark Twain's ROUGHING IT. He was hung in the 1870s. But he had no involvement in moving Indians against rail or telegraph companies. MacLane, however, makes him a memorably evil, and completely evil type. Suddenly, his death from one of the main characters is done - and he looks as if he just got rid of a nuisance. But Lang is responsible, as well as other touches. Look at the sequence with Chill Wills, where he is on a telegraph pole restoring it. He spits tobacco juice several times while talking to Young, who gets a little splash. Then there is an Indian attack that we see from the ground level. Eventually Young is suddenly jumped again, but it is not brown, but red that covers him. He looked up at the pole's top, and there were Wills with an Indian arrow through him. <br /> <br /> It's an exciting movie to watch, and worth catching.
