I love a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose made many interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment. Is it possible to achieve peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach it? Can one be a victim of memory that can lead to other victims? Is one responsible for the product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or control the environment? How is a "typical" person or other than Rose? Finally, will the outcome or story change if it comes from another country like France or Italy? I loved that this movie evoked all these questions in my mind while entertaining, stimulating, and guessing! Every time I watched it, I learned more about the movie and myself.
