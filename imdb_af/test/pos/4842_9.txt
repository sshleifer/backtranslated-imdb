Because I was relatively young, I didn't know how bad anti-Semitism was in Brooklyn, where my family originally came from. This movie absolutely shocked me. I saw a lot of movies about prejudice, racism and anti-Semitism, but it became more difficult for me than most. <br /> <br /> It was definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. . I had to travel 45 minutes to see it, and it was worth it. Almost everything about the movie was wonderful. Sometimes it was a bit slow, but it didn't really bother me, because the movie was very atmospheric. It happened in the 40's and it really looked like it was the 40's. The acting was wonderful. William H. Macy was as always wonderful, so was Laura Dern, and I was pleasantly surprised by Meatloaf's performance and played the evil anti-Semitic neighbor. <br /> <br /> 9/10
