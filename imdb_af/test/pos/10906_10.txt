Joan Cusack steals the show! The point of departure is good, the plot line is interesting and the script was OK. A bit too simplistic by that was an issue of a gay man as positive as it is usually not quite as positive. Then it is again fiction. :) All in all an entertaining skirt. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed was the "inside joke" aspect. Since the target audience is probably straight, they may not get the gay "stuff" in context with the story. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline showed a facet of his acting ability that writers sometimes do not consider when proposing Kline for a part. <br /> <br /> This one hit the point.
