It's not a "real" James Cagney vehicle, as its screen time is unusually slim. Frankie Darro plays tough kid Jimmy Smith, the leader of a gang of street people who are sent to reform the school with some of his hoodlum friends. Cagney plays Patsy Gargan, a gang leader himself, who gets a token position as a deputy commissioner. When he first handles the brutal treatment issued at the reform school, he is obliged to make important changes with the help of the Reformation Nurse (Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> HELL's MAYOR is fast and still entertaining over the years. The role-play is well-rounded with: Dudley Digges, Arthur Bryon, Farina Hoskins, G. Pat Collins and Allen Jenkins.
