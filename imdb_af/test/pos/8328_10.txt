It's as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> These are six episodes that have briefly identified life as if dinosaurs controlled the earth. Done in the style of a nature documentary, this show does not do with talking cups, but just gives us the good things with the dinosaurs trying to survive. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it's not a true documentary, because nothing of what we see on the screen can be testified with any certainty, but it is a best guess, and an entertaining one about it. Here's a show that brings dinosaurs to life in a realistic way that doesn't involve eating people. This is a show to be shown to any child who loves dinosaurs, as it will push them into the OH WOW factor to go out and find out more. It will also entertain hell out of them and you. <br /> <br /> See this. If you love animal shows like nature or science or Disney True Life Adventures (except that no one is really killed) or just a great trip to run somewhere else and get yourself a copy. Your brain will thank you.
