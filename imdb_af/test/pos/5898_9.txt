This American masterpiece came as close to perfection as popular artworks, from its beautiful random and suggestive title to the marvelous show that William Wyler of the nonprofessional amputee Harold Russell raised. <br /> <br /> The film illustrated both the dream and the reality of the post-war world? This intimate involvement in the psychological facts of American life has given it an almost universal audience? But, unlike contemporary and preceding "message" pictures, wasn't it a preaching? It showed Americans as they were, presented their problems as they see themselves, and provided only such solutions, partially, temporarily, personally, as they would accept. <br /> <br /> William Wyler, an excellent director, triple winner of the best photo Oscar, adds an air of distinction to melodrama, epic and western ... With his distinctive visual style and taste for solemnity he gained a reputation as a meticulous, serious artist. Wyler's most knowledgeable use of the deep focus reveals the true dedication to emotional content. <br /> <br /> The movie tells the story of three men coming from war to a small middle-American community, and finds it difficult to pick up where they left off. The three heroes are: a middle-aged sergeant (Fredric March), beautiful as the dedicated family man who manages to break the ice with his family; a keen air force captain (Dana Andrews) returning to an unfaithful wife; and a tormented sailor (Harold Russell) who lost both hands in service replaced with brackets in real life. <br /> <br /> Winner of 7 Academy Awards, including the best photo, "The Best Years of Our Life" is eloquent and compassionate, a deep personal film with wordless home screens. <br /> <br /> - The first words of the sergeant's loving wife when he comes home unexpectedly: "I look terrible! It's not fair to break into us." <br /> <br / > - The involuntary sob of the sailor's mother when she first sees her son's mechanical hands. She blurs: "It's nothing!" <br /> <br /> With her dry martini voice, Myrna Loy combines charm with cheerful qualities with mothers; Teresa Wright is beautiful as the sergeant's beautiful daughter who falls in love with the pilot; Virginia Mayo is hard like the unbelieving, flashy blonde woman whose first love is money and high life; and Cathy O'Donnell is wonderful and sensitive as the sailor's fiance ... <br /> <br /> The situations and even some of the characters seem a little obvious, but this is an excellent example of high-quality movie-making in the forties, with smiles and tears spatially and a film that says what is needed on an important topic ...
