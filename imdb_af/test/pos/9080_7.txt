Nostalgia is not always the best reason to watch a movie. More often than not, the movies you love as a child will disappoint you as an adult. Although there are exceptions to this rule, it is difficult to justify having a Krull DVD, regardless of how much the director's comments may be informative. But keep scratching Gen X / Ys, because the dozens of disappointments that dominate your journey across memory avenue can stop you from being worth it. <br /> <br /> One worthwhile movie is Joel Schumacher's Flatliners, the supernatural thriller that starring the 80's popcorn heavyweights, Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts and Billy Baldwin. You would think that a piece made up of this saucepan, Schumacher's flamboyant flair and the shiny eye of the film, Jan De Bont, would lead to something sickly stodgy, but aside calories. Flatliners are not half bad. Although its production design is inexplicably superimposed and photography is painfully overstated (full of neon-softened streets spitting endless substances), Flatliners are still able to be an effective dark and compelling thriller. If there is an explanation why Flatliners were forgotten, it could be because 1990 is the release of another, much better, supernatural thriller: Jacob's Ladder. The release of Flatliners was a year or two after Jacob's Ladder. Probably Schumacher's flashy thriller will be rejected as a well-rounded, commercial shot of Adrian Lyne's nightmare masterpiece. But with these films released in the same year, Flatliners had a different fate, triple JL's action at the box office, though it was a similar presentation. Over time, not as good for Flatliners, but it was lost on a dated hope discarding 80's Brat Pack dragons, while JL emphasized its reputation as a timeless classic. Shots are aside, JL is frighteningly frightening, and guessing audiences to the last frame, while Flatliners become victims of over-simplification and Hollywood amenities that put the final act into a predictable neat unbundling. Comparisons between the two films are unfair, and ultimately look at Flatliners' ability to represent the 80's at its best. Excluded at the end of a decade of flat surplus, Flatliners will always be dated by her hairstyles and clothing styles, but in fairness it should also be remembered as a well-executed movie at (or at least near) the top of his particular hope of liquor. For purposes, this is an entertaining walk down memory lane.
