If it were possible to award a 10+, it would be the one movie I would choose. <br /> <br /> I remember remembering that this movie was captured on TV many years ago - and fortunately enough was prepared for video. Now my video copy is old, the video technology is outdated and I'm starting to worry that I can no longer enjoy the fun of this movie. <br /> <br /> As a wild film, it's great. As a film about the relationship between man and nature, it surpasses anything sifted before or after the past. How can the film industry allow such a classic to go unnoticed and forgotten? If there is something like a lobby / pushbutton to push for the reissue of this movie, pick me up and send me the details pronto. <br /> <br /> My guess is there is a coin to be made by anyone to abandon it in today's market.
