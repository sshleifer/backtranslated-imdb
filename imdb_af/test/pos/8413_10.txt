Then follows directly from the previous episode of the previous series, Yes Minister. <br /> <br /> Jim Hacker now finds himself in 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister of Britain, instead of a cabinet minister and a member of the government. , he now leads her Majesty's government. <br /> <br /> All this follows Sir Humphrey Appleby after the previous Prime Minister resigned at the end of the year. <br /> <br /> Mr. Humphrey Appleby is now head of the Public Service. <br /> <br /> I thought this series was better than the first series, or it wasn't as long as the first series unlucky.
