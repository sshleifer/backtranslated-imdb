This movie comes from Turkey where you can find no tradition of horror movies. At first I was afraid to just look at an adjustment, but after seeing it, I changed my mind. It has the original scenario. A love movie using horror theme. Most of the players are not well-known young people, but their performance proves that a new generation is coming. Perhaps this is a sign that Turkish theater will return after 20 years.
