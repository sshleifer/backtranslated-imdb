Usually Alan Alda plays characters that are too soft and excessive - that's probably how he really lives. This time he adjusts the character. Although he persuades when the verdict is delivered. <br /> <br /> Many of us remember the 1971 Attica prison riot and the state of New York as a frightening event. Only a few journalists told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the abominations and offenses related to the Attica riot. Attica had a huge impact on this country. Perhaps the film will stimulate someone to explore history. <br /> <br /> I can't remember a feature movie made from the prisoners' perspective - though there is a huge PBS piece with the actual Attica survivors / participants. The perspective of the guards being held hostage is being investigated in "Against the Wall" with Kyle MacLachlan, Samuel L. Jackson, Clarence Williams III and Frederic Forrest. <br /> <br /> Back in the day we shouted, "Attica Attica!" It was nice to hear it in the movie. The memory of the memories. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie is the natural wigs Morris Chestnut and the other African Americans have to wear. It would have been easy for these people to grow a 'Fro'.
