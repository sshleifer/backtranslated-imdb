I thought it was a very good TV show and I'd love to see it. It was really interesting at the end and I really want to see where it's going from there. Sometimes we can quickly kill a series without giving it a chance. I think this one has a chance to continue, and I will definitely wait for it. The sea is one of those places where people know so little and I think it's a mystery in itself. What awaits us under the water of the world. It is even said that man crawled out of the water many years ago or flung out of the water. Is this a new evolution? Are we going to move in the food chain or fight for our position?
