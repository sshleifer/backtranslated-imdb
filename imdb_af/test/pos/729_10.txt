It can be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you don't have to throw chop money at a movie to make it good, nor will it make it worth it to watch), but I think it misses the point altogether. . If you expect fast cars, T&A or a movie that spells for you, don't look it up, you'll be disappointed and amazed. <br /> <br /> This movie was thoroughly enjoyable, keeping us on the edge of our seats and really remembered us. Of course, the author puts a lot of thought and research behind this movie and shows it to the end, just remember to keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Note: The school tones were all filmed at McMaster University and most of The rest were done in Toronto.
