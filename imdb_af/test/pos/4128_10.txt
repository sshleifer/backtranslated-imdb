"The Buddy Holly Story" shows the well-known singer's start in the thin Lubbock, Texas, until his rise to stars, until his tragic death in a plane crash. Strengthened by the fact that Gary Busey, as Holly, plays his own instruments, this movie is the biopsy in its purest form. There are a few things that seem a little hackneyed, namely the people of Lubbock who regard rock'n'roll as the devil's music, but the masterful performances outweigh any weaknesses. If there is only one thing that is certain of us in this great big world, Buddy Holly's music will never be celebrated. Whether it's the day, "Peggy Sue," or another of his songs, still sounds the same. He remains one of the greatest singers in history. <br /> <br /> Just to show what Lubbock really thought of their most famous son, they didn't call a street after 37 years after his death! What a bunch of ingots!
