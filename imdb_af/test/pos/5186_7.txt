This is a disaster in London. The start of several hurricane, storm winds and tornadoes in Scotland has been transferred to East, the English coast disappearing and later the South. After a couple of hours of heavy rainfall, the London barrier is overflowing with Thames shortly, and it opens the way to a disaster. Then there is a tremendous tidal wave journey that ruthlessly causes in the East, causing destruction and lives of millions of Londoners. In the middle of the story, a climatologist (Tom Courtenay) is a climatologist trying to save London from the effects of huge waves. He tries to convince the authorities that the dikes were unsafe, and also a marine engineer (Robert Carlyle) and his ex-wife Samantha (Jessalyn Gilsig). Meanwhile, the secret government agency HQ controlled by Nash (Joanne Whalley) under direct orders from Deputy Minister David Suchet to control and kill many displaced persons, about 200,000. They have some time to save London from the total disaster. <br /> <br /> Perfectly acceptable drama disaster with overall acting. Beautiful Tom Courtenay as a climatologist who predicts disaster and excellent Robert Carlyle and Jessalyn Gilsig as an old-time marriage restoration that revives their love. The movie captures impressive flood scenes that came to life through the breathtaking computer generator's special effects, better than the classics of the 70's, such as 'Earthquake, Inferno Towering' and similar to 'Armaguedon and the day after tomorrow'. Although it is not a clear statement, we know that the flood is caused by the greenhouse effect and global warming that comes from the ozone hole. The movie is well directed by Tony Mitchell. I would recommend this movie to people who love disaster movies. Another flood adjustment is the following: "Flood (1976)" led by Earl Bellamy with Robert Culp and Barbara Hershey; 'Hard rain (1998)' led by Mikael Salomon with Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater; 'Flood: a river's rampage (1979)' led by Bruce Pittman with Richard Thomas
