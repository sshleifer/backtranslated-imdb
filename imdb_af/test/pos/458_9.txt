This story, during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, had all the tensions of a good cold war book or film as a multinational group of foreigners attempting to smuggle Jason Robards from Hungary into Austria. However, three things complement the story, making it a very good movie. <br /> <br /> First, the actors use the real languages ​​of their roles. The Russian soldiers speak only Russian; Hungarian only Hungarian; The Germans are only German, except to a minimum to tell the story. Since Debra Kerr is English, she speaks only English, and of course Yul Brynner and a few others who are essential to the story also speak English. As a result, the audience's empathy for travelers is of the utmost importance. The viewer shares all the confusion and tension of being involved in an illegal border crossing when he / she cannot understand the languages ​​they speak. Many powerful feelings are raised in the audience, and despite the heavy use of foreign languages, the audience is never a loss to follow the movie. No captions are needed. <br /> <br /> Second. I was in Hungary in 1995, and I tell you, this movie is right. From the gypsum music overwhelming the meal to the underground huts in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the town styles, realism is incredible. If I didn't eat in the actual restaurant in the movie, I ate at double. I thought I actually walked down the main street in that town. (Actually, the film was shot in Austria). <br /> <br /> Third and most importantly, this film reunites Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner (after the King and I) and the magnetism between them like the story unfolds nothing but Oscar qualified. Of course, Yul has already received an Oscar to play that relationship, so the Acadamy didn't want to give him another again, but that is the quality of the film. Do not miss this one.
