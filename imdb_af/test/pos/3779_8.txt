Chaplin is a doughboy in his final movie of 1918, a doughboy who doesn't manage to march straight. He spends time "out there" in World War I trenches. Several gags come from: Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. The brief quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his friends are flushed out of their pits are highlights. Chaplin ends with the maintenance of several German soldiers with one hand, and he beats the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did this, Chaplin replied that he had surrounded them. Chaplin hides behind enemy lines as a tree of all things, and those scenes are very funny. He escapes to a bombed house where he meets with a French girl who is played by Edna Purviance. He is found by German soldiers, escapes from them again, and Purviance is arrested for helping him. Chaplin is able to draw a fast one by batting a soldier and using the soldier's uniform. Of course, he ends up saving Purviance and capturing the Kaiser in the process. Along the way, Chaplin uses a few eyepieces and slaps to turn the German soldiers back. With this film Chaplin filmed the location possibilities while retaining the attention of the audience for closer to feature-length time, which his contract with the Mutual Film Corporation did not allow him. The film also allowed him to have fun on the enemy, something he would do more in The Great Dictator. *** of 4 stars.
