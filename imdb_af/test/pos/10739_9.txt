Kramer vs Kramer is a movie to hold and not forget. It's not one of the most popular movies ever made and is definitely one of the worst movie films, but it doesn't matter. I thought the movie was well done and made you look more and more. The performances were the best positive for the film and Dustin Hoffman played one of his best roles he ever did as the lonely workaholic who has to care for his son, as his wife separates from him. Billy, who is Hoffman's son, played a good performance with Meryl Streep, playing Billy's depressing mother. Kramer vs Kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect 10, but it does make the movie worthwhile to warn it. Certainly, one of Hoffman's best films he ever did. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Hedeen's Outlook: 9/10 *** + A-
