Altman and Scorsese have been co-generation in one of the largest American films of the past 20 years. Boogie Nights didn't make a big initial splash, and I still don't think it received the credit it deserves. The instant clam around the movie ("Some porn movie with Marky Mark") was completely without merit. What Paul Thomas Anderson created is no less than a beautiful depiction of the pursuit and consequential loss of the American Dream (if that still exists). <br /> <br /> For those in a box (or a confession) for the past 8 years, Boogie Nights tells the literal rise and false story of young Eddie Adams (Wahlberg). Eddie is just a dull child from Torrance, California who wants something more alive. His room was soaked in muscular, naive Americana. His dreams are much larger than his potential, but not quite as big as his ... special gift. His bald-headed southern gent quickly raises the attention and eyebrows of the thriving, omni-present adult film industry. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds as the film's bright-eyed daddy bear) gets the wind from Eddie's hidden talent and decides to put him in a movie. <br /> <br /> Before you can say "deep throat", Eddie changed his name to Dirk Diggler and exposed his massive member to a wide-eyed public. Familiarity and happiness make Dirk's acquaintance, just like a lot of local porn celebs. His friends and co-workers become his former family, but it soon turns out to be a Sunday picnic like no other. Since the feel-good 70s make way for the coke-addled, video-friendly 80s, Dirk & Co. begins a dangerous decline. <br /> <br /> Anderson puts everything he had in this glorious, moving epic. It is sown and never physics. Nary a frame of this monumental picture was wasted, and the characters and their dialogue lived with us long after ELO disappeared from the soundtrack. See this one right away. And then look again. <br /> <br /> And again.
