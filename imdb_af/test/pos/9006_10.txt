For ever strong is one of those sports movies you can actually watch. This reminded me of the Titans because it included comedy, sadness and just rude. I saw it at a front screen and all my friends kept it and easily put it in their top 2 sports movies. The acting is great in the movie. Although it is similar to the Titans remember, there is something very unique about this movie. I feel it is definitely worthy of Oscar and will receive many awards. Everyone should definitely see this movie and it's worth $ 10. I have to see it again when it comes out, because it was so good. I can't say one bad thing about the movie.
