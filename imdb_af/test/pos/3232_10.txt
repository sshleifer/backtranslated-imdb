A movie is beyond all expectations, an excellent insight into the human condition. What drives Mila exactly to paint her ass. What such a person can force so far that there is only one way to escape is to paint the back section that has been repeatedly painted by strangers. <br /> <br /> This movie is not afraid to fall in the face of the donkey paint issue. Simply breathtaking. Role on the sequel or whatever comes from the geniuses that made it.
