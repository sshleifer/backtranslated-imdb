I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. I already knew it was going to be a funny movie, but it was harder than I expected. Certainly, there were some lame jokes, but they cracked me. I thought the actors would be bad, but the actors were good at playing this comedy. I have to give Amanda Bynes a kudos, she looks surprisingly like her brother and a wonderful performance as a boy. As for the other actors, they were funny too. Of course, there were moments where you shouted on the screen: "How can you not tell it?" But that's all part of the fun. In the end, the plot appeared pretty good. There is a happy ending, but what did you expect. <br /> <br /> Overall, just hilarious.
