Campfire Tales (1997) <br /> <br /> An excellent peace of mind. Everything about this movie is just perfect. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good role to play if you can see IMDb. The reason I brought the movie was because Christine was Taylor and the love of horror movies. Let's get the main parts <br /> <br /> 1. There are 4 teens in this movie. After crashing their car, they decided to tell ghostly stories. 2. There are 3 stories and the main plot (the 4 teens are the main plot). 3. The best story is: "people can also leak" in my opinion. the least scary story is possibly "honeymoon" or the 2nd story (can't remember the name "<br /> <br /> 4." people can also leak "about a man pretending to be a 13 year old girl (over the internet) He starts talking to a girl named Amanda and then enters her home, many flu things, this story will make you think twice about talking to someone online. n pervert her home and things go creepy. <br /> <br /> 5. The main plot is sweet and simple, teenagers' accident, telling stories, trying to miss each other, but there is a very cold end to end. <br /> <br /> The only bad part of this movie is that the teens cut their car in another couple, but the kids didn't bother to see if the couple were right. They just talk about the couple they crashed in. <br /> <br /> The men and women who made this movie made people frighten, not to make money, unlike "Scream" and "I w eat what you did last summer, "this movie was created to scare you. "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer there was made to make Big time cash. <br /> <br /> Although this movie wasn't as publicly demanded as shouting, it's still 10 times better than shouting and "I know what you did last summer". <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are great and have realistic features. The characters who play characters are wonderful. Christine Taylor does a fantastic job with Lauren does not go on top of the acting The man Eric (laurel younger brother) also does a good job of showing boys or boys, Screams are like a movie, the killer is a joke and the kids are stupid. <br /> <br /> Unlike screaming and "I know what you did last summer", this movie has realistic people, not a movie of a movie. be noticed.
