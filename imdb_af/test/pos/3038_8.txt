This movie is a piece of time it was made. Realistic. Movies were not sweets during the late 60's and early 70's. The producers didn't try to make a happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending will lead to riots that will hopefully drive them to action. At least that's how it looked at the time. In today's movie world this movie is unlikely to be done. There certainly won't be this end, but realistic. The unfortunate fact is that the film depicts a situation that cannot be improved without doing, by improving the relationship between white southern traditional thinking and the progressive movements of that time.
