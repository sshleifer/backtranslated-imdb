That is a shame. Home calls are not better known. Is it perhaps because the romantic lead is middle-aged, shop-like and gunshot, rather than well-known ten stars? May be. If you are over 35, you will probably get this comedy. If you're over 45, you'll really get this comedy. If you're 25, wait until you're older to see it. <br /> <br /> The unlikely pairing of Matthau and Jackson works exactly because it's so unlikely. There is a wonderful line of Matthau's that summarizes what happens between them: "I like old brothers because you don't have to explain who Ronald Coleman is." (If it's not the exact line, it's close ...) <br /> <br /> The premise of a sub-par hospital that is landed by incompetent is true. Art Carney's portrayal of a senile chief surgeon is absolutely brilliant. It is impossible not to laugh out loud at his delivery. Subplots, if you can call them, are also fun, as between Matthau and Jackson's teenage son. Everything just gets the right tone. <br /> <br /> Well, there's the little bit where Matthau has to wear women's clothing that is a bit at the top and an easy point. But still - this is Walter Matthau in sleep! It's funny!
