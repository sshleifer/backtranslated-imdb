This film is apparently intended for a young, evangelical Christian audience as a teaching tool. For that I give it a 7 out of 10 point vote. It's a decent movie to show a youth group, but I don't think it will be well received. For any other audience, I would rate it much lower. <br /> <br /> The judges who saw it are a wonderful life, but I didn't think about it before they mentioned it. I was more reminded of a "Chick Tract", those little 3 "by 5" gospel comic books. If Jack Chick ever made a movie from one of his draws, it would probably look much like "Second Look". It has a strong Christian message about the power of prayer and the influence each of us has on earth, but it is somewhat hampered by Christian stereotypes. The Christians are all very nice, somewhat passive, and clean, while all non-Christians look bad. <br /> <br /> Muriel, the angel plays a big role, and he is the feeble, cutest character in the movie. He's the most inaccessible angel I've ever seen in any movie, and the biggest negative. I don't know if the directors meant to get his personality so bad or if he'd just hit me like that. (I admit that he reminds me of someone I know.) Then love for a very worldly girl who is not his kind drives the plot in this movie. Why he ever fell for her in the first place is the one question I wanted to answer. <br /> <br /> But the movie shows positive Christian values ​​and your youth group will be entertained if they consider something healthy. with a good lesson.
