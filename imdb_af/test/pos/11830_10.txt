A wealthy young man who is raised as a son of the gods must confront his Chinese heritage while living in a white world. <br /> <br /> Although the premise on which this film is based, is almost a biological impossibility and the Secret of the plot when it is revealed in the film's conclusion, everything that precedes it makes poorly ridiculous. The story still serves proper entertainment and good acting. <br /> <br /> Richard Barthelmess has the title role as the lovely Oriental whose life is extremely complicated because he looks white. Barthelmess holds the scene of his performance seriously and looks intensely in the middle distance (a way he developed during quiet days) when his character is abused illegally. He makes no attempt to repeat his classic performance in D. W. Griffith's BROKEN BLOSSOMS (1919) and that is his credit. Beautiful Constance Bennett is the millionaire's daughter who makes Barthelmess unhappy. She is beautiful as always, but her behavior does not push her to the viewer and her terrible illness in the final line is graciously kept on display. <br /> <br /> Multi-talented Frank Albertson plays a small role as Barthelmess's improvident buddy. Serene E. Alyn Warren and Blustery Anders Randolf plays the different stars' leading stars, while Claude King distinguishes his short appearance as the English writer who befriends Barthelmess. <br /> <br /> Movie mavens will recognize little Dickie Moore, accredit, play Barthelmess as a small child. <br /> <br /> The original Technicolor of the flashback sequence faded into a reddish hue over time. The lap allegedly being South France, instead of Avalon, looks like Santa Catalina Island, off the coast of Southern California.
