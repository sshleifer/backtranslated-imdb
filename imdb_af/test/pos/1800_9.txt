This is good film which in many ways is defective with low production. Martha Coolidge herself said she had only $ 350,000 to work with. It's a movie I loved growing up in the Middle East. I remember friends and I traveled this nostalgia journey ten years ago. Great stuff about this movie .... Great role players with hungry actors and a hungry director. Bad points of this movie .... Too small of a budget that requires too much improvisation. If Martha Coolidge got more money and time on this movie, the results would be even better. They had taken the story of an early 20's prospective and not from a 15-17 year high school standpoint. Most of the actors / actresses were in their early to mid-20s playing 15-17 year olds .... (come on) The music is extremely memorable and the two soundtracks are played all the time in my car. The best plays in this film take place in a healthy Hollywood club by Nicolas Cage's character. I gave this movie a high score of 9/10 for five reasons. Nicholas Cage's improvisation on the spot; The camera work and corners are excellent given the budget they had and can only take one of each scene; The slime, music and lingo are captured perfectly and forever; Again, the music is incredible and brings the story together from scene to scene; And finally ... Martha Coolidge can change a bad script, unknown actors and a very low budget and 20 days to shoot the whole movie in such a good and memorable movie is amazing!
