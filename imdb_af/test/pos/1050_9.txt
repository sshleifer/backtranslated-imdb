It's a beautiful, not-so-like-like-this-kind movie. Well performed by everyone and participated with interesting character players. An intelligent, witty writing performed with the right blend of broad comedy and understated humor. Stop repeated (annual?) Views. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** Reproduction of this movie by the same name, director Arnold What is an unbearable mess - painful to watch - without a scintilla of charm and whiteness of the original.
