Forget Samara / Sadako and Jason ... <br /> <br /> Horror has a new name: GRANNY. The plot is simple but effective. The actors are good (two thumbs for "Michelle" and the killer) and the dialogues are even pretty clever. From start to finish, the action will leave you breathless, you just can't escape. There is blood, terrible murders, funny moments and a feeling of perversion that goes far beyond any rule. "Deja vu"? Certainly not: "Grandma" is not another slideshow, it's actually a classic of its own ... It deserves the success it has and there's even more success in its re-release. Congratulations!
