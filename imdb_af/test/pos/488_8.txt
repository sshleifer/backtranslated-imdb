The real life case of an innocent First Nation head (the Indian) by a Winnipeg city officer (the Cowboy) is the basis of this TV movie. The real thing caused his fair share of racial tension in Canada, a small scale Martin Luther King thing. The misunderstanding of people of the First Nations becomes a staple in the Canadian cinema diet. What makes the movie worth watching is the focus on family responses. The father played by Gordon Tootoosis requires forgiveness and the brother played by Eric Schweig requires justice. The stars Gordon Tootoosis and Adam Beach (WIND TALKERS, SKINWALKERS) have come up little, almost, appearing. The golden star, Eric Schweig, makes his mark in this movie with a powerful display. An honorable mention goes to veteran actor Gary Chalk, who bought more than 100 films. His portrayal of the troubled soul inspector Dowson was worthy of a Gemini award (Canadian Emmy) with Eric Schweig. The special effects (jumping cuts, dream series) are occasional and not offensive. Connect it with a beautiful northern Canadian landscape and recent continuous events involving police officers and first-century people like the Neil Stonechild case, and you have a very rewarding and relevant viewing experience.
