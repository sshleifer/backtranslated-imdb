I caught catch in the rye, this is my favorite book. JD Salinger, the author of the catcher, has the rights to the book and made it so. Not one person can make a movie about it with his permission. <br /> <br /> With this said, "United States of Leland." Beautiful movie with lots of meaning and depth in emotion. but many of them remind me of catching, almost too much has asked me from the catcher. The few stories Leland told in the movie, like a visit to New York and his adventures, were very similar to those of the catcher in the catcher, and the way Leland views people and emotions is also similar to Holden's. , they are all simple and true to them and others. Superior play credited to Don Cheadle and Kevin Spacy. great editing, everyone is perfect together and loved the story all together. recommend as a buy or at least a rental. good movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing it does is drag on some points but make it in the long run. give it time and appreciate a good movie.
