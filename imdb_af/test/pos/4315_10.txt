The show starts with the boat. Desmond I was. Then they tried to save Walt. And Lock's stuff pushing the button is a big joke, and Desmond found out the one who crashed the plane. Eko is trying to open the door that Jhon locked up on him, and Charlie helped him find the bomb. While Sayid and Jack are planning, Sasyid is to find the other one and see who and what the other is. And find out if there are armed weapons. <br /> <br /> Micheal catches Jack, Swayer, Kate and Hugo. And they are caught. <br /> <br /> After the show there were more questions than answers, but that made the show good. And can't wait until season 3
