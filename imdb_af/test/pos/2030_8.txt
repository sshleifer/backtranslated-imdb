Mark Walhberg in a big role, abhor a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs, following him perfectly, and dressing him up. When the opportunity comes for him to take over his "idols" role in the group, he jumps to the event. But the role of a rock star may not be what it crashed ... and relationships can change .... This movie definitely made me the theme of what you achieved, maybe not what you think it is when you do it get. Overall a very good movie with good performances by all the actors as well as the two, Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston. It made me feel sad, especially when Emily, (Jennifer Aniston) met Chris in Seattle and saw the depths of his sinking. If someone ever dreamed of being a rock star or a group, they should see this movie to see that lifestyle, though glamorous for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you want.
