If you want to shoot em up westerns this is a custodian. I thought the movie was nice to watch and see people I haven't seen before. I'm not an expert, but I like the acting. The town and props, etc. It seemed to suit the time and kind of town you would find on the border. It's not Western, not enough people and budget. The costumes and firearms were right for the time! I expect to see the young actors in the movie again. Rachel, Kans, Rebekah and Kirby were great. The SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) members who contributed to this effort were pretty good. Hope to see more.
