* Minor spoilers * <br /> <br /> You know, it comes to the point where Walt Disney Television Animation can be called as well as Walt Disney Sequel Animation. These prosecutions range from excellent ("The Enchanted Christmas" and the fabulous "Lion King II: Simba's Pride") to horrible ("The Return of Jafar"). (This is of course my personal opinion.) Now Disney brings us their latest successor. "Scamp's adventure," and while it's flawed, it's still entertaining. <br /> <br /> The quality of animation is not at stake with Disney Feature Animation; Still, the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life. Lady and Tramp have not matured a day since 1955. Trusty is still talking about his sense of smell and 'Ol Reliable', and Jock still gives him sadness. There is a good fight between Tramp and a big dog in the dog pound, and again we are treated with a spaghetti meal with the two romantic leads (although it is highly doubtful that it will be a classic scene like its predecessor <Br /> <br /> I really don't care about most songs (although Roger Bart and Susan Egan - the singing voices of Scamp and Angel - sing their parts very well). Both Melissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel have done much better work in the past. Danny Troob's score is okay, but nothing less. And some of the junkyard gangs look like excessive luggage; That is, they really don't do much. <br /> <br /> The voice work, on the other hand, is pretty good. While I don't like Jeff Bennett as the dogcatcher, he's very good at Tramp. Chazz Palminteri does a good job as Buster, leader of the junkyard gang, and gives Alyssa Milano what could be her best performance as Angel. Then there's Scamp (who's the spit image of his dad). He is pronounced PERFECTION by Scott Wolf. Wolf has a beautiful work to show Scamp's wild stripe and soft side. <br /> <br /> All in all, while "Scamp's Adventure" is flawed, it still makes for a fun show. However, I hope Walt Disney Television Animation will draw their attention to more original material for their future releases. <br /> <br />
