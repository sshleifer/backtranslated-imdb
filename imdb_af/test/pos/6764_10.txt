This is without a doubt one of the funniest and most entertaining movies I've ever seen. I really enjoyed the characters in the movie. They are all wonderfully bizarre in themselves. This is something I have never seen in any movie. <br /> <br /> The story is almost non-stop from start to finish. There are no boring moments. I'm totally caught by the movie. And I thought the acting was wonderful. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a fun movie. You need to search for The Green Butchers. A great movie. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10
