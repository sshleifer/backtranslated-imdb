I saw this movie for the first time last night. Wow! What a movie! This is the kind of movie you want everyone in the world to see because it's just as cool and so interesting. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give a single word about the plot, because I think it would be better. for people to go in the cold. DO NOT COLLECT THE SUMMARY before you see the movie! All I'm going to say is that Eastwood, Malkovich, Peterson, and Jeff Maguire's script are. I wish all tensioners were more like this one.
