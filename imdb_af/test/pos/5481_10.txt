I really love action / adventure movies and this is one of the best. Of course, we love the stars of this genre, Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest, but that's the story that really counts. The best is somewhat feasible, but we can tolerate those who are a little "on top" as in the cartoon style. The more turning and turning, the more serious situations the heroes are involved in and the more shocking moments in the movie; the more we enjoy action / adventure. "In the line of fire" has ALL the elements needed for a rip-roaring action thriller. It has Clint Eastwood as a retired Secret Service Agent, whose one bad moment of failure gives him. It has one of the worst, despicable, maniacal villains in John Malkovich, the type in which you can't wait to see him, "gets his debt". It has Rene Russo as the "love interest". It has twists and turns, an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor. It is very good by director Wolfgang Petersen and even a score of the great Ennio Morricone. This one is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller! Don't miss it!
