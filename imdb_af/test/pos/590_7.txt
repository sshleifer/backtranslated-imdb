If I consider the movie a little high, you can blame it on sentiment. This is one of the first movies I remember watching and totally loving. I saw it in California in the late 70's. I was already a big fan of "The Muppet Show" on TV, so I was the movie, and the movie didn't disappoint. Basically, it takes the whole absurd ethos of the Muppet show and transports it from vaudeville to a road movie. Kermit the frog is looking for fame; Not because he wants to take champagne baths and drive in a private jet, but because he wants to make millions happy. "Of course. <br /> <br /> Along the way, he catches all his beloved muppet friends, most intimate Fonzie Bear he meets at an ugly bar standing up, singing" Movin Right Along ", a song I always delighted with his exciting melody and his theme of friendship and shared discovery, he also met enough Hollywood movie stars to fill a Stanley Kramer movie, including comedy locations such as Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle and Mel Brooks, Brooks in particular has a bit of a dull bit, and you felt that Henson could cut some of this blanket if he wasn't afraid of breaking the stars anyway, like a road trip movie like that. this is the first person he meets, Dom DeLuise. <br /> <br /> The end is one of the more weird examples of the 4th wall you find in any "children's" movie. Be crumbling all about them when a real rainbow pierces the Hollywood set with its authentic joy and secret. I'm sure it was meant to relate to some of Jim Henson's own personal or spiritual experiences. <br /> <br /> This is the best movie with Muppets by a long shot. If you or someone else wondered why the Muppets were so popular in the 1970s, considering how bad the movies were in the last few decades, I think this movie is at least good enough to give an idea.
