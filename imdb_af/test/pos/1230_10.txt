It's a ghostly short film. Both James Franco and Rachel Miner are delivering actions that are hurt, true and stay with you. Being a tragic story, it's not much of a spoiler. But I wanted to change the outcome, although it is right for the story, because I have already come across these people. I can only think of a few short films that had that effect on me. Beautifully shot, acted, edited. High caliber works everywhere, even to the use of just the right sound and / or music to promote the story. The end credit song completed the work and even more emotions worsened me. It's the first time from start to finish. Kudos to the author / director and everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This is my first review of a movie in the comment section. I promised to do so in exchange for a copy of the DVD. The review can be good or bad, just my honest opinion. That's it and that's the least I can do. I'm so glad I saw it.
