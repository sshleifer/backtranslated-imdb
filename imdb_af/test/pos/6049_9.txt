I watched this movie on TV back in the 60's, and it's still good, even after brilliant performances like a DI by R. Lee Ermey, Lou Gossett and even Frank Sutton (in a comic vein) at Gomer Pyle USMC. I was not employed, but my brother had a recording of a Drill Instructor in the Air Force and it was scary. Others in the family who were Marines told me that Ermey and even Sutton were beautiful in their roles. The only thing in "The D.I" missing. is the language. In 1958 they could not use profanity on film, but Jack Webb got rather damn hard, found it difficult. I think it's his best role ever. In Dragnet he was quite stiff. I will admit, though not as bad as George Raft, but he just used it in "The D. I." to execute. You never forget the funeral for the dead flea! The romantic part was just to stretch the movie, but didn't really interfere with the basic plot. Don Dubbins was pretty good, but he never exceeded this film in his career. Regarding patriotism, Jack Webb was TV's John Wayne. He wears it a bit too far in some Dragnet episodes, but not in "The D. I." After 40 years, I hoped the movie could rise like the "Full Metal Jacket" and others. and it did!
