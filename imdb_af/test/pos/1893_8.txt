I was lucky to catch a midnight screen tonight from this movie. I have to say, I was expecting a horrible cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot. I was completely wrong. This movie was not only incredibly entertaining, but everything I just loved. Bruce Campbell was as amazing as ever. The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi, you know, Sam's little brother. He played the crazy doctor's mate to a great extent. Somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue, he had nothing but shine. But I can't ignore the magic that Bruce Campbell is. Although I thought Ted Raimi stole the show, Bruce did what he did best on the big screen. Somewhere between the rogue American businessman and the tragic victim, he showed the same energy he always showed to be incredibly attractive to audiences. The movie itself was often interrupted by applause from the viewers. The crowd was definitely excited about every turn the movie took. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be Oscar material, but my good, it was wonderful. I would highly recommend it to any Bruce Campbell fan. Also, anyone who loves champion sci-fi movies does a favor and looks at it. Can't wait for it to come out on DVD. <br /> <br /> Take it as you please .... <br /> <br /> - it is powered
