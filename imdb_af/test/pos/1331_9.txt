Film can definitely be a narrative medium, but it is by no means the ideal medium. Literature best carries a plot because the reader can provide the imagination needed to complete the structure. Movie is best appreciated when seen for what it is: a series of images grouped together. What Soderbergh does in Ocean's Twelve, combines impeccable movie-up technique with the free flowing form of American films from the 1970s. Of the recent comments recently posted, most people were expecting a standard edition movie, a la Entrapment. People seem to miss the tiring clich√©s of romance, disguised as tensions between leaders and ridiculous plot twists designed to keep the audience awake. Soderbergh's legal capacity is just to see this movie, but close-ups of Pitt and Zeta-Jones forty feet high on the screen also do not hurt. A real surprise to those who love the flickering lights on the silver screen, and a disappointment to those who are trying to make something, is not.
