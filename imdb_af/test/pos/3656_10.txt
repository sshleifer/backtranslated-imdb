Between flights, extraordinary scenes in a plethora of Indian places and a plot inspired by Bollywood, is still in fact grounded. This highly moving movie is a must see for those who love a good romance / adventure. And by that I mean "good", not a happy and happy ending of Hollywood or Bollywood. East meets West in a different approach to the girlfriend movie. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, enticing and offensive without a trace of schmaltz or inexpensive grinding at heart beats. HARI OM is a lovely movie that will not ruin your teeth. See it!
