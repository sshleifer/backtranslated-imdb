When I saw this movie, the first thing that jumped at me was the scene of Kelly Overton, a young actress I saw for the first time, completely blown me. She is wonderful on the screen and I'm really looking forward to seeing what the future brings to her. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was good in that it made Kelly Overton do, and took the stick for a ride ... not very new tho I had the feeling I had seen it before .. but a good experience :) I would recommend this movie ... just to see Kelly Overton. This stage actuator takes the screen by storm. I give This movie is a 7 ... 5 voice for acting performance and 2 for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> And on a last note .. sorry about my bad english .. if it's gibberish for you: P plz ignore me ...
