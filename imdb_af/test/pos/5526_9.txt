The gimmick, as it was, of this 1934 Paramount comedy, is the six comedy achievers merged into three male and female teams. W. C. Fields and his regular screen partner Alsion Skipworth appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as a small town sheriff and innkeeper. The area seems to have given latitude to its own one-of-a-kind brand of misanthropic, surrealistic comedy in its part, and it works wonderfully, especially where he can do his famous pool table routine, a print that is completely welcome, as it is hilarious. <br /> <br /> At first thought it might seem like a failure to imagine that a movie is being carried by the subtle house committee of Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland next to the broad, John Vaudeville patter of the great male and female comedy team from George Burns and Gracie Allen, but here it works perfectly because of the parts George and Gracie are given in writing. They are there, there are freeloaders who are going to fetch a trip to California on Ruggles and Boland's honeymoon and find consistent ways to annoy them at every step, including, brilliantly, while keeping each one side by side for the best life. /> <br /> Creating Burns and Allen comic irritations for two sympathetic characters seems to be a perfect way to fit their far-reaching, larger-than-day comedy characters into a real-world environment. The Comedy of People Responding They stay in a credible way as much as a gold mine like Gracie's famous naive delivery itself. <br /> <br /> Charlie Ruggles deserves special mention for his performance as the tough banker Pinky Whinney. He is wonderfully subtle and underplayed, and draws from the lines that could not even be heard in other actors' hands. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderful throughout and most of the way it is a perfect comedy of frustration in which we are sympathetic to the poor Whinneys who cannot get a moment alone, and the added bonus is that it frustrates them, is just more premium comedy material from Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> For the pre-code viewers out there, in some of the most amusing scenes there is quite suggestive material, since Whinney is trying to go to George just WHY he and his wife just want to be for " for a while. <br /> <br /> There are some signs of a rushed production here - occasionally jumping, one of the most obvious drops you'll ever see in a movie (upstairs with WC Field's own short "The Golf Specialist"), and the button in Field's tie is constantly changing. It doesn't save me, and they can't bother anyone who enjoys the movie. <br /> <br /> "Six of a Kind" is a real little jewel and one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. If you think you should see it, the answer must be.
