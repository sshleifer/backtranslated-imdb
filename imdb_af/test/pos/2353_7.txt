What makes this one better than most "movie movies" is that it doesn't feel bad. The film is the story of the lead director and his rise and fall and rise, using real recognizable names and events during the quiet and early sounds. Instead of the generic "sound we'll exercise our business", they actually show Jolson and "The Jazz Singer". The play is really pretty good, with credible performances by Don Ameche, Alice Faye and J. Edward Bromberg in particular.
