It's a deep silly humor ... but I loved it. Jean Dujardin is a good actor in this movie. Béénice Béjo is cute. It makes fun of all the secret agents like James Bond: refreshing !!! This is probably the hilarious movie I've ever seen. I've seen it three times and I want to see it again. Buy the DVD as soon as you can. You won't regret it. It's the kind of movie you don't have to have a big scenario because it's a parody. The only fault is that OSS 117 is too short. It's a jewel. It's not really regular to see a French film get success in the US, but I think this one has everything to succeed. Trust me !!!
