I did not read the source, Richard Brooks' novel, The Brick Foxhole. I hope it's not as inflexible as his title, but I understand the original villain was a homophobe, not an anti-Semite. (And honestly, Sam Levene was written as a gay man picking up a drunk soldier.) But okay, you gotta go with the flow. Consider 1947. Not even anti-Semitism is still on the screen. Many of the people responsible for contemporary movies were Jews themselves, but anti-Semitism had been banned for many years because it was considered unpleasant. So we can hardly blame the makers of this film for leaving the victim a homosexual. Now it is VERY unpleasant - and besides, there may have been a lot of hearings by Robert Ryan to get away with it. We are by no means free from bias, but we have come a long way since 1947. <br /> <br /> See it again for the first time in years. I was impressed with the fairly slow pace of the first half of the year. the movie, the many shots of two people talking, the shadows, the time between the question and the answer, the uninspired editing. But I was able to live through the film's subject and because of some other things. <br /> <br /> One of the things that keeps me glued to the events while deliberately unfolding is Robert Ryan's performance. The man does a beautiful job. Sometimes he may seem considerate, cheerful subordinate and helpful to the police: "Any way I can help, sir." Then, alone or with another soldier, the struggling hatred rises on top, not so much by what he says, but the way he LIKES. That shoe, which is pervading, shines that dark eye. Wow. <br /> <br /> The movie has taken a lot of heat because of Robert Young's sermon on his grandfather's murder. It doesn't make me difficult at all, though I think Dmytryk didn't have to put his face in the camera while talking about "MICKS and PAPISTS". Yet, taking into account the context, it is one of the more shocking moments of the film. Part of its impact is due to Young's almost informal delivery of the message, and part of it is because the message has not yet been heard on the screen. <br /> <br /> Another feature of the movie that almost transformed the surrealist is the Paul Kelly character and his relationship with the whore Gloria Grahame. Saint Guacamole, which elliptical conversation Kelly is given. "You know what I told you, all the things I just told you? They're all lies." His character crosses neatly with patrol. It is impossible to know what to do about him. He adds virtually nothing to the plot, but the movie will be much less without its presence. <br /> <br /> It's a moody, dark movie. His people live in the dark. And there is murder on the point. Almost no one screams or shouts. The horror that these men have experienced and that some of them are still carrying malaria seems just below the surface. <br /> <br /> See if you have a chance.
