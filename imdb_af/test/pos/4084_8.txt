I have a All I get is the movie information and the fact that it is based on a real story, and I find it hard to believe that a judge immediately sent his sentence the courtroom would change, even after such a sincere speech by the brother (beautiful John Corbett), but overall the story was very moving, anyway, if anyone knew the true "real story", I would appreciate that you Share!
