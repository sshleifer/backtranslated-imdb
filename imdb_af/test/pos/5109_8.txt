If you only see one Ernest movie in your life, make it one! This is by far the best in the series, with its non-stop laugh and clever humor suitable for all ages. The other "Ernest" flashes were also good, but most people tend to get rid of him quickly (not ME.) <br /> <br /> In this movie Ernest P. Whorrel has been named jury for " a murder case. The killer, Nash, happens just like our bumbling hero Ernest. Mr. Nash finds it a good opportunity to escape prison by eliminating him from liaising with him, and so we see how Ernest responds to the slam. <br /> <br /> A great movie! If you haven't seen it yet, watch it!
