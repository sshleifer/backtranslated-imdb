Channel zapping one night I just caught the beginning of this movie and it chopped me from the beginning. It tells the sad story of an adopted child, Adam, whose mother left him after birth. The film takes us through his childhood, and lets us discover a very disturbing fact from Adam's past. I won't reveal anymore, but it's a very in-depth movie and will surely intrigue you. It was one of Jimmy Smits's best roles in my opinion.
