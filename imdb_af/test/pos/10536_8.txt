I saw this movie at Galway Film Fleadh, this year it won the best short film. I must say I thought the direction was fantastic and the performances of the key members were very memorable. Both of the lead roles are definitely names to watch out for. <br /> <br /> The final shot over the cliff was enchanting and I'd love to find myself there if I waited for the end of the world. The coast was definitely a big payout, with great enthusiasm done! <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the film was shot on film and I heard that the DOP won an award at the Tribeca Film Festival for its work on this movie and I must say .... earned. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who was a teenager in the 1980s. It brought back some good memories and some scarys.
