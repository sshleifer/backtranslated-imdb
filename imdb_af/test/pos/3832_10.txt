It is one of the best of the early "Star Trek" episodes, with Kirk and his team daring to fight with an enemy known by name. Suggest your surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are breeds of Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, played by Paul Comi, is one of those few truly unlikely characters in the Star Trek universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is quite similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion that many Americans have people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin. The atmosphere of war paranoia is too real. Then there's the Romulans: they are the final Federation nemesis. The Klingons are nasty but basically harmless; more of a nuisance than a serious threat. The Romulans, however, mean matters: they are the ancient Romans who were born again in the space age; Despite their Vulcanic characteristics, it is clear that they must remind us of imperial Rome, with names such as Decius and titles such as "eeurogy" and "praetor". The chain posts are really cool. Well-known guest star Mark Lenard, who named Spock's father Sorek, as well as the Klingon commander in "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", is a fitting grizzled, warlike commander, a character that strikes a striking match with Laurence Olivier has Crassus. in "Spartacus." Also, his question about the Empire's unquenchable thirst for conquest reminds me of the similar confusions Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) expressed at the beginning of the "Gladiator". A must have for both Trekkies and sword-and-sandal epic fans.
