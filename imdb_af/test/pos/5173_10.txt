My Santa Lucia Choir was chosen to be in this movie. Already 100 plus. When it came time to film the movie, I asked to choose only 10. Oh my good. We had a little gall that went out earlier to have her tonsils out because she wanted to be in the movie. The choices were hard to make. The people of Georgetown are just as beautiful as the people they show in the movie. Gracious, kind, believers. The town sponsors an annual Christmas market the first two weekend in December each year. I was this year and it was wonderful. The town is beautiful and the people work hard to make it magical. The town appears today as it did when the film was made. Many credit goes to the Historical Society there, which is working hard to maintain its historical value. The principal of the school who was changed into a charter school was awarded by the Colorado Governor for volunteers.
