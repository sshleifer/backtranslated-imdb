Aslan Adam, or Lionman, as it is commonly known by English-speaking audiences, begins with an epic battle as King Solomon and his army defeats a load of guys, although I'm not sure who they were and the movie itself is to help in determining the fact. In any case, after King Solomon slaughtered all these guys, Princess Mary, Bishop Osorio and commander Antoine were obliged to sign a treaty that King Solomon was all about. Shortly after Princess Maria seduces Solomon and they have sex, meanwhile in the shortest wedding ceremony ever (only two sentences long). Antoine welcomes Princess Mary and plans to rebel against Solomon and gain so much revenge in the process. Antoine and his guards attack and kill Solomon, although his pregnant wife, Princess Almunia, with her protector Rostin escaped with Antoine's guards in pursuit of the shortest labor ever (less than 5 minutes or the time it takes forest). Princess Almunia gives birth to a young baby boy hidden in some bushes from Antoine's guards. Unfortunately, when Rostin tries to find the little fella, he finds that the baby was adopted by one of Lion's pride as one of them! Years later and the evil Antoine now governs his subjects without mercy, Princess Maria gave birth and he has a son, but Rostin is also kicking a gang of rebels together to overthrow Antoine. The task looks hopeless unless they can get the help of the legendary Lionman who is more animal than man ... <br /> <br /> This Turkish Greek co-production is directed by Natuk Baytan and Natuch Baitan a kind of movie, I hilariously found it, but at the same time very much entertained. The script never seems to take itself seriously, it is sometimes a funny movie, it moves like a rocket and is never sowing or sowing, and some of the English-baptized dialogue is just hilarious in context with what is happening on the screen . Not one of them makes sense, we get a boy raised by the lion, an evil king, betrayal, dark family secrets, birth marks that shape the lion in an element of the story that was present before the child the lion was raised. battle scenes, torture scenes where the posts people are supposed to link, old castle interiors that randomly contain zip threads and gymnastic circles, idiot bad guys who all seem to have extensive facial hair and a central character with a jaw that looks like a brick, can be stabbed twice, his hands are covered with acid (this acid can be eaten through steel door, but kept in a ceramic leg!) and falls over 20 feet on a concrete floor and does not hold any serious injury not! Aslan Adam is an incredibly entertaining movie, I don't think I've seen another movie, but I can also compare it. If you are looking for something serious, forget about it, but if you are so bad, it's kind of movies and want to have fun, laugh and be entertained then Aslan Adam should be at the very top of your list. Total 100% gold for bad movie fans and those with a taste for different and bizarre. On the disappointing side, Lionman only gets his steel claws 10 minutes before the end. It's a shame. <br /> <br /> Director Bayten definitely does things at a fast pace, but it's far from being made good during the opening battle. One moment, guys on a sand dune stared at a grass height with trees in the background! There is one point where Lionman uses a 'branch' to polish the safe, but of course it is just a long tube with a vine wrapped around it! Then there is the scene when a bloodthirsty pack of blood dogs pursues the Lions, but the dogs used are, of course, different breeds, including the harmless dogs ever! There are just as many individual scenes in Aslan Adam that are just hilarious, stupid, bizarre or all three that I can keep forever. Just look at the end when Lionman jumps and flies everywhere, as he can fly. There is a lot of blood in Aslan Adam, although not much real graphics or violence, a few stabbings and someone has cut off their hands, is as graphic as it gets. <br /> <br /> Technically, Aslan Adam is pretty cally, the period costumes are bright and garish with purples, yellow, red and various other bright colors. The battle scenes are cheap, but at least try the filmmakers to introduce as much action as they can. The music seems to be more suitable for a classic ballet rather than an action movie and is another bizarre aspect for Aslan Adam. The acting was bad, even mentioning that you could tell that the act was bad. <br /> <br /> Aslan Adam is pure gold from start to finish, there are so many things to love, laugh and enjoy in this movie I just ended up enjoying. In no way whatsoever can Aslan Adam be considered a good movie in any sense, but it is one hell of an entertaining one. I may have to look at this one again only to prove to myself that I didn't dream it all! The best Turkish action movie about a man raised by the Lion, you'll ever see. Prove enough enough to play a sequel, Lionman II: The Witchqueen (1979).
