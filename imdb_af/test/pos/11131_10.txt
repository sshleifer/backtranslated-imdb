I really hate musical, because music numbers just start from the sudden and usually spoiled, but this one is completely different - it's simply brilliant. Plot may not be a challenge for viewers, but the simplicity of people's life stories makes this movie good. <br /> <br /> I've seen it already ten times and still I'm not tired of the plot. , characters or music (I just love the soundtrack - this is the only soundtrack I really wanted and will probably be the only one I owe.) For me, this is a must-see type of movie, great characters composed with entertaining songs and lots of things to think about after the movie end.
