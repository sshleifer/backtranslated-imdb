For some perverse reasons known best to themselves, these IMDb boards seem reluctant to acknowledge the great Billy Wilder as co-author on at least two (this and Ninotchka) of his early classics as any buffalo the Wilder hand at work can find. As it does, it represents the first time he joined Charles Brackett (who gets a credit) and it was a good start. One commentator noted how satisfying it was to watch these types of movies in old-fashioned theaters and I couldn't agree. In Paris, one of the smaller revival houses in one of its halls shows a more or less continuous Lubitsch retrospective and I am happy to report that it is played for a very appreciative audience across the age group, although I doubt whether there is actually life was when It was first released in 1938. The well-known Wilder Schtick is especially nice here when environmentally, but cautiously, with Cooper trying to buy half a set of pajamas in a shopping mall on the Riviera and encountering sales resistance until Claudette Colbert points out and agrees to the buy another half. The gag is even more milked when the driver at the store is exhausted. The driver puts a call to the owner, who is in bed and shows that he also wears the top half of the pajamas. The film is full of siggats like this balanced with verbal white that makes it about perfect. Claudette Colbert is just great and gets a lot of support from Edward Everett Horton as her poor, titled father. David Niven in the fourth invoice has some funny things like Franklin Pangborn and if Gary Cooper does not miss his role because he has the verbal skill and sophisticated persona that Wilder scripts at this stage of his career, you can Have Everything and what you have is near perfect.
