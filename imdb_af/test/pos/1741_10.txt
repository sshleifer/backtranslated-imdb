I loved this show. Such talent; and I am so disappointed that it is canceled just after the start. I watched this show all week. And so sorry for the people who hoped to be the One. I'd like to see who would have won. It just started, and I don't think it should be canceled. I hope this young artist has been watched by talent explorers and has the opportunity to reach their goals. I voted and sat and waited for it to come; never knew it was canceled. And I couldn't believe it was. I'm surprised it had low ratings; because in my opinion it was one of the best reality shows on TV.
