Certainly, most people will indicate "Island of the Fishmen" as stupid and trashy hokum, but can you honestly name one other film that presents these many exciting themes? This Italian jewel stands for pure entertainment and contains things like voodoo, volcanic eruptions, mutant fish beings, the mysterious continent of Atlantis, treasure hunting, a remote island full of deaths, and sane scientists! All this and more in a simple movie? Yes please! Coupled opponents of Italian horror cinema can easily mark this movie as an inexpensive exploitation version of "The Island of Dr. Moreau", but the truth is that it is so much more! "Island of the Fishmen" delivers tension and adventure from start to finish with surprisingly convincing special effects and surprisingly stylish camera work. The story begins promisingly with a small group of prisoners, survivors of a shipwreck, which was a tropical island ashore. They meet the sadistic Edmond Rackham who rules over a native tribe ?? and a legion of genetically created amphibious specimens living in the island's marshes. There are so many twists and additional subtotals in the story that it is almost impossible to write a summary, but, believe me, this gem is worth checking out. Sergio Martino again proves that he is an ingenious filmmaker who has the talent to be commercial and creative at the same time. He makes great use of the beautiful island location and also the insides look very impressive. The staggering underwater footage and imaginative scenery make this movie high above the normal standards of 70-year exploitation. I don't quite understand why Roger Corman has recreated the original so much and released it on the American market under a different title ("Screamers") because there are very few elements open for improvement. The role players are all Sergio Martino regulars (with the exception of the great Joseph Cotton is a neat support line) and give good performances. If you can get your hands on the recently restored German version, you are treated to fifteen uncut minutes of extra action. See it!
