Wesley Eure is a young inventor, Brian Foster, who invented a new safety machine in the form of a robot dog, the titular "C.H.O.M.P.S." (This stands for Canine HOMe Protection System). C.H.O.M.P.S., modeled after Brian's true dog Rascal, can do just about anything; He has improved speed, strength, X-ray vision, and the like. It's just the thing to save his boss, Ralph Norton's (Conrad Bain) security company. Of course, a smart rival, Gibbs (Jim Backus) wants the edge so he tries to get his hands on the secret. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing that is just too hard to resist. It has a lot of slapstick (Chuck McCann and Red Knobs play a large number of turbulent idiots), an exciting stance, an enticing role and plenty of fun to entertain. The energetic disco-style music is repetitive but is undeniably exciting; The story is straight, and the dogs themselves are absolutely treasured. In a very strange but partial touch, there is another dog in the movie (called "Monster") whose thoughts we should actually hear; Both his dialogue and the performer who does the vote are priceless. In fact, he even uses a few soft curses and his last words end the movie on a positive gut-boring final note. <br /> <br /> Eure and cute Valerie Bertinelli are very nice young, and their veteran supporting role-players play the material with all the gusto they can collect. Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert Q. Lewis and Regis Toomey are also co-stars. <br /> <br /> A rare scene-living action venture for the Hanna & Barbera cartoon creator ('The Flintstones' 'Scooby-Doo', 'The Smurfs', etc.), 'CHOMPS' is nice silly stuff. I know it left me with a smile on my face. <br /> <br /> 7/10
