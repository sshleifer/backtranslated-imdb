I watched this movie just because I didn't want to leave my 9 yo and her friend in the theater alone. Honestly, I went to enjoy a good nap - but I was captivated by the movie. I would recommend it to anyone who asks! Roy's mother years ago was one of my favorite TV shows ever, playing a Mermaid (Maximum Bob). She was really cute in this movie. The three main characters were all excellent young actors. Also enjoy and watch Jimmy Buffet. The movie itself was pretty beautiful and has some of the things that make Florida so good. I'm glad I finally went to this movie. And to think, I was disappointed that I couldn't take them to "Stick It" - I think it was much better!
