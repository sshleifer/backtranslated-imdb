Seriously, I don't really get why bashing people here. I mean, <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a killer snowman that causes destruction on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd. The good news is that the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the army of the darkness. <br /> <br /> Especially in the second half of the movie, when the little killer attacks snowballs, I laughed my ass. For example, the pit crawls one of the little ones into a blender (a la Gremlins 1) and mixes it. Then it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a loud voice "It was fun!". <br /> <br /> Bottom line - amazing movie, rent it.
