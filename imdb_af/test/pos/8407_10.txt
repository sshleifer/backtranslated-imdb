A letter to the guys. I tried guys, I really tried! I tried so hard not to watch this movie. I would leave the room when it was on or on the computer when the woman looked at it. This is her second favorite movie, the Godfather is first (which I love). <br /> <br /> Eventually I caught small pieces of this movie and eventually after maybe a year I sat and watched with her. I can't believe I say this, but I loved this movie. Dalton plays a big Rhett and has his great bravery. Whalley plays a beautiful Scarlett. Full of fire and sulfur and NIKKS will stop her. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is when she is overseas (Ireland?) and the government is going to break down a farmer's house because they are in the back of the rent. Scarlett gets angry and pays the whole debt and makes a big name for herself around this small town. <br /> <br /> All I'm saying is guys, you might want to try this movie ... especially if you're a fan of Gone with the Wind. It takes a little while to get used to the new actors, but I think you will find them refreshing.
