It's ten times better than "Who wants to be a supermodel" in Bravo. I think it's more true in the business. Tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and can get the most out of every aspiring model. The photos look for depth in each of the models, in personality and beauty, strength and demure qualities, and the ability to endure and work for whatever they want. I enjoy Tyra's personal experience brought in the photos and on the runway. I don't always agree with the judges' decision whether Tyra's comments and at least one of the winners I feel didn't deserve to win. But it's just a show and every girl there is very lucky to have this chance.
