"Thriller" is brilliant. It's a long video but just brilliant. The song itself is ... excellent ... adds Michael JAckson and you have a golden phenomenon. From all the videos I've ever seen, it's the best. If you haven't seen the video yet, I ask you ... <br /> <br /> The special effects are amazing for the time ... everything from the wolf transformation to the idea of ​​this flu zombies slowly getting up from their graves is great ... spookishly grand it is. Vicent Price has its segment of leg-reputed lines ... known as "the rap". Ola Ray does well like Michael's girlfriend, and Michael JAckson herself ... the dance, and sings (although not during the video itself) is unmatched. ... <br /> <br /> 10/10.
