I am surprised that so many viewers have not found all the symbolism in the movie ..... that's what made the movie an incredible artwork! The story deals with some of the heartfelt content that a movie can hold, but it is one of the best movies I've ever seen because of the need for your own imagination and brilliance in the storyline. <br /> <br /> If you pay close attention, the message is there. The younger brother is killed by the stepfather. The older brother made the story about the wagon that deals with the pain of his brother's death. There are those who would argue why he would lie to his own children with his story. For me, the answer is that he does not want to share such ugliness with his own children, or that he has blocked it and replaced his memory of the terrible event with the idea that his brother is moving away safely. I read some of the reviews that believe he was an only child and created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered. Although it is an interesting idea, I love the imagination used to do it. I don't think he would have lied to his own children to have a little brother. But I think he probably lied about his little brother's death. However, I like the idea of ​​an end much better than the idea that the movie had no symbolism. <br /> <br /> There are many different tasks you can have on the movie, but if you watch the movie at face value ..... two brothers who are flying a wagon to avoid an offensive stepfather - you missed the brilliance. The fact that I could see the subtle messages in the script was what made the movie so incredible to me. It requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work ...... dig deep when you see it. You will be amazed at the genius contained in the film. The only other movie I've seen so close to symbolism and subtle messages is Pleasantville ..... but it's a comment for another movie!
