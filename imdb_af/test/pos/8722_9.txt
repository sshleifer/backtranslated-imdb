What an absolutely beautiful movie. The role-play is wonderful, and the story is spiritual and fun. An all around pleasant movie experience. Although the plot is somewhat predictable, it doesn't make the story less enjoyable, in fact, I didn't want it to end. I have always been an Ingrid Bergman fan, and I wanted to see her in a comical role. She didn't let me down, Ingrid Bergman's performance like Ms Dickinson was nice to watch. I loved her interaction with Toni in the music store as well as her dance and do "the dentist". It just proved what I already knew, being one of the best actresses of all time. Goldie Hawn is also nice to watch. Her lovely, soft heart and sweet Toni is the driving force of the movie. You don't even ask why she would be so worried about her Finacee's wife, you just assume she was just that kind of person who wouldn't be happy unless she knew everyone was too. And Walter Matthau is wonderful like Julian. His actions never create a sense of hostility to the viewer, they almost make him thicker. There wasn't an unlikely character in the crowd. This movie has definitely been the test of time, I just watched it last night and I think it's one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. If you're looking for a fun, light-hearted, romantic comedy, look no further.
