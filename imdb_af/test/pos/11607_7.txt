Chokher Bali ?? Play a passion. <br /> <br /> Based on Rabindranath Tagore's novel of the same name, it is a classic story of deception, adultery and relationship exploitation. In the 1900 Bengal, Rituparno Ghosh director transformed the Nobel Prize winners' award-winning literature into a wonderful visual entertainment. <br /> <br /> Tagore's story deals extensively with Bengal society, by its central character, the rebellious widow who wants to live his own life. We are in the picturesque part of Bengal, where we meet our heroine, the beautiful young widow Binodini (Aishwarya Rai). <br /> <br /> Despite her beautiful looks, two beautiful men, the rich Mahindra (Prosenjit Chatterji) and his friend Behari (Toto Roychowdhury), refused to marry her. <br /> <br /> Mahindra chooses a naive Ashalata (Raima Sen) about Binodini and marries her. Leaving behind the land, the generous Binodini accompanies Mahindra's mother to Calcutta as caretaker. Soon her friendship with Ashalata flourishes. The two seem to address each other like "Chokher Bali" (sand in the eyes), sharing a lasting bond. The English-speaking Binodini captures a special place in the house. But soon she was unmasking her real face. Binipini gets closer to Mahindra and meets her sexual desires. <br /> <br /> When she is thrown out by Mahindra's furious mother, Binodini seeks the comfort of an unwilling Behari. The rest of the story shows how the lives of these four characters cross and lead to an unimaginable climax? Aishwarya walks through the role? A manipulative, rebellious lady, still gaining the viewer's sympathy with a ballet dancer's elegance. The other main artists ?? Prosenjit Chatterjee, Raima Sen and Toto Roychowdhury ?? is as brilliant as they work their characters. <br /> <br /> While Tagore wrote this story story during the turn of the 20th century, the idea of ​​widow marriage was a taboo, even among the top class! While the nations' liberation movement is spoken in parallel, the author claims the importance of individual freedom from the chastised life. Kudos to the art director, who gave life to the early 20th century Bengal, and applause to the filmmaker for capturing these sets of paintings. <br /> <br /> This passion game, by Tagore, has been fiercely transformed into the screen of the filmiest filmmaker without losing its originality.
