The first ever synchronized sound story, Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, debuts its screen in particularly entertaining cartoon short "Steamboat Willie". Mickey is a steamer worker under the supervision of Captain Peg Leg Pete (or Pete as he will be mentioned later). Mickey pledges his long companion Minnie Mouse on board the train while they are bleeding, while Mickey tries to impress Minnie. This card was very nice and pleasantly entertaining. Animators Ubbe Iwerks, Rudolph Ising, and Hugh Harman contributed to Walt's creation. "Steamboat Willie" mainly marks the beginning of the success of the Walt Disney Company.
