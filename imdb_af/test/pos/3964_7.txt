When the trailer for Accepted first emerged, many people began to get excited to see it ... very excited. Who can blame them, it looks like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People have accepted a good movie, but thinking about it is not the kind of movie that is meant to be a good movie. It is meant to be a movie that pleases its crowd without too much effort. That being said, for those of you who have expected a good movie, think about what can be made of a comedy like this. Think about it and you'll really enjoy the movie (because you'll get rid of your idea that the movie will be fantastic.) BOTTOM LINE: Watch the movie and enjoy it, but don't look for something pioneering.
