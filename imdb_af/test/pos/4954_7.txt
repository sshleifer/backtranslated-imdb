Maybe I'm biased because the F-16 is my favorite fighter - although the F-14 is probably second or third - but I like this movie. The successors (Iron Eagle II and III) do not measure up to acting and sudden, but the first - along with Top Gun - has excellent flying and music, along with reasonable plots and plays. Clearly, II and III are less of a "flight budget", but their biggest drawback is plot and acting. I suspect the relative fame and popularity of Iron Eagle compared to Top Gun is almost entirely a reflection of Jason Gedrick's popularity and popularity compared to Tom Cruise. Another plus (for me) is a too short appearance by Shawnee Smith. 10/07
