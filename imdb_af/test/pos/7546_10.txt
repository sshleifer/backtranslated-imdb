These comic classics of English schoolgirl antique were and were one of the great art school classics. Then the art house disappears with the advent of videos. And so did the audience for this movie. The loss is not to the art houses or to this large movie. The loss is for those who will never have a real opportunity to see this memorable, fun-filled movie masterpiece. But I preach to the converts I am not. Who else will find this movie?
