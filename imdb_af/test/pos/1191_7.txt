I avoided the movie for some time, but eventually got a copy. Having been born too late to see 'Hair' in its current environment, I have become known for many years with British and Broadway recordings. and saw it on stage in the late 1980s, where it looks a little crunchy, but still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> The movie. This leaves some of the songs (The Bed, My Conviction, Frank Mills) falling and cutting others (Walking in Space). But what is left is indeed very well presented. All the singers and dancers are excellent, and the main artists (especially Beerley, Berger, Beverley D'Angelo and Sheila, John Savage as Claude) are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> As a hippie celebration and anthem, Hair's management stays powerful even in a movie that is being made ten years late. It was no longer the era of peace, love and Biba, but the time of punk rock ... although this film is now in the time of Iraqi problems, it gives a new resonance to the Vietnam issues of the 1960s. /> <br /> Milos Forman, who also made 'Amadeus', has done a good job. In its scope and feel, I remind myself of Norman Jewison's 'Jesus Christ Superstar', especially with the joy of the 'Aquarius' scene and the intimacy of 'Easy to Hard'. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed filming and seeing it as a good idea of ​​a musical born from the first real hedonistic era.
