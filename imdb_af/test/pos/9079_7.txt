Someone I know said there was a movie that was probably on my street. I heard about this movie after watching the final destination 2 and looking at the extra feature about the nearby experience. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD of flat lines at the modest price of 5 pounds. Go home and see it. And I couldn't help but smile and feel good about wondering how this movie wasn't in my life yet. The film is about a group of medical students, and is trying to see how it looks after the death experience. But then, sin comes back into reality and can physically harm it. <br /> <br /> The action of Kevin Bacon and Keifer Sutherland is great as you would expect from the two. And Joel Schmacheur made it a good movie as he did with the lost boys. <br /> <br /> It's a noble and attractive thriller tied to some kind of movie fans.
