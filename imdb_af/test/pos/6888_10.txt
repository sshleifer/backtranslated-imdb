I absolutely love Promised Land. The first episode I saw was while I was on my mission from 2003-2005. I really loved the rich family background portrayed in the show. Here was a family of their own, but instead of living on them; they will reach out with love to others who may have had the same problems in an effort to forget themselves and to go to work. It dropped me on the show. All the actors; especially Gerald McRaney; showed the true meaning of "Family" that left an indelible point on my life. I'm on the same road they have, but it took me time to develop that kind of character. I love this show so much that I wanted to share it with friends; but I was really amazed when I heard it was taken out of the air. I thought and still think they should bring it back! So many lives can benefit from heaven-inspired media. I honestly believe this show is divinely inspired; because it brings the spirit every time I see only one episode. This show really (in my book) really defined what a "Promised Land" is. This is the love you hold in your heart for others; which brings you to a higher destination. The Spirit of Love is one of the strongest messages in this series, and all I can say is: Bring it back. -Robert
