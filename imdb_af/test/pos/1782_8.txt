This is the episode that is probably best related to his partnership, "You Do Not Kill," by directing the controversial issue directly: "Why are we killing people who kill people to show that the murder is wrong is? " This problem is presented in two parts of the episode: before the killing, when the film shows the dichotomy between the idealistic emerging lawyer and the street dog so trapped in his ways that his life is merely a representation of what he is supposed to do do, followed by the period after the trial and before execution, when both are suffering from the deaths, for which they feel responsible and therefore share. <br /> <br /> One of the great things about how these episodes work is in the small and large ways that the story is fully developed, so that we understand both the motivation and history of characters, we can do less than spent an hour. For all his criminal intentions and ridicule, the murderer is still very sympathetic and turns the most important part of his actions into a history of accidental death. His way of killing is more a desire to control death than it actually is to actually destroy. Likewise, the lawyer's idealistic naivety shows reluctance to allow death in a world where he cannot control it. Their meeting is indeed important; they must both give it without multiplying it. <br /> <br /> Aside, it is interesting how much this episode influences the viewing of Rouge, Kieslowski's later completion of the Trois Colors trilogy. One of Kieslowski's greatest influences seems to be the idea of ​​justice, and in view of the fact that the Decalogue is a meditation on something that represents divine righteousness, this one seems almost the most self-conscious. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
