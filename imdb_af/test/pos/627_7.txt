I waited 9 years to watch this movie, simply because I never saw it on television. Eventually I caught it and it was worth waiting for. It's much better than your excessive shouting or last summer of garbage because it's all pretty quick, without pulling out and crawling home to cute music toners. Just the bad dubbing leaves it a little off, but don't leave it in any way. What lies underneath is hyped and crap. Mute witness - low budget, not at all hyped and very good.
