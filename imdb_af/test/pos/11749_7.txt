"Love is a very beautiful thing" is in Hong Kong in 1949-50 and tells the story of the relationship between Mark Elliott, a white American journalist and Han Suyin, a half-Chinese half-European doctor. This story of a mixed-race love affair was a tough theme for the fifties, and as it often did, Hollywood tried to soften the blow by throwing a white actress as the supposedly non-white woman who fell in love on a white man, something that would be regarded as politically wrong today, but was reasonably acceptable then. (For example, think of Ava Gardner's casting in "Show Boat" or Natalie Wood in "West Side Story"). Setting up the story. In a British colony, perhaps it was also a way to investigate racial issues in a way that would cause less controversy in America. Suyin loses her job at a Hong Kong hospital because her British superiors exclude the fact that she is a white man she cannot marry because his estranged wife will not give him a divorce. As was sometimes the case, European colonialism made the dumpling for some of America's own failures. Imagine the furore that would have been unleashed if a similar movie was made about a black or mixed race woman doctor in a hospital in Alabama. <br /> <br /> Besides racial issues, the film also raises questions about international politics, referring to both the Communist seizure of power in China and the outbreak of the Korean War. Han Suyin was a true person and well-known author of the period; In fact, she tended to support Mao's communist regime, but here she was shown to be firmly anti-communist. However, it is not primarily a film about racism or politics, but rather a romance, a good example of what would have been known as a woman's picture at the time. Such films, but mostly by male directors, are mostly aimed at female audiences. They deal with love and romance - often unhappy romance - from the woman's point of view, and have a strong female character. The genre often has roles for actresses older than the heroines of standard romance. Earlier examples were usually in monochrome, but by the fifties they generally used lush, wonderful color like here. <br /> <br /> Although a Chinese or Eurasian actress would be more convincing in the role, Jennifer Jones did a very good job as Suyin. Rather, I found William Holden, as Mark, uncarismatic, but it doesn't matter, Suyin is the dominant figure. She's screened much more than Mark, and the film explores her family and professional life much more than it does. Although Jennifer was still remarkably beautiful, she was in her mid-thirties, rather older than most romantic heroines of films of this period. Holden was about the same age, unusual for the fifties, when a boy-meet girl often means 'older man meets girl'. <br /> <br /> The film is not very deep but is well-made with some attractive photography, especially from Hong Kong itself, reflecting the growing trend in the fifties for shooting at the spot rather than at the studio . Rarely can Hong Kong look so beautiful; The view from a hill overlooking the city takes on a special meaning, as this is where Suyin and Mark go for their romantic missions. The overall state of mind is one of sad, doomed romance, a mood raised by atmospheric photography and the music count, including one of the most memorable movie themes ever written. 10/07
