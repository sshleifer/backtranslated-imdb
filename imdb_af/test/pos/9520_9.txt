Or at least you feel good about this movie. This is the kind of movie that the word "rollicking" really can be applied, although it participates in the completely informal, intelligent and overt way belonging to the French. <br /> <br /> No, Catherine Deneuve does not spend the whole movie high (sorry to disappoint any Puritans with an agenda) .. but the one scene I refer to involves all the members of a wedding party - And it's a musical number! Anyway, everything fits nicely seamlessly, and the unusual, bright, colorful family (Deneuve's mother is a lesbian, Deneuve's bon vivant daughter) alternately entertain and irritate us as true families do .. but since it is a movie is what they usually entertain. br /> <br /> Don't want to say too much about the end, but Deneuve ends with a man twenty years younger. This is completely credible, as we develop the relationship over time, and if the two are drawn closer and closer together. The end is a happy one; and like the rest of the movie, satisfactorily fun as well as peak-perfect.
