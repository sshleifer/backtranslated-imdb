Leno speaks through his punch lines. It spoils the joke, for those who didn't find it. His performance is held for a reason, or two reasons, in a micro-sized studio. The small amount of laughter will be strengthened, and little will see him. Letterman's set is the polar opposite - Ed Sullivan will be proud and the balcony is always full. <br /> <br /> NBC, tough NBC, will never get it. Founder David Sarnoff's megalomanic business is all about the money. At least CBS has a little bit of family ability. <br /> <br /> Leno gathers cars or seals, while Letterman cars are racing. The difference is informative. <br /> <br /> When I talked, I asked other talks to email me if Leno _ever_ said something funny. I never received an email. Letterman has excellent timing. He can also reuse the most ardent joke in such a way that it becomes one of the funniest things in the night's show. <br /> <br /> Letterman built other careers. Paul is now known and respected in his own musical right. Even Paul's other group members get recognition and career boost. Biff Henderson has become a name that America knows. Even the businesses in the same block as the Ed Sullivan theater are boosted. What did Leno ever do for someone else? Personally, I'm glad Dave moved and Leno got the Carson gig. I have never seen NBC performances before and have no reason to do so. <br /> <br /> The Top Ten List is an American icon. So is Letterman. Leno is a caricaturist's dream, nothing more.
