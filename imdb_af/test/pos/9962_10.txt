My guide to the quality of the movie is when I think of it after I leave the theater. I still think of this one that doesn't happen the next day. <br /> <br /> The scenery (a reasonable guess for the Italian 16th century), costumes, lighting, cinematography is excellent. It is a beautiful film visually. <br /> <br /> Characters can never come across the script they should recite, but these actors made the best of their material, which is excellent. It's one of Shakespeare's best plays, which will keep people under the road for 400 years. All the principals were interesting and pleasant. <br /> <br /> Those who say it's anti-Semitic must be deaf and blind. If it is, it is anti-Venetian-16th-century Catholic. While Shylock is playing a man and being tortured by the pain he has suffered, it is clear that the society he lives in is largely to blame. The script clearly puts his personal responsibility wherever it belongs. <br /> <br /> A great movie.
