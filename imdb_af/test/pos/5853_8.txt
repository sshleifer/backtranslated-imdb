I find it hard to believe that this can't happen at all. We don't know if Justin and Richard were upset in the past or committed crimes. The film seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble. So is the first crime they commit, murder? Just to play and play with the police? How do they pick up a girl and just say you are? Also, it seems that Richard strangles the woman with little or no effort or the women don't seem to struggle. Hmmm. This whole concept is really hard to believe. It says we continue. I really hated myself to gate this punk and would have liked me to be present at the police tactical ammunition and see what their plastic packs were doing. What Cassie, who was a victim of Carl Hudson, has a terrible time to survive. The reminder that he was stabbed 17 times by Carl leaves her in an emotional mess. Sandra does an excellent job. She made sure she was one of the evil men. Regarding the solution of the crime, I thought it was wonderful. This movie planted me in my chair. Love the acting of all but Sam. He didn't get up and go. The one thing that this movie didn't need was the love scene or should I say the rape zone.
