For the reason that I love movies like "Central do Brasil" (1998), I really love "Chop Shop". There is no sugar cover, there is no attempt to surrender these people's lives to something more palatable or beautiful. What you see is what you get, and it's often eager and sometimes heartbreaking. But that's exactly what makes a movie like "Chop Shop" so wonderful, along with the fact that the storyline unfolds so elegantly and subtly. For a young brother and sister, who is so close to homelessness that one ever wants to get, working (and living) at a car series recovery in Queens, New York is as good as it gets. Is this a good or bad thing? This is the question that this movie puts to the viewer. This movie is really a fantastic piece of life that sometimes feels like a documentary rather than a drama, and that's a good thing, because it looks and feels so real. In the midst of that, so many current movies are based on essentially surreal and often indescribable plots, which stumble upon "Chop Shop", like finding a jewel.
