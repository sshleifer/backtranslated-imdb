It is a multicolored, informative and bold story about people in the life of a schizophrenic patient, their (and us) perception and realities. Though the main theme of an outrageous young woman revolves, the story thrives with physics, medicine, religion, and even politics, as it sees our perceptions about what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma says beautifully that the world in which Mithi lives is so much like ours. Within the world she is logical and her mind is internally consistent, not the gibberish they look to us in our world. <br /> <br /> Here are some outstanding scenes to watch while watching the movie (don't worry, it's not spoiled). I absolutely loved how Aparna Sen seduced these comments in the story. <br /> <br /> - The references to quantum mechanics and relativity with the witch doctor ("ojha" in Hindi) performing his religious rituals he believes will chase the "ghosts" in Mithi's brain. <br /> <br /> - The doctor prescribes shock treatment as a "belief" solution to work <br /> <br /> - Press perspectives - The scene of Anu's review. <br /> <br /> - The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a "Maya" director. <br /> <br /> - The new footage of George Bush tells the whole world that there is no doubt in his mind that there is WMD in Iraq (now it's not so much about Bush's perception, which I suspect knew the truth as the bodies' perception of WMD in Iraq.) <br /> <br /> One of the best plays in the movie is where Mithi Anu says, "Charu sent this man to beat me" and Anu rejects it as a matter of course. Konkona did a fantastic job and brought out the strange mix of confused thoughts in a schizophrenic brain when her world and the real world clash. <br /> <br /> Aparna Sen was fat but not fat enough to ask one big question: Is almost all humanity cruel to believe in God? She could have prayed some scenes about "normal", "healthy" people and prayed for a being no one ever saw or heard in all human history. The ritual / exorcism scene is not going far enough. That would be the ultimate question: What is normal? Whose reality is right, the Believer or the Atheist says? <br /> <br /> IMHO, this movie is a much more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic thought as a beautiful thought. It looks at the thoughts of not only the sick, but also the healthy, and does so from many different angles and illuminates our understanding of our own thoughts and our world. If the former 4 Oscars have earned it more - At least one each for story, script, direction, Konkona, and Shabana Azmi. It was a real surprise to watch this movie and I'm glad I bought the DVD for my collection. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it was a story.
