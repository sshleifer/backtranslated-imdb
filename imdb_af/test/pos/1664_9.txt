I want to see this as my French teacher has ordered me over forty years ago. Perhaps the long wait is worth it, as the Criterion Collection DVD restoration is impressive. <br /> <br /> In this review, this movie follows the magazine: A quartet of men makes a difficult lift of a bank vault, the witch takes place, a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate downfall of all. Although the facial material switches over, it occurs earlier and is not at the heart of the film. This film separates him from the typical heist movie by giving us insight into the personality of the characters and their motivation - it plays as much as a drama as it excites. Relationships play a huge role and kidnapping is being tackled, and we give two movies for the price of one. <br /> <br /> John Servais plays the idea man Tony le Stephanois (always called "St Stephaneis") with such a worldly fame that he could only go out of a Camus novel. Tony has just been out of prison and resisted to re-enter the life of crime until he has a very unpleasant interaction with his ex-lover (who has taken up with another man) where he punishes him. make a belt physically whip. Fortunately, the scene comes from camera, but you probably won't forget it. After that disillusioning event, as there is little hope of reviving the relationship, Tony meets with two of his old partners in crime, Jo and Mario, and decides to include them in one of the last major lines. They use the services of Cesar, an Italian safe that is played by director Dassin himself. And we're up to date. <br /> <br /> The lift goes off without a gate. But Cesar's birth is a personality trait that is fatal to everyone involved. However, we can understand his appeal to the nightclub singer he has fallen on, as there is a brilliant set where she performs a sexy and cinematic inspiration from the nightclubs. It should be one of the most memorable scenes of any Noir film. br /> It is early established that Tony has a close relationship with Jo and his family; Jo's son refers to him as an uncle. I think it's partly to help Jo's family that Tony agrees. The end-scenes, where Tony saves Jo's kidnapped son's life, partly make his more brutal and amoral actions. But only partially.
