Yes, let's get it out of the way before we start: * This is the one Sean Connery returned in 1983 to the stint we had of Roger Moore. * This is Connery's last movie. * And YES, it's a (kind of) remake of Thunderball, but more of a movie inspired by it. If all your Bond purists out there think I'm going to be controversial, you're right. Bond is one of the biggest movies ever, but that doesn't mean a series has to go on forever. I think this is one of two films where they could have done a great favor and could end the Bond saga. Don't offend? Then I'll continue ... Hey, if you think I'm careless about Bond movie, you're wrong. I grew up with my mother who knew with them. Any extra moment, Bond and his fiancee will be on the TV. Bond rules, and 'Never Say Never Again' (director of Irvin 'Empire Strikes Back' Kershner) are among the best. It should not be 'Goldfinger' or 'From Russia ...' and should not be done by the same production house, since all the others (what I hear, why they refuse to accept, have it ever been made!), But still head and shoulders stand above the recent Brosnan outings ... (if you haven't spat on the screen, read on). CHARACTERIZATION !!!!! Something so many blunt films forget about these days, but something essential to tell a good story. "Never" played a beautiful hand by treating 007 as he has been aging since 'Dr. None. He becomes a little 'and needs to do things like a health farm - a direct order from' M '(!). Yeah, if you haven't seen this movie, I won't give away the plot too much, because A) is taxing and B) It's clear I want to see it for yourself. Connery is not spoken by my 'old bond' revelation, but still gets many beautiful pieces to load, swim, punch, speed, smash and sniff his way through. The man is a legend, and this film is one of his most enjoyable trips as Bond. High tech gadgets in general, some great villains and an excellent supporting role (including a fantastic comedy by Rowan Atkinson) highlight this movie high above audience expectations. <br /> <br /> It could have been the last Bond movie ever, and it would have been a party to remember. Playing the secret agent when someone retires was a refreshing stroke of genius. The last scene turns things right for the series ... But we have more, and more, and still, and another Moore. Still, if you want to find out what "Fatima Blush" is about, get this movie. Then you can at least pretend that 007 spent his last moments as a wisecracking secret agent, in the arms of Kim Basinger, and at Mr. Bean smothered. (P.S. * The other movie I think could have completed it all? The gritty 'License to Kill'
