Let me just say: I love the horror genre to the extent that I see every one I can handle myself (except really low quality b movie horrors I could do without) and recently a huge fan of Eastern horrors . Little did I know that a Korean abomination would be the one that lists my heavyweights like the Japanese Ringu (or the American Ring), or even quality American films such as the sixth sentence and the other, and the famous Hong Kong Horror ' The Eye. <br /> <br /> Formerly 'The Ring' stood as my favorite horror, but it seems to me that I prefer the beauty of 'The Tale of Two Sisters' a day - the story is exceptional and rather open for interpretation, so repetitive views are made possible, although it will be possible to watch it again and again, just because the film was shot so masterfully. The story is probably one of the best in the genre to date. The play is also on top of the whole role and the frightening people when they come have the potential to fight you like anything inside the Ring. I stuck myself on the screen at those points that couldn't take my eyes off. <br /> <br /> However, I am glad it did not come back to haunt me what Sadako / Samara did from the Ring - even though such feelings are unpleasant and the Languages ​​of Two Sisters leave you with an uncomfortable feeling, but one that hopefully will not leave you without sleep, but satisfy you that you have seen something special. But remember. If you do not understand the plot after the first viewing, a repeat view is more than advised. I didn't personally have time for it, because it was late, so I climbed through the screens on the DVD, some times until I had a good synopsis in my head and looked at the internet, I have a lot of it well versed on the widespread interpretation. And satisfying the solution of a mystery like this is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Overall - a masterly crafted horror that is unlikely to produce the same level remake (purchased by Dreamworks) simply because of Korean content and everyone is advised to put it in the theaters or catch on DVDs while they can ... its one of the best you will get. Unfortunately, due to the type of movie, it is impossible to even talk about the story without destroyers, so I do the best I did - look at it without knowing anything except a story of two sisters! "And be prepared for something that probably won't last for some time.
