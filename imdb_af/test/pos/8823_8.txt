Much of my childhood is spent in front of the wireless listening to Round the Horne or Hancock's Half Hour or watching Carry On movies. Probably the best-known line in the comedy "Infamy! Infamy! They've all shamed it!" still let me laugh. <br /> <br /> This is a rare insight into the man behind the comic figure and the whole production is a brilliant mix of tragedy and comedy until the final quote from the dock in four different voices by Michael Sheen. He was brilliant in the role. Most of the other members of the Carry On team were so-so and their Kenneth Horne was very good, but Michael Sheen wore the show and there should be an award for him. <br /> <br /> It left me feeling "wow". To quote Kenneth Williams, to the cynic who says 'life is a joke' can be the only answer: 'Yes, let's make it good.'
