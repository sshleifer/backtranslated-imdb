When I sat in the cinema to see it, I expected to see some kind of stylish in-cheek action movie implied by the trailers. However, it soon became clear that this film was trying more. <br /> <br /> Normally, I don't accept movies that try to entertain in as many ways as possible. For example, this movie tries to mix action with comedy, romance, light-heartedness and eager seriousness at once. Most of the time this kind of approach isn't going to be in movies (just look at Batman Forever), but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were pulling it off. <br /> <br /> The end result is a highly entertaining movie that has to appeal to most adult movies. (But the stomach should really be warned of one or two scenes.) Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller draw a brilliant double act and Ken Stott does an excellent crook. This blend with wonderful costumes and some decent action scenes make for a very enjoyable watch. <br /> <br /> However, the great expectation here for me is that The Gentleman Highwayman was the opportunity for a good dialogue, but the manuscript certainly had a lack of punchiness and there was little stomach laughing. Okay, so the lines weren't terrible, but for me it's a problem with recent British movies. ignoring some notable exceptions the screens written today are still relatively mediocre compared to some of Hollywood's efforts.
