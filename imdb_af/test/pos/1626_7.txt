Not yet read a single Dan Brown book, but I watched all his movie adjustments. I will not fall into the game to evaluate this one with the previous one, because the range is not really the same: in fact, this one is a thrill, a race against time filled with puzzles. <br /> <br /> The plot is very distorted, imaginative and the cast is excellent: I've never been a big fan of Hanks, but he does well. I noticed his jeans shirt (the one jumped with blood), because I'm so in vain looking for one! The Italian search is a brilliant newcomer to me, but I very much welcomed Ewan MacGregor depiction. His inner faith and calm are really impressive. I really like the debate between science and religion. The action taking place in the Vatican felt like vacation. Eventually, I'm not sure it helps to add new converts to Christianity. With all the presence of gold and man showing up, someone will ask what charity means and why women are so fired from church life while standing for half or more believers.
