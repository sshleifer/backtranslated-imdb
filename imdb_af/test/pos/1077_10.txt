I expected a lot from this movie, and I can say I'm not disappointed. First, this movie, as a world tour of winemaking, lets the spectator enjoy beautiful places. The people interviewed are also very interesting and funny, especially Hubert de Montille. The shooting can be confusing, the camera is always unstable and often focuses on secondary elements in the background. You may not like it, but I do not regard it as a defect. <br /> <br /> The themes included in the movie can also be confusing, as globalization is not the only problem being discussed. But Nossiter managed to give his film consistently. A great achievement of this movie is the unveiling of all the characters involved in the wine industry as they really are, and avoid a clich√© 'Good to Evil'. This could be the main difference between "Mondovino" and Michael Moore's documentary programs; Nossiter's view appears in a subtle way, through opinions expressed by his favorite characters. The wealth of this documentary rests mainly on the characters, the history of the long wine making families, such as De Montilles, Mondavis, Antinori and Frescobaldi. Nossiter tells the viewer that wine is somehow related to families, rather than merely being a business and industry. This movie doesn't mean you want to drink wine, but make sure you want to discover vineyards and winemakers. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie as a student in Enology, and just let there be many ways. to learn. I give this documentary 10 out of 10, despite its technical details.
