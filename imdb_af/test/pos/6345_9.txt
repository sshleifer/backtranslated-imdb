Let's start saying that there is no bigger fan of the original "Lonesome Dove" than I am. Both the Pulitzer Prize-winning book and the towering mini-series adapted from it are in my experience as stand-alone, dramatic, credible and intricate works. There is no comparison between "Lonesome Dove" and any Western movie - at least not since the legendary joining of John Ford and John Wayne. It was with real reservations that I sat down to see this new mini-series, which included McMurtry's non-participation, and the missing original members. After watching the first episode, it was clear that it was not a lonely pigeon. In almost every measurable way, this successor falls short of the original. But what? I didn't expect to measure it. This film is used as an effort, it is engaging, entertaining and of a very good quality. If it's done as a new story, not as a sequel to 'Lonesome Dove', there's no doubt it wouldn't receive so many negative ratings. Jon Voight has a deserving job as Call, Barbara Hershey was a terrific Clara, and new characters such as Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well-rendered and credible. Louis Gossett jr. deserve special mention as the horse wrangler Isom Pickett. The movie cares for the characters, and I don't ask an actor anymore. It is a pity that this worthy effort is in the shadow of his predecessor - it is worth looking into his own right.
