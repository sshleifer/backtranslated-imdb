The Late Shift is a great book, I read the book a few years ago, and I was caught up in the jaw that acted as Johnny Carson retired and Jay Leno and Johnny Carson tried to find their place. When the movie came out, I hung a VHS copy of the movie, and I recently read the book. It's hard to say what I enjoy more, because they are fairly similar to the amount of information being transmitted. The two starring actors, John Michael Higgins, and Daniel Roebuck, two actors I have never heard before, have never heard of Leno and Letterman convincingly, despite Letterman's dismissal of his depiction as poor. They play the parts well, despite many people imitating the two. I wasn't that interested. The story is what counts. And that brings me to Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates, playing Helen Kushnick, is this movie. She plays this evil bitch of a character, so menacing, you realize how on earth this woman can control herself, much less a national TV program. Yikes! There must be a sequel !!
