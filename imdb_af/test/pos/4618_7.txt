Awarded at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, it is becoming well-known and seems to be another modern and profound drama. <br /> <br /> It's about a lot of adolescents coming to school through a revealing and desperate day. Everything circled around a suicide - already shown to the beginning - happening at 2:37 am. The characters are somehow interconnected. What moves them is described through short maintenance sequences, strictly shot in b / w. The characters are well written, the play is intriguing (especially Teresa Palmer as Melody and Frank Sweet as Marcus discoveries are). <br /> <br /> Let's stick to the movie's technique. It really impressed me. There are rarely any cuts, most of the time the camera follows one of the lead actors as in Gus of Sants's Elephant. Some scenes are presented more than once, but each time from a different point of view (here: character). It certainly calls for a slowly developing, but grabbing atmosphere that will literally drag you into you. The colors are vibrant, somehow incompetent to consider the difficult plot - but it's nothing less than a clever contrast, a disturbing 'everything is good thing'. The use of lighting is always adequate, underlining the characters' actual mood. And lastly, there are decent music posts. <br /> <br /> 2:37 somehow you're beating from the beginning. It does not hamper or serve as a laugh. It tightens together what psychologists would define as terror moments. This movie focuses mainly on emotional deposits. There is no one who does not have to deal with a kind of neurosis, even the distracted small parts (eg the teachers) seem to be in some disorder. And that's what keeps this movie out really good. The summary of piercing tragedies is unrealistic for his many legs. There is no: friendship, love, smile, truth, passion. There are: faking, humiliation, despair, illness and beating. It's as if you've been hit in the face all the time, but you're numb after the first hour. This movie continues to hit you until it eventually reveals something rather learner. <br /> <br /> To act sensitively and beautifully: 9. To be technically innovative and original: 9. To be unidimensional: 3. <br /> <br /> Make a solid 7 out of 10 .
