I caught it as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; a perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent but simple animation, it's just a story of a potato. cat chasing the moon. Funny, beautiful, and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics and anyone else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it. This one is worth the price of admission.
