"Americans Next Top Model" is the best reality show! I was 99.9 percent of the time to see it. I opened my eyes all the time. (Well, I shone) It can be sad, funny or addictive. (mostly addictive) "America's next top model" wanted me more and that's almost the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit! It's good for pretty much all ages so everyone can enjoy it! :) <br /> <br /> Also, if you watched the preview before, didn't you notice that Tyra has a different hairstyle every time in the review room? She will have it one week short and curly, and then long and straight next.
