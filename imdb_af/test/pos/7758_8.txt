At first sight it is another high school anime with many excuses for 'fan service', but there is much more going on. The "fanservice" is part of the plot, the main character is a tired cynic (unusual), and above all there is a clever plot that connects all the episodes, and it raises interesting questions. The episodes are deliberately non-chronological, and it is definitely worth looking at the series again in chronological order. <br /> <br /> The series is worth checking out, as there are many accidental hints that explain and explain things, plus a good number of jokes about other series, anime and others.
