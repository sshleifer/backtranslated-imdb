I did a bit of bravery tonight when I watched this movie. I tried to disobey myself from silent movies. Certainly, when this movie was originally distributed, there was probably a piano score played. Often, the director himself will choose the score (Charlie Chaplin often compiled the scores of his later silent films). But most of the music you hear on VHS tapes about silent movies is by no means the same music that was supposed to be played when the first movie was released. And then there were still many silent movies played without a score. I don't know the history of Potemkin's score, so I decided to look for the medium that this piece of art inner film was made. <br /> <br /> Shortly after I turned off the music, I (or would I unobstructedly) support the music creation of the screen emotions, I completely attached to the movie. Visually, it is easily one of the most beautiful of all movies. Eisenstein was a master of composition. The editing, possibly the movie technique Eisenstein is the best known for (montage), is extraordinary. The mood of this film is rage, and it has stirred my passions violently. <br /> <br /> Enjoying a quiet movie, especially a drama, takes a lot of effort, but movies like Battleship Potemkin prove that this effort is worthwhile. Come on! You owe it to yourself to watch this movie! Your training is incomplete without it.
