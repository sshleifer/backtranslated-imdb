Another piece of darkness and denial beneath the surface of the American suburbs, Imaginary Heroes depicts the lives of the Travis family, all of whom regain the suicide of their eldest son. <br /> <br /> The pair in the middle of the film are mother and son Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) and Tim (Emile Hirsch), both acting in different ways due to death. While Tim is experimenting with prescription medication and his own sexuality, Sandy regains her former self, smoking marijuana and comes in terms of an old act of infidelity. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sandy and Tim is well explored, especially when referring to both of them wiped out of their own family: Sandy because of her relationship and Tim, initially because of always in the shade of his more successful older brother. There is considerably less time for Sandy's husband, Ben (Jeff Daniels), who in a devastating depiction of denial instructs Sandy to make an additional plate of food for his dead son and put it in his old place at the table. Michelle Williams's older sister Penny is endorsed and can easily be taken out of the movie. <br /> <br /> Despite its long time, Imaginary Heroes explores its many subplots as much as the individual stories deserve, while some of the movie's black comedy translates not only so, but also author / director who Dan Harris liked. And the depiction of a disturbed family dynamics is not as strongly depicted as the many other films out there with similar ideas. But despite some problems, the central performances of Weaver and Hirsch are stunning, and the movie easily contributes to its successful conclusion. <br /> <br /> Rating: B-
