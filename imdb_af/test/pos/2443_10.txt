Yes, great cult TV series. Great atmosphere, top script and good performances make it a class A candidate for DVD release. <br /> <br /> This is an original tour of Australian TV history and has that memorable groovy period piece of soundtrack with Doug Parkinson's gravel and bad voice spitting 70's Australiana over your cathode ray box as a amazingly long camera look. reveal the religion of the open road in all its antipode glory. It is a reminder of another and not too distant and has the proud stamp of the country, the mighty Down Under, from beginning to end in all its raw freedom and eager grandeur. <br /> <br /> Come on ABC! Get to the program and leave this cool 70's cult baby so everyone can enjoy - or enjoy if you were lucky enough to attend the dream.
