This new movie by Jeskid is great! Check it out and you'll be surprised. The story of Emily Waters, once a broken home girl, whose only way to escape an abused father, was through her sketchbook. Until one night her drawings revealed in reality and saved her, and with that power she used her against those who would do evil. Both live action movie and hand-drawn animation blend to create a unique and original experience that will shake your soul and blow you away. The music is also incredible, it really puts the emotional experience and deepens you into the conflict. Directed by Jesse Cowell and animated by Erica Langworthy, starring the beautiful Marissa Parness, featuring music by Nico Audy-Rowland, Daniel Collins, Jeff Strathearn, Matt Sisco and Selcuk Bor. Support this movie and support Jeskid, he is a very talented man. Also check out his film Shades of Gray.
