if you didn't see Vijay in "Ghillli", "Gilly" or "Ghillie". go look. Wow. she is devastatingly hilarious. I don't know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was serious or not. There are many hot guys in this one, looking out for someone called Velu "Maacha". The one with the brilliant stains, devastatingly hot. His teeth are also brilliant. Vijay rocks. Trisha cries every 5 seconds. It's very deep. Look, you won't regret it. There is some big laugh in this one. If you don't speak Tamil, learn it. Then you get all the inside jokes. This is one for the whole family, except perhaps the violent bits should be skipped. I saw this movie eleven times .... and count. <br /> <br /> Wow!
