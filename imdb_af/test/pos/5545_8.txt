It is a fun movie with subtle intent. His off-beat comedy is hilarious to me, unfunny to my friends. The soundtrack is perfect. <br /> <br /> I own it on VHS and I've watched it many, many times, because it's simply a fun and love story with good performances by all the principals (although Joan Cusack is only used as a it was a waste of her talent for big hair, I know, I know, she was still young ...). <br /> <br /> With a sad note, I decided to watch the DVD. (instead of watching my VHS tape), and was shocked to cut many important scenes. And on the copy I watched, there was no special feature of deleted scenes: it was as if the deleted scenes never existed !! I am so glad I bought the used VHS at a flea market. <br /> <br /> Obviously there was a lot of choreography in it, and that's another reason I love it so much. It takes great skill, talent and genius to move from stage to stage around the scenes like Mercedes Ruehl, Dean Stockwell and Matthew Modine. (Note the scene when the grocery stores converge, the role on the floor during the shootings in Miami, the Chick Lickin debacle, the foot massage, the salon hair was.) There is a very theatrical feeling for this movie, the turnaround be for so many whose poor reviews follow: i know some viewers who do not understand this style, the exaggerated and exaggerated performances for the poor scene and the worse direction. Not so. Jonathan Demme is doing a great job creating the entire company and their respective roles. <br /> <br /> The opening credits and first stage ranking among my everyday favorites as well as another favorite opening credit / first scene: Fly away home). <br /> <br /> Perhaps Matthew Modine skipped the public eye so fiercely; I really like him and find his decisive PERFECT in the role of Mike Smith. Actually, this movie is well-thrown from soup to nuts: everyone is credible and true to his role. As for the question that the public will accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians - why not? I thought they pulled it out. <br /> <br /> Charming, fun, exciting ... what's not to like? If you want some fun, look at this peculiar, colorful adventure mob love story. If you want to know more about organized crime and families, vote on HBO's The Sopranos.
