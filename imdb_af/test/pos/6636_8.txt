Ingmar Bergman's meditation on war relates to a couple living an idyllic existence on a small island along the coast (from which country is not specified). Raging in the distance is a war that only knows about news reports. As they go about their day, the war comes to them and it soon becomes a struggle for survival, as both sides don't seem to care about them. Pale looks at the human cost of the war and those who were not readily involved in the battle, yet caught in the crossfire. It's a film before its time, like about 40 years after it made warriors' idea of ​​war, where most of the victims became civilians. It is a dark disturbing movie that is told from the average person's point of view, with the total feeling of hopeless and confusing best expressed in the mind running through my head, "what am I doing now?". In addition, as an intellectual exercise, the film is a film that reminds you. As an emotional film it never touches fully. I was never moved emotionally, even like the horror of the situation that made my brain flip flops. (I have to say that I admire Bergman intellectually for the ideas he brings to the table, but I've never been moved by his films. I'm not a fan. I always have with Fellini in the old movie class argument. placed who was better, as he had more emotion on his films). Aside from discussions, it is necessary to look, especially since we live in a world that is at war. For most of us it's just a thing on a TV screen.
