This is a surprising, but savings adjustment to Thomas Mann's novel of the same title. Dirk Bogarde gives his best screen performance - he believed it himself. The dialogue is minimal, so his face must register the nuances of his indignant character - a composer (a novelist - the only major change) traveling to Venice in 1910. Visconti unveils in the depiction of beauty, it goes by, and Operations director, used as an opera director, effortlessly reconciles Visconti Mahler's music and images in his best movie since "The Leopard" (another beautiful film that influenced Coppola's Sicily in the "Godfather").
