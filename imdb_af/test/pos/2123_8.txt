It's a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They made the movie look realistic. I did ballet and this movie made me continue. This movie was kind of like a Cinderella movie, but a little different. A father of 12 princesses gets very sick. His cousin poisoned him and wanted the throne. The girls find a secret magical land thanks to their mother-in-law's stories. It is up to them to save their father and society. With the help of their handsome prince. It was a funny movie and my friend and I enjoyed it. We enjoyed it very much and also enjoyed the Indian parrot. The music was very nice and made the movie even bigger. It had a good classical band. The voices were great and the characters were pleasantly sweet and cute. I liked it, so the movie is great for the family. All in all, I'll see it again.
