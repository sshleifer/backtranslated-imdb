Wladyslaw Starewicz was a Russian-born animator living in France who did amazing things with stop-motion. I have previously seen some of these movies and they have his favorite subjects - insects, frogs and various animals. They are extremely realistic and lifelike and even today is great to watch - the quality is simply fantastic. <br /> <br /> These one stars many and many frogs. They call on their god, Jupiter, to give them a king. Why do they need a king, Jupiter wonders - their life is now perfectly good. To give them a nasty lesson, he makes an Egret king and one by one begins to eat his subjects! Then the frogs again call on Jupiter, who declares the obvious morale that it is best to be happy with what you have! <br /> <br /> While the animation quality is incredible, it is a very creepy movie for kids. I would think it would both harm them by how real the animals look, as well as the story itself that is not for the dull of the heart!
