As most other reviewers seem to agree, this adaptation of 'After The Funeral' is indeed very good. Always one of my favorite Poirot stories, I was worried it might be 'messed up'. Well, it was a bit, but just a little and the end was the result thoroughly entertaining. David Suchet continues to be very flawless as Poirot and (as others pointed out) is the other star of this show Monica Dolan, who certainly is not Mrs. Gilchrist could be threatened. I also really enjoyed Fiona Glasscott who was on the red Rosamund Shane, but really, the casting was quite impeccable! <br /> <br /> One point is turned off because the adapters can't resist too much in the last fifteen minutes. The business with the will and home proofs was all unnecessary, although I did not think how to strengthen the structure of the Abernethie family (in the book the family tree is very complicated). The last moments when the killer is revealed, however, was done extremely well and I found the end when they all left Enderby and touched quite a bit. It's really one of the best of the Poirot series so far.
