I saw the second part of this beautiful period that was on a ship in the 19th century. Golding's book should be responsible for the wonderful dialogue, but everything was fine too! I especially liked the way they created the period and felt so good on the ship. For me, it had a sense of completeness about it that I know I will not be able to convey in words. Perhaps this is the way they are mixed in technical and historical details about the sail in the eighteen hundred to the story without disturbing it. Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent, just like the rest of the cast. It's not often a mini-series that sends me to the "zone", but this one did.
