Since Jason and his ilk took over horror movies in the 1980s, most of the horror movies each cut a group of hormonally charged teenagers, with the emphasis on cutting and not tension. <br /> <br /> This small movie is different. Made in the early 80's, doing what every good horror movie should do - bring your worst fears to life while you sit down just to know that these horrors are just around the corner. Then you make the horrors simmer, do not turn it into a lesson on victims' biology. <br /> <br /> The story contains Meg Tilly right before she has a short turn of fame starting with "The Big Chill" and then slipping back into darkness in the early 90s. Meg plays an extinct teenager who just dies to get into the good grace of some classic girls. They tell her that they can be part of their small group if they spend a night in a crypt. The average girls plan to scare her and cause her to leave the manger and give them a double reward. They will annoy the outcast girl and have an excuse to reject her. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, famous occult Karl Rhamarevich died a bizarre death shortly after claiming that he had discovered a way of returning from the grave and commanding magical powers on his return. His daughter doesn't even believe it, but she listens to a band about her father's experiments that include his successful animation of small dead animals and his plans to get out of the grave with the power to create bigger game and more power to pull out. these animations. She also learns that she has inherited her father's power and may be the only person who can stop him from actually getting up. I think you know where this story is going, so I'll stop here. Did I mention that the wizard was thrown into the same tomb, in which Meg Tilly's character spent the night? <br /> <br /> I would mention that the commercial DVD containing this movie is slightly degraded compared to what you would expect from a recent movie. I saw it on TV in the mid-1980s and I remember it looking better than that. The problem is that the original negative of the film was never located, so the DVD had to be created from a print. This means it comes with dirt and scratches. <br /> <br /> Finding out for any horror fan is worth it. It was a standalone movie and an example of the kind of unusual stuff you could usually find on late night TV until the infomercial changed the time slot in a big desert around 1986. Only TCM Underground air this kind of movie any more.
