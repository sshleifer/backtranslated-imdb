Not bad, but can be much better, but it also seems to be a staple diet for crime drama. You have Sandra Bullock as the cop who finds it difficult to work with others, you placed her with a new partner. There is a closed case, but a policeman who works anyway, and there are so many corn lines in the movie you want to scream. <br /> <br /> But if you look at the formal elements, a good movie is hidden underneath. It's gripping and the subplots worked for me. Well worth a rent, but maybe not a purchase.
