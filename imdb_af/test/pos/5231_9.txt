The details in The Big Trail were so incredible that I felt the movie was made at the moment it represented. I have never seen wagons that were so real! They were large, loaded with accessories, and even felt as if they were full of details under the canvas cover that was never meant to be seen. Every spot of dirt, every scratch, every splinter was there. Modern computer technology can never recreate the scenes of the many wagons as they move across the land or circle to conquer Indians. The wagons were all real, individual vehicles, each with its own right team of horses or oxen. <br /> <br /> The actors' clothes could not have been more sincere. With the exception of John Wayne's buckskin outfit and Marguerite Churchill's beautiful dress, the clothes were very common looking, clipped or dirty in an authentic way. Many actors and actresses were born before electricity and indoor plumbing was common, and they had to be comfortable with the environment. All the Indians were painted true Indians rather than white extras. <br /> <br /> Women from the old west had to be solid because there was a lot of work. In every scene that shows work of the people of the carriage, women become timber, wooden slips, etc. Saw. This realism was so natural that it was not a statement about the role of women of the day rather than a fact of survival. <br /> <br /> The plot of revenge and romance is well played. Nothing is over-emphasized or over-overs. <br /> <br /> Something was lost in the 1930s in Hollywood. As much as I love the fake scenery and controlled environment of old movies, the Big Trail surpasses everything. The more I see the big budget movies of the silent era, the more I like them. I can think of some of the 1930s movies I saw that looked like the grandeur of the best of the 1920s. If home movies were made in the days of trailer training, The Big Trail is what they would look like.
