The eighties produced very greedy little horror movie, most of them within the scraper subgenre - thus the movie for most of the rest of its ilk. Night of the Demons is something of a cross between the ultimate Gore movie, The Evil Dead; and haunted house brand new movie Hell Night. Films like this usually have a fake / malformed man as the chief bad man; but here we have bloodthirsty demons, who are always more interesting than a madman when you ask me. There is also a lot of comedy in this movie, and the first third of the movie can easily be set up for a straight comedy film. But as soon as the characters enter the central location; A sinister funeral home known as 'Hull House' - the movie morphs in the horror movie you'd expect to give the title. The plot line is as simple as you would expect, and we follow a lot of kids who decide to place a Halloween party in the listed funeral home. However, it seems to be a bad idea, but as soon as it appears that the house is owned and the demons begin to occupy the children's bodies! Their only rescue lies on the other side of the underground stream ... but the gate on the site is not as easy as it sounds. <br /> <br /> The centerpiece of the film is the Gothic mansion where action takes place. This cracking old house makes a big horror movie spot; the fact that it used to be a funeral home only adds to this. Director Kevin Tenney shoots the house well, and a particularly good job is being done to determine the fact that the house is in the middle of nowhere and the escape is difficult. The comedy after the start of the movie is generally very funny, and I hoped it would be the laugh as soon as the horror started. The movie has its comedy moments when the kids enter Hull House, but it is never cute and it is clear that horror is the main purpose of the movie. Not that it's a problem; but the night of the demons could have been much better if it properly blended the elements. The characters are exactly what you expect from this kind of movie; but the play suits the movie well, and it is clear that the young roll had a good time to make this movie and it translates well to the screen. The effects are good because they fit the film well, and since most of the death sequence is performed well; It's a good bet that most people won't get bored. It's not a classic or a movie; but I can highly recommend it as it offers a good time and appeals to fans of crazy horror feeds.
