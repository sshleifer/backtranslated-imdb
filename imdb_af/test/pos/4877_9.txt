I heard SEA OF DUST as part of a NYC screening a few years ago. I enjoyed the movie at the time, so I was a bit confused by some of the changes made since then. Perhaps this is my reminder, but there were missing pieces of eclipse from the version shown at the Rhode Island Film Festival. I'm really not sure which version I prefer, but I can honestly say I found something to appreciate it both. <br /> <br /> Let me begin to warn everyone that this is not a popcorn movie. Although it was promoted as a Hammer Movies tribute, people expecting a refurbishment between Van Helsing and Dracula will be particularly disappointed. There are a few fumes, but no nudity (a staple of the British production house's later movies). And while SEA OF DUST is filled with a beautiful eyebrow cake (it's really shot like a sixty film), and featuring Hammer aunt Ingrid Pitt, it's not like any of the company's photos in tone or performance. This film is very dark, very confusing, and (sometimes) very funny. I can't remember the previous version being just as useless as this one, but it's not a bad thing (especially the Black Forest performance that plays like a Three Stooges short). And some of Ms Pitt's rantings are quite entertaining. It was as if someone had detached her wound and her. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this movie, however, is not with the borrowed details. It's in the ideas. As an occasional Sci Fi channel viewer, I regularly took the network to the one-note variations on a theme (killing CGI monster, then being destroyed). SEA OF FABRIC is so full of ideas that you will travel on after a while. <br /> <br /> But don't get me wrong. I'm not complaining. Anything, I welcome these guys to take such an enterprising low-budget photo and to have the courage to tackle it with so many concepts. It's not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think about movies (you know who you are). But for the rest of us, those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror movies, the predictability, the lack of respect for the audience, may just be your ticket.
