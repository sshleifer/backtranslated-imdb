I remember seeing this movie back when it was released and I still remember the "buzz" I felt when I left the theater. Everything about this movie is great! The music is on top of that and I still play the soundtrack after all these years. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie so many times, and yet I still get desires to watch it again and again. Nicholas Cage was wonderful and when I see Cameron Dye today, I always associate him with this movie. It's too bad that the rest of the cast doesn't go on bigger things, but maybe it's part of the movie's charm. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to do a film school criticism because I'm sure all the analysts out there can find fault if they wanted to, but what I would say is that this movie has defined my teens and still more than Influence my life 20 years later. The movie feels good and generates emotions when you see it (well ... it did for me) and I can't recommend it highly enough to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. <br /> <br /> You either 'get' the movie or you don't! Those of you who get it will be rewarded with a unique movie experience.
