I saw this movie a few years ago and was literally swept away. So charming and so romantic. David Duchovny and Mrs. Driver has chemistry that is so hot, you have to take off a layer of clothing. The supporting casting is 100% on top. Just watching Caroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia play each other is pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the movies' most beautiful moments are when they are on the screen. As Jim Belushi shouts to his children to go to sleep "FOREVER!" or he is dancing in the kitchen. This film wished us to know such people in my own life. Not to mention which woman David Duchovny doesn't want a boyfriend?
