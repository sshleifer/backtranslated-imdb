I saw it on the Accent Underground issue with the short films. I first found the movie boring and old-fashioned and turned it off after the first hour. I was a little drunk and tired. <br /> <br /> I went to bed, and I didn't have a nightmare about this movie. within half an hour of sleep. I couldn't stop thinking, so I got up, switched on the TV again, loaded the DVD and saw the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Well done, Alex Frayne, sir, you managed to make Implant your movie in this old, cynical movie, and it takes. So 10 out of 10 for you. <br /> <br /> I can't say I love this movie of yours, but it has a lasting impact despite its flaws and low budget.
