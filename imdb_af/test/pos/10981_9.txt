Witticisms, colorful characters, family relationships, dealing with hardship, living with fun and humor. This movie has it all and more. What a great "every man (and woman)" story, with a top plot and script. It just offers clean fun, lots of laughs, lots of smiles and sheer entertainment for the whole family. Other reviewers describe the story a few. I will only offer this comparison tar? It is part of the best exhibition, "Grumpy Old Men," "Millions," and some other comedy and live flashes that were completed in one. <br /> <br /> This gem of a movie probably has limited release and is probably not very available for rent. But it's now on DVD and I highly recommend it for purchase. If you want good, fun fun and entertaining movies for the family, don't miss out on "Manna from Heaven." This movie is a safe fire for the blues or to chase away the darkness in nasty weather or rough times.
