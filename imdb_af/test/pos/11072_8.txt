I lived in that area (Hoboken and Jersey City) for about ten years. This film determines the feeling of that time and place. The dialogue is very good, the music is right and scenarios are realistic. As another poster said, it almost looks like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I like the way it manages these kids, who would probably have been born in Westchester, but fall into which kids are falling. It just happens that the area is pretty rough. <br /> <br /> They are quite convincing the police, but it is expected. I'll say the acting is also good everywhere. <br /> <br /> This gives the viewer some sense of how this idiot is caused and disproportionate. Hopefully, the new Mayor of Newark is making progress.
