Talk about your classic! Ernie Fossilus (the Foss from here) performed with a cute and creative fan with a totally haunting Star Wars. This jewel is so caught up with tributes and gags that I laugh every time! Not only that, when Star Wars did a reissue with new special effects, Hardware Wars did the same! Talk about a spoof that just won't die! There is a reason why George Lucas calls it his favorite parody. He was so impressed, he even hired the Foss to work on "Return of the Jedi". (Don't believe me, go to his entry in IMDb!) <br /> <br /> It should be the first, and in my opinion, the best parody ever done. I think the special issue was a little exaggerated, but on reflection, I think it is PERFECT for the contemporary revival of Star Wars and it proves that it is sometimes wrong to waste perfection. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's worth your time to appreciate. <br /> <br /> You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss $ 3 goodbye! Well, maybe 15 for the DVD, but you'll be really happy with what you've done.
