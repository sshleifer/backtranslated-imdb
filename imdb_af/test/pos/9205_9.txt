I read the comments on Las Vegas and agreed with some of them. It's not brain surgery TV, but then I was once again impressed that TV was mainly for escapes, especially with what's going on in today's world. Let's see it, a show about Vegas (it's not a reality-based program) doesn't go to one based on reality, because to me Vegas is fine fantasy! That's the kind of place we can go and do pretty much what we want if we want (subject to funds of course!). <br /> <br /> Therefore, the fact that Las Vegas is beautiful, sexy and clicked with characters that reflect it all seems to be on the money in my eyes. If you don't like it, don't see it, that's what we have a million channels! <br /> <br /> We're coming here to the third episode here in the UK and I know I'll make a beeline to watch it again. I just hope it's not canceled, something that seems to be happening to most of the shows coming to the UK is half decent! (Firefly and Jake 2.0 anyone? !!). <br /> <br /> It is harmless, fun and every time I see it, I want to go back to the right thing :)
