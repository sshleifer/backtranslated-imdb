I think it's the first time I've seen a Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle movie. I really loved him in his (title) role as a butcher boy. The way he moves is, according to me, very funny, for example, how he handles his knife and how he rolls a cigarette. I think he is a good actor; His facial expressions really fit the role he plays, for example, how he looks at the audience in the end. But one might add that this was probably not too difficult. Anyway, I think he would have earned a longer career. As you probably know, it was devastated by greedy journalists who made money by pressing false charges that said he was involved in a scandal. <br /> <br /> The plot is not very important. In the first half, Fatty and Alum are employees of a store and competitors for Almagine's love. After a heavy fight, Almondine is sent to a girls' school by her father, the shop owner. (This is the beginning of the second half). Both Fatty and Alum enter the school, and the battle for Almondine continues. (Some of the characters' names are different in the version I saw. For some reason, they seem to have replaced the original title cards with new ones.) <br /> <br /> There are many wheat-like gags such as food fights and pratfalls, but this is well done in my opinion. And there are a few gags that I liked, for example, how to make the dog make the pepper mill (or is it a coffee grinder?), Or the scene when Fatty down a coat, although of course it's not necessary. or when Miss. Teachem, the head of the girls' school, spanking Vettig, and he spun her back. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is also funny in this, his first movie; a great addition to the cast. In the first half he is a client at the store, in the second half he supports Alum in his battle for Almondine. I like his acrobatics, for example, when Fatty moves from one room to another, he doesn't show a simple pratfall, but lands on his hands and his head and does some pirouette. Watch out for one scene in the fight: Alum throws a meal bag with him, but it misses and stores the shop owner instead. It makes Buster laugh, which must be a rarity, as he usually always shows a neutral expression (what you probably know, called him "The Great Stone Face"). (Another note: Al St John, who plays Alum, was 'Fatty' Arbuckle's cousin, and later became known for the role of 'Fuzzy' he played in many Western games.) <br /> <br /> I don't like this one as much as I want, for example 'One Week' and 'The Balloonatic' (films made later by Buster, without 'Fatty'). And it didn't make me run out loud - but it made me smile a lot, so I gave it eight points.
