Well, I enjoy this movie, although it sometimes affects too much of a stereotypical situation. I didn't understand at the moment whether the Penalty Park existed in the past, but I don't think the case is really here. <br /> <br /> You should watch this movie in a different way. It shows how much violence you can find in our world. It reminds us that we are living in a world that is led by violence and that no one can escape from it. If someone refuses to accept his responsibilities, you will be thrown out of our society. All our history is made by wars, we must never forget it. In fact, it is only when we finally accept the truth that we might change and understand that our "intellectual skills" have improved. So we can use them to find other ways to solve our problems. <br /> <br /> In 2 words this movie is a must see, maybe it will help us to accept the truth ...
