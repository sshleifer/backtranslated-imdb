I was impressed with the story. It had the "typical" roofgay man and the "typical" Mormon missionary. But they also all had friends and family who balanced their lives well. There are a number of characters, a little fun and a few, not so nice, each with their own personality chance. And most remind me of people in my own life. <br /> <br /> The story begins with several humorous moments and slowly develops into a heart-warming relationship movie. The story progresses without clear plot twists and never speaks to you. It makes you think a little while waiting to see what happens. Even when I thought I could predict something, I was amazed at how it really happened. <br /> <br /> Not many movies make me aware of real gay dialogue and then bring a tear to my eye when I feel the pain of the characters. I watched the movie on DVD, and couldn't stop me watching until it was over. (Usually I watch a movie in a few days.) It is nice to see a movie with gay characters who are upbeat, but not preaching. I recommend this movie! And not just for gay audiences. Relationships violate sexuality.
