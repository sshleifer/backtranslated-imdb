Seriously any movie with John Malkovich is usually very good. And this includes Clint Eastwood, Rene Russo, John Mahoney (Frasier), Dylan McDermott (The Practice), and much more good actors. <br /> <br /> Clint gets old, but thank you he is also a great director (in his own right). <br /> <br /> We are accustomed to Wolfgang "water films" such as Das Boot, Poseidon and Perfect Storm. It was very different, but just as sublime. <br /> <br /> The incident of the killer is as serious as it gets, the movie is good, some of the violence is a bit ... But altogether recommended (but not for children).
