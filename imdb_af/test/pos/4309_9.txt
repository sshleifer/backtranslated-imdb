If you haven't seen this movie, do it. It's a genre mix like I've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, a hilarious funny game, a movie noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best orgasm on Film, only spent by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles mingled in ' a work of art. As an artwork it should not be logical, at least not logical for everyone ;-). I owned a TV copy on VHS, but borrowed it from an ex-girlfriend and now I can't get it back. But the movie should be on DVD in Austria on 10.06.03 and be sure to buy it.
