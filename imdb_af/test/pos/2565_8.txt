As I read through the comments, I was surprised to find one that said this movie was "not very deep." I have to disagree. It must be one of the deepest and most formidable movies I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they were praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feeling? It is a story of salvation. It's about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten by life, but too strong to lie down and die. It's about a man who sees more value in a girl than she herself saw. It reminded me strongly of the book Redding Love at Francine Rivers, which has a similar story of salvation. Yes, the images and themes are messy and sometimes shocking, but if you look close enough, you can only see yourself in these characters. Sometimes the real things in life aren't pretty, but they're real.
