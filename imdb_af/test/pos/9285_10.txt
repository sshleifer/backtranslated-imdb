This program is definitely my favorite non-sitcom television comedy. Australia produces very good programs. Most of the TV I see (and I live in Australia) is from the US and England. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this show is just how controversial it is. As they passed, many security barriers at the APEC summit were thought to be Canadian diplomats. <br /> <br /> The show consists of pre-filmed stunts, general satirical discussion of current world events, and sometimes sketched on stage. It all comes together to make a fantastic, extremely funny TV show. The segments such as "Ad Road Test" and "Message from Osama bin Ladin" are hilarious. For anyone interested in watching hilarious satirical TV comedy, it's definitely the show you need to watch. <br /> <br /> All the guys are great and do a great job of entertaining you for half an hour. <br /> <br /> I'll rate it 10/10.
