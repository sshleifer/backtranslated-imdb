I rented this movie, but I wasn't sure what to expect from it. I was delighted to find that it's about the best Brazilian movie I've ever seen. The story is rather strange and simple, and above all, very original. We have Antonio, a young man living in Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in the northeast of Brazil, and who is deeply in love with Karina. The biggest conflict between the two is that while Antonio loves his little town and doesn't want to leave, Karina wants to see the world and leave the place. As proof of his love for her, he decides to go out and bring the world to her. He will place Nordestina on the map, as he says. And the way he does it is incredible. It's a good movie; It may be a bit stiff for some people due to its different editing, but I think it's also improving the story. It's just fun, and it makes you feel good.
