For me, "Late Chrysanthemums" was interesting not only because it was my first film of Naruse that I totally enjoyed, but because it was technically as modern and innovative as his 30-year-old work I saw. This does not mean innovative editing in the way Godard introduced it to "Breathless" in 1959, but rather the opposite. <br /> <br /> Editing was as smooth as in the best Hollywood movies from the 30's / 40's, but at the same time incredibly appropriate about the way he told his story. Unlike them, it never deliberately emphasized or tried to "make itself" invisible, but with cinematography I felt like I was traveling on a gentle stream, constantly feeling the waves beneath me, like a gentle stroke from the hand or the almost imperceptible rocking of a cradle. In this sense, the film was comparable to the work of Ozu and Mizoguchi, but somehow, even more subtle. <br /> <br /> What was so modern was the fact that editing is almost a character in itself, similar to the remarkable camera work in Dreyer's Ordet (1954) or Friday (1943), which we better understand the film and its characters, rather than just showing it to us. <br /> <br /> I feel that Naruse's editing and filmmaking are the most interesting aspects of his films, which elevate the stories beyond the obvious. The wonderful sets and settings shouldn't be forgotten either! I found the story quite conventional. <br /> <br /> The narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way, and I thought the first half of the film had set a delicate engineering spectrum of emotions. and interrelationships. Unfortunately, the second half of the film and its resolution were rather didactic and formulated compared to the set-up (though in itself it would be perfectly appropriate in any other - less complex - movie). Somehow I felt that he had failed a bit to try to solve the many layers he had woven. Maybe he had to keep them intact. This criticism may seem a bit difficult for a viewer of this movie, especially as the process reminds of the way Ozu dealt with the plot in his films. Unfortunately, I do not yet feel that Naruse could elevate the story and his characters in his films in a similar sublime way. The best efforts I have seen so far - Ukigumo (Floating Clouds / 1955) and Midaregumo (Scattered Clouds / 1967) - have sustained the energy he built through the story while delivering interesting and resonant ends. <br /> <br /> It is more than most directors are able to do, and in my opinion the basis for real mastery of the movie medium. In this regard, and seeing the resonance of the last two films I saw through him, he may have become one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The only problem I currently have is where I'm going to see more of his movies on the big screen.
