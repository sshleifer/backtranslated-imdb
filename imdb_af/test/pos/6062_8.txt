'Travel racket' is one of the best new Danish TV shows I watched. <br /> <br /> The series deals with the Danish Police Force's Unit 1 - a kind of FBI style team that helps solve murder cases everywhere. the country and the cases they are working on, as well as the impact their work has on their personal lives, and the price they sometimes have to pay to be part of a top team. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much when I watched this series - I was pleasantly surprised, the series is exciting, sometimes fun, it has drama and excitement, I love it.
