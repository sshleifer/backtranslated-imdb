I wanted to love this movie. Everything was in place for a pleasant, if not pioneering, movie. It was in the south of France, good and recognizable actors played the part and I really admired the vibrant African costumes, the proverbs and the music. Despite this, I didn't love it. Movies are supposed to convey their meaning on the first show, but "Secret Laughter" doesn't. Nimi and Matthew, as played by Long and Firth (who both played romantic prospects and knew better), should radiate so much warmth and passion as dried fish. I deliberately used 'dried fish' because it was one of a few - too few - strong lines and moments spread the whole film. Another winner was when Nimi caught Matthew crawling around her flat. He found a book from her with her first name written on it, saying, "Your name is Nimi. I never knew." Then he insists she calls him his Christian name. I watched this scene intensively as Matthew asked Nimi over and over to say my name, and realized that until that moment, they always phoned each other by their names. I thought it was a turning point for the movie and expecting it to be better. It didn't. Why does Nimi and Matthew always look at ten, even in that "my name" scene? What keeps Matthew from Nimi, apart from her obvious beauty? And why would a sensible woman like Nimi fall for a comic book writer who sees his marriage as something he can put into the game when a beautiful exotic adventure comes together? And I would like to add that it was a little difficult for me to come after a romance for adultery. Yes, Jenny is a vicious harpy, but when I was in her shoes, but I would probably fit her Cruella tactics to stop my husband from seducing. Believe it. The story suggests Nimi's painful past, but never fully investigates it. Some critics say Firth looked a little uncomfortable here, and I agree. For the sake of well-being, the actor addressed more striking desire and passion than the early 19th century snob Mr. Darcy (and while wearing the spectacular britches)! Regarding Long, which shines in 'Love Jones', there were times when she concentrated more on her accent than playing her character. Yet there were many moments? the 'say my name' scene among them ?? when she was in total control and really did well. Still, 'Secret Laughter' is not without its redeeming qualities, and I have found it has grown with more views. Nene is well portrayed as supportive and well-meaning, even though she does not understand Nimi's attraction to Matthew. I absolutely loved it when Nene challenged Mama Fola in the devil games. My husband likes it, and usually he is the first to suck and put insults on the screen if he doesn't like what is going on. He even visited the scene when Sammy asked Matthew some very honest questions about sex. So there you have it. "Secret Laughter" was good enough to entertain a beloved curmudgeon like my hubby, but a keen filmmaker like me would need more than one show to appreciate what the director and writer was trying to convey.
