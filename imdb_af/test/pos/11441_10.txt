This little film brings back many memories, both fine and dirty, from what can and does happen if one work musician is. The not so pleasant accommodation for the group, running the room that jumps up and down, tells you what to play, the sheer ecstasy of the applause .............. Far from being over, it is, in fact, very accurate in the way it portrays musicians, professionally and otherwise, who have traveled a great distance to perform a season's performances on a venue. There are times when everything goes perfectly, there are those other times when you immediately start to miss your mate and wonder what the hell are you doing so far from home. Ultimately, you have to make the best of it, because there is no other way out.
