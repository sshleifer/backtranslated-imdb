I just saw this movie and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it keeps your attention, the play is excellent, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good movie indeed, about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the trials that are about to begin, but he takes the matter while the story progresses, and this great actor gives you a performance that Feel the character's anxiety and suffering. Emily Watson's character is very strong and she only has a quick look and you understand everything. I won't say anymore because it's better because you have to enter the story as it unfolds.
