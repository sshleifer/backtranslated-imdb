Robert McKimson's' Acrobatty Bunny 'is one of the directors' best shorts. Although the circus-based environment may be reminiscent of McKimson's horrible 'Big Top Bunny', 'Acrobatty Bunny', it's actually as dull as that travesty. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a fiery lion, 'Acrobatty Bunny' is fresh and funny from the start, not to look extremely attractive. There is a classic scene in which Bugs takes a curly lift ride from his hole just to get into the lion's jaws. In a brilliant Disney parody, he holds 'Pinocchio' in the lion's throat! This brilliant opening is a sign of things to come. There are some choreographic ancient things in and around the lion's loft. Start off with a hilarious grotesque and annoying version of 'Laugh Clown Laugh', which I as a child have regularly personalized! All this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence that gives the cartoon's name. I have never loved the circus as a cartoon setting, and finding it usually makes a dull and predictable set of gags, but 'Acrobatty Bunny' breaks out and the result is an exciting funny short that comes under McKimson it's best.
