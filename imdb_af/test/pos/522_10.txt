I like to see Linda Blair again in a real horror movie. I was disappointed with her in most things since the "Exorcist" movies (which I loved). What happened to all the nasty "B-movies" she did? <br /> <br /> David Hassellhoff on the other hand, all I can do is laugh. He is not cut out to be a horror movie actor. David must be at "Knight Rider" or "Baywatch". <br /> <br /> All around, it's a great movie. Even for the eighties it was a wonderful movie. It has horror, action and drama. It's a strain, and I loved how Linda Blair turned out.
