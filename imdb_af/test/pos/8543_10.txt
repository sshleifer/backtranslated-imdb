I only saw this movie in Papua New Guinea in 1967 and remembered it since, although I have never seen it before. <br /> <br /> How easy the lives of good people can be destroyed by the pure evil that has existed and is still a memory that will haunt me forever. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny and very sad at the same time and Anthony Quinn's role is great. <br /> <br /> This movie must be in all college studies on man's inhumanity to man.
