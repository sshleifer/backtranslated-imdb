<br /> <br /> Fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid. This short parody is at least as much a part of the Star Wars saga as Phantom Menace, and much more entertaining if you ask me. Hardware wars were the first in a long line of SW spoofs that form their own subgenre today. I hate to describe it too much - it's so short that the point of departure is just about the whole thing. That's enough to say that many of the most popular and well-known aspects of Star Wars have fun on them. Household appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners have depicted spaces and robots. The Princess Anne-Droid character carries real rolls of bread on her head instead of the familiar coils of braided hair and Fluke Starbucker is even more of a thorn than its original, if possible. Ernie Fosselius is a crazy boy-of-a-buck - he is also the source of Porklips Now, the Apocalypse Now spoof.
