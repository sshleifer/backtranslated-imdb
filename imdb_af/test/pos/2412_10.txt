THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial arts flick. I thought Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) look good in their promotional clothes. For me, Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real bully. This was because he was in trouble with July with Prince Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was a pure ******! It was because he was a very hard man who would not tolerate mistakes. My favorite parts were the prom and the jump between July and the Alpha Elite. Finally, I recommend this smash hit to all of you who love martial arts flicks or are fans of Hilary Swank.
