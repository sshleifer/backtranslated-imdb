Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a very high rating anime in almost every review page you can find on the web. So I really wanted to know why, and I was nothing but disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you get past the bizarre (but funny) first episode, you'll find yourself in a very entertaining and much alien world. A very well-drawn, perfectly animated world, that is. <br /> <br /> I can't tell much about the story without spoiling it, so I'll just say it's a high school comedy ... and yet it's not. I can't really say what it is about. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'm a BIG ANIME fan, and I have about 50 full ranges, and I'm not joking when I say it. Although I didn't watch Haruhi Suzumiya, it's actually high in my personal collection. I am in love with the first face with this one, and I assure you that at least you will not be indifferent to his irresistible charm. Believe me, I'm not going around and give a 10 for every thing I look at.
