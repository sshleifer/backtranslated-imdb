Let's see it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's simply too long and varied and cerebral to get absolutely perfect on the board, especially with the challenges of Elizabeth's English and Shakespeare's urgent dialogue. At some times, there must be certain moments, scenes or intonations that you disagree with. I watched many filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC movie with Jacobi. In terms of faithful, full-fledged productions, this one stands high on top. <br /> <br /> Most Hamlet productions are cut drastically, as performing the entire play takes four to five hours to complete. This production seems to be complete - that is, ALL the original Shakespeare dialogue is intact - and it is therefore essential for scholars and Shakespeare lovers. And although the lines were on a scarce occasion (for those who are less familiar with the text), the writing was mostly well-acted, well-spoken and well-executed. Subtitles are available and very useful, but sometimes they sit a little behind. <br /> <br /> Jacobi does a pretty admirable job with the longest and most impossible role of the theater. I actually cried when Hamlet died, and I don't think I did it before. Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, such as Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the very on-point cast. Sets are minimal, so we can be grateful for the play without distractions or attention to non-essentials. <br /> <br /> At 3 am and 45 minutes, this long-distance Hamlet is a long way to go, but again, if you want the right deal, it's worth 100% even if you need to take a break. I recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
