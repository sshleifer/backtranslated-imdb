"Quai des Orfevres", directed by brilliant Henri-Georges Clouzot, is a film to treasure because it is one of the best exponents of the French film production of the post-war years. M. Clouzot, who adjusts the Steeman novel, "Longtime Defense", shows his genius in the way he sets the story and in the way he connects all the characters in this deeply satisfying movie that, like DBDumonteil in this forum on showed how influential Cluzot was and how much the next generation of French filmmakers were convicted of the master, especially Claude Chabrol. <br /> <br /> The sharp black and white cinematography by Armand Thirard has been beautifully transferred to the Criterion DVD we recently watched. With Clouzot, Thirard works most of the dark shades and shadows in most of the keys. The music by Francis Lopez, a man who created light music and operetta in France, works well in the context of the film, as action takes place in the world of music halls and nightclubs. <br /> <br /> Louis Jouvet, seen as a police detective, is perfect in that part. It was one of his best screen performances for an actor who was a pillar of French theater. Jouvet understands the mechanics well for the creation of his wiser police inspector and can look deeply into the souls of his suspects and ultimately steal the performance of the other. In an unfair remark by someone on this page, Jouvet's inspector is compared to Peter Falk's Columbo, the television copyright. Honestly, and no respect for Mr. Falk meant, it's like comparing a good champagne with a good house wine. <br /> <br /> Bernard Blier is perfect as the jealous man. Blier had the kind of face one could associate with the man who was consumed with passion, who woke up his wife, Jenny Lamour. Martineau is vulnerable and does not trade rationally; He's an easy suspect because he did everything wrong because he was in the middle of a crime he didn't commit, but all the evidence indicates the opposite. <br /> <br /> The other big character in the movie is Dora, the photographer. It is clear with the way she communicates with Jenny where her real interest lies. Simone Renant is tragically appealing like this troubled woman and makes a huge contribution to the film. Suzy Delair, who plays Jenny, is appealing as the singer who suddenly jumps from darkness to celebrity and attracts the kind of men like Brignon, the old lecher. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the best Clouzot directors during his Outstanding Career and one who will live forever, for the way he brought all the elements together.
