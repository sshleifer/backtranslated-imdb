Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly, he was, was moving, and emotionally. <br /> <br /> This movie captures the spirit of what architecture really is, what good design is and the emotional price paid for it. Just like ghost is the soundtrack. If you watch the movie and then listen to the soundtrack, you can just repeat the movie by listening. As a practicing architect of more than 30 years, my heart has pain and rejoicing over the film and its straight forward, even if it is emotional honesty and sincerity. <br /> <br /> I had the honor of seeing this film in Chicago at the National Convention of the American Institute of Architects. The film was introduced by Daniel and he was kind enough to then do a question and answer session. During the entire film presentation, not a sound, not a cough, no distraction occurred. The whole audience was fitter, and the real surprise was that Daniel's mother was present during the performance of the film. <br /> <br /> I will always remember the movie and every time I listen, I always play about the soundtrack ...
