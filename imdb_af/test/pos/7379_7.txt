It was an interesting study in community sexuality, as well as the "dark interests" of man. <br /> <br /> While I can't say the woman was a strong character - she was the wrong choice for the part, in my opinion - she was a rich kid looking to escape her cool life . She was a rebel in fact, and never fully grown up for her husband, a lawyer (Rickman). Obviously he married her for her money and covers his sexual desires, which are taboo. Rickman played his part on a tea, his flirtations with the young man and many subtle undertones of gayness. The young man was denied gay! When he did Marilyn's imitation, the woman had to tell everything. He was also thrown perfectly. He wrote hustler about him. <br /> <br /> I didn't love the end because I knew what was coming. Overall, Rickman's actions were wonderful, Reedus was good, Walker was okay, but I had reservations. For a gay themed movie, it was average, but not striking. It is worth watching if you don't turn around "Truly Madly Deeply" for a spin.
