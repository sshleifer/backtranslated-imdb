I adore this movie as much as anyone who worshiped when they were young. It was one of those movies that Home Box Office showed my youth every other day. This film is filed forever in my brain. For someone who has not grown up around this movie, you may have been spoiled by the ADD cycle since the mid-90s since the mid-90s. cool, that's because my sis was baptized on 'better dead' before I saw it (of which I was raped and loved) and nobody, no one can deny the embrace of uncomfortable teenage humor in American cinema in the 80's - It has birth given to everything we found tiring in teenage comedies. Because with all the over-exploitation of slow-mo, the current soundtrack, the new technology. I wonder if the theater goes back to these roots ... THIS is the teenage comedy ... YES!
