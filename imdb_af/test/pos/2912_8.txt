When this movie gets it right, it gets right. And if it goes wrong ... I'd say a full 3/4s of the movie is good. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's all about the romance. Everything you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes, but it goes on for about 30. I would recommend hitting that portion if you can. It does nothing except its exile. It must have been a small plot point. Fortunately, the period from about 0-30 and 1: 2-2: 19 (The End) is excellent. <br /> <br /> There are a number of excellent performances in this movie, and an equal number of terrible. Like everything else in this movie, the play is perfect or awful. Peter Ustinov as the clever one-eyed slave Kaptah is perfect. It's one of his best performances, with his role in Spartacus. Victor Adult as the ambitious Horemheb is also perfect. Again, one of its best roles. Jean Simmons is wasted as earnings, the perfect girl in love with our hero. John Carradine plays a good supporting role as a philosophical tomb robber; and Michael Wilding is excellent as Akhnaton, the idealistic pharaoh who only brings peace and monotheism to Egypt to see it fall apart due to his reluctance to fight. Now for the bad. Edmund Purdom as Sinuhe is unfortunate. It's double unfortunate because he's the main character. The whole movie turns around him. He really does very well like the disillusioned exile and the wise old man. This is because of its very limited scope. He doesn't seem able to put any passion into his words. This is especially evident during the love scenes that are uncomfortable. He spends the last half of the film as an old man, a show he is decent enough. He has the perfect voice for the character. The less said about Bella Darvi as Nefer, the treacherous Babylonian woman, the better. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets are wonderful. This is the only film I know of, which seeks to portray life in Egypt that is not overshadowed by Jews or Romans. The film takes place in the 14th century B.C. which is even exodus. The only monotheists are Pharaoh Akhenaten and his followers. There is the same strong element of religious zeal that occurs in most epics, but it is done differently and it only shows at the end. An interesting note: by Akhenaten followed by Horemheb as Pharaoh, the film about the best-known pharaoh of all: Tutankhamen. Seems kind of a strange thing to do if using that name can raise awareness of the movie. <br /> <br /> Be warned: this is a 1950s epic movie. If you don't like that kind of thing, don't expect this one to be different. It's different, but it's still an epic one. I appreciate this movie, and I appreciate what it did and what it tried. It's a movie that needs to be remembered better than it is.
