Emilio is a successful businessman, a perfect father and a good man. Or that's what everyone thinks. The perfect storyline that he has been building carefully for years will suddenly enter him. Will he be able to keep his own lies? <br /> <br /> It is a very good drama, with a great acting and steady direction. Although the plot is being pushed to the limit to increase tension, the movie explores some of our worst fears ... Do we really know the people we're dealing with? Can we be so sure? <br /> <br /> The story is evolving at a faster pace because it reaches the point where Emilio is no longer in control of his lies. A good part of Spanish movies has interesting stories but are far from technical skill. The perfect rhythm and well-shot scene make the actors so credible, we get into Emilio and hate him and suffer for him, as his situation becomes more and more desperate. There is no need for any Spanish folklore, nor is it an attempt to create a Hollywood style. It really is Spain, 2002, and regardless of the obvious likelihood of Emilio's life in fact, there are good chances someone knows are not quite like the person he claims. Not just a great commercial product, it will make you wonder where lies can get us. Can we keep pace? <br /> <br /> Well done.
