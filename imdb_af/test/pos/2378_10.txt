Four unhappy women leave furious London to spend a SALE APRIL in a castle on the Italian coast. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth von Arnim's novel comes alive in this beautiful little movie that demonstrates the virtues of a literate script and ensemble. acting. All the elements come together to make a movie that, while now almost forgotten, still offers a sense of appreciation for the appropriate resolution of the story. <br /> <br /> The actresses each save themselves wonderfully. Ann Harding is the generous woman who longs for 'wisteria & tranquility' far from misty London. Katharine Alexander plays the quiet housewife and wishes the elegant responsibility to act as a hostess in the castle. Jane Baxter is the beautiful young noble woman who has temporarily escaped from her male admirers. Jessie Ralph steals every scene she's in as an old lady who wants to be alone with her memories of the past. <br /> <br /> The men in the story are also well thrown. As Mrs. Harding's husband, Frank Morgan has a rather complicated role as a mischievous researcher who has a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer. Reginald Owen, as Mrs. Alexander's spouse is wonderfully pompous as a man well-equipped to drill for England. (His hilarious attempt to take an English bath in an Italian bath is even worse with Charles Judels & Rafaela Ottiano as the castle's wedding servants). Finally, Ralph Forbes, one of the best forgotten actors of the decade, is joyfully eccentric as the lady-minded landlord. <br /> <br /> Movie mavens acknowledge an unreasonable Ethel Griffon who plays the Hampstead Housewives Club.
