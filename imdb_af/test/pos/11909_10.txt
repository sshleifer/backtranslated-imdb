I like this movie. That's pretty much everything I can say about it. Lou Gossett did a good job, though I am still very disappointed in him after all the Iron Eagle movies. And even though I smile on the inside when the first head teen dies (I won't give it away). It's done in a nice, appropriate way. Pretty much everyone in this movie does a good job, so check it out! This is one of those movies I really found cheap, so I bought it and I recommend it.
