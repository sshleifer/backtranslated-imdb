Excellent introspective / interpersonal piece that really had teeth on it without feeling hopeless or worse, manipulative and artificially satisfying. Can also be a good double feature with American Beauty. Best performance to date I've seen from Anita Mui, and every actor here looks like a power station. Hats off to Ann Hui for the direction and Ivy Ho for the brilliant writing. Seriously one of the best dramas I've seen for a while, especially if you have a taste for ALA poetry in classical literature. Again, excellent.
