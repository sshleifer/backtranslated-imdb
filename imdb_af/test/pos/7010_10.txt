I watched this movie at least 30 times, maybe more, and every time I see it, I'm pulled into the movie and back to 1963! The movie takes me on a nostalgic holiday every time I see it. <br /> <br /> I think the most important thing to say here is I was 15 in 1963 and I can remember "before President Kennedy was shot and came before the Beetles." I can feel myself like, "I wore a watermelon. " and then realize how stupid it was! Jennifer Gray plays Frances "Baby" Houseman in Dirty Dancing. Baby starts college in the fall. She goes to Kellerman's for a holiday with her family (mother, father and sister Lisa). <br /> <br /> One of the staff dancers, Penny (played by Cynthia Rhodes) gets pregnant by another staff member (one of the college boys played by Max Cantor) and has a chance to get an abortion, but it is on a night that she and Johnny (Patrick Swayze) will dance at a nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> So the need for a dancer for Penny. Johnny is convinced by Penny and his cousin Billy (Neal Jones) that he can teach Baby to do the dance on time. Baby learns the dance steps with Penny and Johnny are wonderful scenes! <br /> <br /> Baby's dad (Doctor Jake Houseman played by Jerry Orbach) comes to Penny's rescue when the abortion is done wrong. Dirty Dancing this time back in history when girls got pregnant and had victims in the back room by butchers. Around this time (1963), many girls actually died of this type of abortion, but there were not many choices for a girl. <br /> <br /> Lonnie Price plays a big, excited grandson (Neil Kellerman) to Jack Weston's Max Kellerman. Jane Brucker does a good job as Baby's annoying sister Lisa Houseman. <br /> <br /> The music is great and the dance is great! The "dirty dancers" are absolutely wonderful and very sexy. I can feel Baby's surprise when she first sees them dancing and says, "Where did they learn it?" <br /> <br /> Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are just perfect in their respective roles. Patrick's song, "She's Like The Wind," brings tears to my eyes every time I hear / watch it in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with a recording, but lets you know what happens next. in Babies and Johnny's lives. Dirty Dancing gives something new every time it is watched. It entertaines the viewer with nostalgia, a feeling that it must be 1963 again.
