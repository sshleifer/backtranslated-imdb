I watched this movie at a screener and it's the best movie I've seen in a long time. I loved it !!!! James Franco is soo hot and he and Sienna Miller make the perfect couple. I don't want to throw away what is happening, but they do play some newlyweds going on their honeymoon to the Niagara Falls and some nice wild things going on. The movie is really funny and sad and original. I can't even say what it reminds me of, but will see it! I cried so hard, but really loved and wanted to see it again when it came out! My friends also cried. I hope it comes out soon - does anyone know when? I'll really see it if I were you
