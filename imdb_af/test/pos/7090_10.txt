Meryl Streep as Kate, a woman who dies of cancer, miraculously plays her part. No wonder she was on Oscar. In part, she proves that caring and caring housewives are just as important as their sisters in the business world. And the lesson she learns about life's expectations and their lack of fulfillment as the relationship grows, is the most important thing she teaches her daughter. We can expect too much from our friends. Realizing that there are many slips and forgiveness or understanding are the main ingredients of a happy life. It is a bleak film and the end, though sad, shows reconciliation between the father and the daughter. I give this one a ten.
