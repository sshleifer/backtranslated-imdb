An exciting watch, but one of Bergman's best films. Interesting to compare it with The Hour of the Wolf, as both are the same lead actors as artists (or an artist and his wife) who have taken a sanctuary on an island. In the previous film, it is largely inner demons that lead to von Sydows dissolution of personality (at least so I read it). Here are many circumstances beyond his control. Much has been written about the unsympathetic central characters, especially von Sydow's. To me, there are flashes of a good (as defective) man early in the film, but one that is dealing with contradiction heavily. The mistakes are all that remains, as his humanity is gradually eroded by one horror after another. <br /> <br /> Shortly afterwards, I watched a passion (Ullmann and von Sydow on their island) and was amazed to recognize many of the same places. And then there's a dream order ...
