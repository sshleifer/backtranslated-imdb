Jackass Number Two is easily the most hilarious movie of 2006, which also defeats the hilarious Clerks II. This is one of the best successors in the recent memory, which Jackass The Movie hits in every respect. Now, this movie can be the funniest, but it is also the most offensive, terrible and completely disgusting. You will feel sick several times in the movie. I am quite serious when I say nothing is eating before I watch or during this movie, because there is a chance it will literally come to haunt you. Also keep drinking to a minimum. You have been warned, because, as the tagline says, it will make you merciful. Jackass Number Two follows the crazy men from the hit show Jackass, Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Chris Party Party Pontius, Preston Lacy, Ehren McGhehey, Dave England, Brandon DiCamillo, and Jason 'Wee Man' Acuna (Chris 'Raab Self' Raab is absent) as they perform the most outrageous life. treatment, and rebellious stunts conceivable. I'm not going to tell you what the stunts are, but I will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sick or psychologically scary, and the one that the member (again, does not tell) will flirt with death several times the movie. <br /> <br /> What makes Jackass number two so entertaining is not the stunts themselves, but how the cast responds to them and does so. To put it simply, if they love it and have it, you also have (it's 99% of the stunts). All the stunts are very original, and 90% of them have never been seen before. You will see some recycled people, but they are over. You will not really think to set factors in such a movie, but it does; Jeff Tremaine's direction makes the movie so much more beautiful, as he gives guidance to the gang in their comic timing, which is simply brilliant. He could just sit and sleep throughout the filming (actually you will see in the movie that he has filmed a movie), but he went there and helped this crazy guy make the stunts as funny as he could . I give Mr. Tremaine two inches before. Another good thing about Jackass is the bonanza of celebrity cameos, and this time they include BMX legend Mat Hoffman, skateboard god Tony Hawk, director / actor Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers & Beerfest), actor Luke Wilson, Miami Dolphins star Jason Taylor, and director / actor Mike Judge (Office Space). The scenes with Hoffman, Taylor and Chandrasekhar are one of the funniest in the film, as it is even more beautiful to see these men as part of the movie. Jackass Number Two is one of the most politically wrong, morally humiliating, and simply erroneous films of all time, if not most. Despite this, it's so original and so hilarious that you won't mind it. You sneak for the air, laugh so loudly, you will cry and jump out of your seat all over the film. Due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this movie, no one under 18 should see this movie. You're warned. I hope you enjoy Jackass Number Two as much as I did. <br /> <br /> 10/10 - spy
