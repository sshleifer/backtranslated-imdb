It is a story of a long and uncomfortable love. The daily life of a 50-year-old woman and some around her is portrayed. Her daily life is so common and routine that I doubt who was the right main character in the beginning. Then the audience knows that the woman and a man who was her high school classmate had very little connection. The woman did the same job for so long - a milk wife and a supermarket. There are so many slopes that deliver milk bottles, is a very hard work. The man married another woman, who is now dying of cancer. He works at the city hall and cares for her at home. They never look straight or talk to each other, but they never forget each other. <br /> <br /> The original Japanese title means "at some time the days you read books". But of course when the man said "Now I want to do what I always wanted to do", it was to hug and love her with her. She wrote to a radio disc jockey that "If God gives us time to talk, we need at least a whole day". Dream of that day, she sublimated the desire for hard work and book reading. I personally know a woman who has long loved a man, even after he married another woman and died for an accident. That's why the story environment isn't that special. On the contrary, this film presents unusual romance in many ordinary men and women. Through this movie you will remember your long lost romance. It's a movie with lasting effect.
