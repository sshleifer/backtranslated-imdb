Why couldn't the end of the movie Sean Connery's men fight the French instead of the Germans? Since the French occupied Algeria in 1830, the tribes of Morocco and those of Algeria made invasions on the French military and civilian settlements. This movie could have been a continuous of the historical aspect where the French seized the Rasuadli, so that his followers would not seize Algeria, and then his followers would have attacked the French to free him. <br /> <br /> The movie is still stereotypical of shooting between the Germans and the Americans. When the Americans shoot the Germans, their guns (even the pistols) make loud noises, creating huge bloody bullet wounds, and shouting their enemies after they're shot. When the Germans shoot at the Americans, their guns do not make big noises, do not make bloody wounds, and their enemies make little or no noise after they are shot. <br /> <br /> In real life, the US Rifle was the worst rifle America ever produced until the early release of the M-16. The Force was difficult to maintain, not reliable, and the gun bolt was always stuck. The German Mauser was one of the world's best guns. We were so impressed with the Spanish American war that we made a copy of it and called it the Springfield rifle. <br /> <br /> Finally, the people of Morocco have a word for artillery, as the French were used. they attacked Morocco. I didn't like it when they made the Rasuldai stupid that there was no word for artillery in Moorish vocabulary. Instead, the Rasuadli said the Europeans had guns on wheels that shook the ground.
