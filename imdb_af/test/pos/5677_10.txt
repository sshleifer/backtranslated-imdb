BLACK WATER should be one of the best Australian movies I've seen in many years. My girlfriend and I tackled each other's hands and jumped into all the right places. It's so much a crocodile movie, because OPENWATER was a shark movie. In other words, the beings are merely part of the dilemma, the fall in which people find themselves in circumstances. How director Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich strangle so much tension and terror from such a modest situation is great to see how they unfold. And when I say fright, it is not over-moving, artificially confronted moments, but little more that when you ask yourself, "How will I feel in that situation," you lead to ending "scared whiteless". The performances were wonderful, the pacing and beautiful vantage points for the other mangroves were excellent and the end-time of the movie felt right. This is an appropriate feature debut for two directors who must rightfully be proud of. Check out this very nice shot and acted tension film.
