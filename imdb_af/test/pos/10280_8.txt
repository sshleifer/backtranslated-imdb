Not all movies should have the predictable end to which we are all so used, and it is great to see movies with very unusual twists. But with that said, I was very disappointed at the end of the apartment. In my opinion, the end didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie and it destroyed the story being told. <br /> <br /> You are spending the whole movie discovering everyone and their feelings, but events in the last 2 minutes of the movie would have greatly influenced everyone's character, but the movie ends and leaves it too wide open. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was made very well, and unlike similar films like Serendipity all the screens were credible and did not go over.
