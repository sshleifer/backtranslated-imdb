I love this Western Starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Ford.it has pretty much everything that western needs. There are gunfights, action, chasing horses. There is a bit of a romance angle pointed out. There is some pretty comical relief in the form of Edgar Buchanan, who plays Uncle Willie McLeod, a character who pretends to be a deadly old fool, but is actually aware of everything that is going on. Randolph Scott plays the city sheriff and Glenn Ford plays Cheyenne Rogers / Bill Smith, a runaway out-of-bounds who eventually tries to change his ways. I like the different characters in the movie. I didn't always play it fast, but I never found it boring. Although the film is in 1943, it is in color. 8/10
