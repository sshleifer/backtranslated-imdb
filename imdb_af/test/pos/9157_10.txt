Hey, you're not alone! I remember Nichols! I was just 17 when it was on. I remember James Garner was one of the coolest actors, and Nichols was such a good performance. I couldn't believe it was so short time, wish I could remember the last episode, I probably didn't see it ... there were no vrr, so when it was up, you saw it and if you were a missed episode it was gone forever, unless it returned on summer reruns. Anyway, it would be good if it came to DVD, but I don't think many people even knew about it. What a shame. <br /> <br /> Garner will hit Rockford Files a few years later, and he brought Nichols's friend Stuart Margolin to play his sidekick Angel.
