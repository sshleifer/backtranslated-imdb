What a journey to the memory lane. <br /> <br /> Don't look for great plays, credible plot lines, or something that looks like a quality movie. <br /> <br /> It is pure blast exploitation at its best. Scandalous outfits, unspeakable dialogue, women's objections, and the most beautiful police you can imagine. <br /> <br /> This vanity piece of the "Godfather of Rap", Rudy Ray Moore, which was good for us last week, is the standard by which all blow operation is measured. <br /> <br /> Not only do you see blaxploitation at its best, but get a glimpse of its comedy genius and see why its records are kept under the counter.
