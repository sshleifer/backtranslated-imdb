It's a strange and compelling movie. The subject, about the atomic bombs created in Los Alamos, NM in the US and used in Japan during the second half of World War II, is huge and of course deeply disturbing. The movie's plot has a lot of trouble and the actors need a lot of creative tension. I have never seen the movie, or have been very interested in what I must admit until I read the book "Smoke in Bed: Conversations with Bruce Robinson." Robinson wrote the story and script. I think the movie was better than I expected to read Robinson's point of view about it, but I can see how he thought it was derailed. I think Paul Newman is pretty good, but is somehow down, disliked. He's too Hollywood. At one stage a big, ingenious man storms into Newman's office and has such a striking presence, I immediately thought he should play the character Newman plays. The other chief, who plays the mainstream, is also pretty good, but somehow not brilliant enough to portray the great anxiety associated with the part of the game - the tremendous responsibility for creating " an ultimate machine of death and destruction. One of the more effective characters seems to be a composite personality, played by John Cusack. He's strangely up and running, and finally the character whose fate really gets home and reminds me of the fate of over 200,000 Japanese people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
