A fantastic movie experience. I really enjoyed seeing this wonderful movie in the theater when it came out. There is nothing to add, except it is a terrible shame that Mr. Albert Finney not yet accepted by AMPAS (American Academy). After roles in movies like Tom Jones, Murder on the Orient Express, under the volcano (to name but a few - for this he was nominated for the Oscar), the Dresser is probably his highlight, but ... <br /> < I know, Oscars is just popularity competition, but as Americans such as British actors and actresses ("and the Oscar goes to" Jeremy Irons, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Glenda Jackson, etc. deserve the award!), Why have they always left empty-handed with Mr. Finney? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, they gave it to John Wayne and Marisa Tomei (in Cousin Vinny). I don't know, I have to laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> If you saw the two slots in The Dresser, you won't forget the art of acting. Watch this movie and enjoy! I recommend it to everyone who loves art. <br /> <br /> I give 9/10 for this excellent movie (1 point is missing for non-film material, after all it's just a theater) <br /> <br /> Note: My criteria are much stronger than this on IMDb (only 10 for the movie masterpiece that can last forever).
