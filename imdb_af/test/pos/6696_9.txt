As with some of the best films and series, I almost stumbled across it. It was late, a storm was in full force outside and I sat comfortably on the couch when I hit a channel that only showed one of the episodes. I just meant to watch a few minutes while waiting for the ads to finish on another channel before switching back to some or other sitcom. About an hour and a half later I remembered my decision and was so glad I didn't. Needless to say I made sure I saw all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> John Hannah is brilliant in almost everything I saw him, and he does not leave here either. All other cast members also do a star job. My personal favorite (except John Hannah, of course) is Gerard Murphy. <br /> <br /> The only negative side of this series is the limited number of episodes. Only 8 with JH himself and another with someone else. I'd love to see McCallum again on the screen, though it should be with JH!
