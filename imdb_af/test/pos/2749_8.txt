Central airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has a bad flight in more than 4000 hours and is forced to give commercial flight. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start with an act of flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim hurts, his brother (Tom Brown) takes action and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things are exciting and terribly sad. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pre-code due to several reasons. First, Jim and Jill performed their relationship without being married and with no intention of having a wedding. Secondly, Eilers is shown in her underwear, and the scene is absolutely limited when the Production Code came into effect. <br /> <br /> This movie does not fall on the dramatic love triangle and therefore ends up bittersweet.
