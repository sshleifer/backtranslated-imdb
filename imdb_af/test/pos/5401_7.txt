The NYT review says that Sigourney Weaver's character is stiff and frustrated, and later she can be the sister of MTM's character in Ordinary People. What do you say? Not at all. This lady was from the beginning. Nothing like MTM in ordinary people. Sorry. <br /> <br /> Next, the NYT notes that Sigourney Weaver's Sandy Travis and Jeff Daniel's Ben Travis are 40-year-olds, "Children of the 60's." Ms Weaver should dance a gig. I believe when she made Imaginary Heroes, she was actually 55 years old. She was born in 1949. <br /> <br /> NYT perception corrections aside, this was a good movie, as it was made by someone so young. Clearly, Sigourney Weaver thought so, and so did Jeff Daniels. The young man playing Tim was excellent. <br /> <br /> There are some critical comments I could make about writing. So I never really had a good sense of why Sandy Travis missed her son. Her kind of disconcerting behavior was possibly caused by his death, but that this behavior Â¾ had taken off the road through the movie I felt had more to do with her stagnation marriage, her relationship with Tim and where he came from. , and other unresolved issues, than of any grief of her older son. Ben's grief was much clearer. <br /> <br /> So Matt Travis was an asshole. Did his mother think so too? Still, a very viewable movie. What is clearer and clearer is not that there are no roles for women over a certain age, rather than requiring it, a director like this one is so much in love with an older woman (Ms Weaver) and almost making his movie is a tribute to her. Kind of an anti-Woody Allen.
