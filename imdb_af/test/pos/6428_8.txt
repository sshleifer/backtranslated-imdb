This is actually a very good surreal secret movie, despite the description it is trying to sell as a sci-fi movie. Balkan stars as a woman rushed by mysterious visions and lost memories she is trying to work with. She spent the majority of the movie making sense of her vision. Very atmospheric and effective. True, Kinski does not appear much in this movie, but the staring actors are very good. There is only one English baptized version available in the US, and the dubbing leaves something to be desired, but the actors do a very good job. The cinematography, by Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro, is excellent. An earlier Giallo by director Bazzoni, the fifth cord, is also excellent, and also by Storarro gelens.
