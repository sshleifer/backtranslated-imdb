The Falcon and the snowman are based on a true story. Christopher Boyce, and Andrew Daulton Lee (the titular traitors) played by Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn, received their code names from the KGB. Why? Boyce was an avid hawk and Lee was a cook. The movie is based on a true story. It is based on the book of the same name. Another reviewer asked what was their motivation? Disillusionment is not. Ideology is not. (Forget my bad grammar), but I'm making a point here. What was it if it wasn't disillusionment or ideology? In a word, greed. By the time of the Boyce-Lee case, money became the main motivator and not ideology. Don't believe me? Then look at the Walker Family Spy Ring that was broken in the late 80's. Three spies had the worst damage to our national security in the 70s and 80s. John Walker, who began his career as a spy in the 60's, Christopher Boyce, and Andrew Daulton Lee. All three sold out this country for thirty pieces of silver. If you are not familiar with that phrase, I suggest you read the Bible.
