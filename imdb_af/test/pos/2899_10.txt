Personally, I consider the "Egyptian" in a very favorable light. <br /> <br /> It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian film commentary and critic, Bill, who was known for his insight and broad vision of people & places and especially of movies. This film has perfectly applied the Bill and I appreciated its comments and enthusiasm for this movie, more than I watched it. As I wrote it literally, he took my minute for the minute, except for his introductory remarks, on my first performance many years ago. <br /> <br /> For me, it was driven in half an hour into an intriguing and engaging production on the lowest layer. Yes, I am aware of his mistakes! But this was so tempting? The young man of idealism learns and is inspired by his father? The farmer was in his suffering as a litter? However, the opportunistic friend is flawed, but still loves his friend, the central character Sinute ?? And surely, a defective hero, as so much about mankind of all societies and all the time, but loving and worthy of love too! Yes, I believe in a Christian God, but I also acknowledge the rights and respects that need to be. Any person of good heart who will or will not respect the rights of his fellowman without reason. As such, I endorse this film and its representation of a man of good heart and belief in his belief in the sun god he is dedicated to. Such people will always be welcome in my world vision, and hopefully, in much more beyond. <br /> <br /> Also, the drama in the ensuing movie I watched so often how it touched my heart and soul, as surely as it seems he has elicited critics in his era. It's fascinating, watch the struggle and sorrow and love of Sinute, the doctor! When I see it again, I am always reminded of my friend in the heart of Bill, the film critic, who has long resisted all the critics who rubbed it off. He added criticism to too many critics? that they make statues to honor stars, on the screen or in history, but they do not make statues to honor critics! And besides, I am reminded of every look of a SUPERB & TOUCHING spectacle, of a beautiful and well-presented drama. It was not only relevant to the 1950s or an early era. It was meant for YOU & ME, over time and place, for every man and woman and child, and for their personal aspirations for love and freedom and overcoming barriers to misunderstanding and injustice and tragedy that are attractive to the simple faith of many religions. it seems too much cause for war! Take a night off of invitations or unfair violence, of bigotry and disastrous attacks on others who have been wronged and consider the merits of this offer. Not to the sun god or to power that prove time and again to be so exaggerated. Let this outstanding movie over you, like waves on a beach, like the passing hands of time? like life was meant to be. And maybe you find yourself in his world of possibilities! Lost offers no longer! 9.9 out of 10!
