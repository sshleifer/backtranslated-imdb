In my opinion, dad's army is your best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you only watch one episode of the show, you can't quite judge on one episode (it includes the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, inside the characters, become familiar with the environment and The situations in which they are in. When you get acquainted with the performance, it will appeal to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the slightly disappointing series, but it still works. Look at a series or two of the show before watching it. You won't be disappointed. Good episode to watch is "No Spring for Frazer"
