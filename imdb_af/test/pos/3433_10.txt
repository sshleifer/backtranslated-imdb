First of all - I never see Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life, I watch a Swedish movie at the theater! That's why I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of excitement and humor is outstanding, and sometimes you don't even know if you're scared or just laughing! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans start. On his way to Germany, he tried to help his friends on the train, but that was a bad idea. What a rubbish! And arm Robert Gustafsson - the wounded soldier - always gets in the way ... OUCH !!! But he still has his big mood. A positive guy. Robert Gustafsson has done some less good movies over the past few years, and it's really a relief. He is wonderful in this movie. After all - this is one of the best Swedish movies ever, and Peter Dalle has made an excellent job! Congratulations!
