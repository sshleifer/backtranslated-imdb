Blythe Danner and Judith Ivey perform wonderful performances here as Jonathan Silverman, like Eugene, tells his life in 1937's Brighton Beach. <br /> <br /> What makes the movie so good is the relationships between characters with a backdrop of extraordinarily wonderful family values. <br /> <br /> Bob Dishy had a great opportunity here as the father of the clan. He gives a limited but compelling performance as the patriarch of the family. <br /> <br /> His sons played by Jonathan Silverman and Brian Dillinger are fabulous. There are some scenes when Silverman skating or jumping where I am reminded of Jerry Lewis. <br /> <br /> As far as Danner and Ivey are concerned, they are also wonderful. Their ways, intonation and idealism of Jewish culture are beautifully realized by them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is just wonderful. Beautiful Brighton in 1937! Even if the inevitability of the war is doomed, the film is rich in many of the typical problems that families experience during that time. In a sense, you don't have to be Jewish to experience what the family is doing. <br /> <br /> A must see for nostalgic buffs and those who believe so strongly in family values.
