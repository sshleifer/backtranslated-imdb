Filmed less than a year after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the subject was fresh in the minds of the cast, the director and the audience. Most of the cast are real soldiers and officials just back from the war. The Soviet army worked quite a bit during filming, which is strange. <br /> <br /> The Afghan intervention was a bloody and useless war in which even the generals forgot about the reasons for bloodshed. This film shows the tensions and cruelty of military life, the emotional atrophy experienced by the troops and the pain that torn a small nation torn by war and civil war. <br /> <br /> There is no lack of powerful scenes. . One of the first is footage of steel coffins loaded onto a USSR-bound transport. Solders are about to work while an officer quietly marks the destinations: Moscow, Rostov, Donetsk, The Baltic. <br /> <br /> A previous comment describes the last scene with Maj. Bandura as illogical. It is quite logical and in the spirit of the film: the only human relationship Bandura maintained was with the Afghan family he accidentally killed in the attack. After losing his only buffer against the futility of the war, Bandura turned his back on the boy (and his gun) in his resignation. <br /> <br /> I especially had the last scene: a flock of MI-28s climb over the mountains as the voice of a pilot shouts: "Uhodim! Uhodim rebyata! (We leave! Boys, we go! ) In a tone of sincere relief. <br /> <br /> Afhanskii Izlom is an excellent movie - brutally honest and unhealthy as they come.
