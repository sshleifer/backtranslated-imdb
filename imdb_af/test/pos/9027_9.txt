I really can't see why people look like this movie. I found it very entertaining (of course the fact that it is the beautiful Laura Fraser, a bonus!) When I first heard it, I thought it would be in the direction of a reversed "Weird Science" and after an extent, that is true, but there is a twist that I really did not see. After seeing the trailer on the DVD (which I haven't seen before watching the movie), I saw that the "turn" is actually shown in the trailer! Very strange. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, the "Weird Science" equation fits more or less, and I think it's the best of the two movies. Certainly, there are some scenes that do not work wonderfully, but are made up of the enthusiasm of the young role. <br /> <br /> In summary, I suggest this is a good example of a Scientific-Chick, and I don't think I've seen many of them!
