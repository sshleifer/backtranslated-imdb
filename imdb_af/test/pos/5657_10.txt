This is one of the most anti-traditional war movies on what I saw. Instead of the typical films that emphasize the glory and perhaps superhuman characters (such as John Wayne), this film is exactly the opposite - emphasizing the de-humanization that also happens in the war. The story relates to the Japanese who were stranded in the Philippines after the US returned in late 1944 early 1945. By the time the movie started, the Japanese were clearly beaten, but because of Bushido's insane logic, they could not consider surrender. At one of the very moving moments, the main character at the beginning of the film is told to report to the hospital as he is unable to fight because of his TB. The problem is that the hospital won't accept him, so his commander said he was going to the hospital again - and if they didn't accept him, he would blow him with a grenade! Well, it only happens in the first five minutes of the movie - much worse things happen to this soldier and the few stragglers because they will not surrender. Plus, there's a case in the movie where a soldier is trying to surrender, but is being shot down. It happened much later in the war because so often the surviving Japanese soldiers caught booby to blow up when they got close. In addition, the film shows the most spectacular depiction of famine and the accompanying madness of any movie I've seen. In addition, cannibalism, cowardice and betrayal can all accompany this very keen, realistic and depressed realistic film. You simply couldn't have made a better movie of this type. Horrible but great.
