Although flawed in the view of homosexuals, this movie will shed light on the viewer over the myths and inaccuracies regarding AIDS. Despite the oppressive topic, this film portrays a warm friendship between two boys, and you will also make you laugh and cry. Well done by everyone, especially Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro. The language is a bit strong, though appropriate, and it is an entertaining and intelligent movie for the whole family. But remember to have the Kleenex ready!
