"If I die, someone will bury me. And if they don't, what's the difference. Who gives a damn, huh?" So summed up the view of life (or lack thereof) in less than classic, yet funny spinoff of Sergio Leone's "Dollars Trilogy". <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, three naturally evil armed men are driving in a western village and, with threatening glares, intimidating all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes. The acting viewer will see that each of these three has a striking resemblance to characters from Leone's For A Few Dollars More. There is one man in Eastwood's poncho, one in Lee Van Cleef's black suit, and one that looks like Gian Marie Volonte's Indio. But this movie is not about these guys. Not soon they drive into town when they are knocked down by someone who is cooler than they are, a mysterious bounty hunter, just like the Alien. <br /> <br /> No. This is a completely different story. <br /> <br /> In a clear copy of Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, three armed men are trying again for a hidden treasure. Again there is the bounty hunter and the Mexican bandit. The stranger (George Hilton) is a super-cool bounty hunter with a love of shooting people while dressed like a priest. He is after the reward for the bandit Monetero (Gilbert Roland). But if Monetero's gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins, the Stranger is pulled off his normal line of work. <br /> <br /> To end the trio, Edd Byrne's corrupt bank manager, Clayton. He also wants the money for himself. But after the money was hid, the only man who knew where it was shot was shot. Now the only hint for the hiding point is a medal that carries a family crest. The game is also to find the treasure before anyone else does it. And every gun can play. <br /> <br /> With many rifle battles, fist battles and double crosses, the action takes these three to the ultimate action ripoff, a three-way draw for the hidden treasure, ala The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - but with a twist. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie isn't as good as Leone's movies, but in the end what a damn makes, huh? This movie is fun - 60's nihilism, spaghetti western style. There are no rules, no lasting loyalty, not right or wrong - just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it. And although the movie is not classic, the end is definitely. Hey, maybe we can all get together right away, for a hundred thousand a piece. <br /> <br /> If you like spaghetti westerns, watch this one. It's fast, furious and worth the look.
