Ocean's 12 <br /> <br /> "If you steal fifty million dollars, they'll get you." (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Die Hard) <br /> <br /> This adage is certainly true in this sequel. Terry Benedict was informed that Danny Ocean and his fellow members were the people who tore him and now he wants it all back. The Ocean gang needs a lot of money and fast, but can't work in the states, as Benedict made it impossible for them. It is therefore from Europe to carry out acts of death, while avoiding Catherine Zeta Jones' superman, an old flame of Rusty's (Pitt) past. <br /> <br /> On their first lift in Amsterdam, they find out who scratched them, was the Night Fox, a super smooth thief with a legend complex. He gives them a challenge that can fully write off their debt or put in a kind of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II burial-living-type order. Interesting? Well yes. Slowly? Sort of. Entertainment Like? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Very. <br /> <br /> Ocean and his band of cheerful men are charismatic, as nothing else and as it is a successor and we are all old friends we see even more 'pals' situations and conversations. Too much. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins ​​are scared as we knew they would; Bernie Mac speaks too much and Don Cheadle's cock-no accent is as bad as ever (I really like Cheadle but couldn't obey it). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, fill each other's glasses and read each other's thoughts. But what worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development compared to how smooth the whole damn was. And as much as these actors work well, Zeta Jones fits in this movie like a big square pen in a tight 11-sided hole. She simply didn't fit and her chemistry with Pitt didn't exist. <br /> <br /> However, the stars of this movie for me were Vincent Cassel as the Night Fox and Soderbergh's choice of venues. Cassel plays pump and wealth as if he were both born. His Night Fox is arrogant, "terribly cavalier with other people's lives" (Danny Ocean) and a total contrast with the Ocean gang. That's where I think the movie is losing its way. Cassel and the European sites offer an all-realistic contrast with American actors and the style of the first film. We want to be slim, brash and quick witted; not cruel, contemplated and intellectual. That's where the movie doesn't work. <br /> <br /> You can't repeat the same formula twice at the letter, but left or right usually do more damage than good in a mainstream movie like this.
