"Eighteen" (2004) tells the story of Pip Anders, a depressed and extremely cynical young man, alienated from his dysfunctional upper / middle-class family and living in the streets of Vancouver. On his 18th birthday, he received a cassette and player from his late-deceased grandfather, whose memoirs of his own 18th birthday, worked with the British army in France, and tried to help a deadly companion avoid by the occupiers to catch. Germans. As Pip listens to the band (Ian McKellen has voiced his grandfather's voice), we see the screens he describes as flashbacks, alternating with daily scenes of Pip's life, as well as more recent flashbacks that fill the dark secret, why Pip's left home. <br /> <br /> An ambitious second film by writer / director Richard Bell ("Two Brothers"), with a polished look, excellent photography, well-developed non-star-like characters (with gay and straight looks equal) , and laudable efforts in the emotional and physically demanding roles of some talented new actors (especially Paul Anthony as Pip and Brendan Fletcher as his grandfather at 18). There is also a notable turn by Alan Cummings as a priest to help Pip, and a small supporting role played by Thea Gill ("Queer As Folk"). The complex story - in the director's own words in his DVD commentary - is meant to drive a "whirlpool of emotion" that Pip pushes to his breakpoint, and that certainly does. My only criticism is that the overall effect is "schmaltzy" or artificial for an audience that truly identifies with much of the supportive dialogue (and the end) to predict and predict, and the direction must be sharper to the sloppy offense. limited. some scenes. I recommend it, 7 stars out of 10, including extra points for a notable effort.
