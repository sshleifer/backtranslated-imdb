"twin peaks" and "blue velvet" have always been two of my favorite pieces of filmmaking. And although previous movies by lynch were a little disappointing to me, they were always worth a look a few times. To be pretentious, Lynch can be like a good wine - he must be tasted and rolled over. but in the end you have to make your own thoughts about what you have seen, because lynch never gives you the full answers. <br /> <br /> Many people go from 'mulholland drive' to the sensible visual puzzle that just unfolded before them. but there is a twisted logic to this movie, just look at the clues. Betty (Naomi Watts) comes in Hollywood, do-eyed and looking for stars. She then finds an amnesiac in her bathroom that has escaped a murder attempt on Mulholland row. together they try to uncover the secrets behind the amnesiac's life. all this leads to a club called silencio, where a blue box will reveal everything. And that's when the movie throws everything out of the window. people we thought we knew were completely different people altogether ... is this a dream? a reminder of previous escapades of life? You will also love or hate this movie. David Lynch always draws such extreme reactions from his viewers. But since his universe itself is always about extremes, it's fitting that his films elicit such reactions. <br /> <br /> It is best to consider this film thematically, rather than a straight forward. and appreciate the fact that lynch is a film maker who will still allow you to draw your own conclusions. he has had many mimics, especially in "vanilla sky", where a sensible film decides to give all the answers in the last rush five minutes and you will probably forget the movie once you go out of the theater. Mulholland driving will haunt you.
