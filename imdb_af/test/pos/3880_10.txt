I thought it was brilliant! It was wonderful that the presenter watched each of them. Dwight Schultz still looks the same, he has hardly changed the look, and did not have Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as neatly! I thought Mr. T looked even thinner, but it was still nice to see how he looked after all this time. I thought it did a bit to watch the other cast members, like the one Decker played, and the lady Amy played. It was a pity that Mr. T could not make the real reunion. It was also a great shame that George Peppard died, leaving a gap like that. I just wish I had tied it up to keep it. Let's hope they repeat it again.
