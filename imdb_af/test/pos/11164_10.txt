I just watched this movie in a preview and I can only recommend seeing it. It was about 90 minutes long and when it was over, I felt it could take hours. The stories of the protagonists are so realistic and you really feel at home. The movie basically consists of dialogues, but I wasn't bored for a moment. 18 people from many different characters and each one performed so well. I had to laugh, feel uncomfortable, sad and still feel lucky. All in all, it is a movie that shows the different kinds of people in our society, how they communicate and how love has changed and is now being treated as an economic thing. Dating becomes something similar to an audition. The whole audience loved it. So, please check if that is possible. You will love it!
