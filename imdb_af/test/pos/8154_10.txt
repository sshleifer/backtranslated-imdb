I watched this movie on LOGO television today. I was absolutely surprised by the powerful messages and plot line within this movie. I don't want to spoil it. I will say, I concern Aaron's inner struggle and his education. As a gay man who grew up in a small town, I was so related to the "big secret" and the choices I made. This movie has made a huge impact on me and I plan to buy a copy of it for my personal library in the near future. I didn't finish the movie anymore and started calling my friends to recommend it. This had a lot of my effect. To those who read this comment. Beware. Try to have as little distraction as possible. Also, keep an open mind. It's not a movie that can be seen like a Disney movie or the movie of the week. Instead, take the time to watch and actively listen to the dialogue, as well as to read between the lines and engage in the plot. You may find yourself in tears. Not since "Steel Magnolias" I was moved by a movie to tears. This one did just as well. Thanks to the film and writer and crew for producing an emotionally charged romantic film about homosexuality and religion. It was long overdue.
