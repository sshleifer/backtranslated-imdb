Of the characters that were previously developed in a series of many beloved short shorts, the COURSE OF THE WERE RABBIT is so far from the milestone "family money" that you can get: beautifully crafted and with witty dialogue and clever concepts, it's really " a movie that will appeal to almost every member of the family. <br /> <br /> The story is about Wallace and his dog, Gromit, who lives in a town that is growing big vegetables for the annual scholarship and working "Anti-Pesto", a human solution. for all the troublesome rabbits that make passionate gardeners everywhere. The business is a great success, but Wallace proves a little too clever for his own good. When he tries to rehabilitate rabbits from their vegetable wreath, he unexpectedly unleashes an ancient horror of legendary relationships: the Were-Rabbit! And suddenly no vegetables in the village are safe! The movie is full of crazy inventions, unexpectedly smart dialogue, and references to everything from KING KONG to THE WOLFMAN - more than enough to attract even a charged teenager - but the real charm of the thing is in its characters. The amount of personality that the artists and animators of clay can wring is wonderful: they look as alive as any flesh-and-blood actor. The DVD release (and I recommend the widescreen) also includes a number of informative and entertaining extras. Highly recommended! GFT, Amazon Reviewer
