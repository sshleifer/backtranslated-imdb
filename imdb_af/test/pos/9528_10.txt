I try to catch this movie every time it is shown on TV, which is very happy. But I keep forgetting to video it. As it is, I know the writing practically, but it doesn't stop me crying, but it probably adds. I cry to know what comes next. It's such a beautiful film - well made, well-thrown, good photography. I love it. One of my top ten movies.
