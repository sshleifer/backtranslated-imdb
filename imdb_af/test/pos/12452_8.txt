Although films about Edgar Rice Burrough's famous Rousseau hero Tarzan have been seen by filmmakers for almost a century, it is the definitive version of the story. Greystoke is the true story of Tarzan's origins, as restored by Edgar Rice Burroughs in the second decade of last century. I was assured by experts. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and Sherlock Holmes are probably the most filmed fictional heroes in history. I have no basis for saying this, just a nice feeling. The most popular Holmes was Basil Rathbone, the most popular Tarzan was Johnny Weissmuller. And movies made with both characters will not be criticized by purists. <br /> <br /> But Greystoke is the real deal, a faithful adaptation of Burrough's first story about the emergence of his hero. I can't think of another movie that shows Tarzan has learned French for English, but it is shown here and that is just natural, as it was a French survivor of a murdered safari played by Ian Holm. who discovered Tarzan who was raised by the monkeys. since his parents who fled on the African coast died after his mother gave birth. <br /> <br /> His parents were actually the son and daughter-in-law of the Earl of Greystoke and the surviving spokesman, played. by Ralph Richardson is obviously happy to learn he has a grandson. Of course there are others who do not welcome the new heir to society. <br /> <br /> One who doesn't play Andie McDowell is, of course, Jane. She does not communicate with Tarzan in response to his grunts and monosyllabic commands. Tarzan speaks a brief English, French, and also understands the language of the monkeys. As for the language of love, Tarzan and Jane need no lessons. <br /> <br /> Greystoke has won three Oscar nominations for the best make-up in the apes, the best custom screenplay and a posthumous nomination for Ralph Richardson for the best supporting actor. It also had to be a nomination for cinematography of the jungle scene in Cameroon and the scenes of British Aristocracy in various landmarks such as Hatfield House and Blenheim Palace. <br /> <br /> Greystoke is the right thing for Burroughs purists. .
