First, it is pure joy to hear that the legend performs so wonderful and timeless music. This movie and soundtrack is a tour of the power. Ray Charles is unique and wonderful. I really loved the movie because it was inspiring and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx has become one of the leading actors in Hollywood, as shown clearly in Ray, and he must get an Oscar for this role. This is unprecedented. In fact, everyone who worked on this film should receive awards. I really liked Kerry Washington who played the exceptional woman. Of course, Ray Charles faithfully married. Regina King is a good actress as well as the extraordinary Sharon Warren who plays a struggling young mother. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, I want to say this whole project is foreseeable. The whole movie was perfect, great screenplay and fantastic settings ... great props to director Taylor Hackford and the crew to do such a beautiful job to bring Ray Charles's life so flawless on the screen. This is my photo of the year, certainly one of the best biographical films ever made.
