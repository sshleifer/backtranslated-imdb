The main attraction of Anywhere, but Here's the beautiful display of Natalie Portman. She greatly appreciated her rather ungrateful character emotionally. Susan Sarandon, a fine actress, is sincerely sincere as the mother figure. I thought the chemistry between the two stars was credible, a chemistry that could be more developed with a more relevant writing. I'm not saying the script is bad in any way, but I just say it sometimes looks undeveloped. I don't think it was the author's fault. The film suffered as though it was overlapping, and sometimes became indifferent in the long scenes. The film looks pretty, with some good direction and excellent performances. All in all, vigilantly sure, but perhaps more for an older audience. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
