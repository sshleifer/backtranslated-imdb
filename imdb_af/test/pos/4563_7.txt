Sharpe's Honor for the uninitiated, is the fifth entry into a series of TV movies focusing on an English army during the Napoleonic wars and based on Bernard Cornwell's books (which I highly recommend reading). However, if you start looking at this particular one, you will get the impression that Sharpe is not as much a soldier as the very centrifugal force that turns the rest of the army. If so, I would recommend starting with earlier chapters like Sharpe's Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but it's a worthy choice for a second show. <br /> <br /> The story this time is all about the spies of things. With the French army faltering in Spain, Major Ducos, the slimy spy master gives the opportunity to reverse the situation. By capturing the murder of a Spanish Marques to Richard Sharpe, the hero of the British army, the fragile British / Spanish alliance will begin to crumble and things will turn back. However, when the Spanish nobles come to Wellington to cry for Sharpe's blood, the English general is less than willing to hang his best soldier, killing his death. He will soon be on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who master the plot. Surprisingly enough for a Sharpe movie, there is also a beautiful woman who can be saved along the way. Of course, this means a more adventurous approach. The concentration is less on the work of the English army with Sharpe as the image chief and concentrates more on his escape into the countryside, unleashed French patrols, stove with Spanish guerrillas and become involved in daring escapes from fortified military positions. Sergeant Harper, his loyal right-hand man, accompanies him, but the rest of the riflemen remain unaware that their leader is still alive. Strangely, they actually get more attention than usual, as they end up in their own subplot with the delivery of Harper's baby. <br /> <br /> This slightly different approach makes for an interesting episode, but is just a good thing in the long run. And should anyone worry that there will not be the standard fight against the climax, because again poor poor French will get a head start. In addition, Ducos makes a fantastic successor to Obadiah Hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate. He is a double, malicious and absolutely evil son of a female dog, and it also reflects it strangely to that black-haired guy from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman is very prominent, as he gets the chance to get more screen time and comes across as the kind of man you want to make your first born, even though he looks like a member of Iron Maiden who accidentally hijacked back. <br /> <br /> In short, another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as ever, but considerably more bitter and angry, this time the events in the previous film have given. It is not the best introduction if you have not seen any of the other chapters, but it does point to Sharpe that we will not normally witness: the action hero rather than the professional soldier. And if that's not enough to tempt you, it's also worth watching for the rather surrealistic face of a raging Sean Bean swinging a live chicken at a group of nuns.
