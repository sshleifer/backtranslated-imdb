This movie is not a comedy, it's a barefoot. I always hated dog shows, taking into account the ridiculous get-ups people bring their dogs and the idiotic names they give them. Hence the reason for my uncontrolled lashing while watching this movie. I get a kick out of something that is taken so seriously, though the profits are small and insignificant. It's like miniature golf, or jumping ropes championships or the need to set up some dark world records. The play was much more refined in this film than Waiting for Guffman, and it is mainly due to the more fluidity of the characters who feel more comfortable with their particular acting partners in this film than the previous one. Eugene Levy was great, like Michael McKean and Fred Willard. However, these were the dogs that eventually stole the show. But then, whoever wants to see a lot of people in a movie about dogs?
