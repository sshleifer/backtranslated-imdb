Alter Egos is not more beautiful than the creation of Sacha Baron Cohen's Ali G. Totally deceived by his deceptive and non-existent sense of the Middle English suburban environment in which his social background exists. He continues to live the style of a Los Angeles Gansta. While still living at his Gran in the London suburb of Staines, he holds tight control over his posts, the West Staines "Massive". <br /> <br /> Spend his free time between my July, his girlfriend, the Posse and teaching local eight-year-old Scouts at "Keep It Real" lessons at the Government Funding John Nike Leisure Center. <br /> <br /> That's where the story begins, it is said that government funding has ceased, Ali G continues on a sole proprietorship. "In the struggle for justice I want to be willing to lay down life, just as Martin Luther Van Dross has." This is his answer to the local media crew when questioning him with hunger strike while chained to a fence. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance plays here David Carlton, the sinister and divisive Deputy Prime Minister, who is "even more like Skeletor". Use Ali G, unaware, to lose the First Minster 18 000 votes three weeks before the General Election. If he sees Ali G as a clumsy idiot, his plan goes back. Ali G suddenly becomes a nightmare and a savior of the people working directly with the Prime Minster. The story becomes more sinister and hilarious. <br /> <br /> Ali G Indahouse is a great British film that brings along the highly talented writing skills, along with Dan Mazer, executive production and acting Sacha Baron Cohen. Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, as the P.M. play their parts with great seriousness under the gags and hilarious Ali G. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the parodies are playing their parts in a truly real world and who constantly proclaim "Keep It Right" From Their own little world that is West Staines "Massiv" is a true comic paradox. <br /> <br /> Directed by Mark Mylod, his first full-length feature film since directing television work such as Shameless, Shooting Stars, The Fast Show and the Reeves and Mortimer's to name a few. <br /> <br /> Many real and very funny.
