Madonna is back in action and she fails again! Who is that girl was released just one year after the big flop of Shanghai Surprise and two after the successful cult film Desperately seeking Susan. She decided to deal with forgetting the flop of the previous movie, and not to suspect that the latter could also be a flop. The film received a bad acceptance by American critic and audience, while it was a success in Europe. Madonna says "Some people don't want her to be successful as a pop star and a movie star". The soundtrack album, in which she sings four songs, sells well and the title track single is hit all over the world, such as the World Series. The truth is, Madonna failed as an actress, because the writing was pretty poor. Butit is not that bad, especially for those who love the 80's: it's such a ramshackle, trash, colorful and joyful action movie! In the end it is very funny to see it.
