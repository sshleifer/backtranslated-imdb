Solve based on actual events, "River's Edge" is a movie, much in the style of David Lynch, about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends, but no one does it long . time. With a top speed acting by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper, we can forgive the average of everyone in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a young boy, Tim (Joshua John Miller) a doll of a bridge (murder # 1). Tim then heard someone screaming. As he looked up, he saw Samson (Daniel Roebuck) on the bank of the river with the dead naked body of his girlfriend behind him (murder # 2). Samson eventually points the body to his friends. Everyone was terrified, not only because of the murder, but also because the victim, Jamie (Danyi Deats), was a friend of theirs. Despite this, no one goes to the police. You may think it's unrealistic, but that's what happened in the right story. If you are familiar with the story of "Alpha Dog" (2006), you will know that the same thing happened there. Through it all, Layne (Crispin Glover) works to keep Samson safe, though no one (including Samson) cares to keep him out of the way. As time goes on, we learn that Feck (Dennis Hopper), a middle-aged closed-up drug drug to local teens, also killed a woman (murder # 3). From there, things start to close with Samson and his friends, and eventually everything is revealed, but not as you expect. <br /> <br /> In the film we learn about three murders, each with a different reason, a different reaction, and another effect on those involved. When Tim drops his younger sister's doll out of the bridge, we're never made aware of his motive. However, we see the reaction of the younger sister. She cries and screams while her mother consoles her. Later, her older brother, Matt (Keanu Reeves), helps her put a cross in the backyard in memory of her doll. The murder of Jamie indignant all (except Samson who is apathetic to the whole situation, and when LÃ©ne asked why he did this, Samson replied: "She talked, but they didn't catch or shout. The run away and go on With their lives trying to forget what happened, in Feck's situation he did not kill his girlfriend out of hatred, we never really know why he killed her, but we see Feck is not proud of what he did He even mentions that he is sorry, and that she loved her, showing us the different ways in which we can be affected by death, and in the movie it is easy for us to identify with the teenagers because they do not know what they do not feel, or how they should feel about the death of their friend, in the same way we know the audience, not how to feel, because we do not know Jamie, we are apparently saddened by death and realize that Samson must be arrested, but we do not feel strong for Jamie a s an individual. <br /> <br /> There are several similarities between "River's Edge" and "Twin Peaks" (1990-1991), especially in the overall feel of the movie. I wonder if Mark Frost and David Lynch think of "River's Edge" when they created their series. After all, Tim Hunter has learned three episodes of Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover's performance as the hyperactive, stooping Layne is an Oscar-worthy feat. Always in a hurry and always worried Samson is not caught, Layne is an intense character that seems to be speeding. If you saw Crispin Glover in any movie, you know he can deliver a line like no other. It is always a surprise to see him perform. The other big show in "River's Edge" is by Dennis Hopper. His portrayal of Feck, the one-legged closed drug dealer and an inflatable sex doll he calls Elly, reminded me of a more toned and more humorous version of Frank Booth, Hopper's character in David Lynch's movie, "Blue Velvet "(1986). <br /> <br /> River's Edge is a good movie and I believe it shows us how easy it is to be apathetic. When we really have to rise and speak against the evils in the world.
