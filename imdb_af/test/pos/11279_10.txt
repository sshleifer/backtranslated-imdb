What this movie is not: Cool, Entertaining <br /> <br /> What this movie is: Visually Interesting, Difficult to go through, Intentional <br /> <br /> I feel this movie is the viewer ( if he or she is willing) through a magazine where they experience a world without language. Much like how animals should experience the world. You don't really see this movie as much as you see a horrible series of events in what 'feels' like a real time. <br /> <br /> Consistently, it lasts much longer than is comfortable. This movie can be edited up to 20 minutes and it will be a totally different movie. It will be cool and entertaining, but the experience will be lost. I've seen a lot of cool movies, but I've never experienced one. If you can get your head in the right place for this one, you really should appreciate (but probably not "enjoy") what they have achieved here. 10 out of 10.
