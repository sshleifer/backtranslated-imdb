It's always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods when you haven't expected it. The Dead End Kids / Bowery Boys found themselves in many unequal films and usually outperformed in a supporting role, such as in Angels With Dirty Faces. Here, their presence as a backdrop for the story of a boxer set up for murder, gives them a lot of screen time without distracting from the main action. <br /> <br /> John Garfield is the lightweight heavyweight champion, Johnny Bradfield, a Southpaw Hitter who is very different from the image he portrays to the sports world and the press. When a newspaper reporter accidentally learns that Johnny is a party-friendly woman, his plans to waste that information in a column are interrupted by a whiskey bottle headed by Johnny's manager Doc Ward (Robert Gleckler). In turn, Doc speaks to Johnny's girlfriend, Goldie (Ann Sheridan), to run with him to avoid the repressed reporter's death. As both fleeing, a policeman was caught in a fiery car wreck, and Doc's body was misidentified as Johnny of the gold watch he wore. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains adopts an Edward G. Robinson cut that is not 'I work quite like a detective who was transferred to lighthouse detail years ago after a bad arrest. His character is Monty Phelan, and he has a fairly good break that the body in the car accident was not Johnny. He scolded his boss to hand over the closed case to him and was instructed to get him out of town and out of the way. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Johnny is looking for advice from his attorney and winds. He gets even worse when he gets rid of most of his ten thousand dollar savings. Johnny wind on the Rancho Rafferty Date Farm in Arizona, run by a grumpy Granny Rafferty (May Robson). The farm is the legacy of Grandma's brother, a late Brooklyn priest, and is now home to a band of The Dead End Kids who work the farm. Billy Halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this one, and his sister Peggy (Gloria Dickson) becomes the romantic interest in Johnny, now by the name of Jack Dorney. <br /> <br /> I get a kick out of the historical perspective presented in these pre-war era films. When Johnny and the boys fetch a pleasure ride in the farm's truck, they fill up at a petrol station for $ 1.28! Tommy (Halop) gets the idea that a petrol station on the farm will be a great way to earn extra money, and with the thought Jack Dorney decides to offer a shoe boxer that offers $ 500 a round to everyone in the liaise with him. The divide is touched when it is eliminated in the fifth round, but then he is earned enough to give the fruit farm a chance to make his own. Perhaps Grandma Rafferty had been in the ring, and she came out to everyone who was sitting with her. As Johnny / Jack arrives in the locker room, Detective Phelan is on hand to arrest him. Knowing that he can release his reputation with this collar, it is an attempt to determine whether Phelan is following his arrest. You'll have to watch the movie to find out. <br /> <br /> I love the Dead End movies where Leo Gorcey is in control, but he doesn't need much in this one. However, he does a good movie flame on the ticket officer at the gate of the boxing match. Another thought - wouldn't it be great if the ever-present picture was on the wall of Pat O'Brien's priest? <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good thing for both the John Garfield and Dead End Kids filmography, and an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half. If there's one downside, it's not enough screen time for pretty Ann Sheridan. The movie could have been even more satisfying if Sheridan and Gloria Dickson's roles were reversed, as the blizzard between Dickson's Peggy and Jack was more than natural.
