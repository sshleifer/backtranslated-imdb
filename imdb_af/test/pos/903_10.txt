This is a well done action movie. There are many battle scenes, the play is convincing (for this genre) and RS1 is wonderful. I don't know why people are forced to get dirty RS1, I thought his effects were very well executed and his design looked good. The plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie. <br /> <br /> That said, I must tell you Richard Sun is one of Hong Kong's worst actors I've ever watched. At least RS1 had the right idea to kill him. Now, for anyone who thought Sam Lee (Alien) was a bad actor ... he wasn't meant to be taken seriously! I just had the pleasure of watching Gen-X Cops (prequel) and Sam Lee played the same character the same way! <br /> <br /> Now, please, all of you who watch high Oscar winners: DO NOT JUDGE THIS IS A THINKING HUMAN'S FILE! It is not foreseen to require thoughts! Just meant to be enjoyed, that's all. I hope they make another one soon.
