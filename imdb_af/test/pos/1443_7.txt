*** Spoiler in fifth paragraph *** It was an incredibly candid photo for 1955. Otto Preminger and Carlyle Productions got the chance to do so, the Motion Picture Association of America sharpened a film that was openly a showy syringe full of heroin in his arm shows. Frank Sinatra had the chance to play an addict musician and fall flat on his face in a role that performed at least twice as much as he ever did. All the gambles pay both, the movie is a classic, but it's not perfect. <br /> <br /> Nelson Algren's novel can be great, but it has far too much to fit into a two-hour movie. "The man with the golden arm" is 119 minutes and often feels much longer. However, it is not just Frankie Machine (Sinatra) who makes the movie, but the other characters and their sub-plots, all about Frankie. Eventually it is not just Frankie who has the addiction, everyone and everything looks dependent on him and he feels sharp. When the pressure gets too much, the drums start bumping into the sound track, and Frankie walks across the street with his well-dressed "friend" Louie. <br /> <br /> It is an exaggeration to say that Frank Sinatra's music career was ever really in the doldrums, but in the early 50's he was in the limbo between his days with big bands and the Las Vegas era . "From here to eternity" recovered as a serious actor and his career as a singer, but "The Man with the Golden Arm" was still a major challenge. The whole show is sinking or swimming with his performance. He pulled it off with such a skill that for a few minutes I forgot that I had watched Frank Sinatra. He had to know junk musicians and exploit that knowledge to the utmost. <br /> <br /> Sitting side by side with Billy Wilder's masterpiece "The Lost Weekend" is more emphasis on the sociological causes of addiction in 'The Man with the Golden Arm'. While Don Birnem (Ray Milland in 'The Lost Weekend') mostly battles against himself, Frankie Machine is occupied by external forces and he hides in the needle. No approach is completely right or wrong, mostly because addiction is impossible to fully explain, but it seems that this movie has benefited from a little more insight into Frankie's internal struggle. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler ** * One of the problems I have with this movie is the claw dependence of "cold turkey stops." I realize that "The man with the golden arm" probably tends to follow rather than follow it, but it doesn't make it any better. In the beginning of the movie Frankie kicked off his appearance with the help of a doctor and some treatment facility. Of course, the drama of the film requires him to fall back, but I found the All-American ideal to face a man facing his problems alone (or perhaps with the help of a good wife). To go cold turkey and drive off with Kim Novak in the sunset was too unrealistic. The end of 'The Lost Weekend' was similar, but I think it was a little less rosy.
