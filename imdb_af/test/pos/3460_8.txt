It is definitely a movie that will make you think of the everyday struggle one can penetrate every day. It is a heartwarming story of two new friends who see the ups and downs of everyday life, seen from a wheelchair seat. Their friendship is tested as well as their spirits when they get their own apartment outside the nursing home. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a girlfriend or photo or just wants to see a wonderful and heartwarming movie. It beats all the rocks and potholes and doesn't get soft.
