I saw this movie last night and thought it was decent. It has moments I think you will say. Some of the screens with the special powers were cool, and some of the spot shots were very authentic. I won't post this movie in my DVD collection, but it's fair to recommend for rent. I think nothing sets the film at another level compared to others of the same genre. The action is good, the acting is decent, the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion, and the story is pretty interesting. 7 out of ten
