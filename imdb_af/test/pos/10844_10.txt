It was one of the most emotional movies I saw. Passion, Pleasure, Pain, Despair, Care, Healing, Cleansing and Love. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was spellbinding. Everything was done so well; adjusting the book, the actors, the sets, the camera shots. <br /> <br /> This movie touched me deeply in so many ways. It reminds me of the despair that loses your love and the time it takes to heal the wound. You may love again, but will always threaten the pain that comes with separation. <br /> <br /> Isn't this one of the most important age questions? <br /> <br /> "Is it better to have love and lost? <br /> <br /> Never to have loved before?" <br /> <br /> -Ascension
