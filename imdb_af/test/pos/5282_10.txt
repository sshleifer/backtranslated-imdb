It's hard for a movie to wipe you around the world and want you more once the credits run out. Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo is such a movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is the story of a young goldfish named Ponyo that you want to become. She swims to the beach and is found by a young boy named Sasuke who promises to care for her. Course Ponyo's father, an ecologically obsessed wizard named Fujimoto, is trying to keep Ponyo from becoming one to maintain the balance of nature. It eventually turned around when Ponyo eventually turned into a little girl and caused a massive typhoon. <br /> <br /> Ponyo is a very rich film. It is full of wonderful fantasy, lovely characters and true heart. What director Hayao Miyazaki has done here tells a simple story, creating authentic film magic. <br /> <br /> Ponyo is an enchanting experience. The love between Sasuke and Ponyo is very pure and true. Miyazaki's environmental scientist is still in his film as in all his previous works. Miyazaki shows the filth and dirt that falls into the sea in an almost staggering light. Ponyo's father is not on an obsessive mission to clean the world's oceans. While the story is simple, Miyazaki can add this extra layer to challenge thoughts with expert skill. <br /> <br /> The movie is a beautiful artwork, every hand-drawn cell looks like a wonderful pastel painting. The film looks very different from many other Studio Ghibli productions, but the artworks are just as spectacular as ever. The underground screens are just great to watch, Fujimoto's fort under the sea is extremely resourceful, and the sequence in which Ponyo walks into the typhoon to reach Sosuke is iconic. <br /> <br /> Course it is thanks to its wonderfully executed characters that make this movie such an unforgettable experience. Sosuke is a young boy who acts older than he actually is, and the energetic Ponyo is a little nice. Every character is just as pleasant and highly memorable. <br /> <br /> Overall Ponyo is a wonderful experience that is enchanting in every way. While the movie can be sold as a children's fairy tale, I believe many adults will be swept away with their children in the fantastic world. Although the film might lack the density of some of Miyazaki's previous works, he keeps it pure and simple, it is true that he is a movie that is funny, heart-warming and entertaining. It's a beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I give Ponyo a perfect 10 out of 10!
