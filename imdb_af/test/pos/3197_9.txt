Awww, I love this! The Languages ​​of the Cat and the Moon do not really need a synopsis, because that is what it is ... the cat is chasing the moon into a Spanish poem. It's the artworks that are interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower which was an Oscar winner last year ... Yes, almost the same thing, which makes me believe it might just be a rip. <Br /> <br /> But it's a very good short, with sharp black and white shapes that move and switch to beautiful movement and poetic seduction ... If you believe cats are poetry in motion, see it and you will believe it more. <br /> <br /> It also has such a touch. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
