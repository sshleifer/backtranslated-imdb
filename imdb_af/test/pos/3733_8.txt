I'm a guy, so I was very reluctant to watch the movie, because I know Richard Gear is in tears. I'd rather watch action / adventure / science. I was right, the movie is definitely a teardrop. Diane tended to do a few times, just like Richardard, but they brought it and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teenager with great attitude, so you started to hate her. The film is too predictable, but for entertainment purposes it was a masterpiece. Go hire it, see if you don't lose a tear. Lol If you want the notebook, you will love this one. The beach scenes were shot immaculately. Even though the hurricane was driving a bit off, it was a little panicking to see how they reacted to it.
