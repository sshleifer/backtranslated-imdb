I'm totally with GarryJohal of Singapore's comment on this movie. Quote: 'Yes, no-Singapore can't see the big problem with this movie. Some of the references in this movie fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly Singapore is the one that will really get it. "It's not quite the truth yet, and as a Malaysian Chinese, I get it, though I don't speak Hokkien, because we also have similar problems in Malaysia. I know it's very difficult to understand and accept it as a REALITY, but it's definitely NOT a 'no real story'. I was delighted to see this film outside of Malaysia, as it will definitely be banned in Malaysia. This means you get it in 'illegally copied VCDs or DVDs' or hope someone is so kind to share it on the internet. It is not another violent teenage drama ....... because it portrays the reality of Singapore (and Malaysia) in an interesting way (sad + humor). I was just a little sad to know that this movie has about 20 cuts in censorship. What a waste!
