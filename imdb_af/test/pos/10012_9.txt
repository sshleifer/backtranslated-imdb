My wife is a mental health therapist and we looked at it from start to finish. I'm the typical guy and can't stand chick flicks, but this movie is incredible. If you want to see how it is for someone who's going through this kind of battle, it's the movie for you. As I watched it, I felt sorry for him and others like him. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** Plus the fact that all the individuals in the film, including the people in the spiritual setting, have real people in real life, made it more real. <br /> <br /> Must see someone in the mental health profession!
