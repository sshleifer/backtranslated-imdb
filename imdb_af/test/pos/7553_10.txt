For the first time, I met HBO with Arthur Penn's "Four Friends". I've never heard of it, but I expected a lot, but watched as I was interested in seeing what a creation by Penn and writer Steve Tesich would be. For the next two hours or so I sat down and watched this amazing teamwork of talent and the story they waved. A semi-autobiographical story of a young immigrant to America who grew up in the midst of the 1960's turbulence, follows Danilo's Four Friends, an Eastern European immigrant (the brilliant Craig Wasson), from his arrival in the United States through a decade that changed the American landscape. Danilo is with his friends Georgia (the radiant Jodi Thelan in a role that unfortunately had the opportunity to equate), Tom (Jim Metzler) and David (Michael Huddleston). "Four friends" cover too much for me to explain it here, but if you haven't seen this movie, I ask you to find a copy (it's just released on DVD) and watch it. You won't be disappointed. Tesich's writing is wonderfully gripping ?? Sometimes funny, sometimes incredibly sad, but always fascinating and honest. Penn leads with a certain hand and a clear love for the period and the people whose lives follow us. The throw is uniformly beautiful. This film had to make a big star of Wasson, which is truly one of the country's most wasted talents. Jodi Thelan, not your standard mindless Hollywood sex potty, heats the screen in a performance that falls in love with her character as easy as the characters in the movie. Metzler and Huddleston's subtle performances can easily be overlooked in the shadow of their fellow stars, but they are excellent and help anchor the film. Also great are Miklos Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence as Danilo's parents, as well as Reed Birney and Lois Smith. I was not a copy of the "Four Friends" since the day after I saw it on HBO many years ago. It's been one of my best favorite movies for over 20 years. I can't recommend it enough and feel that if you give it a chance you'll feel the same way.
