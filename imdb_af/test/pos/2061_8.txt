"The Long Kiss Goodnight" is a pleasant and very cool action thriller, and a career breakthrough for Geena Davis. The plot is well known to that of The Bourne Identity, but so. The battle scenes are a great surprise to the eyes and the plot line is strong enough to keep you engaged for the 2 hours. <br /> <br /> It's aimed at a smooth feel of style and avoids most action cleats. Geena Davis is big as an action chick and gets past her usual "good wife" role. Samuel L. Jackson is good as usual as the supporting player. However, the movie's bath is cute and you can tell what will happen to him. <br /> <br /> It breaks away from the usual running action action, such as Commando and On Deadly Ground, and is definitely one of the best actioners in years. Good fun and good popcorn entertainment. 7.4 / 10.
