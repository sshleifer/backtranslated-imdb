It is truly a documentary love about a fascinating character, her outlook on life and her extended family. The filmmakers spent three years sitting Sister Helen at her halfway home and managed to catch as much wonderful material as you can't help but feel like Sister Helen and her "boys." The house owns 21 addicts each with a story, almost as it does about Sister Helen's. The end scenes are particularly involved and emotional. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen's story of marriage, addiction and loss shows a very complex character, whose difficult love at all times is funny, touching, and engaging. <br /> <br /> The movie is great in the way it tells its story in wonderful slices of life that evolve into a story that is almost as clear as every scene is written and performed by the best. The honesty (and obvious dishonesty) of the "clients" is very important when you learn from their fears and see how they are trying to grow. <br /> <br /> You will never forget Sister Helen, Robert, Tired or poor Ashish spelling?).
