I have great memories of watching this visually stunning movie as a kid in NY in the late 70's / early 80's on Wor TV. Although a product of the swinging 60's, this film is almost obsolete. The effects are just as wonderful as 2001, and in some ways better (the model work is flawless). With an attractive movie, great color photography and design, and an exciting score, JTTFSOTS is a winner!
