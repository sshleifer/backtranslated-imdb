I see it as a breathtaking but deceptive movie because it looks so simple and straightforward: a Vietnam survivor tells his heartbreaking story and part of the story is reckoned with. Reviewers sometimes even claim Herzog's presence in the film is minimal, but how wrong it is. We know that all documentary documents are mediated to some extent and this one has Herzog's subtle hand over it, especially in the incredible music, the incredible expert selection of archival material and the management of cascade images. The enticing power of this film is astounding, starting with its title, the opening title card from the book "Revelation" and the first voice-over. It is a movie that can be seen repeatedly with an increasing wonder, not a simple commodity being shot down with the favorite drink on the way to the evening news. It's one of those movies that can resonate with you for a lifetime.
