I didn't know anything about this movie until I watched it. It seems to be a lesser-known teenage horn of the 80's. What struck me was the way it differs from so many other movies from that era. <br /> <br /> The first thing I noticed was how slowly this movie builds. This does not mean the typical setup of displaying characters killed one by one. It takes time to build the back story, and leave a little secret about what can happen. I almost thought that no one would really hurt this movie. But everything has led to the climatic series over the last 15 minutes, and then it becomes pretty graphical (it was a bad time to break a break. I almost couldn't finish my pizza as soon as it started). <br /> <br /> The characters also look a little more three-dimensional than a lot of cheap teenage fear planes. There were conversations refreshingly top notch, as opposed to the over-the-top stereotypes you would expect. For example, the girl who is the popular, snobbish queen queen of the clique, does not continually push insults at all, but is able to give uncertainty and give consideration to others. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize, I felt this movie was somewhat original compared to what I expected, and also made a little better. It involved me, interested me, and then let me get it. As I said, it is pretty gory during the final, but almost family-friendly much of the rest of the time. I don't have to own it, but I'm glad I discovered it.
