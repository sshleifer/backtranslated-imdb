After reading all the books of Sarah Waters, I was eagerly looking for a BBC adaptation of Fingersmith. Especially because Tipping the Velvet was so well done by well-known Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> I wasn't disappointed with the results, in fact I think it could be on a par with TAC; both romantic and entertaining. And not as many ignorant people would want to believe you, a senseless lesbian skirt. Having been a fan of Elaine Cassidy since seeing her blameless turn in Felicia's Journey, I thought she embodied both hard deception and a growing fragility as Maud. Her transformation was credible and impressive to look at. I recognized Sally Hawkins as Zena Blake from Tipping the Velvet, a small role, mostly so I didn't have so many expectations, but she was amazing in the role of Sue Trinder. Her eyes were fascinating and conveyed everything from anger to absolute despair. The two of them working together and combining these talents made this drama unacceptable. Of course, Imelda Staunton was incredible as usual, she is undoubtedly a national treasure and the supporting role play was all of high quality. Even the direction of the fairly unknown Aisling Walsh uses contrasting but beautiful shades of blue for Briar and brown for London. <br /> <br /> But so much praise should be given to Ransley the author. Making a 600-page book where each line is of the highest quality in a three-hour extravaganza is a great achievement. He relieved the main revelations at a steady pace while at the same time giving a lot of storytelling and character development. He has my full admiration. <br /> <br /> Finally, a brilliant adaptation where everyone was involved gave 100% and made this one of the best BBC dramas I saw.
