For me, a teenage movie is one that never dies in my memory, and yet I can be watched with the same pleasure again. It could be a technically flawed movie; The pleasure has nothing to do with spitting and police (my personal top ten is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of very few films to meet this criterion. <br /> <br /> I have been a science fiction fan since I was a child in the Sixties, and I read the John W Campbell short story on which the movie is based ("Who's Going There") before I get the original , watched black and white Howard Hawks movie (like many people, that the view was illegal on the TV when I was in bed!). This film, as with so much you see as a child in such circumstances, looked close to perfection: the tension, the inexplicable nature of the stranger, the photography; everything seems to be working. I have looked at it many times over the years (and still, when shown on TV). As a result, I avoided the Carpenter version for years. If I see a favorite movie, I thought, always a mistake. When I watched it again in 1988/9, again on TV, because there was nothing else, I realized that I should always change a mistake into "usually a mistake"! Carpenter made something different from the original film, closer to the original story, and truly wonderful. From the helicopter and shoulder opening scene, through the visually disturbing dog-pounding scene, to the end (sorry, no spoilers here!), I was addicted. The soundtrack alone stays with me - all I have to hear is a close match with that bass-over-strings drum beat, and I'm back in the last scene ... <br /> <br /> See you "The Thing, "I have Carpenter as just another Gore monkey, based on comments and reviews in the mainstream press. Since I saw "The Thing", I think I've seen most of his movies. I didn't go about doing it, but when one comes up, I just see his name as a director, I'm enough to watch It. He is considerate and knows how to build a movie to reach a point where something will be remembered. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen "The Thing" and you enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favor - sit in a dark room, turn up warm and prepare your memory!
