Yes, this is "Flipper". But author / director Alan Shapiro has compiled a jewel of a version. Spectacular top and bottom photography of "Jaws" veteran Bill Butler and ghostly music by Joel McNeely and Crosby, Stills & Nash make this memorable family entertainment. Shapiro, whose last film was unlikely to be "The Crush", shows himself again as an extremely talented and versatile film maker. Rent it!
