Being Cornish and educated with the history of tin mining, this film is special to me. Caught in and around different places in Cornwall, it is the story of two of your children trapped in a mine with a group of miners. The <br /> <br /> The title haunters refer to the 'Spriggins' ghosts of children's minors living in the mine and said they bring evil to all those mines. Events take place with an American who wants to invest in local tin mining, but when the young local child Josh is harassed by the ghost of a young boy, he and his American 'friend' unraveled the mystery behind his death, climaxing in the rescue of themselves and several miners from almost certain death when a new shaft is opened and the Spiggins save them. <br /> <br /> Top film, albeit low budget and short, but worth watching if you like Cornwall and / or tin mining!
