Victor Sjostrom's silent movie masterpiece The Phantom Carriage has recently been released on DVD with a new KTL recorded soundtrack. The duo, made up of American guitarist Stephen O'Malley and Austrian writer Peter Rehberg, created an extraordinary collection of sounds to facilitate and emphasize the original film material from 1921. An ominous sound sounds every act and a medley of drones, guitar chords and feedback ebbs and flows as the grim drama unfolds. <br /> <br /> As impressive as the new soundtrack, the movie remains the star with its timeless version of a dark and dystopic fairy tale. According to this story, the last person to die before New Years Eve before midnight is condemned to spend a year behind the kidneys of the equal ghosts, to collect the souls of the dead. This is the fate of the film's anti-hero David Holm, who after his untimely death and consecutive encounter with the driver of the coach is moved to painful investigation into his life. <br /> <br /> This movie is often referred to as a horror movie and although it is an appropriate label, the true horror does not reside in the supernatural elements, but rather in the portrayal of human suffering in the hand. from others. Shostrom gives a remarkable performance as the drunken, mitigating and threatening Holm alive, and the miserable, terrible Holm looks back from the dead land and shrinks from his past. <br /> <br /> Striking images flow throughout The Phantom Carriage and more than compensate for the inevitably limited dialogue. The bad start of midnight is vigorously illustrated by the image of a watch floating alone in the dark dark air like a second moon. Just as impressive, the dead are depicted by pioneering semi-transparent images, and the ghost car's scenes across land and sea remain cold to watch. <br /> <br /> Sjostrom's film deserves its place as one of the most appreciated silence. films of all time and the new soundtrack by KTL is an excellent emphasis on his themes. This is a must-see.
