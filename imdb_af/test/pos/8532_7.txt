The filming is cheesy. Some of the actors surpassed. The acts are inexplicable and inexplicable. But ... <br /> <br /> This movie is in the mode of psychological dramas of the fifties. <br /> <br /> It's a morality game. Similar to the film in which a "method" factor becomes the malignant character he portrays on stage, Ed is forced to watch treasure movies because he is the movie editor. It gives him a nervous breakdown that leads to a complete psychotic break. <br /> <br />
