I can never understand why people take time to review movies that they have not fully understood. I know people on these pages read this movie, and that will keep them from searching for copies of this forgotten, late 20's, but 1932 movie, which should probably be referred to as "indecent", like that the names on the headlines. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy, known as a comic actress in innumerable active roles, shows that she is all in disrepute in them. She was a truly dramatic actress, something I didn't know before I saw this movie, which precedes all her familiar roles. She is exciting and moves here, two things she has never been to the graceful and refined William Powell. I'm still shocked at how good she was. <br /> <br /> Becky Sharp (1935), the first three-stroke Technicolor feature, is more well-known, but this one is much better artistic and adaptable. It is also very gripping as an expression of a movie style that is about to die. You can't take my word for this, you have to see it.
