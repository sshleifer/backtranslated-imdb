<br /> <br /> My favorite science fiction, incredible ride through mistrust and the confusion of reality. Probably the best show I've ever seen. Incredibly original with interesting character developments and a storyline that spins so fast that it takes a few minutes after the film fully understands its genius. Even more fun looking at it again is changing the beginning.
