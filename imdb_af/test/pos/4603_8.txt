A good, bad movie with taste from James Bond, Romeo and Juliet, and maybe even Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Von Bruno's evil score receives an English man as a guest for a very dangerous hunt. Elga, the beautiful simple and well-conscious lady who was forced to marry the score, offers the love triangle. The score is missing out on a terrible past. The Englishman is not what the count thinks and is a terrible treatment for him. There is also the terrible breaking back, crocodiles and even the appearance of some torture instruments. <br /> <br /> Boris Karlloff, here in a support role, makes a strong but somewhat stiff presence. The other actors (and directions) are the symbol of an era the strong representations of black and white movies. Since the beginning there is no doubt who the evil man is, who is the good. Even traitors and stiffs can be easily identified.
