Chop Shop is a hidden treasure in theaters! I can't begin to describe how wonderful the performances in this movie are. This movie is for anyone who wants to see a powerful story and see an example of how contemporary movies should look and be. <br /> <br /> This film is about a young boy, Alejandro "Ale" who works and lives with his teenage sister, Isamar, "Izzie" in a one-room-small loft in a car shop. The story takes place in a part of New York City (which I didn't even know - Willits Points) where there are endless junkyards and body shops. Here, Bahrani tells the story of two forgotten children who hope to support themselves by buying and fixing a food vehicle. <br /> <br /> Ale makes money at the car shop, and Izzie helps at a lunch box. however, both earn extra money on the side. Ale sells bootleg movies and stolen car parts; Izzie leads to the sale of herself. Their lives are surrounded by grain and anger, but although they both testify, live and hardly survive in their hard world, their love for one another is never polluted by the filth that surrounds them. And sometimes they can laugh and enjoy the moments of their childhood stolen by the reality of struggling to survive and stay together. <br /> <br /> The best comparison I have for Chop Shop is that Bahrani's contradiction of an innocent love between family members against such a dark atmosphere is as powerful as Pasolini's Mama Roma combined with the battle for an unfavorable environment too big, just like in Bresson's Mouchette. <br /> <br /> With co-written, directed and both this film and his first Man Push Cart (which has won awards worldwide), Bahrani is a total film producer. <br /> <br /> I just hope his movies won't be hidden treasures for long!
