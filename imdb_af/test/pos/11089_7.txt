Director John Schlesinger's tense and surprising film tells the true story of Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee, two young men who sold US government secrets to the Soviet Union in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton plays Christopher Boyce very skillfully. He is a young man who is very disillusioned by the CIA's private operations in Australia. Sean Penn, as the baptized drug-trafficking Andrew Daulton Lee, is excellent. <br /> <br /> The capable and professional direction of Schlesinger, along with some very good acting, make "The Falcon and the Snowman" a spy thriller that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> Tuesday, February 4, 1992 - Video
