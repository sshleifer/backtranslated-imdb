After 2 years of using this site for movie reviews, I finally registered with IMDB, so I was Farscape a "10." could give. The authors' authors, role-players and crew have proven themselves the unequivocal masters of the science fiction genre. Even those who do not usually appreciate sci-fi should be encouraged to give this exceptional range a chance! <br /> <br /> Farscape's virtues are simply too much to list, but one of them stands above all; The quality of the writing is wonderful. I haven't heard this dialogue since "Blake's 7." In fact, Farscape feels much like a Blake's 7 with good special effects and a little more romance. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
