This show has a wonderful plot with good and recognizable actors (like Boston Legal's and Boris the Butcher's girlfriend of Snatch). Even the extras and the child, whom I thought of the commercial, could be a bad link, surprised me with his skill. It's just the little things the director has to adjust. As the man who does the recording of the last episode at the beginning of each new episode, needs to be dismissed. Having a narrator tells you what happened. The only other minor issue I had was that it sometimes took too long to do things, but not as close as long as some appear like prison breaks. Anyone know when they will resume the season ??
