I just wanted to say that when I was young, my favorite was show back in the daytime night heat. I loved the characters and the plot of the show. I thought it was an excellent show and still has to date. I like to look at the reserves and I'm a big fan. I like the way the characters played from each other. I will always be happy to see my favorite show with my mom, which was also a big fan. Now I can enjoy watching my show again and listening to the theme song. What I thought was a cool song for the show. My favorite characters were Scott Hylands and Jeff Wincott. I enjoyed watching these handsome guys take off the bad boys.
