I originally saw the flash Gordon series on PBS and thought it was fun and fantastic. I have overlooked the special effects of the rocket-propelled ship with sparklers, and the great dragon monster, with caring, is 1936 and it was a series, so every week they showed a new chapter. Crabbe played 3 times 3 times in Gordon. In 1939 he played buck rogers. In 1933 he played Tarzan the frightened. He was a very busy actor. Beautiful jean rogers played. sexy valleys Arden.frank Shannon as professor zarkov, and Charles Middleton played the evil ming the merciless. He makes Darth Vader look like a boyscout. The magazines were very close to the Alex Raymond strip. space travel was just a pipe dream at the time. Not to mention ray guns and television. this one stands out as the best series ever. the sequel flash Gordon's journey to Mars is 2 chapters longer, the next flash Gordon conquers the universe is only 12 chapters. and then there are the natives of mongo .., hawk-men, lion-men, shark-m And the feature version leaves the shark-man scenes out. For the full effect, see the full serial. I heard that George Lucas was inspired by Gordon when he was dying. Gordon was of universal studios. And the music on the soundtrack is of many universal movies such as Frankenstein's bride, London werewolf, Dracula's daughter, etc .; Even today, Gordon is still flashing young and old.10 out of 10.
