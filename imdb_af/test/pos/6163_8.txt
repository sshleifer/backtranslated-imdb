A beautiful romantic war story that needed more exposure. The Czech pilot who played the piano gives a soft touch to the story. The flying footage may not be enough for aviation buffers like me, but then it's really not an action movie. Although it has nothing in common with the James Salter novel The Hunters, which became the movie about the Korean War F86 Saber pilots, Dark Blue World had a similar feel, but with more of a romantic element to it. Better in some ways than Battle of Britain, because it doesn't rely on big names actors. Suggest to watch this movie with a Czech beer and some Czech dumplings called kneldniky (sp).
