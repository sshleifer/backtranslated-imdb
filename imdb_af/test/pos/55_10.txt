No blood, no sex (albeit passionate), no special effects, but just one of those pearls coming over your movie screen when you're not really looking and getting your attention. <br /> <br /> Great play, good sets, good music, beautiful story. If there were just a lot more movies like this one! <br /> <br /> The sets move us through time and let's feel we were there. <br /> <br /> The play looks like real life. , and elevate us to the level of awareness of "Nanny" to whom no one is a lost cause, the least of all the inhabitants of her own "Halfway" home. <br /> <br /> Best of all, it's a true story of misfits learning to fit. I was somewhat jealous of the good times everyone was in the movie! Can we all spend in Nanny's house?
