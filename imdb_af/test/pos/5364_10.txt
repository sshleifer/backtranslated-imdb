An excellent movie for those who just need to turn off and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Scotland. Based on the fact, the movie takes you on a journey of love amidst spectacular scenery. The role-play is "dressed" for the parts they play, so no glamorous costumes or cultured hair in this movie where performances are excellent, eager and on earth. Every character is credible and gives a convincing portrayal of the island's life, beliefs and culture of Time A definite one for those who even have the smallest drop of Scottish blood ... because it will drag on the passion and soul stir. Something that can be shared with the family time and time again .................. a true classic, one that I'm sure will be with some of the big ones movies that never die.
