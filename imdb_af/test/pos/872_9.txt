(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> People who put a Lonely Heart's ad in the newspaper are often idealists. They try to get everything they are and expect in a few words. The exchange of letters is full of hope. Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo), owner of a cigarette company at the ile de la Reunion (east of Madagascar), is so affected by Julie Roussell's letters he suggests to her. But not the expected pretty brunette comes from the "Mississippi" board, but - Catherine Deneuve. And we know from the beginning that she is a fraudster and that a crime has occurred. She shows no interest in "July's" wardrobe (she doesn't even get her suitcases open) and neglects her canary until it dies. But the most basic tricks of seduction (an open zipper) is enough to turn Louis into a beer puppy. First, a joint bank account. And then, when Julie's sister draws her attention to the flight. With 27,850 million Louis' 28 million - his signature would need the full sum. <br /> <br /> Louis and Julie's sister involved a private detective (Michel Bouquet). Louis is planning to track Marion (Deneuve's real name) in Antibes where she works as a taxi girl - her gangster darling has her trivial, or rather sentimeless. Louis finds himself unable to kill her. She tells her story: Orphan. Always. Lesbian experiences. Many sugar radishes. Prison - and soon she'll lead him through the nose again. The detective appears to be clever as a fox and stubborn as a blood dog; Louis and Marion buried his body in the basement. They flee to Paris, where Louis discovers that Marion has an expensive taste. She worships money like a deity. He sells his firm at a fraction of his value. But when the detective's body is discovered (a flood), they have to flee again - without the money. Living in a mountain hut, along with a shaky loser - Marion can think of a more cheerful life without this appendix ... <br /> <br /> A high point in the careers of everyone involved. Belmondo's self-deception almost makes him endearing. Deneuve looks beautiful in her wardrobe by Yves St Laurent, and her performance is wonderful. First, she decays the fragile wifey - too rude to ask her husband for money, so the joint bank account is needed - but after she's exposed, she sounds like Katharine Hepburn in jail to make BABY. The scenery is spectacular - the tropics, the Riviera, Paris. Truffaut leads with a clear aplomb: the sixties were the only decade when European films were head and shoulders above American productions. After this movie, Truffaut was able to face his idol, Alfred Hichcock.
