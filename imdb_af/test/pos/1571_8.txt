If I was working professionally with young girls, I found this movie surprisingly authentic. I would never have found it if a friend did not borrow his videotape. There are classic themes here: Coming from Age, Mother / Daughter Expulsion, The Restricted Choices of the Disabled, Who is the Good Samaritan, Tragedy is in Every Life and the Very Low or Relationships. Flashbacks are meaningful (when Alice gets a gun, we know she has some familiarity with how to use it) and it doesn't end in clich√©. The role players really sell their roles. It is adult material and the sound is a bit too grainy. Allow 15 minutes to sign.
