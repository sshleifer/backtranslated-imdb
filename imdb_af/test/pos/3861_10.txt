<br /> <br /> Since cats have nine lives, I will give you nine reasons to see this movie: <br /> <br /> * The kittens Berlioz and Toulouse play the piano together (so incredibly cute!) * The hunting dogs Napoleon and Lafayette * Toulouse jumps as emigrates every time he wants to be like a tough alley * Marie sighs romantic while the alley cat O'Malley deceives her mother * Scat Cat and his jazz band, "ev" rybody wants to be a cat "* Dumb but decent and good English geese Amelia and Abigail who run the cats like geese * O'Malley gets the" magical mat "that makes the Cheshire cat shy * Roquefort asks the brave mouse's journey help from stable cats * Edgar the butler chased scenes and transition from a nice guy to an insane cat hater due to the cat riddance plan gone bad
