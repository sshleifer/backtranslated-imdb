Many movies try to take universal themes and make a comedy; but little will rise to the event like "Check Out." The movie is brilliant. The dialogue is well written and true to form. The acting is absolutely fine. Peter Falk gave a really good performance - as an actor; as an actor. He can carry the pot to greatness. Another great show is given by Laura San Giacomo. She is such an intriguing actress. Her performances take a surprise. She does not matter what role she is asked to give - from Wacko in Stephen King's "The Stand" to her television appearances. But, "Check Out" allows her to shine. It's a role she's meant to play. The film is brilliantly directed by Jeff Hare. He was able to make the most of his role and his direction - in all respects - made the film a wonderful treasure. Jeff Hare was able to make a difficult theme, laugh and still deep. He gives us a careful and personal look at why movies should be made. The directors' knowledge of his film is extended to the final film. The results are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Hopefully this will be made available to big audiences, because it's one you don't want to miss. It has the potential to be the place to stay in 2005 - in the fashion of My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
