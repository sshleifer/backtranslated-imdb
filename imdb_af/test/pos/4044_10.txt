I thought the movie was a little slow and untouched for the first time. However, it has become more absorbent, fascinating and surprising in its last two hours. So, as it starts out as a cheap horror movie, it develops into a beautiful and wonderful fantasy movie. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda stands up as the Snow Queen. It was her best performance and it is sad that it was apparently her last performance as she did not perform for the past 7 years. She both embodies the beauty and coldness of winter. <br /> <br /> My daughter, 14 years old, found the movie a bit scary. If you see it as family entertainment, please stay with your child and rest assured. or him that it is just a fairy tale fantasy and does not take too seriously. <br /> <br /> It's really one of the best fantasy movies I've seen long ago, slightly better than "Eragon" or any of the "Lord of the Rings." It's about as good as "The Golden Compass".
