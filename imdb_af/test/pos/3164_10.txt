Totally worth checking out. Seen this on MLK's birthday 2006 and it hit me big time. Sometimes it feels like we're all in a trap and doomed to repeat the past, no matter how much we try to change. All we can do is continue and talk. Go ahead. Don't mean to be a downer, because that's not the point, but maybe we should come down before we see how much we have to work on ourselves. What happens if we are told by the best people like MLK, what we need to do to get out of line, but we don't listen. I know some of us are listening, but how do we get the rest of the world to see things like them really? Keep thinking, I think. This movie thought me even more about all these things, so I think it did what it explained. This is what I consider to be a good movie or play or book or poem or speech or anything: something that reminds you of being actively moved instead of being stuck and bored and hopeless.
