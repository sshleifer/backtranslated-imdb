(This is edited for space) <br /> <br /> Chan-wook Park's new movie is a complex movie that is not easy to classify. Nominally a horror movie, the central character is a vampire. The movie actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analogue of the virus invasion of a body), romance and few other things. It's a movie that's almost too much on its head. The film takes its own business and mixes it with classic European literature, in this case Emile Zola's "Thérèse Raquin". It is a strange mixture that does not always gel, but has an incredible power. Here it is almost 24 hours since I watched the movie at Lincoln Center (with a film movie review by the director) and I find my cage is increasingly agitated. It's not so much what happens, it's awkward, it's more that its wide-reaching story and its themes call a few bells in retrospect. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie has a beloved priest who has decided that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to cure a terrible disease. find. He is infected with the disease and eventually occurs and dies, but due to a transfusion of vampire blood (it is not explained), he actually survives. As a priest, he was returned as a miracle worker to the hospital where he served the sick. Unfortunately, it's not good. The priest finds that he needs blood to survive. He also finds that he has all the typical problems of a vampire, and his no is not possible for him to go out during the day. Things become even more complicated when he encounters a childhood and his family. The priest, some of his animal passions awake, is taken with his friend's wife. From there it goes sideways. <br /> <br /> An ever-changing film, it's a story that spans a variety of genres, as it tells the human story of a man who finds his life radically changed. through a coincidental event and find that he is no longer what he thought he was. It's a movie you have to stay with, because the movie is forever in something else. It is also a film that is constantly being explored in various ways on its head and the themes in which it plays. <br /> <br /> The movie has enough to do and people will probably write books that discuss the movie. <br /> <br /> The two strongest parts of the movie are its vampire elements and its romance. The vampire part of the story is brilliant. There is something about how it sets out the ground rules and the nature of the "misery" that makes such a perfect sense that it sets aside the old vampire ideas. I sat in the theater last night and was amazed at how impressive it worked. I think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is the earthquake. Here's a vampire who just wants a normal life. This is in contrast to what happens later, making it clear that the life of a man's hunting does not really work. It's not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys, rather it's something else. Personally, I think the movie changes the playing field from a hip-cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible. (The order in which the powers kick is just as cool). The romance is also wonderfully handled. Certainly the sex scenes are steamy and well done, but that's the other thing, the look, the talking, the gestures outside the sex that makes it special. I love the look, the silence staring at the forbidden couple looking hungry and unable to act, the disappointment and heartbeat of betrayal, both true and suspicious, and the mad passion of possible consummation. This is one of the big screen novels of all time. It holds the feeling and emotion of deeply passionate love (and desire) perfectly. If you have ever loved, you think you will hear some of you on the screen, I know I did. The statement "I just wanted to spend eternity with you" has a sad poignancy on it. It's both a statement of what the intention was as well as the depth of emotion. The tragic romance will break your heart. <br /> <br /> I won't lie to you and say the movie is perfect and good. It is not as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are big (especially the actors I have unfairly failed to make so wonderful) do not always come together. The different genres, thematic elements and tints stir occasionally against each other. Often I wondered where the movie was going. I hung there, though the film was wandering about aimlessly. <br /> <br /> I love the movie a lot. I loved the pieces more than the movie as a whole. She's been chasing around in my head since I've seen it, and I guess it'll do more for a few days. Like love is irrelevant as it is a movie that really has to be seen as it goes on, it will give you enough days to think and talk enough. One of the meatiest and most complete films of the year.
