It is definitely a good movie, beautifully photographed and evolutionary. Yet one must certainly criticize it, and Mizoguchi, for it is not without errors and weaknesses. Mizoguchi really cared for women and wanted to make statements about man's lack of sympathy and total cruelty, but he sometimes presents himself to do this by adopting the wrong means. This is definitely a case in 'the crucified lovers', 'Princess Yang Kwei Fei' and 'Zankiku monogatari'. He puts the scenario in feudal Japan at the end of the viewer with the partially straight-out cry: "boy, is feudalism battling, I'm glad it's over ...". And where are some of the scenarios that such weaker films of Mizoguchi present today will be literally impossible. Also, his female characters sometimes become archetypes of unrealistic self-sacrifice, which also makes the scenario less attractive. Say that 'crucified lovers' is a good movie, with so few relative weaknesses, although the sometimes cold, cynical prose of Ueda, the screenwriter helps this movie. I still prefer Mizoguchi's' realistic 'contemprary films of 1936:' Osaka Elegy 'and' Sisters of the Gion ', as well as his late masterpieces, showing more self-control and subtlety:' Ugetsu ',' Sansho Dayu 'and' The Life of Oharu '.
