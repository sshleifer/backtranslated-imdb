Last night, I was at the premier of the movie in Rome. I'm not an expert in the book, but there are many changes from the book to the movie. The rate of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things have been cut, otherwise it would be a 4 hour movie. Many things have also been changed to give the movie a quick fit. I think what's important is the feel of the movie and it works well for Hanks, Brown and the company. <br /> <br /> There are a few things in the book that seem unconditional in the film form. I don't give a treat, except to say the end of the movie is handled in a slightly different way. How Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who watch the movie may be interested in reading the book to get the full details of the story. Some small details are also cut from the movie. <br /> <br /> Although they made films in Rome, they had to recover indoor shots. Since I had a walk in Rome the day before the movie, I can say that the interior is in appearance. Kohler is not in the movie and there is not much to show about CERN. Hanks do a good job and there are some interesting scenes involved in the Vatican archives. Of course, they didn't have access to the area and I don't know if anyone actually knows what the Vatican archives look like. Eyelet Zurer breaks her into this movie as Victoria Vetra and does a good job as an eyecatcher for Hanks. <br /> <br /> This movie should be better received by critics and the public, but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and the movie before the movie, it's just a movie.
