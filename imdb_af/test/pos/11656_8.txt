This movie is a story of a Catholic nun as a counselor of convicted killer on the charcoal. The film describes what she does as a nun, which does not have a productive role. She may have doubts in her real role. But eventually she does the role that only a nun can do, who has nothing but faith in Christ. In America, there are so many movies describing convicted criminals or prisons. These scenes, especially performance, are far too different from Japan.
