Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna was a two-part star-studded historical TV movie based on the Peter Kurth book, Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson. It holds reasonably well, names are changed, etc. But the story really does very well. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom are doing pretty well like Russian royalty, Tsar Nicholas and Czarina Alexandra. What excites me in my mind were the all too short portrayals of Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland. All in all, it was a beautiful, classic production with some fine acting. I was quite awesruck by the production values ​​when it first broadcast on NBC at the end of 1986. The lead role was also the fine German actor Jan Niklas, who previously died in NBC's other Russian epic "Peter the Great". <br /> <br /> I felt that Part 2 skipped key aspects of Anna Anderson's journey to America. It is also important to know that in 1986 less known about the Anna Anderson story. It was not yet known whether her claim to the Great Duchess Anastasia was actually. By the late 1990s, more was known and Anna Anderson is now known as a fraud. <br /> <br /> Badly, the networks are no longer good for television movies like this.
