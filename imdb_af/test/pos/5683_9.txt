One of the best horror / thrill movies I've seen for a long time. Wow, it was a great surprise and beautiful on how good this movie was, sometimes a jewel like this would be superficial but scarce. I expected a popcorn monster flick and a gentle distracting way to a late night, but rather a very well-made and focused movie with great acting and made with passion and heart. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that makes you feel the characters and what's happening to them, and it is filmed as if you're there and it's really happening. I know some people in other reviews compare it to "Open Water" but I disagree because I thought Open Water was very boring and mediocre, while this movie was the opposite, but superficially they were in the same "realistic" style filmed. br /> <br /> The actors are unknown, at least to me, but they are all very effective and carry the frightening situation with frightening intensity and realism. The story is well done and flows smoothly, the plot is logical and seems to be something that happens. All the actions and thoughts of the characters are exactly what one would do and think. Very credible and it makes the movie more real because of it. <br /> <br /> In the end I had tears in my eyes. I have to say a movie rarely has the effect on me, that is how powerful and emotional this movie is and I am appropriately impressed by the director and actors of this wonderful movie.
