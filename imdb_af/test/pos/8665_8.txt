Our Scandinavian cinema seems to be acknowledging for more than just the Dogma 1995 movement as the Danish has been snapping up the years ago. The Brysomme Man, of The Bothersome Man in English, is a surrealistic and deep-seated film, but is quite entertaining and rich in content, both on and below the surface. As a movie alone, it is a passing comedy about society and attitudes in the postmodern world in which we live; A world judging by The Bothersome Man has reached the regions of Norway and the like. But with this black comedy, it seems, the movie looks a bit deeper and issues, at least for me, come up with metaphorical religious spaces and our human instinct to uncover the truth among so many material in our world that maybe It's strange to us. <br /> <br /> It was really a fantastic introduction to my current Norwegian theater. The film is very much in the category of the European art canon with its deep themes and ambiguity-covered atmosphere while maintaining an open finale and not so much a story as a march of events that can mean anything. So many times we've seen movies using the essay. The Modest Man accepts and as many times it has turned into a near predictable routine moving around a detective or a chase or something in the sentences, but this film leaves its setting and situation to act as a mere backdrop to his protagonist, named Andreas (Fausa Aurvaag), to explore who he is; where he is and what the possible mysteries are behind this place. <br /> <br /> The setup I am talking about is that the hero comes to a place without prior memory or what has happened before. I will soon jump and say it is in my opinion he is dead and has been sent to a kind of purgatory, just like all the city's inhabitants. Everyone in the city that mixes with Andrew is of the same age; the same mentality and attitude that suggests that most of them are victims of their own suicide and sent to purgatory without any emotion, feeling, color or more important pain. <br /> <br /> Once we see Andreas, he gets a bus he later discovers, is unaware of his abilities, and approaches a petrol station in the middle of the countryside. He is scruffy and has a big beard, but soon he will be the opposite, wearing a suit and a tie; clean-faced face and a home-filled, new-work home that makes the film one of the best changing shifts between the rural and urban I've ever seen. But the new work as well as the new city are uncomfortable; you can break whenever you want; Tracks are unusually friendly and there seems to be no emotion or reaction to anything. These ideas are best portrayed in a movie when Andreas, still a relative of the city, cries and is clearly touched by a movie at the show, but all look in a rock-colored style. There is also the initial example when one man jumped out of a window and placed lies on some nails, but everyone continues without acting. <br /> <br /> To get my idea up to everyone who has already died and the city acting as a kind of purgatory, death and damage are generally impossible. There is a particularly nasty scene involving electronic paper gillotine and somebody's thumb, but everyone's reaction to the event is rocky and it grows within the hour. Similarly, a suicide attempt with trains that are later acted upon is nothing more, but we get the view on how it is dragged along your side like a walkway. The city acts as a barrier, a painless society in which the masochistic need to do self-abuse is impossible; a place where sexual relationships can occur and randomly disrupt, but both under emotion-less and passion-less circumstances; a place where people can try suicide, but it is impossible to really die. The city accepts these powers because the damage has already been done in "real life" and so the film says you can't kill twice. Indeed, you cannot feel pain or emotion in the aftermath of purgatory. <br /> <br /> But the movie's best part is the one that comes to mind. To judge at the end of the five minutes of the film and the side story that opens with music coming from another man's house, there seems to be a fine line between the spaces dictating the movie as "heaven" and 'hell'. We see these spaces only very, very briefly ?? so briefly that they consist of a single shot. The 'sky' is a colorful kitchen with music and children playing: it offers life, hope, emotion and happiness, while hell is a snow that is not entirely due to its hopeless build-up and ominous cut-off. The introduction of these two spaces at the end of the film suddenly reveals to you the reality of Andreas and others. confronted: purgatory and all that went with it, was the afterlife not only for Andreas and his freelance adventurous mind? and see where the thinkers end.
