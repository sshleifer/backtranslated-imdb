I hate to admit it, but I haven't seen it as one of Hitchcock's best, yet a sounding climax. In a remake of Hitchock's 1934 movie with the same title, Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) ?? The man who knows too much - and his wife, Jo McKenna (Doris Day), vacation in Morocco with their son Hank (Christopher Oslen) when there is a faulty identity and caught on the web of an assassination. The conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot: kidnapping their beloved Hank. <br /> <br /> I found it surprising that Doris Day, which I usually associate with Rock Hudson comedies, was thrown into a Hitchcock. film. When I saw this, I soon realized that it was more of a family movie compared to Hitchcock's other works (for example: Psycho) and she had the ability to pull out the "Que Sera Sera" she did beautifully has. She was well-cast as herself and James Stewart had chemistry, which helped make the couple credible. <br /> <br /> Compared to the great directors' other works, I believe it's not that good, but it's still an extraordinarily entertaining family thriller / mystery. There is also the added bonus of Que Sera Sera, who has become a Doras Day smash hit. Well directed, well done. A good movie.
