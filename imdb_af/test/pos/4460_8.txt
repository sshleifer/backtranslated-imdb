DO NOT Torture a DUCKLING (Lucio Fulci - Italy 1972). <br /> <br /> Definitely a first candidate for the most insane film ever developed and this is quite an achievement in Giallo. Originally, the film was even more absurdly titled, "Don't Torture Donald Duck", literally translated from his Italian title. A small Donald Duck figure briefly contains a toy, but barely enough to give such a title, but apparently it has turned into fear of legal persecution by Disney. I drove quite a lot against Fulci's earlier LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN (1971), but here are all the right ingredients present. A surprisingly effective mystery, a good throw and imaginative shot against an unusual rural setting. Don't click everything. I think it is considered fair as one of the director's most accomplished achievements. <br /> <br /> The story is set against the backdrop of a small mountain village in Sicily, where someone kills young teenagers. Among the suspects, the most obvious is a young woman, Maciara (Florinda Balkan), a self-proclaimed witch suspiciously seen the skeleton of a baby and pegs. Guiseppe, the town idiot is also under suspicion, as he made a poor effort to take advantage of the disappearance of one of the boys and walked straight into their fall. By the time a fast-paced Newshound (Tomas Milian) from Milan arrived to cover the murders, he immediately questioned the government's assumptions. He meets two other possible suspects: Don Alberto, the high-ranking local priest (Marc Porel), and Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a bored young woman from the city with an awkward drug crime, who also has sexual relations with the want young boys in the city. Talk about your front red hair. <br /> <br /> Fulci contrasts modernity and tradition with the newly built elevated highway passing through the Sicilian hills, past the ancient villages where life is still strongly rooted in tradition and superstition. One can argue about the film's political stance as the North towards the South, or comment on the virtues of the village - the societal conventions in general - it's too often dangerously close to switching to moral disintegration, chaos and - finally, self-sufficiency by the population. The film is often branded because of its anti-Catholic tone, but it is hardly an important element here, except for obvious plot-related reasons, which give away too much. It's actually pretty much compared to a movie like Joel Seria's MAKING US FROM EVIL (1971). Probably, the film's rather unobstructed depiction of the Sicilian small stages (when another boy is killed, the locals are portrayed as a delayed lynch mob), can cause some offense in Sicily, but - with Considering Sicily's problem relationship with the rest of Italy - hardly problematic for other Italians, I would think. The movie has in many cases become too much to have a lot of impact anyway. <br /> <br /> When talking about Fulci, the amount of gore is usually an important topic for discussion. Although spectacular scenes are lacking, the film contains two many graphic scenes. In the outbreak match, the murderer falls off a cliff, with his face next to the rocks en route with horrific results (though not very realistic). And the chain-raving sequence with the Florinda Balkan in the cemetery shows Fulci's tendency to sadistic violence and typically he does not hold back to show graphically what most filmmakers would only hint at. Certainly, one of the most horrible scenes in Fulci's repertoire. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a solid, well-written, effective little mystery, beautifully fascinated by Fulci, with an impressive movie of genre regulars like Barbara Bouchet, Marc Porel (not very convincing as " not a priest), Tomas Milian and Florinda Balkan (mouth-shadowing crazy like the witch of the village). <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
