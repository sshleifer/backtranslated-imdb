Me. Aparna Sen, owner of Mr. A wife. Iyer, lead this film about a young girl's struggle to deal with her disruptive condition. <br /> <br /> Since childhood, Meethi (Konkona Sen) has been an apostate child and has shown signs of despair, no one knows why. However, the dormant tendency is out of control when the assignment transports her to neighboring Bihar where she is raped by political governor. The resulting trauma also leads to episodes of manic depressive psychosis in addition to her schizophrenia. Throughout the years, she has been completely uncomfortable and getting worse and sinking deeper into her private 'world'. <br /> <br /> The opposite of an 'unforeseen' (divorced) older sister and how her predominant ways already make a worse situation indicate what a fine line between abnormal and * seemingly normal * is. Ms Sen also makes an excellent comment on the social alienation of such individuals. Social rehab is standard therapy with all the deadly mental drugs. But what about the poor and the needy, who are always left to care for themselves and usually fall down the road? <br /> <br /> The romantic relationship between Dr Kunal and Anu was unnecessary. Also, the cafeteria scene where Dr Kunal explained to Anu how truly their world is for them was superfluous. Anu must already know it. The English dialogue is sometimes a little uncomfortable, although the acting compensates for it. Konkona and Shabana prove that their reputation is worth every bit. Waheeda, Rahul and Shefali play their limited roles very well. <br /> <br /> Extensive research has been done on this disease, it is very clear. But it is not clear whether MDP together with schizophrenia in the same patient can coexist. Also in the early part, Dr Kunal recommends ECT (shock therapy), while the fact that it does not work for schizophrenia is only valid for extreme MDP with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> The ending of the remarkable story indicates an unknown solution (perhaps no solution). The movie may have ended on a nicer note, as the world-wide minded and can lead balanced and fruitful if it is not much fulfilled, living under good medical care. <br /> <br /> However, it is an excellent film made with extreme sensitivity to the subject. HATE TO Ms. Sen! No one in India could have done better.
