.... can it be that ITV doesn't want to release this absolute classic, as it will show their current range of Mike Bassett for what it is? When discussing Mike Bassett with a few colleagues, I mentioned Bostock's Cup as a much better offer and was surprised to find that I was the only person in my entire office who actually saw it. It can't be right for a movie that has to be the funniest thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Let's look at it, ITV doesn't have the biggest recent record for producing comedy, so you'll think they'd jump at the chance to repeat at least something that's really funny. Maybe if it can be combined with a profitable phone competition from where we think the coach will go next time, they might be interested. <br /> <br /> Come on ITV, there are still some of us out there who would like to see original, quality comedy / drama. Do the decent thing. Repeat and get it on DVD.
