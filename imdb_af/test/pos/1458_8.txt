We have moved far beyond this preliminary decay to a forbidden area drug addiction - for the 1950s. As such, the movie may look dated. The man with the golden arm served his function a layer of the bottom of society, an eye opener for a Southern country boy in 1955, when I saw the movie in the theater. After considering the fact that I was too young, I was allowed to go. It was powerful and then influenced and still holds a few sharp, painful moments of the soul that is being dissolved naked. As a film depicting the loneliness of the essence, it succeeds. <br /> <br /> Filled with anxiety, Frank Sinatra in his best role creates a vulnerability that makes him sympathetic to the viewer. He carries out his helplessness and inefficiency in a beautifully constrained performance. As a common sense in the deadly urban jungle, Kim Novak as Molly is pretty good. She is compassionate and stands on solid ground. The interaction between Sinatra and Novak is really good. Darren McGavin plays a slimy character and does very well. Eleanor Parker is beautifully annoying and painfully uncertain in her role of the pathetic Zosch, Sinatra's cripple. Arnold Stang is another unlikely survivor of the street. He is considered sorry and contemptuous, and his character Sparrow offers cake comedic moments. <br /> <br /> The music is almost the star of this cinematic, frenetic, moody, gripping. Elmer Bernstein's score highlights the tension of Frankie Machine's spiritual weakness and physical need for heroin. Molly's theme is bitter and captures what the film visually portrays. I know of no other soundtrack that effectively enhances the tension and defeat in a man as it does.
