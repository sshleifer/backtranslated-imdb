Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) were a much-needed parody of Mel Brooks. He has been commissioned to spoof the Robin Hood legacy and the few films dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes star as Robin Hood. He is looking for some good men who will join him in his quest to overthrow the evil Nottingham sheriff (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to do with Prince John (Richard Lewis). Tracey Ullman co-star as Prince John's personal witch Latrine has her eyes on the Sheriff. <br /> <br /> Will Robin find his cheerful men? How far will the Prince go to throw his weight in the absence of his father? Why does the Sheriff hate so much Robin? To find out, you need to look ROBIN HOOD: PEOPLE IN TIGHTS! Watch the hilarious cameo by Dom De Luise playing the Duke of Jersey. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
