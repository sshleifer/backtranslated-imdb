I watched this movie again and again - every time it made me laugh, it made me think, and it made me cry. Robin Tuney does an incredible job of portraying Marcy (and I'm so happy that Kate Winslet and the other woman declined her share). It's just one of those roles you know nobody could ever compare. <Br /> <br /> This is a beautiful love story of these 2 very different people working together in crappy situations. They stand side by side, no matter what, even in a strange situation and crazy ways. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you now it's not for everyone - from everyone I've shown it to me, says the results are 50/50 - but if you like, you'll love it and want it share with others! 10 stars all the way!
