The "good news" is that the circus is in town. The bad news is that it's right about Bugs Bunny's underground home. He wakes up as his place shakes, as an earthquake strikes, when workers in the ground stab and elephants bump. <br /> <br /> To be more specific, the lion's cage is exactly about Bugs' hole. The lion cuts food, and by eliminating it, it figures out of a hurry. Bugs, curious about all the racket, wind his way through the tunnel and wind in the lion's mouth. <br /> <br /> I would say to BB: he is completely careless, at least in this cartoon, and at least for 30 seconds. When he comes to his senses, he walks like crazy and we get a lion-versus-a-rabbit battle the rest of the way. Again Bugs sees a dumb opponent, one he calls, "Nero," but lion is fierce and Bugs will need all his mind and somewhat false bravado to relieve this animal. <br /> <br /> About half of the gags are stupid and the other half funny but always fast moving, colorful and good enough to recommend. I mean, it's not every day, you can see a lion on a trapeze or do a hula dance!
