Before I watched this movie, I read the commentary of someone who didn't really love it. I must admit that I worry about dedicating 1 hour and 48 minutes to my life, but I'm glad I did. Ryan Gosling is a fantastic actor, I especially loved the believer. Don Cheadle was also fantastic. The film presented an interesting view on life and death. It was very enjoyable and very sad, but it was of interest to me, which cannot do the most touching stories. This is a movie that is reckless if you like it or you should see it. It was unique and I don't think anyone can ever duplicate it. All the young actors have surprisingly given the subject and the emotion to go into it. I was pleasantly surprised.
