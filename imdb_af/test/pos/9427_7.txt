Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) involved a battle of whits to control a Switz inventor's latest bomb-sight creation. Holmes wants to protect the British, while Moriarty no longer sells to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> Although many fans will be disappointed to see Holmes being updated after the war of the 1940s, this film shows a sad pleasure that does not propaganda in war time, as it may have done well. . Dennis Hoey's inspector Lestrade and Nigel Bruce's dr. Watson tends to steal the show, as their characters bumbling methods consistently offer wonderful comic relief. The sparring between Holmes and Moriraty is colorful and well thought out to begin. Atwill does well enough for Moriarty, even though he is not as memorable as some others played. <br /> <br /> While offering nothing special to fans of the series, it is a wonderful escape from reality, which I think was suitable for the 1930s and 1940s in 1942. boasts a more compact, less repetitive plot. And all this is done while still staying with the basic spirit of Sherlock Holmes.
