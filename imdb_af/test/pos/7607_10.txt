I love this movie. It focuses on both issues: reality and fantasy. reality, for hey, we all wanted a date from that popular man Billy. and some of us haven't kissed yet, right? be honest! <br /> <br /> Another real problem is because of the pain people get. and who, high school life. remember that? The fantasy finds your true love, if you are 25 and still in high school. not really fantasy but close enough! <br /> <br /> Although some parts are incredible, it was a great movie. There are no other words to describe such incredible work. and the story was wonderful. Drew Barrymore did a wonderful wonderful job, the same as the hilarious David Arquette. The people who worked in the movie are wonderful. didn't I just repeat it? <br /> <br /> Never Been Kissed is one of the movies to watch later generations. it shows reality and some non-problems for people like you and me.
