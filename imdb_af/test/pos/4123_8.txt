This movie biography of the early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour force for Gary Busey. The movie's highlights are Busey's stage shows where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings so much energy to the performances that Holly's own filmed performances are almost pale in comparison. Busey's contagious toothy grin light on the screen, creating a completely credible and winning personality, and his best actor Oscar nomination was well deserved. <br /> <br /> The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to star and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash. One thing I found interesting was Buddy's management ambition - he had good plans to go beyond signing up and producing. As young as he was, he had already established himself as a smart businessman and certainly wanted to take things on a higher level. We will never know if he would eventually have snapped his early success into a brand like The Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The lyrics of many Holly's songs are beautiful adolescent; read the lyrics for "Peggy Sue" or "Oh Boy!" and you will see what I mean. Perhaps to a large extent, it explains its popularity with adolescent audiences, but its instrumentation and stage performances do indeed affect its influence on groups to follow - both The Rolling Stones and The Beatles acknowledged its importance. <br /> <br /> It is clear that some freedoms have been taken for dramatic effects. For example, I doubt whether Holly ever poured out a producer in Nashville or that the audience at the Apollo Theater in New York responded immediately that he was wild in the hallway. If you're interested in getting closer to the truth, see the documentary "The Real Buddy Holly Story" (1985) produced and presented by Paul McCartney. It contains interviews with Holly's family, friends and bandmates (Holly's musical brothers are not even mentioned in "The Buddy Holly Story"). Members of other groups like Keith Richards and Don Everly also present opinions and stories and there are images of old Holly performances. The McCartney production can stand on its own, but it makes an excellent companion for "The Buddy Holly Story" and may need to be watched by anyone watching the fictional story.
