How exactly do gay Asians do in a culture that usually refuses to even recognize the concept of homosexuality? For millions of gay Hindus and Muslims, there is little hope of ever living a life accepted and endorsed by their otherwise very close knit families. This is the most important point explored in Chicken Tikka Masala - probably named after the West-spicy dish with soft pieces of young chicken meat! Jimmy is a typical young Asian, educated by traditional parents in Britain, with the common meticulous and selfish views of marriage and grandchildren. Like millions of others, he is led to a regular marriage that is inseparable, although he is apparently completely gay and deeply involved with a very attractive young man with whom he lives. He knows the truth must be told, but fear of its consequences, especially because his father seems to be terminally ill. And so he is broken into a web of deception that grows wider and wider as the plot develops. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully sensitive and not at all condemning any group being portrayed. The acting is generally excellent, although it may seem a bit ham in places like the director tend to look for humor rather than let it flow naturally. There are no prizes for photography or mini-dissertation, but the film is made entirely by the wonderful sentiment that is finally expressed - a sentiment that all fathers around the world will learn well to learn.
