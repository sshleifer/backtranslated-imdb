Well, I fear my review of this special attention will not be much different from the others before me, but I literally just looked at it - during a PBS membership - and frankly, I'm too excited to say nothing. To appreciate the mystery that Barbra Streisand is, you need to look back at the movie. Before the Broadway mid-60s feature. When television was still a young medium, there was a form of entertainment that was very prominent on the air, but it is just a reminder today: musical variety. Some musicals were weekly, but others were single-unit, usually showing the special talent of the individual artist. This is where we get the raw, unobstructed first look at Streisand. She was already a host of other variety shows, including Garry Moore, Ed Sullivan, and achieved a major coup in a once-off, tandem look with the woman who would stifle her the extraordinary belly Judy Garland stick. In 1966 COLOR ME BARBRA launched Barbra Streisand in color (hence the title), but copied the format of her first special one year earlier almost literally. In 3 separate acts we get an abstract Streisand (in an after-hours art museum that looks at and sometimes the works of art), a comic Streisand who already works an obedient audience in a studio circus (populated with very fuzzy and hairy animals), and best of all, a song Streisand in mini-concert format just - well, honestly, just to do it. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that she still has the movie message from FUNNY GIRL to come, as well as songwriter, director and political activist. Here she is almost 24 years old, doing extraordinary things because, as she puts it in her own in-camera introduction, "we didn't know we couldn't, so we did." The art museum series is shot in Philadelphia one weekend, immediately after the museum was closed to the public on Saturday night, and apparently done with just one small camera. Still, there are cuts, fixes and traces in large, resulting in a rather spectacular peak moment - the modern, slightly beatnik-flavored, "Gotta Move." After the modern abstracts are lost, jazz club begins bongos, with Streisand appearing in a psychedelic gown and making glittering eye makeup, the enticing staccato tune with almost androgynous sexual appeal. It's not up to Act 3, believe it or not, that the moment compares or improves. In the concert sequence, in a white gown and pearl earrings, Streisand repeats the torch "Anywhere I hang, my hat is home," Tear in the final notes and reveal one of those climaxes that scream you like a girl, even if you are 44 years old ... and an old man. Just old old big television. Look at that.
