The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spell binding. It seems to me that the reason why so much the movie gives is a low score due to the dedication to the original, 1937 version with Ronald Coleman. The movie - for good reason! - created an incredible level of dedication. Talking to people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something similar to the first Starwars movie in modern times. I saw it. It was and is wonderful. But this does not mean that this version is not worthy either. From the first scene, the 1973 version is seized. The noise and noise are fantastic, especially in the way they prepare for the peace of Shangri La. And Burt Bacharach's music is beautiful. So - with all meanings, enjoy the 1937 version. But don't detract from this 1973 version, as you would destroy the 1935 King Kong, Peter Jackson's this year.
