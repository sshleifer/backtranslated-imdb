I first saw the movie on an Alaska Airlines flight and saw it twice. It's simple - and is simple - one of the best movies in years. I found that I enjoyed it after my first show, but a little overwhelmed about what had happened. After seeing it again a few weeks later, things started to fall. It wasn't confusing, just deep. In fact, the depth of the movie may not have been appreciated long ago. For example, it only happened after my third show that Sammy Davis Jr. Jr (Grandpa's dog) is more than just a pet - maybe she's the point of view for his dead wife. Witness how fiercely he protects her. There is symbolism in general, and nothing of it is juicy or lenient, just actually. The adventure of their journey keeps the storyline forever and even when they arrive, you are not sure if it really was the destination. As the movie continues, so the adventure and I have the sentence the destination was merely a waypoint. The soundtrack is fun, the landscape compelling - and both definite eastern blocks. I can go on the deeper meanings within the movie, but I'm not quite sure I've discovered all the nuances. Moreover, it is better to bother it yourself. As much as a movie can be, "Everything is lightened", like a good wine that is sweet with time. I recommend seeing it - twice.
