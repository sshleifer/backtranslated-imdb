If you like rigid historical perspective, this movie is actually quite entertaining. It has action, adventure and romance, and one of the premier decisive games of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead. As evidenced by this advice, the picture does not succeed with purists who seek 100 percent accuracy in their storytelling. To go further, one has to set aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know it's hard to do when you consider Custer's last stand at the Little Big Horn and it's prominent in the history of the Civil War America. So I think there is an unresolved issue with the picture, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to do here for the photo's two hours plus run time. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first scraper, which he performs in full military regalia. Sharp's practical joke (Arthur Kennedy), who took him up in Major's headquarters, had to both get into trouble. <br /> <br /> Ironically, many scenes play in this military movie for comedy, such as Custer's first meeting with Libby Bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I haven't noticed it in other movies yet, but McDaniel reminded me of a number of other favorite characters from the Forties, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene it might seem that Moreland could be in a dress. With that in mind, the owl scene was also a hoot. <br /> <br /> As far as Flynn is concerned, it is interesting to note that he was a year earlier J.E.B. Stuart opposite Ronald Reagan's performance of General Custer in Santa Fe Trail. Both fight for the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland. In that film, Reagan did not place any of the arrogance and flamboyance in the character of Custer who remembered history. In Flynn's depiction it is more than clear. But it doesn't come close to Richard Mulligan's attack on the military hero in 1970's "Little Big Man". Let's just say the one was slightly above. <br /> <br /> The better thing the picture had for me was the way in which Custer persisted in maintaining its reputation and not risking a risky business. company. This and his loyalty to the men he led in the struggle with the discipline he developed in the course of the story. The most poignant was the final confrontation with the archbishop Sharp just before he drove into the Klein Groothoring, stating that hell or glory was totally dependent on one's point of view. Earlier, a similar comment could have given us the best insight into everything in Custer's character, when he said, "You're honoring yourself when it's your time to go."
