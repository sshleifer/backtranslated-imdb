I loved this movie very much, it reminds me of my high school days. The soundtrack is wonderful. I'm a big nik cage fan and this is my favorite movie in which he is. I love the storyline, it's a total love story, against the chances of a thing. I think anyone who graduated in the early eighties (1980-1984) must see the movie. It has completely reminded me of high school memories.
