It's pretty good, everything is considered. A must be confused for anyone over the opposite sex (that is, all of us!). The trailer does not give away a plot. FOR THE GOOD REASON. <br /> <br /> The point of departure is absurd, so it's nice to see it doesn't take itself seriously. It's like someone from the BBC Children's Department decides to make an adult movie. This is not a bad thing IMO. <br /> <br /> 7/10
