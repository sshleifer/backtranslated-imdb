This movie is the most moving and funny movie I've seen in a very long time. As a housewife ("homemaker") and a fan (Rupert) I considered it sympathetic. Anyone who misunderstands Dirk's angry outburst is wrong. Kathy Bates is not really an actress I know, but she is perfect, the whole role is perfect for their roles. Julie Andrews had me in stitches. I looked at the reading of Rupert's autobiography so that her recording was even better. It is sometimes terribly moving. I'm not really a fan of the kind of music in the movie, but you're recorded in the romance and find you sing the songs for days. This movie is becoming more widely available. Our favorite scene involves Dirk and a gun and his pants, watch it and see!
