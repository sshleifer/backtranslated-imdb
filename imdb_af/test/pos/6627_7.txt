Shame, is a Swedish film in Swedish with English subtitles. The film is about a man and woman named Jan, and Eva. They live on an island working as a farmer. There is a war going on and soldiers are starting to attack people on the island. As soon as the war leaves Jan a little, Eva is arrested to go with the opposite side. Once released, more problems arise and the film shows how two ordinary people will act in a war and life or death situation. Winner of the CEC Best Foreign Film Award at The Cinema Writers Circle Awards, The Guldbagge Best Actress Award (Liv Ullman, who plays Eva) at the Guldbagge Awards, the NBR Best Foreign Language Film Award and Best Actress to the national council Van Review and the NSFC award for best actress, best director (Ingmar Bergman) and best film at the National Association of Film Critics Awards. Shame, has good direction, a good screenplay, good performances by both Max Von Sydow (who plays Jan) and Liv Ullman (who plays Eva), good cinematography and good production design. Shame, is a well-activated and well-made story of how people in a desperate situation will sometimes do what they can to survive. The movie has a powerful message and is a good movie. The reason I didn't judge this movie is because it is not a masterpiece such as Ingmar Bergman films such as Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal or Persona. The film did not have such an impact as I thought it was missing Ingmar Bergman's thoughtful and philosophical dialogue. While nowhere near being one of his best films, there's still a lot to keep about Shame, and it's a great movie. I would probably just love it if I haven't seen any of the other Bergman masterpieces yet.
