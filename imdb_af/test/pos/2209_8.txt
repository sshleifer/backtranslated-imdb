Initially, I didn't think the performance by Lauren Ambrose was anything but flap, but because her character developed the image, it made more sense. Amy Madigan was too strong for her role and didn't really associate her daughter's characters, although it was clear that her character was disconnected from the character Lauren Ambrose played. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd is a hit as usual and has played his part in encouraging the story line. His character development left the audience, and asked why he was chastened by the younger characters and could be more directly reached. <br /> <br /> The overwhelming glue to this somewhat vague storyline has been played by Taylor Roberts. Her comprehensive version of a simplistic character kept the movie together. In this key role, Taylor was able to encourage a realistic family relationship between the characters while acting as the antagonist for all the other relationships in the film.
