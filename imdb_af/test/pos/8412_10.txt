I didn't read the book "Scarlett" and when I watched this mini-series, I enjoyed it very much and thought it didn't have to be compared to GWTW. The story may differ from the book, but who cares about her. Even in the credits based on the book, it's not the book. The movie is appreciated by the reviews other people write, but can't even correct the main characters' names. <br /> <br /> The play in Scarlett thought to me was wonderful. Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton were excellent. They took the characters and gave them. As far as other people go, they compare them to the great Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. Of course, they did great, but the clues in this movie are quite different people who have their own acting methods and should not be under pressure from what people should say. If you wanted some actors to do well, then you should have directed the film. I'm sure other actors won't do as well with the chemistry and smartness they've brought to these roles. The supporting role-player stood out with greatness and Jean Smart steals the scenes that were in her comedy genius. <br /> <br /> The places in the movie were very nice and it was just cute to see Scarlett go to everyone. those places in the film than she causes problems and other things. Also, the scene in which Scarlett talks to her father's grave was very dramatic and I thought there were two great actresses that Scarlett O'Hara had brought to life. Not just Vivian Leigh, but also Joanne Whalley. <br /> <br /> The movie and the book may differ, but you should not think that this is a sequel to one of the best films ever made, otherwise you will think it should be like Gone With be the wind and you will not like this movie. But it's an endorsed classic that, unlike GWTW, is its own movie. Also keep in mind that 'Tomorrow is another day ...
