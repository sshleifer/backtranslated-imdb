First of all, it looks like the current romance movie where a girl meets and falls in love with a boy, but the point is that this movie feels that others don't. The first time I saw it, I couldn't see it, because I had to leave. But while I was next, I thought I should see it again, but I didn't have any opportunity. One year passed until I saw this movie in a non-free channel and I saw it and I recorded it too. I saw it once, twice ... up to 200 times and not joking. I know all the dialogues by heart and I don't know why, but I saw it every day and never got bored. And I have to say I'm not used to seeing a movie more than twice. The act is very good. Gerard Depardieu is also a talented actor and katherine heigl. I want her to be in a good movie because I think she can do it. In balance, it's a movie I can't take out of my mind.
