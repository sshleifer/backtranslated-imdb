* Can be spoiled * No doubt one of the best plays if it is not the best in the genre I have ever seen. Is Prot a stranger or just a crazy bugger? That's the question you'll ask yourself everything in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is just amazing, like Jeff Bridges. You can't sometimes beat this kind of acting with some humor. Some of Kevin Spacey's actions in this movie are very funny. For example, when he got up in the tree, and when he spoke to the "queen" spiritual patient, he threw half of his face around the wall and just stared. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, from the beginning you will be addicted, and if you really like drama, you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> A solid 85%.
