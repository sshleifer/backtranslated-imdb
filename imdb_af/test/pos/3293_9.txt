This story has held a special place in my heart for the past thirty years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the desert. Books like "Call of the Wild", "White Fang", "The Frontiersman" and "My Side Of the Mountain" influenced me tremendously. I wanted to live as much as a mountain man, but nothing inspired me to do this, as I saw this movie on television in 1975. I just wanted to be like "Trapper". But when I got older, I found I was just too moderate to live like that. Nevertheless, I still romanticize the life of this kind of life. I agree with other reviews of this movie that the storyline has the simplicity commonly found in "Disneyisque" type movies, but if you look at the mechanics in which it is made and the heart of the story, watch the real themes, then I think you find yourself pleasantly touched. I make it a point to watch this movie once a year. After thirty-one years I still get a cold through me, when I see snow of snow running down the mountains, listening to the echo, haunting laughter of the Stairs. <br /> <br /> - Good luck old-timer and stay free <br /> <br /> PS If you want to read more about the real story, I found this link on the Mad Trapper or Rat River: < br /> <br /> http: //www.mysteriesofcanada com / NWT / madtrapper.htm
