Until I watched this movie, life is great, my favorite movie of all time was. This movie is all a good movie. Great writing, unauthorized acting and direction that does not approach sentimentalism, despise the subject or leave it without the emotional impact it demands. This film contains the taste that could not come from Hollywood and lacked the pretencion that would come from France. A wonderful movie even above the caliber I expected to see when the handmade movies came up. I don't have to go into detail, as the previous posts include everything that this movie should be seen by everyone on this planet.
