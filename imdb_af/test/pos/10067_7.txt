I am very sad that this film has so much negative criticism. I think it's a nice little comedy and really funny. The humor in this movie is a kind of hot and innocent and I like it. I also like Madonna's character and I disagree that she has played herself. She created a character and sympathetic. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes were the scaffolding on top of the sinking car and where Madonna climbed over the fence in a fine dress to claim her love. The humor in the movie has a bit of a realistic touch and maybe it's not everyone's cup of tea. But that's their problem, not the movie. <br /> <br /> I found this movie healthy and sunny. In fact, the day I first saw it, for one reason or another I was incredibly sad and this movie relieved my day. And Madonna can act. Just keep your glasses negative thinking.
