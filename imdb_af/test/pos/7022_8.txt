Great music, good dancing, a sexy star (Swayze) and real sexual desire shown by a female character (a very unusual event!). You rarely see female characters being motivated mainly by loop and this is a good change. I also think the movie catches up with what it is like to be a teenager who deals with the issues of the class and that ideals come to reality. Of course, it is a good moment - after all, it is a film musical - but it is a real pleasure - a fun romance and also politically relieved. This movie also has one of my favorite all time movie lines: "I wore the watermelon."
