I was very happy to see this movie as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival 2005 just days ago. I have to admit that I am a part of films that focus on human relationships and especially those that focus on the tragic side of life. I also love the majority of Scandinavian movie offerings. There is often a specific deep quality in how the story unfolds and the characters are drawn. Character building in this film is extraordinary in its detail and depth. This is despite the fact that we have quite a few characters with very specific personal situations and places within their community. The audience at the end of the show was very quiet and offensive. I still play some of those scenes in my mind and am still amazed at their power and meaning.
