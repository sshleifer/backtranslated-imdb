I agree with all of the above comments. This show was a pleasure to watch. Funny, witty, fantastic plays. It's always a thrill to find a spectacular show, assuming the audience has brain and subtle humor. I will spend good, hard-earned cash to see it again on DVD. And as long as we request a Smart Series that never has a chance ... How about DVD releases from Maximum Bob (another well-written, strange duck show with a beautiful piece of characters.) And add the list ... Middle Ages or Frank's Place. There must be a way to abandon these performances from the safes and in the hands of devoted fans and new audiences.
