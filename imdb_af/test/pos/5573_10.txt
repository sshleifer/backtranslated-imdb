Not since J. Michael Straczynski's Babylon 5, a television program captured the wonderful art of applying a story bow to a television program. It is easily the best thing on TV now! The characters are nice and you can easily attach them and take care of their well-being. The villians are the type you love to hate and make you wonder what they are next. And Brian Hensen's puppet network is the most innovative out there. Kudos to Rockne S. O'Bannon for a great job!
