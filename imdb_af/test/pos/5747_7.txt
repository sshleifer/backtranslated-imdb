It is a very direct movie that is almost right in your face. I am a Christian and love that movie in one way. It had some average behavior from the main character, and it was a low budget as you can see clearly. It may be a bit long, but the movie has some nice cars that save it from a lower rating from me. As a Christian movie it was pretty good, but maybe a little right in the message. The movie works best on a large screen. * SPOILERS * The fighting scene with the two brothers reminds you of the fighting scene between the two brothers in the Christian thriller Mercy Streets with Eric Roberts. * End of Spoiler * I give it a 7/10.
