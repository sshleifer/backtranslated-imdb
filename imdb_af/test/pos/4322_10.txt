This episode so far is the best of the series. The story was told perfectly. I especially liked how the authors made it a Desmond episode; It was his best performance to date and he definitely deserved the Emmy for his performance. <br /> <br /> We answered some of our questions in this episode, but since the show is called Lost, we know there will be more questions. first raised the answer: Walt is finally reunited with his father Michael. Secondly, Michael's betrayal is exposed to Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurly and as a result of this betrayal, Kate, Jack and Sawyer are all taken into exile by The Others. It was a great way to end the show. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the island we see Locke through a mental crash with the button. This leads to another answered question about how the plane really went down. However, there are a few unanswered questions: First, what happened to Locke, Eko and Desmond when Desmond wore the flawless key and what was the deal with the scientists in the Arctic in search of electromagnetic oils. Guess we'll find out next season, how big it ends with the best TV show.
