Den Brysomme Men is one of the better films of all time and is about a man trapped in a world where there are no senses, no feelings, no love, no truth and certainly no freedom. A world where people are scared when someone expresses their mind, expresses himself or shows love, a world where no one is free and no one has an idea of ​​the meaning of any of these. Like the world in which we live, the world in Den Brysomme Men is a world of lost souls trying to be fulfilled, but focusing on the complete opposite of what they fulfill, materialism, social acceptance and mediocre gratification. <br /> <br /> The Brysomme Man deserves full attention from every human soul, because we can all use a fresh Wake Up call.
