Finally! Happy third time. This film was always in my mind, but I forgot my first performance and just caught the second half of the movie. When I had the second chance to view it a few months later, I decided I would take it. Just to discover that my timer went off occasionally, I missed the first half of the movie. I won't allow it again. So, when it comes back to TV, I thought I was going to wait until it came, so I'll record it. And it was a good choice. I would just have watched the movie, but they always sit at midnight every night. <br /> <br /> After discovering a hole in their closed cell, nine prisoners escaped their birth to find the key of the universe, which a co-prisoner known as the Imitation King said he had hid. They think this key can be an opening for a hidden fake counterfeit. Of course, on this trip, they see it as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they go. Although things do not turn out as planned, most of the criminals plan. <br /> <br /> "9 Souls" is a beautiful spiritual journey from the Japanese director Toshiaki Toyada, who has destroyed its viewers in a movie of two completely different halves. The first half of the story is more like a psychological comedy with the criminals' ties and the situations they find the point of sale, but all that makes a moral and consequent drama-packed second half, where real trouble begins with " some very nasty and bloody moments that replaced the goofball toes. While the first half is quite amusing with her on the road, screw ball doodle and careless banter. But it's really the really haunting last half with its peculiar variety that hits you so hard with a few surprising touches that make you very sympathetic to these many human characters. Although they are not really innocent of their crimes, you are only entrenched by these external characters in the first half that when you see their spiral in their downfall, you know it's an effective drama when you are shocked in the dramatic change . The nine characters get enough screen time to really understand their personal story and what weakness will eventually break them down. The way the plot works out is that Michiru and Torakichi are the main characters and we mostly see them from their perspectives. The escapism story is an indisputable character study that is clear in its purpose and raises many questions about society and the path you choose to take to escape life and free yourself from these limitations. <br /> <br /> While the symbolic story is full of brightness and alive. The visual element does not go unnoticed, because there is only a dreamy and trance-like vibe that can fit into the unique atmosphere. What contributed greatly to the factor and gave the movie a lift was the versatile, moody instrumental rock soundtrack. The gentle atmospheric gel that could create it in many scenes left me quite breathless with the eternal emotions it could provoke. Simply beautiful and straightforward powerful control on the front. The pacing for such a long film (2 hours) seems to be breeze and editing is done fast because we are just as complicated in everything. The hypnotic photography is in sharp detail. While performances by the cast as a strange bunch of criminals are of high quality with everyone who offers enough personality and traits to separate themselves. <br /> <br /> I found 9 souls to be a pleasant and quite a wonderful surrealistic movie that stirs up the emotions and then strikes you with an almighty muurop when it changes direction. Highly recommended.
