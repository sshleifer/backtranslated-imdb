Thanks for making such a wonderful escape. That's what I like about movies. I was so impressed with the aireals, the way they were shot and the timing was so dynamically perfect with the music. As a dancer himself, and as part of many dance films, choreography is usually chopped, cut into cubes and sometimes even the beat ..... "Showgirls" the movie. The relationship between the ladies was ever so present in the movement. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the last one when she is covered. I saw the movie before, another version., And I didn't like the man last time. I feel sorry for him this time. It changes how I feel about the female love birds. It's all so magical.
