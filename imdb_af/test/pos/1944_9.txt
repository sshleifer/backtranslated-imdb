I saw this movie three times. Return to videos, in the 1980s, and again on The Encor channel last night (11 February 2010). Based on a true story I remember being in the news in the early 1980s, I decided to find it disturbing to ever look again. Yet it is difficult to look away from a car accident. The creepiest character is Joshua John Miller, who plays Keeanu Reeves's little brother. <br /> <br /> (The story on which this movie is based can be found anywhere on the Internet, just Google. It's about Anthony Jacques Broussard who killed Marcy Conrad in Milpitas, California in 1981). characters depict Generation X pre-grunge, borderline sociopaths, with the exception of Keeanu Reeves, who develops a conscience. <br /> <br /> Old hippies did a good job getting that generation. <br /> <br /> For such a Young Child, I thought Joshua Miller was excellent, as the serial killer in making character. In fact, he went to Yale and wrote scenes as well as direct. His acting abilities in this movie were incredible. Just as he treats his little sister by drowning her doll and tearing her puppet, I gave the chills. It gave me nightmares. Even with what is happening in our world today, in 2010, it's still the most degenerate movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The apathy and dysfunction of these families is enough to make one. This excitement kills almost Manson murders. <br /> <br /> Crispon Glover has a bit too much in character. He wound up on David Letters to discuss his role, and almost kicked the host. Apparently Glover had to seek psychiatric help after depicting his character. <br /> <br /> Fight the good fight against the great Dennis Hopper. You are one of the best!
