This movie was a pretty nice watch for me, I mean it wasn't good, but it was one of the late horror movies. It seems too low, almost state advantage budget size, but it has its charms like the beautiful ladies in it. The atmosphere was also good (that's what many of the horror movies are missing tonight). The acting was your typical 80's low budget affair, that's if you don't know, it's acting dud. But that's what Lucio Fulci's movies were full of, they like this movie they had atmosphere in story and money, etc. Missing. They formed more than in the horror and gore and atmosphere for the movie itself. <br /> <br /> It's just a typical low budget horror movie that is viewable, I've watched it completely and I love horror movies. I watched movies where I switch off or just sit back and forth in 10 to 20 minutes if it's on video or left the scene on the DVD. This movie didn't let me do it, I sat and watched it all the way to the end, without skipping parts. <br /> <br /> I'd love it if the zombie-type folk in it was a little more scarce because they were so frightening to have Freddy Kreuger as your babysitter. But seriously, though it was a little better, it might be low budget perfection. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie was top notch, ideal horror music, so it was. I saw horror movies where the music is good or average, but it could have been better, thanks, though this movie had nothing of the Metal music in it. <br /> <br /> I have been the hard metal fan since 1990, but in horror movies metal music spoils it, the movie loses the atmosphere a lot when any kind of music other than a score is playing. So I'm glad there was no music in this movie, except that your typical score was pretty dirty. <br /> <br /> This can use 'Profane Grace - Epitaph Of Shattered Dreams'. . Like it is keyboard music no guitars nothing anything but "really" creepy keyboard tracks. Like a "Forever Sleep", you hear the wind completely and some goose clash that causes keyboard music to follow. Ever on the CD is the same, most ideal horror music at its best, it would be the perfect movie. <br /> <br /> The only unattractive chick in the movie for me was the one who cut / killed (or we are led to believe) and hung like a scarecrow, just to get free and later try to escape. Every other woman in the movie was great, a great 9 out of 10 for everyone except the one I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> I wish Hollywood (mainstream of things) would give money to Romero and the man who made this movie. If it's given to them for movies, it's better to make a decision than to give it to a goemon muppet named Paul Anderson of the resident evil grain. <br /> <br /> Well done guys, it's not bad, not bad Anyway, I loved the part of the end credits when they kept making your cuts from them (behind the scene). Not many movies do this kind of thing, which I thought a bit at the movie, as it also showed you are some outreaches of sorts and this is always a good thing if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Rating for this movie 8/10, rating for the lovely 9/10 movie 9/10, rating for the movie 9/10, rating for the movie 9.5 / 10.
