There is more to this movie than to the eye. If you are looking for groundbreaking originality or easy comedy, you will be disappointed. But for an entertaining 90 minutes, it's just right. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is careful and accurate. The sex scene, which denies one comment as free, is anything but - each gesture contributes to the development of the characters. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of the main characters aren't exactly sweet people. But the movie makes an honest effort to show their interactions in a fair light without being sensational (at least not to the early 21st century urban standards). And there are many very entertaining moments.
