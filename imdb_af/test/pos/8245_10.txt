In my opinion, the movie is an excellent example of the realities of the war and a tribute to the soldiers of all nations who fought in the land Gallipoli. The lack of violence in no way detracted from the extent of the story. It is honest, true and brave, just like the men who fought and died in the Hellespont. The lack of cruel depictions of violence is just and right. These men suffered from freedom, freedom and the right to self-determination in a free and better world. They never wanted to see such a scene again. This is Gallipoli's legacy. Suffering the play of free pirate techniques and blood and gore is best shown for maintaining proper respect for the fighters of this melting pot of nation. <br /> <br /> This movie glory in the marvel of men who fight for their lives, with honor, courage, dignity and unspeakable spirit and humor in the face of disturbing adversity. This film is not interested in making a spectacle for fools to glorify. The brutal outcomes that resulted from this personal struggle of these men is not something that those who survived ever wanted to see on an entertainment screen. They had seen enough of them at that time, and would never have seen them before and never wanted to review such scenes on a screen in the name of "entertainment". The brutal horrors of the reality of the evil battles fought at Gallipoli were scenes that haunted and awakened hours for the rest of their natural days. These were the painful internal scars that they, the men of all nations who fought, entered into their graves. They all fought, and many died in the face of everything and somehow they, the mighty men, succeeded in killing the teeth of constant fear because they would not insult their friends because they was not willing to play next to them. It is Australasians for brave, gameplay, but it has applied all or more to all fighters, but the word of the boy who fought was that Johhny Turk was like a game, it is as brave as you ever did a soldier would have wanted. <br /> <br /> ANZACs and Turks are fighting to establish their place at the world stage. From 25/04/15 their respective demands for equality in the nation are known and unthinkable to the world. The director made a masterpiece that respects the spirit and memory of those soldiers and serves as a reminder of future generations of all ages, because children can be feared to scare them for the sake of visual "horror" and that is morbid and useless appeal. And children should attend this movie to learn what happened at that holy coast before they were born. So they can remember. For this is the nature of the people, who soon forget them.
