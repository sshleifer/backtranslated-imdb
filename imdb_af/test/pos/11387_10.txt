Once, I watched a video of Paul Thomas Anderson depicting the great interest he has in porn movies and how this industry can deliver better movies and hence a complete genre and not just sex in videotape. Paul Thomas Anderson has his own beliefs of porn industry in the character Burt Reynolds played in a terrific way. His name is Jack Horner, a director whose biggest dream is to make a "real" movie that can keep the viewer in tension because of the great dramatic story and at the same time exciting with the beauty? and with the "big cocks and tits". Soon as he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Walhberg), he believes he has received the new star for his films. And so begins the story of the young Eddie in the porn industry. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a sequence in a nightclub where we can see all the people who are part of Eddie's life and later we can see them outside the porn industry and live their daily routine . But soon we will see them inside the porn industry and after just one party the story of the new Eddie, the story of Dirk Diggler, begins. All of them will taste the real success with Dirk as the lead star and win many prizes and Jack helps to make his biggest dream come true with a series of films about Brock Landers, the new character of Dirk. This kind of exploitation is a great success and Jack is his first "real" movie. But here is the beginning of the end and the start of the "terrible 80s" when there will be $ ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll for Dirk and pals. But we all know that the excess can destroy any person and the erectile dysfunction can destroy any pornstar and here the film in their lives focuses on total success and how everyone has a very bad time with many problems due to the bad appearance of society. porn industry and up to a lot of remains. In Dirk's decadence, after trying and failing in the music industry, there is a brilliant sequence that can perfectly resume how things go to Dirk and his friends. This order is one of his first drug deal, with the appearance of Alfred Molina, ending in a total mess. Is funny to us and a terrible experience for Dirk and pals, but there is always a solution when you come back to what you know and when Dirk is back, Brock is back. <br /> <br /> Well, I didn't mention the most. of the characters in my sort of summary, but I have to say that everyone is incredibly well developed. The movie is just excellent with the best performance I have seen from Mark Walhberg. Julianne Moore has a powerful display in a very moving character; Reilly, Macy, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman, etc. Just memorable, all their characters with funny and sad moments. <br /> <br /> Finally, I really love the wonderful movie style of Anderson here with a unique view. to the porn industry of the late 70's and early 80's. I said "Magnolia" was my favorite of Anderson, but now that I've looked at everything but "Sidney" I can't say I have a favorite because I love them all! <br /> <br /> PS: Somewhere I read that this movie is the "Scorsese movie" of Anderson, so I'm more than sure that if you like Goodfellas and Casino, you will also like this one. I love "Boogie Nights"!
