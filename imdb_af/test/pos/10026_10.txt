Warner Brothers was significantly tempered with American history in Raoul Walsh's director Raoul Walsh, the leading western "They Died With Their Boots On", a somewhat inaccurate but totally exciting biography of cavalier George Armstrong Custer. The film chronicle Custer from the moment he arrives at the West Point Academy until the Indians kill him at the Little Big Horn. This is one of Errol Flynn's signature roles and one of Raoul Walsh's greatest epics. Walsh and Flynn worked together quite often, and "They've joined up with their boots" reunited Olivia de Havilland as Flynn's romantic interest for the last time. They appeared as a couple in seven previous films. This 140-minute black-and-white otter is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action ranges, humorous romantic scenes, and rigorous dramatic confrontations between our hero and his opponents. One of the notorious flaws is Colonel Philip Sheridan, who was shown commanding at West Point before the Civil War. Indeed, Sheridan was a lieutenant at this point. In fact, the commander was shown Robert E. Lee as the previous Flynn movie "Santa Fe Trail". Another historic decline is Lieutenant General Whitfield Scott; Scott was not the commander of the Union troops by the Civil War. Warner Brothers offered Custer a drinker (probably because Flynn had a reputation for drinking), but in real life Custer didn't drink or smoke. Yet, both this and other historical goofs do not detract from a truly beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> "They opened up with their boots" with Custer in West Point Military Academy wearing a fine dress uniform with an African American carrying his luggage and striving for his dogs. After the sergeant of the guard realized that he had become an honor guard for a future commander instead of a distinguished foreign general, the sergeant Custer changed to a positional defeat Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy of "City for Conquest") after take control of him. Sharp plays a practical work on Custer by installing him in the quarters of Major Romulus Taipe (Stanley Ridges of "Task Force"), which will quickly lead Custer. Of course, the volatile Custer attacks sharply in a public noise. General Phil Sheridan (John Litel of "The Sons of Katie Elder") is willing to hand over Custer from West Point to behavior that is unrelenting. As it turns out, Sheridan can't drive Custer out because Custer hasn't entered. Once enrolled, Custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with perseverance to fight and build. When the American Civil War broke out, West Point graduated cadets that did not complete their education and crashed into battle. One of the last cadets raging in the war is Custer. Custer meets his future wife, Elizabeth 'Libby' Bacon (Olivia de Havilland of Santa Fe Trail), and they commit themselves to each other, in spite of Mr. Bacon (Gene Lockhart from "Carousel") who denies Custer's eyes. Bacon seems to have run over Custer at a salon and insulted one of Custer's friends and our hero. Bacon. Meanwhile, in Washington, Custer desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment, but Major Taipe cools his heels. Custer befriends Rotund Lieutenant General Winfield Scott (Sidney Greenstreet of "The Maltese Falcon") and they share an appetite for creamed Bermuda onions that become one of Custer's attributes. Not only does Scott assure Taipe Custer to award the Second Cavalry, but Custer also makes Taipe's horse come to his order. During the Battle of the Bull Run, July 21, 1861, Custer does not violate orders from anyone other than Sharp, strikes his chief and holds a bridge so that the infantry can cross it. In the shoulder wounded and sent to hospital, Custer receives a medal rather than a court martial. When Confederate General Jeb Stuart threatens the Union Army in the battle of Gettysburg, in Pennsylvania, Scott is shocked at the chance that the South can defeat. When a Brigadier-General cannot be found, Scott Goipes throws the first available officer. An error is made and Custer is being promoted. First, Custer embraced the moment and cracked Stuart's advance. After the war, Custer stopped and started with the boys at the local salons. Sharply displayed as a crooked railway promoter and they are trying to encourage Custer to serve as chairman of their railroad so that they can raise funds. Eventually, Libby intercedes on his behalf with General. Sheridan, who was in charge of the army, gets him back on active duty as the commander of the 7th Cavalry. When he orders, Custer finds the 7th cavalry drunk and is not surprised that Sharp orders the liquor at the fort. Meanwhile, Custer has his first race in Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn of "The Guns of Navarone") and takes him into custody. Of course, Crazy Horse escapes, Custer's opponent and they fight. <br /> <br /> Once Custer Crazy Horse and the Indians, Sharp with Taipe chose as a government agent, conspire to destroy a peace treaty with the Sioux and other Indian nations. They also ensure that Custer is educated on Taipe's actions in a salon connection. On his way to Washington, Custer discovered the perfection of Sharp and Taipe who drank a golden strike in the sacred Black Hills. The settlers hit a rocky wall in the Indians. Custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men at the Little Big Horn in a slam-bang action against 6,000 impala. "Stagecoach" lenser Bert Glennon captures both the grit and the glory. The long shot of the 7th Cavalry that leaves the fort in the morning is spectacular. As a complementary presumption of Custer's impending demise, Libby is stained after leaving their homes for the Little Big Horn. "They died with their shoes" benefits from a top Max Steiner score that the direct tune "Gary Owen." Include.
