The first feature film Muppet Movie, and besides perhaps The Muppet Christmas Carol, the movie pop players around the world are still looking for a guide. Disney did the Muppets a dis-service and this movie proves it over and over. With classic comedians and guest stars comos, keep it on a simple but original plot, classic Muppet lame jokes, Paul Williams genius in songwriting, and Electric Mayhem insanity, and come off with a wonderful movie, especially as you realize the big movies are puppets. . Only Croft came near Hensen's genius with dolls. Half of the fun that is playing today is that the actor / actress still lived ???? I can only hope Frank Oz and Dave Goelz and the rest of the surviving Muppeteers can somehow save Kermit and Company from Disney's lethal grip.
