Movies are something you see and forget on Saturday night. Motion pictures are artworks that stay with you forever. Mishima falls into the latter category. This is the kind of thing Oscar awards, a brilliant, visual piece of film that is both depressed and exciting. Instead of a straight look at the life of Yukio Mishima, director Paul Schrader calls three adaptations of the author's stories into a look at his past and final day on Earth, the day he tried to lead the Japanese army into rebellion in the name of the emperor If he does not, he commits ritual suicide in an end that strikes you like a bunch of bricks. The three short translation adjustments allow for an overview of what has led to it and is presented in an experimental way, which makes them look like they are being filmed. Ken Ogata is wonderful like Mishima. Despite his eccentricity, he comes out as very sympathetic, a man who is totally willing to die for his beliefs and doings. This makes the end that much more devastating and the sense of loss more significant. Of the three story adaptations, Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Kyoko's House and Runaway Horses, this is the last to be the strongest and most emotional. It is also the story that has been best suited to Mishima's mood recently and illustrates what really led to the events of November 1970. This review cannot be complete without mentioning Philip Glass's striking musical score. Not since 2001 has a movie score been such a perfect compliment to his visual art. Paul Schrader made one of the most beautiful films of the 1980s or any other decade for that matter. Prepare the hooks because the end will leave you in tears. Mishima: A life in four chapters reminds you that sometimes film can still be an art form and as art it is brilliant.
