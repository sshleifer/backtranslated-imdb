Nothing is worse than the genocide of our world history. This film seeks to describe the horror seen by a particular family, a common narrative device in the Atomic bomb world of Hiroshima. The most memorable parts are the graphic and sad images that the people of Hiroshima face in the wake of the war. However, the story becomes more concerned about the impact on a particular group of people and how they can cope with their lives; In other words, if you don't really care about them, the movie becomes boring. It is hard not to care when a family's homeland is destroyed. I'm not sure if I would recommend this movie because it says very little politically and honestly, my interest in the family's problems didn't.
