With all the drinks out there, it's a soft film about young love. Yes, it is true that young love is often more of something than it deserves, but why are people not on Romeo and Juliet? Paul and Michelle are models of good behavior compared to them. <br /> <br /> Yes, they run away and set up an ideal life, but it's a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who acted badly. Eventually they have sex, but no one is forced to do so. The film lets children know that sex can cause babies. <br /> <br /> One thing, there is nudity in the movies. The camera doesn't focus on it, but it's there. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie has Paul in a good chance to find out. In Paul and Michelle they divorce for a while. If you don't like the end of a movie, you think for yourself. Alternative ends are not just for DVDs.
