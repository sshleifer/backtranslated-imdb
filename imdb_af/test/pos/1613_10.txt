Cinema's biggest era began in post-war Europe with Italy's Neo-Realistic movement. In the next 2 or 3 decades that followed, France's New Wavers caught everyone's attention, and Bergman was always there on his deserted Scandinavian island and made bitter masterpieces. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti brought the geographical shape in full circle, with its miracle * Death in Venice *, which can also be called the death of Europoean Cinema *. After the sixties, the major European filmmakers, who were exceptionally exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation Movie Brats (Coppola, Scorsese & Co.). This movie feels absolutely like a great summary, not just of Visconti's particular obsessions, but of the general effort of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. And rest assured, you won't find a sterner task master like the Visconti unveiled here. He doesn't play for the crowd, people: either you get behind him and follow along, or you're left behind. The pacing is a challenge: slow but never without emotional weight. "Incidents" are few and far between, but each one looks with symbolic meaning in a solid, inexorable cosmos. <br /> <br /> We'll probably never be in such a rare company again, in terms of the movies: one of the greatest writers of the century inspired the story (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest filmmakers who direct it (Visconti), one of the leading actors in the lead (Dirk Bogarde), and almost constantly in the background, Gustav Mahler 5th symphony. With full advantage of Mahler's ability to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical breast, Visconti transforms the main character, Aschenbach, into a far-reaching composer of his original persona as a writer. He even makes Bogarde like Mahler (geeky mustache, specifications, rugged hair, similar walk). Bogarde, incidentally, delivers the best performance of an actor in the history of movies: it is a great silent performance, and the actor must make meaningful rules in a gesture or glance. Chaplin or just like an animated look. <br /> <br /> Cinema doesn't get any better than that. I will ignore the complaints of the Ritalin addicts out there who say it's too slow, but even the more legitimate grabs about some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with this antagonistic friend of his are misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the film's thematic worries (ie, what is the better way to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), And the confusion and shyness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway.) An uninterrupted flow of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice will be nothing but a beautiful picture; but this movie is really about something. And what it usually involves is: Romance (capital R), especially. As a suffering from Romance himself, Visconti knew what he was talking about. <br /> <br /> [SPOILER. . . I guess] If you see nothing else, see * Death in Venice * for its turbulent opening credits. . . And for his memorable end, with Bogarde's straw-black hair dye dripping from his sweat, dying head and on his chalk-white face. Meanwhile, young Tadzio, the object of Bogarde's dying desire, stands in the ocean and points to the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climate range is an exciting economy that is all about the movie: love, lust, beauty, loss, ending a life at the beginning of another life and cold death in the heart of warm, sunny beauty. * Death in Venice * is a wonderful work of art. <br /> <br /> [DVD point: As with the Visconti masterpiece released simultaneously * The Damned *, I recommend that you turn on the English captions while watching this movie. It is apparently in English, but the DVD's sound looks muddy and there are many Italian spoken in the film.) <br /> <br />
