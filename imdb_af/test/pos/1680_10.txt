Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) can be described on the surface as a French variation on John Huston's main film, Asfalt Jungle (1950). The difference between the two films is Rififi (1955), giving a little more attention to the robbery series. Also, the police are not involved in the aftermath of the robbery in Rififi, just as much as an Asphalt Jungle. In the end, in my opinion, Rififi (1955) is a slightly better film than Asfalt Jungle (1950). Spartacus (1960) may have been the one who broke down the notorious black list, but in my opinion Rififi (1955) was the movie that started to divide the couple. unbreakable Hollywood blacklist. First film in five years for Jules Dassin, who was victimized by the McCarthy Communist hunt from the late 40s to early 50's. He had a kind of retaliation when Rififi (1955) became a success in France and Europe. So, the poisonous Hollywood blacklist outraged in a great way that probably inspired others to do the same. Rififi (1955) is the most important film of Dassin's career because it not only restored his name but also gave him a second chance to make films. Jules Dassin has the film world and his ever-growing audiences a masterpiece of influential relationships. His handling of the material is exceptional and the direction of the actors is flawless. Build tense situations with precise craftsmanship. Dassin came full circle in the Film Noir genre by directing his best and last Noir, Rififi (1955). Rififi (1955) is the number one film in an arsenal of thirty plus films for director, Jules Dassin. A masterpiece in acting, cinematography, directing, editing and writing. Not a movie to leave your seat for a minute because there's always something unforgettable going on. So brilliant as anything from Jean Pierre Melville who was a master of this kind of movie. Masterpieces such as Rififi (1955) are relatively small compared to the probably billions of films made in film history. <br /> <br /> The one fascinating aspect of Rififi is the exact planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes up much of the 118 minute duration. The main characters plan and perform the jewel cage in the same way as a film director prepares for the pre-production, production and post-production of a movie. Show how difficult a Jewel loft as in Rififi (1955) is going on and why very little would do so. The fact that the scene hardly contains a mess as in other films makes this scene a bit bigger. Often, one can get a perfect sequence in a movie. <br /> <br /> Lack of unnatural sound in the remarkable three-minute hoist sequence puts it in a realm of absolute realism. Any dialogue or music will destroy any tension and tension the director is trying to create. Using natural sound makes the heist range a rewarding movie show experience. Now, filmmakers and producers will use dialogue and music in such a scene because of a lack of confidence in the patience of a mainstream filmmaker. Keep a level of consistency that never drops once. <br /> <br /> Maintaining a high level of tension is what makes the cross sequence perfect. The director achieves tension in the heights that rarely fall in most of the robbery scenes from heist films. Jean Servais and the rest of the protagonists contribute to the tension with some low key workers. Placing tension in a scene is a task that is not very capable of doing. The robbery series of Rififi (1955) reaches a Hitchcockian level of tension and tension. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers from the years after Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) were influenced if not inspired. One filmmaker was Jean Pierre Melville (original choice for Rififi director). He uses variations of the hoist sequence in Le Doulos (1961) and Le Cercle Rouge (1970). Another filmmaker was Stanley Kubrick who made a similar theme film in The Killing (1956). Also, Quentin Tarantino whose debut feature Reservoir Dogs (1992) is inspired by this film. Other film directors are John Woo, Michael Mann, Paul Schrader, Ringo Lam, etc. <br /> <br /> Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) is comparable in many ways to Bob le Flambeur (1955). One, Jules Dassin and Jean Pierre Melville in 1987 introduced Rififi (1955) and Bob Le Flambeur (1955) pioneering films. Two, each film involves an aging criminal who is planning and exercising a daring hoist. Three, Bob le Flambeur and Rififi end up fatalistic. Four, each movie shares many motives and situations that classify the two as movie groups. <br /> <br /> Part of Rififi's charm is the colorful characters that tell the story of Tony le Stephanois, Jo le Suedois, Mario Farrati, and Cesar le Milanais. Most of the violence is implicit, but effective, brutal. The main characters led by Tony le Stephanois adhere to a strong outdated code of honor reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo. Jean Servais is the role of Tony le Stephanois with his cynical outlook and tired look. Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) became my favorite when I saw it on the big screen from start to finish.
