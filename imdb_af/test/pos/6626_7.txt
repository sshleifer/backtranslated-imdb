It was no surprise to me that it was a very depressing and draining movie. After all, it is about the impact of the war on civilians AND it is through the "king of depression," Ingmar Bergman. In other words, so many of Bergman's works are deep in human misery and anxiety, and so this film does not look so unusual from this director. <br /> <br /> Although it's more difficult to watch, the last half of the movie may offer more insight into the lower depths of humanity. This is because the main characters (Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow) initially try to overcome adversity and are basically decent (though a little stupid) people. However, since hardship after hardship occurs, they (especially Von Sydow) become less and less human and more animal-like - do ANYTHING to survive. <br /> <br /> Fun to watch, NO RELAXATION ROAD! But, an interesting insight into human nature. <br /> <br /> PS - 1 thing I loved about this movie is that it avoided a stupid movie chiche. When the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or wine, they completely finished the wine! In most movies they hardly touch their drinks or leave them untouched. It makes me crazy because I will never leave an alcoholic beverage of $ 4 without drinking it, unless it tasted terribly or had a mistake in it! BRAVO!
