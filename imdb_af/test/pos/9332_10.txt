I'm not a great music video fan. I think music videos take away personal feelings about a particular song. Any song. In other words, creative thinking goes out of the window. Similarly, personal feelings aside about MJ, throw aside. It was the best music video of all. Simply wonderful. It was a movie. Yes people were. Brilliant! You've had wonderful acting, fantastic choreography and awesome singing. It was spectacular. Simply a plot line of a beautiful young lady speaking a man, but he was a man or something sinister. Vincent Price contributed to the song and video. MJ was MJ, enough said about it. This song was to video, which Jaguars are for cars. Top of the line, PERFECTO. What was even better was that we have the right MJ without the thousand facets. Although ironically, there were more than enough make-up and costumes to go around. People go to Youtube. Take 14 minutes. from your life and see for yourself what a wonderful artwork this particular video is really.
