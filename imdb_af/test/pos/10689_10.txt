This movie is surprisingly good. The ninja combat ranges were incredible. I haven't seen all of Sho Kosugi's movies, but it's probably the best of those I've seen. Probably the impressive battle series was at the start when ninja killed about 20 people, it was one of the most impressive ninja fight ranges I've ever seen. Another good fight was at a police funeral where the Ninja buried more people. The last battle was also very impressive. I also liked the soundtrack of this movie. The story was good enough for a ninja movie, actually it was different from other ninja movies. So if you're a fan of ninja movies, you'll probably have this one.
