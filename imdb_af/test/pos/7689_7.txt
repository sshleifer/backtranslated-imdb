I recently had the privilege of watching what is said to be the last 35mm, Technicolor, stereo print and much more alive and touching than remember. Approaching the original material - basically, all scriptwriter N. Richard Nash was pruning, changed very recitively to spoken dialogue, adding a transition team or two (including a very amusing one to Pearl Bailey). Oliver Smith's production design is staggering in the "Li'l Abner" "Guys and Dolls" 50s adjustment mode, but works well for the folklore, unrealistic quality of this work. Stereotyping and racism are present, but not for a winning-inducing degree. Furthermore, for a movie of his time, it's pretty fair - the adultery, violent behavior, drug use and self-destructive habits of the people of Catfish Row are not diminished at all. But there are debits, starting with all the variation of the stage text. The loss of so many compromises Gershwin's brilliance - no wonder the family doesn't find it. The rearrangement, especially of Sammy Davis Jr. 's material is disturbingly trendy and vulgar. George knew what he was doing, people; you don't have to waste that much. And while Poitier and Dandridge are doing well and singing their singles well, there is a huge gap between the characters' voice and voice voices - you are constantly aware of the art. What really counts here, of course, is the music, among the greatest ever written for the theater. In spite of all the thought, it survives, and you have to be made of stone not to be moved. If the treatment isn't exactly the estate's estate (and it shouldn't be), there's no reason not to spend some money to restore this ambitious filming of Gershwin's masterpiece and to new ones. generates more awareness of his genius.
