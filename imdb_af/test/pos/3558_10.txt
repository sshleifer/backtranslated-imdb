Due to some writers, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, own experiences as Butlins Holiday Camp entertainers in the UK during the same time schedule, the program, "Hi-De-Hi!" In the fictional seaside resort of Crimpton-on-Sea, 'Hi-De-Hi' is written in the Maplins Holiday Camp - one of the many dotted British-owned coastal mega-rich but never seen (on the screen ), Joe Maplin. <br /> <br /> Although the actual show started with the pilot division in 1980, it ran until 1988 when the BBC considered it too soft. for the leading comedy division, seasons 1-5 focused on 1959, while seasons 6-9 fell out in 1960 - a time when the British holiday camp camp fell. In the first 5 seasons, Jeffrey Fairbrother (brilliantly played at the late, big Simon Cadell) was the camp's entertainment manager; a well-meaning but somewhat compassionate university professor who has degenerated from his upper class and waited in the "real" world to manage his team of entertainment staff, which was in stark contrast to his own relaxed personality. From seaso After 6 hours, Fairbrother was replaced by Clive Dempster (played by David Griffin, when Cadell left the show up to his popularity), an ex-RAF war hero who in many ways looked like Cadell's character in the background but more <br /> <br /> The right stars of Hi-De-Hi during the nine seasons, however, were Ted Bovis (played beautifully by Paul Shane), a stereotypical working class, ale drinking, bawdy comic - someone never the opportunity to cheat the campers; Gladys Pugh (played by Ruth Madoc, currently experiencing a career with appearances in the BBC comedy, "Little Britain"), chief Yellowcoat (called the entertainment staff because of their bright yellow jackets) and sports organizer - but more importantly one person Jeffrey Fairbrother and Clive Dempster rescued by covering their inexperience to run a holiday camp; Peggy Ollerenshaw (Su Pollard), the slightly dim but lovely low chalet girl with a burning ambition to become a Yellow Coat, and Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland), Ted's innocent protégé, learn more about "show business" than what he hoped for. /> <br /> As usual with a Croft & Perry production, the composite characters were a bunch of misfits played by the actors involved. Mr. Partridge (played by the then Leslie Dwyer, who was in his 70's by the time he left the show), the alcoholic children's warming children's entertainer; Fred Quilly (Felix Bowness), a former champion jockey with a dubious past; Yvonne & Barry Stuart-Hargreaves (Dianne Holland & Barry Howard), the snobbish former ballroom dance champions who were in the twilight of their careers; and Sylvia and Betty (Nikki Kelly and Rikki Howard), the two main girl Yellowcoats who were always looking for the kind of fun, Joe Maplin, will never allow in one of his camps. <br /> <br /> "Hi-De-Hi" typified the slapstick era of the late fifties and it's juicy and to some extent vulgar "tongue-in-cheek" humor (jokes about people coming up toilets and anecdotes about "women with big bumps" were the order of the day). But in spite of this it is a rogue of "Wearing" beauty, it has always been so innocent and has become something of the recommended family show in the 80's. Of course, the critics of the show noticed that the show had been postponed, it is welcome with a few years, but I disagree. While the early seasons focused mainly on foolishness and slapstick humor, the latter series "Hi-De-Hi" saw more thoughts in the scripts and the main characters (especially Spike Dixon & Gladys Pugh) were able to grow with more sensitive stories. lines. It was said that there were some criticisms of the show. Clive Dempster was not Jeffrey Fairbrother, and the former did not have the screen shot with Gladys like Jeffrey (I personally think it would have been more credible if Gladys married Jeff); Five seasons dedicated to 1959 and four to 1960 caused more than just a few continuity errors (the disappearance of old faces and the introduction of new characters have not been properly explained, especially with the yellow coats that came frequently and frequently Gladys Pugh, who was chosen in the pilot episode to be a liberated man-eater who suddenly turned into a naive virgin character! To mention quite a few pedanties, was one of the 1959 holiday season's season covered, Expanding the rest of the year into five more ranges, something incredible was going on, yet the show wasn't meant to be scrutinized, and the comedy followed more than its mistakes. br /> Everything Hi-De-Hi was probably one of the last comedies of the BBC's golden age, and even though it never managed to get such a British comedian lead as "Only Fools & Horses", "Pap" or even "Last" of Summer Wine "," Hi D e Hi "will be best It wasn't a comedy that the whole family could enjoy. If you have not checked it yourself, I ask you to do so.
