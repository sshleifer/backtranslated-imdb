Crack House (1989) was one of the few films during the 80's that fall into this genre. What is supposed to be an anti-drug movie seems to be nothing more than some white-exploited drunkenness exercise. However, there is nothing wrong with that. The video presentation even has an anti-drug message from one of the stars of the show Richard "Turncoat" Roundtree, <br /> <br /> The movie follows two young lovers in high school. One of them is a quasi-difficult guy and the other is his girlfriend. One of them is turned up by a friend, while the other gets a trip to the slam and later gets a chance to get back to his ex-friends. Jim Brown appears as the movie's "Mister Big", he is one bad man who can still punk out and is a very sadistic man who likes to beat his cough and beat the tar of those who try his word to deceive. Luke from General Hospital also makes a guest star spot. <br /> <br /> If you like hard edge sleaze, then this movie is for you. Unfortunately, Hollywood doesn't make it anymore and when they do, it's not exploiting or entertaining. <br /> <br /> Recommended for sleaze fans.
