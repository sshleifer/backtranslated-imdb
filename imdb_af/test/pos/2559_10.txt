Where do I start? Let me say this - after watching the whole movie and the special features on the DVD - my wife and I watched the whole movie again with the director's comment. I can't remember having ever had such a comment for a movie more than 7 minutes. It is worth hearing. <br /> <br /> I'm not a southern boy, but I spent some time ago by Memphis, and have a feel for the environment. This movie almost smells from the south, it's actually. Samuel Jackson, one of my all-time favorite actors, is wonderful like the emotional Lazarus, and Christina Ricci gives the performance of a lifetime as Rae, a woman who was seriously injured during her short life. I've always liked Ricci's work, but in this show she gives 137% of herself every time she's on the screen. Awards and small statues aren't enough to reward her for what she's in front of the audience in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are other places where you can read the essence of the story, so I'm just commenting on the work. I heard the name Justin Timberlake before he saw "BSM" but didn't know how he looked, or even why he was famous. I'm 60 years old, I'm demographically outside my target, to say the least. After I saw this movie, I will recognize him. He can act! He gives a substantial, credible performance as the loving soulmate of the County slut. <br /> <br /> The director is from Memphis, and shows respect for his home territory. He is also a good storyteller. <br /> <br /> ..... and I MUST call the music. I love Blues, and the soundtrack for Black Snake Moan is a real feast for a blues fan. <br /> <br /> I write less coherently than usual because my enthusiasm for this movie overcomes my sentence structure. See this movie and I mean now.
