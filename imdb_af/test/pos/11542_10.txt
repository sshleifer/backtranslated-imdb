This documentary about the life and comedy of Bill Hicks contains bits of Hicks' "Revelations" and other stand-up gigs. It also includes interviews with fellow comedians and people in the industry who knew him, as well as reporters and journalists talking about how his political commentary was miserable and brutal. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. I've already seen "Revelations", but the comedy clips were still refreshing. It's a nice balance of comedy and documentaries that will explain Hicks's popularity to non-fans and remember those already known to him. <br /> <br /> I picked it a ten.
