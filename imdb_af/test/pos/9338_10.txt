Without a doubt, this is the big mom of all music videos !!! Unlike most music videos, which are either "dance videos", a bad story and / or poorly interrupting lyrics, it's done right. Jackson co-authored and through evidence from VH1, this masterpiece choreographed and directed heavily. In fact, you can say Thriller is creepier than most horror movies with that last second sparkling eye. For me, this music video you judge on all other music videos. You can easily see the ominous influence that M.J had on early break dancing with the Zombi march number. Because of the dance, comedy, storyline and yes horror. I give it a 5 out of 5.
