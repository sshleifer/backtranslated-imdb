Unfortunately, this movie is being moved to the curio status it looks. Many people I asked "Did you know the Monkeys made a movie?" usually answer 'No'. It is said, if you are one of those big numbers, I recommend you see them, but with the following proviso: If you expect Monkey Style humor, it's there. It's not just about the place like the TV shows. <br /> <br /> Yes, they are trying to break their TV form a bit by making it fun like a lot of no-longer teens who are on the short end of a lot of sticks. <br /> <br /> No, you don't have to be intrigued to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> No, you don't have to keep in <br /> <br /> If you like classical music, you'll keep the intersexual tracks right. <br /> <br /> If you like the psychedelic era, you'll love the comos. </ br /> <br /> If you are a Monkees fan, you may recognize the jabs they take in the heavy commercialization of the band. <br /> <br /> In the near-immortal words of one of my best friends after seeing 5 minutes of it, "It's a weird movie, man." In fact, it might be better if you don't try to understand it, just sit back and respond to it. It's strange, it's funny, it's a bit surreal, it's experimental (yet) ... it's a lot of things. Overall, this is an experience.
