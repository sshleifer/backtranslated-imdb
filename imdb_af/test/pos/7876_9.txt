My 2nd favorite movie from 1970 (after five easy pieces) was completely dismissed by many idiots, calling in a hearing-biting piece of garbage. Peter Boyle, a well-known liberal, is unbelievable because the hard work works firmly with some problems with the younger generation. He is a frightening man, but has a great imagination and is very funny. I was a teenager liberal when it was released, but he also crawled me, just as scary as Joe. Susan Sarandon, in her first role, is perfect and a mixed stone rich fox. Queens dinner is hilarious and informative for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> It was NOT an exploitation movie and the script (nominated Oscar) had to win that year. The director just wasted enough money to give it enough credibility in Hollywood. No matter your political persecution, then and now, you will like someone in this movie. A certain 9 out of 10. It is on DVD and video. Look at it!
