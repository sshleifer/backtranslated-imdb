Do-it-yourself horror author Todd Sheets returns with another entertaining, nickel-shot-on-video clunker. It's basically just a bad excuse to sway as much as possible a lot of watery blood and glittering intestines. An evil demonic scarecrow revives the dead as ravenous rock-faced zombies, so they can feast on life. A bunch of boxing college children, a trio of dangerous escaped prisoners, led by the Evil Slade (Byron Nichodemus who finds it in a far-reaching way), two equally wasteful sleazeball hoodlums and a trio of Hottie sisters should do their best to survive. this sad trial. This is for the unnecessarily delighted and winding plot, but fortunately this hilariously horrendous hoot in narrative coherence (enough) no longer compensates with a pleasing abundance of glorious brutal graphic gore. Disgusting highlights include a woman with her fingers cut off, a lethal shoot to a young bile's groin, attempted rape, uncut, and, of course, more repulsive intake, than you can shake a bunch of moist bowel. In addition, we also have a rough, granular kinematics that continually varies between washed-out color and grim black and white, indifferent fights, to which we indifferently act from a uniformly pathetic name cast (Jerry Angell, in particular, cops the top crummy thespic dishonest for his legally abused histrionics as slimy no-count psycho-criminal Joe Bob), a raging head-beat-thrash metal soundtrack, and a generic rillery'ininous synthesizer score. Let's not forget the ridiculous ending in which several of our survivors stumble over a few bottles of carnivorous bacteria to use on the pests. Certainly, this movie is purely drunk, but it has a very awesome horrible quality which in turn makes it so awful-it's awesome Grade Z fun for hardcore aficionados of bad fear price.
