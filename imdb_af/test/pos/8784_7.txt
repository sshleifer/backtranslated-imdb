An entertaining first concept for 'North North West', 'Saboteur', has some wonderful Hitchcockian moments (one of the best at a table when the hero is asked by a woman who has not yet seen he does not carry her a plate, trying to do it, he also falls on the floor, exposes him even more!) but suffers from a poorly chosen lead (whether he makes patriotic speeches, Romc Priscilla Lane make, joke or try to worry, Robert Cummings is wood), and a lack of very clear crooks (oh, there are villains, many of them, but hardly anyone has enough screen time).
