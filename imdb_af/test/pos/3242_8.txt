I'm a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it is for me. Some of the other posts are correct: "Wannabes" will not enter a "Godfather". On the other hand, "Wannabes" is a well written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances by every actor / actress. My problem with one of the other reviews: <br /> <br /> - Conor Dubin stands up as the only Irish in a cast of Italians. <br /> <br /> - Dubin is a Jewish name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional reddish one of an Irishman. He does not stand out, but gives a good performance. <br /> <br /> It didn't earn many awards, but it deserves a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn. I found it at $ 7 at Blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised to say the least! Highly recommended.
