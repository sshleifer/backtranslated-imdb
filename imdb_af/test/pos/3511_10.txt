I saw the first one in the 80's on the TV network. I think I was like 9. (Beeld now sees a violent movie on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years ago and that's how I remembered, it's really good, anything. I think the reason it would be unmarked is because it was not followed by a **** freight successor, ie Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that take the original idea and do it better. Although it is a murderer in the bush spot like Friday, it has more in common with the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is because the film puts a certain atmosphere and sense of fear, even in broad daylight. And the killers feel more threatening than Friday. There is also a good amount of tension. I recommend now that it be released on DVD at the end of July.
