The original The Man, who knew too much, recognized Alfred Hitchcock outside the UK for the first time. Of course, part of the reason for the award was that people were amazed at how Hitchcock could provide so much on the screen on such a clever budget compared to the luxury Hollywood products. The original movie was shot in a studio. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason, he has already selected Hitchcock from his films to remake, with an international reputation and a big Hollywood studio behind him (Paramount) decides to see what Die Man who knew too much would be like an abundant budget. It was shot in place in Marrakech and London and has two major international names for the checkout. It was James Stewart's third of four Hitchcock films and his only team with Doris Day and her only Hitchcock movie. <br /> <br /> I wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again. At first glance, she will fit the profile of blonde leading ladies who benefit from Hitchcock. Perhaps because her healthy screen image was contrary to sophistication, Hitchcock wanted to have his blonde. <br /> <br /> Doris does her best acting ever in The Man Who Were Too Much. Her best scene is when her doctor James Stewart gives her a sedative before telling her their son was kidnapped by an English couple who befriended Morocco. Stewart and Day play each other beautifully in that scene. But Doris especially because she registers four different emotions simultaneously. <br /> <br /> Day and Stewart are on holiday with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco and they meet Frenchman Daniel Gelin and former English couple Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzie. Gelin is stabbed in the back of a marketplace in Marrakech and whispers a few dying words to Stewart about an assassination that takes place in Albert Hall in London. Their child was cut to ensure their silence. <br /> <br /> For the only time I can think of a hit song, a Hitchcock movie came out. Doris does indeed play a well-known singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother. The song was Que Sera Sera and I remember it well at the age of 9. You couldn't go without hearing it in 1956. It even competed with the fast-rising Elvis Presley that year. Que Sera Sera won the Academy Award for Best Song, such as High Society titles such as True Love and the title song of Around the World in 80 days. It became Doris Day's theme song for the rest of her life, and she still has to come back. <br /> <br /> The song actually works very well in the plot, as Doris sings it at an embassy party at the climax. <br /> <br /> Instead of doing so with mirrors, Hitchcock shot the murder scene at real Albert Hall and, as another reviewer said, was not targeted, it was choreographed. You will hang on your seats at that moment. <br /> <br /> It was a worthwhile remake.
