Aaah ... That thing. <br /> <br /> Watching a horror movie in which not only every character is over the age of thirty, but clearly unattractive, makes a refreshing change and reminds me of those distant times when actors are chosen as a result of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters, rather than their teenage apples on a magazine cover. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and a movie maker that can actually create realistic environments rather than over-styled parodies. And there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending, or come celebrity appearance, or lam pseudo-romantic subplot. <br /> <br /> And I miss REALLY on-set physical effects; With all the 20 year olds, try new ideas with blood and latex and early animatronics. In the 5 years between 1979 and 1984, our Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, an American Werewolf in London, The Thing, The Company of Wolves, saw a nightmare on Elm Street ... what an era for horror effects! And don't start me at the death of carpet painting. The carpet work in this movie is beautiful and seamless. <br /> <br /> What do we have now? Third-rate CGI, former music video directors and professional stylists, who even look like a "gritty" horror movie like shiny MTV videos. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to go Netflix 'The Howling'.
