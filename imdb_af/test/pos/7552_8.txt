Four Friends is one of those movies you go without any expectations, just to beat yourself for a loop. You kind of file it away, but then you hear the song "Georgia On My Mind" by Ray Charles, and images and vague feelings start flashing on the edge of your consciousness and then remember this crazy movie that makes you laugh and cry, almost simultaneously. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so memorable? First, at least for the people who lived through it, capturing the tenor of the times so well - its coveted hope, its successes, its sincerity and especially the emotional rollercoaster ride that leads to a gripping nostalgia. And then the play is just as amazing. Danilow, all anxiety and passion, Georgia, so hard to grasp as a will of the blast ... yet enchanting, and Louis, the disabled roommate with charm to save life attacking with gusto and taking every moment with a crazy smile, because he knows too well that it can only be his last. <br /> <br /> How long has it been since you've seen a movie that really cares about the people in the story? Even if they were far from perfect? The film offers people whose choices are not necessarily commendable, but the film is never moralized. It only appreciates the human condition in all its variety. Even the minor characters have a well-defined personality and a history that is why this film looks so real, even if some of the actions and responses can look like ... because that is the way life is, you think about it. And why make this movie a complexity defined by character. Really a wonderful and satisfying experience.
