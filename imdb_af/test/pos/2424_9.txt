It's another of Robert Altman's underestimated movies (let's be honest, the only movie he made that didn't really work, was ready to wear) and Sandy Dennis gave a playful thing. She's much better here than she's in "The Out of Towners". The material I will admit is among the great director Altman and the extraordinary actress Dennis, but it doesn't matter. As long as it's possible to do their thing and do well, just about any story will happen.
