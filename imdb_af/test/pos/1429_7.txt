A proof that it is not necessary for a movie to have a deep, multi-story and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie. Even if the story can be expanded in many directions, especially in the sociological way (people desire money), it seems to be perfect, just as it is. With very sudden changes, it takes the spectator to an end without any unnecessary complications and without the viewer taking the eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> But the acting for me is not that good. With the exception of Lindsey McKeon, the other was average or even worst. In some scenes, they just stared ahead of themselves. Except for Lindsey who was more convincing. It's a very simple movie to just read and enjoy. <br /> <br /> 7/10
