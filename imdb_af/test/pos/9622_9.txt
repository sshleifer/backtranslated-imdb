While it is widely acknowledged that one of the first martial arts films is playing here in the West, it is the true impact that comes in retrospect. Lo Lieh is VERY low key throughout and many of the battle scenes, while often considered innovative (what they were at the time of the film's initial release), are a tame tame compared to what happened next (especially after Bruce Lee , which has become the immediate standard through which all others will be judged forever. It is not to say that FIVE Fingers of Death / KINGBOXER is something less than a classic in their own right, because it is. Like many of the leading characters in many martial arts films, the character Lieh plays low through most of the movies for a reason, but when he goes loose, he cleans the house. You can't ask for it anymore.
