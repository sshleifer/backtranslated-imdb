Although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining, fantasy is sometimes better than real life, and nothing can be more real than Errol Flynn who plays Custer. It remains the best film about Custer. The music of Max Steiner is wonderful and even though the movie is the Irish song "Gerry Owen", which is a favorite of Custer, played. The movie should have more villains, as they try to concentrate all the bad guys in Arthur Kennedy. The relationship between Flynn and De Havilland does not coincide with any of their films, and director Raoul Walsh with his out-of-doors experience with many actors is at its best.
