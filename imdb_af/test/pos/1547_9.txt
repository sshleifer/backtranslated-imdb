One of the best of the 'kitchen sinks'. Fantastic views of London and valuable snippets of the 60's working class life. Loach's Eye seems to catch everything but does not make a judgment - a taste of things to come. As with 'Kes', 'Riff-raff' and 'Sweet Sixteen', it serves as a film-social history of Britain. Carol White is completely convincing, you love her, love her, want to take care of her, but keep your head on her self-destructed decisions and still follow her in an evil hope. Well supported by Terence Stamp, (verse from 'The Collector', also captures 'The Hit') and an abundance of English faces (everyone looks very young). Pefectly on Donovan's dulcet tones. Stamping 'Yellow is the color', in a beautiful scene, ends with him and says, "Better, I am not" (song was also used in 'The rules of attraction' - I think). to go out and get a lightning, to put her false eyelashes on the sound of 'Rosie' on the radio - priceless. A treasure for anyone who was back then and a reminder of how good life is now in England. Incidentally, Soderburgh used clips from 'Poor Cow' in 'The Limey'.
