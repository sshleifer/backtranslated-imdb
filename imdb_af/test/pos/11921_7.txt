Yes, it's not a great movie performance, but Toy Soldiers is a fun and entertaining movie. The young actor does a great job with both dramatic and comical aspects of the story, and I especially liked Shawn Phelan as Derek / Yoghurt. I've seen this one over the years and will probably see it even more. Don't think too much and you'll love it - enjoy!
