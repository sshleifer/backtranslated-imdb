Come on. Anyone who does not understand the greatness of this cartoon should be launched by any critics panel. They should not be allowed to be heard because they have no sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Anyone who doesn't love this animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained and forced to look straight for "Huckleberry Hound" episodes for 20 years! <br /> <br /> Taking and doubling the Wolf in this cartoon are the best examples of this important past of comedy ever captured on film. <br /> <br /> Tex Avery should receive a posthumous academy award for this cartoon. That's the best.
