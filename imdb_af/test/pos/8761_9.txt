"Traffik 1989" is an Emmy award-winning six-part miniseries from the UK who inspired the "Oscar 2000" winning 2000 Traffic. The five-hour film breaks out the opium / heroine trade for the viewer from the hand throwing poppy seeds in an Afghanistan field to the "main storm" of a headquarters in an apartment in England. Traffik not only provides entertainment value through intricate dramatic stories, but also provides an overview of the international drug trade at all levels to answer who, where, how and why questions from the old and unstoppable narcotic supply / demand machine. Synergistically entertaining and educational, "Traffic" will be time spent well for teenagers and above. (A)
