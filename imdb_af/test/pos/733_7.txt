This movie, also known as "not in the basement" is actually not bad. It's a little-known movie, even to die of hard horror fans, but I've entertained this movie nicely. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely not without his problems, but think more people should give it a glimpse. The story of a hot nurse working in a sanatorium is definitely a pleasant one for me. I thought that the play, which was initially forced, somehow improved when the movie went along. The actors seem to have really come in their roles. There are some good, colorful characters, including a man who thinks he is still a soldier, one who thinks he is a judge, an adult with a child's brain and an attractive girl who Attention is required for her to drop her clothes when someone comes close to her. The title "don't look in the basement" has about as much relevance to the story as "the last house on the left" on the movie. If you like movies with creepy characters in a mental ward like me, watch it.
