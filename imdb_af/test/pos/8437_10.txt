James Bridges "The China Syndrome" is a first-rate thriller; a model for those who want to make a really scary thriller, but don't know how. <br /> <br /> Most thrillers end up with the standard shoot-em-up and race that ends with the villain he / she earns. But Bridges understands that such a standard finale is not the case in some scenarios. "The China Syndrome" is exciting in a way no one would expect. <br /> <br /> The movie stars are three (then) current Oscar winners: Jack Lemmon (Best Actor 1973 for "Save the Tiger"), Jane Fonda (Best Actress 1971 and 1978 for "Cloths" and "Coming Home" "respectively" and Michael Douglas (Best Photo 1975 for "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest". This is not your standard "spot the star" popular in the 70s. The acting is so solid and strong that we forget who play the roles and believe that the characters are real people, this is a testament to the collective ablution of all three actors - they can be stars, but they are actors first. <br /> <br /> There is no music party in The movie, apart from some background songs from jukeboxes or TV shows, there is nothing Bridges does not allow any director style to come on the screen, simply presents the material, with a strong dramatic story like this, we don't need a score to divert us, it looks like a predecessor to the Dogma 95 movies eries started in 1997 by Lars Von Trier. It focuses on characters and story rather than style. <br /> <br /> The story is about a nuclear power plant in Southern California. ** SPOILER ** An accident seems to be and basically the movie about Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas is trying to uncover the truth. In a way, it's not a spoiler, as the trailer, TV spots, video boxes and reviews give it all away. But from this seemingly simple point of departure, a surprisingly complex morality pattern arises and the tension comes from human nature and the actions of people rather than a villain who forms another man (although it is an element in the film) . This makes the "China Syndrome" as good. <br /> <br /> **** out of 4 stars
