I'm surprised I have a true love for this one, because I'm not an action and adventure lover. But hey ... It's pretty hard to go wrong with a Robert Carlyle movie. I read some poor or moderate reviews on this movie, and put it apart because it is period errors or unlikely plot development, but no one seems to be the rather intriguing character transition that is typical of how a hardened, lower-on-side Happiness (Carlyle) transforms into a fairly noble, selfless hero and how the beautiful boy, cowardly vagrant (Miller) develops a true taste for the life of a highway man as soon as he gets the feel of it. Filled with a lot of bad humor, luxurious scenes (especially the use of fireworks by the former Plunkett apothecary) and a beautiful echo musical score, Plunkett & Macleane is a fast, very enjoyable piece of film. It's definitely worth your time to watch CLIMAX SCENE ONLY! Shoot them, boys!
