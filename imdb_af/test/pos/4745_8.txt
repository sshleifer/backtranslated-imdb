a compact crime drama with a good amount of action. The unique NYC location shots add to this tough little movie. Technically well done with good direction and acting. Needless to say, the wild car chase in the city center spans the upper west, Washington Heights, across the George Washington Bridge and in NJ one of the best ever on the film. Everything around a fine movie that gets me better with time.8 out of 10 ... easy
