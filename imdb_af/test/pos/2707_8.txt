The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Although it fails to provide accurate facts and details. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Gibb (picture Karen) was not a good election. She is a good actress, but plays a very naive and kind of stupid Karen Carpenter. I think the role needs a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality. <br /> <br /> Louise Fletcher's role as Agnes Carpenter is great, she does a good job as Karen's mother. <br /> <br /> It has good songs that could be included in a soundtrack album. Unfortunately, it was not, although this movie was on top of the US and other country ratings
