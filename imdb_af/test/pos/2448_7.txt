There were many movies about people who had returned from wars and had to deal with, but "The War at Home" is worth seeing. Jeremy Collier (Vietnamese veterinarian), Emilio Estevez, who is experiencing problems with his Texas family, is very likely to work for you. But nothing can prepare you for what is eventually revealed. <br /> <br /> Sharing what makes this movie so good is how it gives the viewer the feel of both Texas and the generation gap. Jeremy's parents Bob (Martin Sheen) and Maurine (Kathy Bates) clearly have a problem with their son's attitude, both about war and his rejection of Americanism. His sister Karen (Kimberly Williams) is unsure of who's on his side. But after the meal there can be no neutrality. <br /> <br /> So, we as Americans can never get the Vietnam War full, but this movie is likely to help us look seriously at how it affected. a lot of people. Emilio Estevez certainly did good work. Also with Corin Nemec and Carla Gugino.
