This film was soon made after Karen's passing, that perhaps Richard Carpenter and those closest to Karen felt a bit guilty about how they could have contributed to their health problems. As the years are over (almost 25 to be exact), it must have been easier to deny any complicity. Richard spent the years after Karen's death and remixed and recalculated the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I read, it seems he might be planning another generation of carpenters with his kids. He looks sorry for making this movie, and it may be very good why it is unavailable in any form. It was an honest assessment of the tragic short life and incredible talent that Karen Carpenter was.
