Passed by Jacques Tourneur (Cat People, Out of the Past, Night of the Demon) and written by Phillip Dunne (How Green was My Valley) Anne of India is a very interesting adventure pirate movie. Captain Anne Providence's main character is based on a real female pirate Anne Boney, who actually lived and lived through the 18th century Atlantic Ocean. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the battle where Anne's (Jean Peters) attacks hit a merchant ship heading for Europe from South America. As a result, a treasure of great value is taken with a beautiful French officer, Pierre La Rochelle (Louis Jourdan), who is being captured. Anne ends up falling in love with him and apparently her feelings are reciprocal, but it is only until she frees him when she discovers that he is a beautiful young woman, Molly (Debra Paget) with whom he is almost in love. Anne starts planning revenge on both of them, but in an unexpected turn of fate they end up sacrificing a lot to save them. The pirate movie clique figure of `Black Beard 'also makes its appearance here, this time played by Thomas Gomez. <br /> <br /> Although Anne of India is probably no more or less than a repeat of pirate movie clich√©s, it still has its classic moments in beautiful visuals and marine structures filmed in Technicolor, as well as in some aspects of the story and especially in personal touch to correct Jacques Tourneur. 10/07
