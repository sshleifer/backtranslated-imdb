Normally, I'm not investigating online, but it's Saturday and I'm trapped in my room, on a rainy day with nothing to do, but watching sci-fi movies and Xena: Warrior Princess (I can't do the damn 'Joxer the Mighty 'song from my head, it's been the last ten years or so, just appears randomly when someone (me) does something idiotic). If you have any complaints about this movie and actually put them on the internet, do you have any idea how much of an idiot you look? If you expect more from Bruce Campbell than he is sticking out (in the literal sense) than why in G-d's holy name, do you watch his movies? No one looks at a Bruce Campbell movie when they want to see something genius and understandable, we look at them so we feel better about ourselves (like the people watching Jerry Springer and eating Chunky Monkey) and easily entertained by senseless psychobab. I personally love Bruce Campbell movies. I'm not a complete idiot, in fact, I see myself as an intellectual and a scholar (haha, shut up, Ally). His movies reflect mad, random, peculiar, ridiculous ideals that anyone with a brain, scream, or no can enjoy. That and he was sexy on Xena: Warrior Princess, even with the face. I rate this movie an excellent 10, just because I can. If you can't do simplistic plot schemes (if any), hot babies are in the slide muscle (leather, spandex) and known if it's not exhausted by insanity, then it goes out loud, don't look at the movie. (or anyone who calls as much as the name Bruce Campbell). Oh yes, Ted Raimi was wonderful in this movie! Away to Ted! You did the best with what you had. ; |
