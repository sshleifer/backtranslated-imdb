Film follows a lot of students in NYC High School of the Performing Arts. There, Coco (Irene Cara) is a black singer who will make it on top despite everything. She was helped by Bruno (Lee Curren) a white musician. Then there is Doris (Maureen Teefy) who wants to be an actress - but she is shy and scared. She becomes friends with Motgomery (Paul McCrane) - allegedly the only gay student in the school and is translated by Raul (Barry Miller). Then there is Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray - who unfortunately died in 2003), who is homeless and a good dancer - but can't read. Then there are several teachers (Albert Hague, Anne Meara stand out) to teach the children. <br /> <br /> The songs are BIG (the title tune and "Out Here On My Own" is nominated for Best Song - "Fame" won), the dances are energetic and the young role play shows a lot of ambition and talent. BUT this movie misses the boat in the drama section. Many plot lines are picked up and left open at the end of the movie. Why did Coco make a porn? Did Doris and Raul almost stay together? Did it also? How about Montgomery - what happened to him? And has Leroy ever graduated - and how? There are too many long speeches (Raul has two) and moments that only lead to nothing. I suppose there were cuts in the screenplay - I can't believe the movie just left this open. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing for the acting and again the music. There is basically no bad song and the dances go full of power (and at one point stop traffic - literally!). My favorites are "Fame", "Out Here ..." and "I Sing the Body Electric" which is a good closing rod. So I recommend it but can only give it a 7 - the font really should be loose. And it didn't. <br /> <br /> Trivia: They wanted to shoot this movie at real school for performing arts, but couldn't get permission. The dean of the school read the script and said there was too much curse in the film. It's true - there's a very dirty language, but that's how high school children talk. Avoid the TV version that abysmally overbeats it.
