Race Against Fear must be one of the most moving TV movies I've seen in the past. All the starring performances were excellent, especially those of Ariana Richards (Mickey Carlyle), William Bullimer (Coach Kurt Ansom) and Susan Blakely (Margaret Carlyle). Ariana in particular has a very emotional display, with facial expressions to suit. She portrayed the emotions that Mickey felt perfectly, and you could easily believe she was really raped, so realistically was her performance. <br /> <br /> RAF is an incredibly realistic movie due to the moving performances of the throw. Bullimer seemed incredibly good as a rapist, and you hated him more and more when the movie progressed. Blakely also used an emotional performance as the raped girl's mother (Mickey Carlyle), and you felt increasingly sorry for the Carlyle family because no one believed them from the rape. <br /> <br /> All in all, RAF is a great movie. It is both moving and full of tension, as you are constantly uncertain whether Ansom will be prosecuted for the rape due to the lack of witnesses, evidence and belief in the claim. I recommend watching this movie.
