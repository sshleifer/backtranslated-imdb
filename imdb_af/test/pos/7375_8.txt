I saw the movie on a free-air channel late at night, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. As a horror movie fan, I often watch these midnight movies during school holidays. More often than not, the horror movies that appear during this time are usually big lamers. 'Campfire Tales' is definitely not included in the category. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is basically an anthology of short stories lying loosely on well-known urban legends. They are accompanied by an environment in which teens tell these stories around a campfire. This campfire environment in itself has a mysterious plot. However, this particular story is weak and confusing. Of course, it is mainly used to compose the other ghostly stories. <br /> <br /> There are three stories in this movie (four if you're counting 'The Hook' at the beginning), all of which are ghostly and well made. I especially enjoyed the third story ('The Locket') involving a man whose car breaks down for a mysterious household. This particular story works well to spell you out with sudden flashbacks of home history. In addition, the end of the story will shock you completely! The first story ('The Honeymoon') was also very creepy, but the second story ('People can lik too') was somewhat lacking. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie veteran, I usually don't get freaked out. This movie definitely did that job well! What I especially like about this movie is the fact that it is divided into three shorts. This means that the movie will not flow through character development and settings for an hour or so before actual bloodshed begins. It makes 'Campfire Tales' ideal for sleeping, partying, etc. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales is a creepy, sharp horror movie that will stop your heart more than once. It's definitely better than the crap you'll find in the theater today (Blair Witch 2, Urban Legends: Final Cut ... bleah!). Find a copy and watch it ... if you dare! <br /> <br />
