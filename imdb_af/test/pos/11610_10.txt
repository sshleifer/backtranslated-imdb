I saw this piece of perfection :-) at the fantasy film festival in Berlin and when I was out of the theater, I felt like I was dried! I've seen a lot of movies, but there are just a few that I call perfectly, such as koyaanisqatsi or the club-unconscious cruelty is definitely one of them !!! Half of the people went out of the show in Berlin and I can absolutely understand it! it is not a movie for 'ordinary' people with dreams and illusions! A person who lives in his / her dreams every day does not want to see all the horror in our lives and on our planet, will be greatly shocked by this movie! if anyone reads it now, what s.c. and also think it is good: please contact me so far, i have met no one who shares my opinion - it will be cool !!! this movie earns 10 points out of 10 !!! Eventually I'm really sorry for my bad English - I'm not a studied person !!! (and I'm so gut so * g *)
