Easily one of the best shows ever made, and it just gets better with age. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the main reasons for this was the English custom made by David Weir. <br /> <br /> A Japanese friend of mine once told me the show in its original language was more whimsical and less flat, hilarious that the version we all know. <br /> <br /> The fact that the show is so strong for its non-Japanese fans, mainly due to Mr. Weir's inspired efforts and a winning voice over work. <br /> <br /> Well done, sir!
