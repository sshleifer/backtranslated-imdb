One of the few comical Twilight Zones that is actually very good. We have Floyd The Barber from Andy Griffith Show, the stock trading Old Geezer dude from Many Old Westerns, and lovely old Frisby. It also has the cool spacecraft interior that I believe was used in the Sci Fi classic Forbidden Planet. Or else The Day The Earth Has Sill.Plus The new guys in town drive an exotic Renault (I think) sports car back in the days when European cars were known as "foreign work" in the US. The whole idea of ​​accordion as a weapon is a hoot. And the fact that Frisby's friends love him, despite being a total BS artist, is a heartwarming moment.
