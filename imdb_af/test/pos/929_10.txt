This is my favorite movie because there is so much going on that you don't even see and so many things that make you wonder. "Did Kieslowski mean it or is it in my head?" For example - is the judge intended to be God or a supreme being? <br /> <br /> Also, Irene Jacob, as in The Double Life of Veronique, is outstanding, there may be some superficial actresses, but no one can pass on the beauty of mind with physical beauty as she does. <br /> <br /> Also, tritainant is wonderful without really saying much and the things he says are great as his answer to Valentine. . . "Be".
