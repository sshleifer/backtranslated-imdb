<br /> <br /> It's the curious mix of real life, surrealistic life, comedy, tragedy and love that Australians have developed on their own. <Br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is basically a good as naive man. He wants to come in with a local "Big" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the moment he is at first on the dark road to crime, he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here's the cause of the mistake to change his life in unexpected ways. After getting accidentally on the wrong side of Pando, it gets very bad very quickly and if it wasn't for some other worldly help, it would be a short, sad movie. Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and nobody escapes in one way or another, but at the end it feels good. Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how devastating crime can be on normal lives. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and skilled at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan are wonderful as usual. These are small ensemble characters that are credible and I choked on the good guys and didn't like the bad stuff. <br /> <br /> This DVD is usually in the cheap path, so I would recommend adding it to your DVD collection, which will be well spent. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
