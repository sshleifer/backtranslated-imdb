It's great to see a lead actress whose idea of ​​"acting adult" is not sensual. Instead, these children see a problem in their community and take responsibility to help solve it. Hoot is a movie aimed at families looking for a fun day at the theater. The production values ​​are good, especially the shooting of Montana and Florida. The soundtrack by Jimmy Buffet is a perfect fit. The young actors are enthusiastic and refreshing. <br /> <br /> The plot, about a thirty children working together to save some funny owls of death in the hands of an unscrupulous pancake house rich builder, will involve children. So many movies make children powerless, it's nice to see a movie that shows kids are working hard to make a difference. And while parents are absent or temporarily distracted, it was nice to see children who want to follow in their parents' footsteps and try the right injustices. <br /> <br /> If you are tired of all the self-reliant story lines about children filling the cinema, Hoot gives a shot. Then take time to talk to your children about the adventure of serving others and caring for the world they live in. A positive message from a positive film.
