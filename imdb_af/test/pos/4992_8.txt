Things I want. Steve Zahn as Gus nails the part, copying Robert Duvalls ways that make him feel comfortable with Gus fans. (some of the other actors also copy their predecessor style in this series). Karl Urban, looks grim and tough, but can also crack and smile, which T.L. Jones did in the original series. The gear, the guns, the clothes, everything accurate or very close to time accurate. I will never forgive Costner and Duvall for having a nylon lariat in their open range chuckwagon. The Comanches, they are actually visiting, rather than concealing a modern hall under a Navajo blanket. And they are not painted as politically correct peace lovers, but as a proud warrior. There are a few dumb screens, but it knocks the shit out of another variation to do something stupid not to win a million-dollar reality game.
