K-Pax is a very intriguing film. Is Prot (Kevin Spacey) really a stranger, or is he a mentally strangled person who just thinks he's a stranger? This is the question that Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) must answer before the self-declared deadline that Prot sets for his departure from Earth. <br /> <br /> As the film unfolds and more evidence is uncovered, both theories grow in credibility. His ability to identify, from memory, the area of ​​the galaxy where his home planner is located, indicates a knowledge that no man can possibly possess. Yet, the hypnosis sessions lead to a real person with a very real and traumatic life, filled with devastating events that could have caused such a personality disorder. The end seems to give the answer, but is just ambiguous enough to make you wonder if you really know. Normally I don't like lady or tiger ends, but this one is tempting. I have my own theory that fits all the clues, but I do not know my theory is correct as anyone else. <br /> <br /> Director Iain Softley (Wings of the Dove) turns the story delicately, with great skill. It is a rare example of the director who remains in the shadows and causes impressive acting performances by talented actors to dominate the story. It's not to say that directing is technically inferior because it's excellent. However, Softley remains unobtrusive and delivers great power by using subtlety, a pleasant change from today's vanguard directors who visually grab the viewer and shake as if shouting, "Look how brilliant I am!" <br /> <br /> Once again, Kevin Spacey delivers a great performance as Prot. This is an extremely demanding part, requiring Spacey to give the cool and logical Prot one minute, and then dial gears to make his plagued alter ego under hypnosis. Spacey is as credible as both alien and human, making the viewer's task so much more difficult. Jeff Bridges is also great as the ruthless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about Prot. <br /> <br /> This is an inspired storytelling for the thoughtful viewer. I evaluated it a 9/10. If you have to close the end of a movie, this movie will be very frustrating. However, if you keep a fascinating puzzle that reminds you of the credit for a long time, you won't be disappointed.
