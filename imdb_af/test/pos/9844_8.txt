James Cagney, racket runner and political ward, becomes a deputy commissioner of redress and visits a boy reform school. The catch is that Cagney is not there, he really wants to make a difference in the lives of the kids there, because he comes from a background as they say. <br /> <br /> The villain of the piece is Dudley Digges who is a grafting chiseler and a saint abuser. One of the sub-texts of the Mayor's plot is that these children are mostly immigrants and those who judge and are in positions of power are those who are here for a few generations. Note in the mess hall scene if Digges thank you for the food they will receive. Digges eat well, but the kids get quality that you won't feed on your pet. <br /> <br /> Cagney has his own problems in the city with some of his henchmen and he has to take it on the lamb. It puts Digges back in control and setting up the movie for the climax. <br /> <br /> The Mayor of Hell was a typical product of the working class studio. And because it was pre-code, it sometimes gets pretty horrible. A final version of this Crime School, with Humphrey Bogart and the Dead End Kids, was a more purified remake. <br /> <br /> Although Cagney plays well in the lead, Madge Evans is also the school nurse, the acting awards go to Dudley Digges. Hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunk, but friendly, surgeon surgeon in Mutiny on the Bounty. But Digges is a good player and a joy to watch in every movie he is in. <br /> <br /> This film is not often shown because of its racial and ethnic stereotypes. Many minorities will be offended today. Still, it's a fine movie. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, a few years ago, the movie Sleepers came out and touched some of the same issues. I think reform school movies don't change at any time.
