I couldn't agree with the comments left by "coldshitaction" and how this movie is a masterpiece. I have never seen a movie that runs my adrenaline that this movie did, and it mostly happened when Bronson ran a firefight with an M-60 and, like 20 dude of a gang, it is genius. Certainly the best action movie ever made (also not exaggerated) can really be the best action movie ever made. From the start, one needs to know that you are doing something that is great when police leave Bronson and tell him to clean the slums. Again, genius. And again, Bronson is a bad ass. Paul Kersey is just as cool, maybe even cooler than John McClain or the Terminator, he's just a bad ass. And what is also nice is the fact that he is a nice guy and buys a little bit, and he helps an old couple before bagging a few bags. genius. Highly recommended, if you hate this movie, you're crazy.
