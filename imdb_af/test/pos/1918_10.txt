well-made documentary document on a sailing race, common sense and the loss of both. <br /> <br /> I remember reading Sir Francis Chichester's version of his journey across the world when I was in high school when I watched this movie. what an adventure it was. <br /> <br /> deep water tells an equally fascinating story. <br /> <br /> It takes a special person and an excellent sailor to drive an uninterrupted journey around the world ... alone. <br /> <br /> This movie does a great job of demonstrating it. <br /> <br /> I like to sail, and my brother is chasing J-30s. <br /> <br /> But I could never achieve such a performance.
