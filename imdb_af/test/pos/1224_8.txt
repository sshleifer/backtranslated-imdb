It's a decent movie. Although a little short of time for me, it tackles a lot of action, grit, communities and emotions in that timeframe. Matt Dillon and the other main character are doing a good job in this movie. The emotions and intensity were convincing and tense by the film. This is not a typical fancy expensive Hollywood CGI action movie, but it was a very satisfying movie indeed for the prize. My evening was great because of this movie. This movie is a straightforward traditional action movie with great acting, story and direction. I would recommend this movie. The character development of the characters was good and let you believe there is actually a real event taking place. Because this movie I believe was made with a cheaper budget, the acting and quality was much higher.
