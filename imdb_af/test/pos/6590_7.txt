As far as Miguel Bardem's career was concerned, it was one of the more terrifying of the recent Spanish theater. He made nothing but garbage. Until now. "Incautos" was quite a surprise: it is a serious movie, with rhythm, with a good role and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> The art of robbing, that's what "Incautos" is about. A movie very similar to David Mamet's "House of Game" and things like that. A thousand twists in the screenplay, and a story where nothing like it seems. <br /> <br /> The weaknesses in the latest Bardem movie can be the so-called American language, which rather looks some of the characters unnatural (especially Victoria Abril's. She is a hell of an actress, but in "Inkautos" she seems a little forced). Ernesto Alterio is not that bad, but he is not half as good actor as his father ... And what to say about Luppi ?? Well, he's the MAN. <br /> <br /> In short: a good movie. The best Miguel Bardem ever made. I hope this is the start of a brand new stage in his career. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
