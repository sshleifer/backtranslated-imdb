This one is a hilarious diamond in the rough. The acting and plot are not so impressive, but the lines just keep going. It gets very flack, because at first glance it looks like a bad movie, but it is so boiling that you can't help but be amused. The spastic relief quick dialogue and peculiar characters keep it going ... I especially loved Sharon, the Canuck on Shrooms eh? The one who really stole the show, however, was Richard's little brother Andrew (Ira Heiden), his high number was somehow encouraging. The whole movie smelled.
