The love letter is one of my favorite books of all time, so of course I was skeptical when I heard it's a movie. But I liked it. I grabbed myself through the whole movie. I admit it is not a good movie, but definitely an enjoyable hour and a half. I thought Capshaw and Scott were perfect like Helen and Johnny. Just as I imagined them. And the town and the scenery were just right. I recommend this movie, but don't expect too much, just enjoy it.
