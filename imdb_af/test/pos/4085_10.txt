I don't usually like this kind of movie, but worked at home and wanted to look something halfway while doing it. I was so worried that I gave up just to sit and drop off to watch the last half hour. And I usually don't shoot tears about this kind of performance, but I cried in the end. Much emotional nuance. Great acting, and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the man who played Luke was also really good. Highly recommended.
