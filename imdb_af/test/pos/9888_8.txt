I saw this movie at the Phila last night. Film Festival. It was an interesting and funny movie that had impressive and moving scenes. Peter Falk was excellent like the rest of the casting. They were credible and played their roles well. The movie may have been a bit long and the conclusion was good. The audience laughed in the right places. Family dynamics were great and although it was a Jewish family, they could be Italian, Irish or any other Greek. I recommend this movie if you are interested in laughing at a topic that is not often dealt with. IOT reminds you of the consequences of your actions and how it affects others in your life and those who are not clear in your life.
