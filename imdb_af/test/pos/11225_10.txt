It is a rare and fine spectacle, an allegory of death and transfiguration that is not preaching or mawkish. A work of mature and courageous insight, Northfork avoids arthouse distinction by refusing to belong to any kind. Unlike the most memorable and perfect film to set up a clear comparison, Wim Wenders's 1987 Wings of Desire (Der Himmel Ã¼ber Berlin) holds an ambivalence in a narrative spectrum that stretches from everyday to supernatural tension. This story of earthly and heavenly prominent domains in the American West holds the fairy-tale literality known to his German predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels, with their wings endowed with sustained sentimentalism. His heavenly transcendence, it is inspired by dead faith or driven by a feverish dream, never shares ways with rough and rot. This solid foundation gives a great credit to writers and directors Mark and Michael Polish.
