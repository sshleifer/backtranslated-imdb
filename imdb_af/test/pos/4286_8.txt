Years ago, when I read John Irving's The World, according to Garp, I was surprised that most of the younger adults I had contact with didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience. I experienced a bit of a thing when some of the comments on this site were read, which were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Apart Lies is certainly an age and experience. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he is a successful lawyer - she is the perfect wife of a successful lawyer. They have a townhouse in London and a house in the country. Everyone is good until the "villain" enters the cover of the son of the richest man in town. This man seems to be out of the word, "Go." He is disdainful of all and everything that includes his own children. In the traditional form of last-minute guys, the lawyer's wife enters into a relationship with the bounder. You see the lawyer is really a good guy, but with the marital property of an organized perfectionist. Although he really loved her, he bore his wife to death. The bad boy is much more exciting. <br /> <br /> All these things are entangled with the death-and-death death of a man in town where all the facts indicate that the vehicle is the driver of the vehicle. . <br /> <br /> It is easy to say that this movie does not lead to a happy ending, but it leads to a very satisfying end in that the man and his wife learn and grow from their experiences and probably will be able to perform their personal lives more successfully. <br /> <br /> Three excellent actors play the main characters in this movie, and there are performances that make the whole thing a pleasure to watch. Tom Wilkinson is perfect as the man. His portrayal shows us a good man who has so much control over his emotions that he has lost contact with the world. Emily Watson shows us a woman so trapped in the role of perfect woman that she almost lost her knowledge of passion. That passion is born again by the character Rupert Everett played well. <br /> <br /> Having reached that point in life in which you understand that everyone has clay feet and that everyone - even with the gifts of intelligence and opportunities - makes many very wrong decisions, then you will probably enjoyed watching these excellent actors creating the lives of three such people. It is a beautifully active and focused adult movie about realistic adults.
