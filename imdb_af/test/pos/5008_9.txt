This show was a pleasant surprise after watching Mad TV on a Saturday night. Spike is an excellent host you can tell, is still accustomed to it, but he does great adaptation to his new job. I can imagine that this is a difficult transition from the author (Seinfeld) to host, but unlike many new talk show hosts, he does not allow airtime driving while trying to figure out what to do next. no. He is fast minded and every segment and division rolls together. It also doesn't hurt that he's so sexy in a nasty way, so he's not hard on eyes like Leno or Letterman. I can't remember the exact delivery date my favorite was, but I especially loved the Idiot Paparazzi shit with a fake J-Lo and Katie Holmes. Great New Show !!
