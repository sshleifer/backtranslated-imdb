A very good Australian movie. Nice to see the look and feel of Sydney as it was in the 1950s. This movie impressed me when I first saw the movie release and it is still very good. Fine directing works by Phil Noyce, wonderful camera work, thoughtful lighting and a few good performances across the board. An absolute "must see" for any of 70's Australian cinema students. One out of the box!
