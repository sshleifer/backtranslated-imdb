To see Gary Busey in a G-rated movie was a first and a good one. I don't know much about the director, but of course he knows how to spend a few bucks and make the most of it. Where did Jillian Clare come from? My kids love her! The only thing I remember was Christopher Atkins being the Blue Lagoon. Disney has to watch this movie and put him to work. The woman thinks he is very cute. I like what he did with his character. He was so real. What we liked most was the message this movie sent out. Greed sucking and winning faith, love and family! This is the first low-budget DVD we've bought that had so many things about it. The producers made this one for children and the kids loved it. They love the music and all the extras on the DVD. The director probably won't like family movies, but I hope he does, because he really knows how to get the most out of kids, animals and stars like Gary Busey. The dog was wonderful and watched Gary Busey act like a dog, even harder. There wasn't much we didn't have from this one. It's hard to find a family movie without all the rough humor, and Quigley was a wonderful surprise.
