Tom Clancy uses "Alesandr Nevsky" in his book "Red Storm Rising". In the book, Nevksy was in theaters over Russia as a forecast for the Soviet invasion of West Germany. I felt I had to check it out. It was excellent! The cinematography was wonderful and the story was incredible. I'm not sorry to watch this movie and add it to my collection.
