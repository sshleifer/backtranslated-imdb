This movie is the biggest ninja movie ever made in my opinion and if you haven't seen it, it's worth watching. I would review this movie a 10/10 if you want to see more and watch http://uk.geocities.com/ninja3thedomination The opening sequence where the evil ninja kills everyone in his way is excellent, his character is the best. He must then have a young woman who finds him to die. She must then take revenge on the police who killed him, which means there is more murder and action. But just a ninja can destroy a ninja so she and her boyfriend, who are also one of her targets, use the help of Yamad (Sho Kosugi) to release the evil Ninjas spirit and destroy him.
