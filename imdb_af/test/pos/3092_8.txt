Fata Morgana is by far one of the strangest and most confusing art movies I've ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary, because while the documents of the images exist, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogical, so unclear, that I wonder if it really was worth telling this story just so that this images cannot exist. The film is basically the story of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, whether it be stranger or something indescribable, all of which takes place in the Sahara desert. The title of the picture is related to the illusion or reflection of images, both actually and hallucinated, that people in the desert often testify. This is also known as mirages. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with an airplane landing, followed by the land and weather plane again and again and again and again and again. With each aircraft landing shot, the actual architecture of both the location it landed and the plane itself began to dissolve slowly and grow less and less real and more and more reflective images. The images in this movie become more intense and more unusual as the picture continues. The story of the film tells of the creation of the universe, as disturbing sexual images of sand and landscape move past the camera. The shots go further and further in the desert and Herzog films he sees and finds. The strangest reflection of the world is shown in the distance while Herzog meets some of the purest and photogenic collections of outsiders you'll ever see. When the Leonard Cohen soundtrack comes in, you can be sure that you are in the world of a mad man in love with the universe. <br /> <br /> I can't say too much more about this movie, without destroying anything, but I'll say it's a sobering experience and there's really nothing like it. I like watching movies that are just in their own classes. This film is definitely a good example of how Herzog mixes love storytelling and documentary movie story in a removable form. Fata Morgana is unfortunately welcome, but it is welcome, but by the time it is close, the images will probably be burned forever. Definitely a must-see for those who are obsessed with the nature and origin of the universe.
