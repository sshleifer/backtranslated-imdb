I saw in Sweeney Todd on Broadway in 1980. This was played by George Hearn and most of the other role-players appearing in the national tour production were detected in Los Angeles in 1982. Last night I watched the new DVD release of the Los Angeles production, although I have owned the videotape for many years. The production and performances could hardly have been better, but the original band's age has been shown because both the audio and video quality are under modern standards, even on a new printed DVD. Still, I still give it 10 out of 10 due to the greatness of the work and George Hearns and Angella Lansbury's brilliant amazing performances. Even today, my most memorable reminder of a live music theater performance, Hearn's version of "These are My Friends" should be. "You'll dump rubies," brrr.
