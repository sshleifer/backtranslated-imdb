I thought it would be more fantastic a story. But the subject is rather on the earth compared to the story about the Death Cart I was expecting. In fact, there is much more of a social drama. As usual in the films of European writers. <br /> <br /> Actors are interesting, not too much like in the average silent movie. Images are not as good as holding onto your mind as in Bergman's Smultron place. <br /> <br /> It is true that the comparison between the two movies is the most important point. Smultronplaas begins with a vision of a Death Guard in which Sjöström's character can see his own body. There are watches without hands. He is obliged to look back at what he did wrong. There is a vision of his happy family in the country. In Körkarlen Sjöström's wife does not deceive him in front of his eyes, but she wants to flee with the little ones because it will never get him better. Eventually, Edit's confession is some kind of law. <br /> <br /> Well, I just want to add that Sjöström destroys the door with an ax because his wife locked it up and plans to go away with the children, reminding me of The Shine. What was much more of a fantasy story with Death hanging around.
