Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. This is Werner Herzog's most unconventional movie. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we get a collection of images, words and music that work so well together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this movie are directed and give lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating in the middle of the desert, which are not actually there, but reflecting hundreds of miles away as in a mirror. The use of music in this movie is so brilliant - from Leonard Cohen, Mozart, and the Third Band. Imagine Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey in the Desert; That's how this movie is. This film is so hypnotic that it has the ability to make you feel like your mind has left your body. A must see. This will change how you watch movies. Rating: 10 out of 10.
