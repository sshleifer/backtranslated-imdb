Have you ever looked at a movie or documentary and to keep yourself from shouting things like "No! Don't!" No? Well, it's time you do. And no doubt, DEEP WATER is the one that starts you. <br /> <br /> The story is based on Donald Crowhurst and his entry into the first worldwide yacht that individuals undertook in 1968. The word "individuals" is important, as the men who walk out on this almost suicidal escape only leave. <br /> <br /> Most men are known in the sea communities of England (where they are launching), but one of them is the "unknown dark horse" and his name was Donald Crowhurst. Struggling financially, Crowhurst captivates a player who can take everything from him if he fails to at least try and make it a big part of the race. He can take his house, his property, everything. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst now finds himself between a rock and ... well ... deep water: try the race with a submarine ship and an unproven captain, or lose everything you own (significantly was because Crowhurst had a wife and several children). You will also notify the term "unproven captain". Not only was he not in evidence, he was never on the open sea! Did I call suicide? Right between the archives of the front and back races, and those of Crowhurst's friends, relatives and acquaintances today, Deep Water is mysteriously composed. Initially seen as a poor juice coming in over his head, the film gradually showed the limited choices Crowhurst had on the water for months and months. She's leaking. Equipment breaks. Psyche extends to the breaking point (and beyond). Crowhurst finds himself lost in an internal struggle without a successful way out. It's also interesting to see the psychological break that other racists have, as they handle their separate incarceration on board their respective boats. <br /> <br /> The wavy emotions you will feel like watching this amazing documentary can make you a little sick (not to try to get your seabirds). And you will probably be frustrated with the choices made; maybe just as frustrated as poor man Crowhurst. <br /> <br /> The end is also astonishing because we see the real ship that Crowhurst sails, sits deserted and rotting on a Caribbean beach ... no different from other things that have been lost and rotten by the end of this bad thought race. <br /> <br /> Incredible.
