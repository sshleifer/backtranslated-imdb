Hal Hartley joining a European film series is one of his two or three best efforts to date, and, fortunately, one of the few available on DVD. Just 63 minutes walk, my only problem would be with Hartley. I always leave more, but never as much as this time. Martin Donovan is amazing like Jesus. PJ Harvey is beautiful and interesting as Magdelena, but the highest point for me was Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry Fool) as Satan. Hartley gives him excellent dialogue and a chance to use his sounding voice to full effect. Look for three scenes in which a microphone waits for him, as if a poetry grind is about to be won by the devil. I read other comments on this film and had to add mine because there is not enough praise. If you like Henry Fool, Martin Donovan in anything (versus Sex), and / or very clever comedies based on Biblical ideas, get it as soon as possible.
