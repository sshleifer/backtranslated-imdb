Great movie. No gratuities like most Hollywood movies. Everything supported the tension of the plot. B&W also gave it a basic no-frills feel. In short, it was visceral in the simplicity of movies and movies. <br /> <br /> The following serves as an interesting contrast to Memento. Characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively. In that sense, I have also reminded myself a bit of "In the Company of Men", also highly recommended. One difference between Nolan's two films is that Memento was a bit easier for me to follow, as the B&W scenes are progressing in a constant chronological direction, as well as in color. I don't think it was true of Follow, where scenes seemed. If you have the choice between video and DVD, I highly recommend DVD, as this gives you the opportunity to watch the movie a second time in chronological order, not only in the clipped (though complicated) sequence offered by Nolan no. It also makes it easier to combine the order for yourself if you want. <br /> <br /> As another viewer noted, one of the best things about both this movie and Memento is that none of the role-players was known. They were characters, not big-name actors who brought personas into other movies. <br /> <br /> Given some similarities in the plots, I wonder if Memento is a reminder of the following, but intended to make a bigger audience, like Edward Burns. She is the one in the form of - and with much the same role as - The Brothers McMullan.
