This definitely is the most advanced X-Files episode of the first season. This episode is what I think when I hear "X-Files". the plot is simple but exciting. Our main thrust plus a few scientists are going to investigate an Alskan outpost in which his research team murdered each other. It appears from a small parasite dug out of the ice, infected the research team. The parasite attaches itself to the brain and causes paranoia and madness. Soon no one can tell who they can trust, or who is infected or not. <br /> <br /> This episode was an honest tribute to John Carpenters' great horror movie "The Thing". The Ding is in Antarctica and a team of scientists find a devastated outpost in which the resident is killed or killed. An alien that has been buried in the ice for 10,000 years has been thawed. It has the ability to imitate any form of life. therefore, the main characters can no longer be separate friends of enemies. <br /> <br /> Believe me The THING is one of the most exciting and thrillingly filled horror movies you'll ever see. If you like the episode ICE, I advise you to see it. Or if you first saw the DING, I advise you to see ICE. <br /> <br /> ICE is the best tribute to John Carpenter's DING I have ever seen, and it is inspiring as one of the best X-Files episodes. I give it a 10/10.
