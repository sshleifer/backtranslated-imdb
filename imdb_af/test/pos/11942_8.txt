I gave these 8 stars out of a possible 10. It had an excellent plot, and Peter Coyote and Michele Lee, as well as the rest of the role play, did their part well. <br /> <br /> Both Peter and Michele were too long for the ages to be their characters, and their children in the movie were, of course, better than their grandchildren. <br /> <br /> I missed the first ten minutes of this movie. So I don't just know how the body arrived after 25 years and returned to Denny Traynor (Peter Coyote's character), but I had no trouble picking up the storyline. <br /> <br /> Barbara Traynor (Michele Lee) was surprised when her longman, Denny, was arrested for a murder in Oregon about 25 years ago, a state Denny claims he was never in. <br /> <br /> But as evidence emerges against Denny, his story changes. Then his story changes again and again, until Barbara doesn't know what to believe. <br /> <br /> Barbara, however, thought of coming to the bottom of the riddle about the fateful time Denny and a young girl named Sherry had a stranger named Wayne Kennedy, who ended up in murder. <br /> <br /> I entertained the movie, played well, and it told me what really happened between those three people. <br /> <br /> From what I saw during the closing credits, it was based on a true story.
