All right guys, here's the deal with this movie. It's not the best, but for all of you 80's kids out there, it will bring back good memories of your childhood. Personally, I love this movie. I'm still fond of rainbow british and caring. So, in my opinion, if you are not a child now or a child who loved and / or is, you do not like this movie.
