I am glad that it was the work of foreign films because it cannot be accused of unfair bias. With the absolutely no reason, the Jacksonville police are chasing this case and choosing the first black suspect to accuse the murder of a white foreign tourist. They chose 15 years. old child who is just as close to a saint as you can find at random and then foolishly make an unlikely case against him. In addition to the unfairness arising from the blatant prejudice, there are 6 months of unfair imprisonment of a completely innocent young black teenager. It makes one question whether we, as a society, are being imprisoned and found guilty of being charged. These docudrama are well-produced, professionally recorded and presented in a fascinating package from which you do not want to take a 1 minute break. If you care about social justice, don't miss this one. It certainly deserves his Oscar.
