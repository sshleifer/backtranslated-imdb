I use IMDB a lot. Mainly read comments from other people about movies I have seen or not seen. I thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life and how I watch a movie. I think I've seen it at least a dozen times since autumn 94, when I first saw it in the theater. <br /> <br /> I feel Kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time. And I think it's his best one. It was his last one. I was very sad the day I knew he was dead because we lost the chance to get something from him. RED is just the best Kieslowski + incredible show by Trintignant & Jacob + kinography by Sobocinski. If you haven't seen it, watch it! If you have, just come back !! <br /> <br /> Red: just a masterpiece. Please, forgive my poor English !, reader
