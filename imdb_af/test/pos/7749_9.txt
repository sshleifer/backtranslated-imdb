This show is wonderful. Not only is "Haruhai Suzumiya" a very well written anime show, it also reflects things like philosophy, science fiction and a small religion. It is hilarious and "cute" at some points (for lack of a better term) at others. Actually, this may be my result of my lack of experience with Japanese anime performances, but it's one of the best of his genre I've seen. <br /> <br /> I need to give credit mainly to the authors. Since the original Star Trek I have not seen such a brilliant scope of imagination in a television program. I hope the authors continue to add strange new characters and give more insight into all the great characters that have been added. <br /> <br /> 9/10
