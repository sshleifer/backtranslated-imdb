It's one of the best movies I've seen in the past year. Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles as a naive plantation owner and she is a mysterious trickster. Words will not do this masterpiece justice, it is enough to say that it is a movie that explores the dark side of love and the pain, humiliation and capacity for self-seduction associated with it, although it is dressed as a film noir. Forget about the poor remake with Jolie and Banderas, see the real artticle instead and treat yourself to a few moments of wonderful spectacular beauty.
