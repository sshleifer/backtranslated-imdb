This Don Siegel / Clint Eastwood strange and hypnotic drama left the road in 1971 and a pity. A fascinating character study with some great women for Squint to handle. Geraldine Page was one of our top actresses and she was thrown perfectly. Young Jo Ann Harris is a flirty minx, and Elizabeth Hartman (who died too young) is undeniably suppressed. <br /> <br /> A 7 out of 10. Best Show = C. Eastwood. From the same year as DIRTY HARRY released, it didn't matter except to get good reviews. Find it out unless you're just in "Blast" movies. Very subtle and scary, this piece will stay with you.
