I find this film meretric, preliminary, lethargic, and proficient in a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid. But I admire the courage to cast a script, turn the camera on and do a fool. I find the ominous performances, lighting, cinematography, sound and any film school laws that D 'Urville Martin has broken funny. Speaking from a film director's perspective, there are times I just want to drop and have fun on the set. This movie looks like fun. When other aspiring film directors give me advice, I'm just telling them to watch any movie by Rudy Ray Moore. They always give a confusing look back and ask me why not watch masters Woody Allen, Scorsese, Lucas, Capra? I laugh and include that you always want to know what should not happen in the storytelling story.
