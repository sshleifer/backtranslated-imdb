The three most important names in this movie are Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore. These three deliver the strongest performances, but the whole movie does a great job. The film, although it is about the porn industry, does not let itself out with its own sexual premises. On the other hand, there were many scenes in drug use and although it is important to understand the characters' lifestyle, I think there was some leftover in this department. Paul Thomas Anderson didn't do much, but he was selected for this film based on his 1988 work "The Dirk Diggler Story." One thing brilliantly portrayed is the family like an atmosphere between the characters while they work, live and party together. Although it is not a typical family, they certainly look to each other. The wonderful soundtrack really helps you feel the time during a time when disco was the rage. There are also many disco favorites and other great songs. <br /> <br /> The story is about a gifted young man named Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) who is invited to the porn industry. He changed his name to Dirk Diggler and became almost overnight and adult movie star. Jack Horner (Reynolds) is the director who takes his films very seriously, as he believes his work is more than just pornography, but that it is true art. Dirk, however, becomes too dependent on drugs and soon goes over a dangerous path where he has to lose everything. Although a greater focus is placed on the character Dirk, there are subplots for the other characters and their trials in life. You will find yourself and hope their situations improve. All-in-all a well done movie.
