"Landscapes after a fight" open with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather funny movements accompanied by Vivaldis Four Seasons. An opening. But we soon learn these prisoners as a crowd, and when they (also humorously treat) a man buried alive, the protagonist stops for a moment, but they are soon more involved in finding books from the finished camp than caring for his neighbor. . <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is in an American camp from which prisoners are not released, in a kind of semi-freedom, semi-camp. A perfect set for a study of war crimes, American camps, Polish nationalism, Catholicism, sadness and human misery in general. <br /> <br /> Film makes an important turn. In come women, and with them change film, light, color and mood. At the same time, it appears that these prisoners were slaves in the Holocaust. I think a major underlying political theme of the film should be mankind's treatment of Jews during and after the world war, not just the Nazi extermination, but mankind - and even force them out of Europe after the war. At an emotional level, the film is about sadness and the problem of getting sad, how the environment is making difficult and how difficult it can be to share sadness for people with different experiences. <br /> <br /> But the film is a mat of underlying inconsistencies, humor, irony and sudden beauty. A Gypsy prisoner plays a harp several times during the film, an emotional melody brutally rejected by the protagonist. The example picks up an important essence of the movie's style and theme. When it comes to humor, it is very funny how the protagonist constantly keeps his glasses, crowds, hay stacks, and so on. Lose. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to understand Spielberg's respect for Wajda when you see this movie. The great treatment of light can be compared with Spielberg at its best. The Grunwald interlude speaks for itself. Narrativly just brings the movie out of the camp, but it filmed film film the dream and eternity with profound beauty. Anyway, there's another scene I can't leave without comment. This is the Christian communion. Undoubtedly ironic, but at the same time very religiously we see the transubstantial moment, all falling on their knees, while the protagonist of seclusion is saved by the priest to serve as a comic altar son. His bells mock the scene, but also give it emotion and love. When Nina gets her bread, sunlight falls on her and bells ring spherical, which is the highlight of the movie. <br /> <br /> Main players are excellent in their roles. Olbrychski as the perfect Wajda protagonist - the dubious reflective mind, unable to bring all aspects of his mind and emotion alive. Beautiful Celinska is having a big bodily acting debut in a character who cannot express her inner in her proud movements. <br /> <br /> Those who try to define everything can often ignore anything. This is what Wajda manages. His films are either very moving, deep or beautifully shot, but pay attention to the particularities of life and society. A moment of joy for one is the moment of irony for a second, the moment of grief for the third, a moment of nothing for the fourth. <br /> <br /> There are at least two reasons to pay attention to Wajdas films of this period. First, the remarkable free expression of deep political impact. This country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later. Secondly, the development of a cinematic and narrative language that Kusturica grew up.
