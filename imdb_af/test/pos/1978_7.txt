Now, a fan of sci fi, the trailer for this movie also looks a bit, how can I, Hollywood. But after looking at it, I would like to say it impressed me. Jude is a class actor and wife. Leigh pulls it off better than she did in Delores Clairborne. It brings to mind films like The Matrix, 12 Monkeys and The Cell, which may not sound as attractive, but it really is one of the best movies I've seen.
