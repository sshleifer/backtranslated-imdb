Just want to inform your parents that this movie was pretty good !!! <br /> <br /> Think it's a lame ass movie, but not at all, many moments in this movie were pretty scary. <br /> <br /> This movie has plenty of blood, gore, and some sexy makeup screens, of course, to keep any horror buff like I 100% satisfied! The cast was also pretty good IMO. <br /> <br /> Although it's not a high budget click, the effects definitely have a bit of fun. <br /> <br /> It is worth checking if you want a shoe belt horror movie, that's for sure !! <br /> <br /> - Tom
