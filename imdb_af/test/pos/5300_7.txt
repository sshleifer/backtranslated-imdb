Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderful fun and imaginative look at childhood. At a time when movie animation is dominated by Disney / Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is refreshing and reassuring to know that Miyazaki still relies on traditional hand-drawn animations to tell his charming and captivating stories. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the friendship between a magical seagull / goldfish and the human child she meets during a strange outing to see the human world. The human child, Sosuke (Doi Hiroki), lives in a small house on a cliff overlooking a small port city in southern Japan (based on Seto Island) where he, along with his young mother, Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko ), live. Sosuke calls the strange goldfish "Ponyo" and takes it to the daycare / nursing center where Lisa works. Ponyo is definitely not your typical goldfish and soon begins to adapt and adapt human aspects (she develops human speech and an appetite for ham meat) by sticking some blood from a cut to Sosuke's finger. <br /> <br /> But just like Sosuke and Ponyo start to develop a connection, Ponyo is withdrawn by her father, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji) who is a former man who has rejected the surface world and is now trying to collect and develop magical elixirs taken from the sea, helping him to restore and rejuvenate the world's oceans. <br /> <br /> However, Ponyo's desire to become human has become so strong that Fujimoto can no longer contain her and she takes a more human look and breaks free from her water world and returns to see Sosuke . <br /> <br /> During her outbreak, Ponyo unconsciously releases release of Fujimoto's cupboard of magical elixirs that unleash all kinds of magical sea creatures that cause a violent storm in the sea around Sosuke's town. Desperate to solve Ponyo's uprising, he soon called for the help of his beautiful wife, Ponyo's mother, the water element, Mother / Woman of the Sea (Amami Yuki). <br /> <br /> As with his past films, Miyazaki's "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" touches on various ecology and environmental themes, and this time focuses on the health and vitality of the world's oceans. The opening sequence is sometimes disillusioning when Ponyo meets a printer's boat scraping the ocean floor, exposing the rubbish and debris mountains. One can understand the anger and frustration of the character of Fujimoto who spent his lifetime restoring the damage done by civilization to his oceans, but it finds it a frightening and almost fruitless pursuit. <br /> <br /> It can't be said enough of the remarkable animation in this movie. It is sometimes bizarre and outrageous but at the same time charming and inquisitive. It was clear that Miyazaki wanted to capture the sense and style of a child's imagination. The art style has the appearance of crayon / pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and imaginative. It's almost like a child's coloring book comes to life. <br /> <br /> Child actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do good work like Ponyo and Sosuke. They bring beautiful charm to their roles. Nara Yuria in particular sounds so beautiful as Ponyo that it is little wonder that Doi's Sosuke falls to the magical girl. Former campaign girl / model and actress Yamaguchi Tomoko (Shichinin No Otaku, Swallowtail) is also very good at her role as Sosuke's modern mom, Lisa. I was first confused by her character because I initially thought she was Sosuke's older sister. It also didn't help Sosuke call her "Lisa", rather than Mum, but I think it's a sign of the times and an indication of the modern Japanese family (in the anime series Crayon Shinchan, Shinnosuke also refers to his mother with the first name as well). <br /> <br /> 80-year-old Tokoro Joji sounds completely different from the serious Fujimoto, but does not show his character sound-like, scary or goofy. While we no longer get to know his character, former pro-baseball player and actor Nagashima Kazushige (who depicts Sosuke's father Koichi) also delivers good voice. The opening theme "Umi No Okasan" by Japanese soprano Masako Hayashi is simply beautiful and stirring. In contrast, Fujimaki Fujioka and Nozomi Ohashi "Geke No Ue No Ponyo" theme are light and amusing and claim the images of a traditional Japanese nursery. During a brilliant sequence, the soundtrack assumes an almost Wagneric operational sound, with music sounding like Die Walk√ºre. <br /> <br /> However, the film is not perfect and suffers from moments where the central story of Ponyo and Sosuke takes a back seat to some of Miyazaki's stunningly fantastic footage. I also wish we had more time to explore Fujimoto's back story, as well as the relationship between Sosuke and his father. <br /> <br /> Like "Kiki's Delivery Service / Majo No Takkyubin", "Howl's Moving Castle" "Princess Momonoke / Momonoke Hime" and "My Neighbor Totoro / Tonari No Totoro", "Gake No Ue No Ponyo", is another Miyazaki classic that is a great feast for the eyes. Like a contemporary fairy tale, the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that will surely be cherished in the years to come.
