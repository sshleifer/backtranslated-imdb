A lecture on the life of the plagued wizard named Ray Charles. His pulsations on the piano made fire music and his nostalgic voice created exciting, cool songs. Every barrier that Ray faced never kept him, and he found his way over conflict. A real lesson. A large team of producers help to recreate the era and armed with huge costumes, hair and settings. Follow Ray's story and believe his true, direct filming! An icy music freezes and goosebumps the audience with clever audio editing. But the most important part of the movie is Jamie Foxx. His acting is really great, the most diamond-polished play ever seen. He lives his role. He's the Ray of Light.
