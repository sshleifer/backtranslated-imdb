The War at Home is so good, it's become my new favorite show. Me and my neighbor Carly and April watch every Sunday and laugh at how long it is. I love how everyone is so sarcastic and so worried and they live every little problem. If someone does something dumb, it never lives and it's soooo how the family is. The father always has three children on every little thing. I love how parents have no idea how to deal with the children. It is so true to the real family life and the fact that parents are so overwhelmed and have no idea how to solve their teenage problems just put the performance on top. The war at home is so cruel honest and so true to the world that it has become a milestone for sitcoms to come. It's not Happy Days or The Brady Bunch it's real life.
