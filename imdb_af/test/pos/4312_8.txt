It's a good look if you have time - deal with three friends who come in an unnecessary battle and become in serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some shady people and cannot handle it. much, very disturbing portrayal of Japan, the randomness of modern life ... some intense scenes, but a bit of a pot boiler <br /> <br /> The spoiler was that the plot is not too clear on English subtitles. Of course, I don't know Japanese. <br /> <br /> The only other Japanese movies I saw were kurosawa, which is different and exalted than this modern genre. So, can't really compare. otherwise it compares better with most Hollywood blockbusters for plot and build story. <br /> <br /> taptieg24
