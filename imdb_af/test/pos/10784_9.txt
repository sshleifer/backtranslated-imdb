WOW, a masterpiece of a movie that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> I didn't know what this movie was when I left it late night. I didn't realize it was a Stone movie until after the movie when I entered IMDb. If I see it, I'm fascinated. The cast, especially Eric Bogosian, is just fantastic. One of the best scripts and camera work ever ... The movie pulled me in and enchanted me to the end. I did not dare to shine with the fear of missing something. Amazing how a small-budget movie can be so annoying and well-made, while big-budget movies containing tons of action and computer-generated special effects can be so incredibly boring. Don't miss this movie ...
