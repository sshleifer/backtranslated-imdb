Broken Silence of Race Against Fear 1998: The movie Ariana Richards, William Bumiller, Susan Blakely, Tracy Ellis Ross, Teryl Rothery, Scott Vickaryous, Marissa Rudiak, Ken Camroux, David Neale, Bruce Dawson ... Director Joseph Scanlan, Sara Charmo, Jean Gennis, Phyllis Murphy. <br /> <br /> This is another lifetime channel film, made exclusively for television, released in 1998. It is directed by director Joseph L. Scanlan, TV series. Inspired by true events, it is much like most lifelong movies, a women's warning story, the awareness of the predator in the family (mother, father, wife, husband) and mentor (teacher, in this case, trainer). Young and little-known actress Ariana Richards (she played the little girl in Jurassic Park) delivers a highly convincing performance as high school track athlete Mickey Carlyle, raped by her coach, Kurt Ansom (William Bumiller) and silently should suffer if nobody believes her story, except of course her own mother (Susan Blakely). Together, mother and daughter fight Kurt Ansom behind bars. The movie goes pretty well, is ultimately predictable, sometimes too melodramatic for the sake of drama itself, but is actually powerful. Ariana Richards' performance is soap-friendly, but she is the strongest in the whole role. Her facial expressions, body language and overall acting are realistic in terms of how she, as an aspiring athlete, idolizes her coach. He is in turn violated and must now fight with shame, trauma and further in court. William Bumiller plays the part with a nasty kind of duplication, though he is far from subtle. He has previously abused other star athletes, who remained silent and made it up, and apparently innocent. William Bumiller, a lesser-known actor like the other, has never played such a role, but he has a credible and strong performance overall. It is especially disturbing to see him in this role because he is a sexy main actress in everything he does, including lesser-known films and on the soap opera "Guiding Light". The only real problem I had with this movie is the way the movie is structured. As the film opens, we look at Coach Ansom to rape Mickey and let us know right away that this guy is not good. But it creates poor character development and story. If the first scene was instead the sequence with the opening credits in which we run / run Mickey in the city over a lake, we would have better character development because we don't know that Coach Ansom, while seemingly interested in success. from his star athlete, is really a nasty piece of work and we would have seen Mickey know a person she thought she knew and then received a rude awakening when she realized she was wrong. Director Joseph Scanlan is not a stranger to drama for television (Knott's Landing, Star Trek, Quantum Leap, Outer Limits, Lois And Clark, Earth Final Conflict and films like La Femme Nikitta. These are "Stand Against Fear" (1996) He manages the gravity of the event, and we are really disturbed by the coach who walks around the showers where he rapes his own student, these scenes are graphic and must be seen by adults, but his message is clear: Sexual predators and rapists are not always aliens and can take different forms and their leopard can even include a high school. This film supports the cause of the fight to prevent violence against women and encourages women who were victims to testify and to fight so that rapists will not cause any further harm to others.In spite of other negative reviews, this film does a good job of expressing its message and must be given to mothers, daughters Gh school students (including male and female). Worse than rape is to keep quiet when it happens, even worse.
