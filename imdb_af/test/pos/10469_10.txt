Food always makes a good topic in movies, as "Chocolat" has shown. "Babette's Feast" is the same kind of thing. Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) is a French cook who, after the repression of 1871, fled to her country of oppression. She moved to a very religious Danish town. The people in this town simply have nothing for joy. This is until Babette cooks one of her beautiful meals. <br /> <br /> It's not just that this movie is going to bring fun to a place it never knew. Like other Scandinavian movies (and non-Hollywood movies in general), it seems that a movie can keep you interested without the use of explosions, car hunting, etc. It's a movie you can't afford to miss. <Br /> <br /> Another thing. Do you think the Danish word for "feast" sounds a bit like "taste bud"?
