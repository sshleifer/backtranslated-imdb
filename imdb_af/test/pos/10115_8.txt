Radio will make you laugh, cry, feel. This story based on a true story is the perfect movie for some to watch. There is plenty for both. Cuba Gooding Jr.portrays the title character to perfection. His performance is worthy of nominating an academic award. The compassion of the movie is obvious. The movie evokes many emotions. I really enjoyed this movie.
