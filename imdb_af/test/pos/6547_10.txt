I saw UZUMAKI about a year ago and am interested. The only Japanese horror movie I've seen before was KWAIDAN (which I proudly own DVD), fantastic! The idea of ​​a town absorbed by spirals sounds exactly like something from Lovecraft. Surely it reminds one of SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH, of the residents who are slowly changing into monstrosities (in this case giant snails). And who can forget the washing machine order? I hope we will soon see this one on Region 1 DVD (I see that Sundance has recently selected it on American TV, hopefully they will do it very soon) so we can see it all. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!
