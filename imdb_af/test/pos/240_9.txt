In Brooklyn, night club dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) has a simple but happy life in the McGuire's, owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty, Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) have a ritual on Friday night: they order oysters in a bar and try to find a pearl. Rusty's life changes when she participates and wins a match to be the cover of the Vanity magazine. She is invited to work in a big theater in Broadway, whose owner suggests her. She lost her happiness and started drinking in her new lifestyle, lacking the love of Danny and her old friends. Cover Girl is a wonderful romantic comedy, very naive and has beautiful parts such as the beauty and talented Rita Hayworth who dance, sing and perform; Gene Kelly, specially in two scenes, dancing with herself and with Rusty and Genius on the street; The songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectacles. Danny, the character of Gene Kelly, is almost nasty with his chauvinistic behavior. Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent: I found her wonderful in 'Gilda', but she is stunning in 'Cover Girl'. In keeping with the information on the cover of the VHS, Cover Girl was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot, which gave continuity to the story rather than just being thrown into the movie. My sixteen-year-old boy saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent Gene Kelly festival and they loved 'Cover Girl'. Therefore, I dare say that these classics are recommended to any film lover and not just to the old generations. . My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Modelos" ("Models")
