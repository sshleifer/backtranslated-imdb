The historical inaccuracies of this film are well documented. It was never meant to be a serious history, but an entertaining saga and it succeeds. Errol Flynn was never better, as this role was adapted to him. Olivia DeHavilland was never more beautiful. Arthur Kennedy never been disgraceful. Anthony Quinn is never more noble than Crazy Horse. It had a lot of humor and pathos and kept your interest throughout. The one historical aspect that I found most strikingly inaccurate was the final "Last Tribune" that took place on the shores of the Little Big Horn. The movie version is filmed in a desert without any river in sight. However, I consider it a wonderful entertainment that is typical of Hollywood's golden age.
