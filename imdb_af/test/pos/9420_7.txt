This is one of the paradoxes of Basil Rathbone's war-time anti-Nazi Sherlock Holmes films (Voice of Terror, SH in Washington, and this one) that while the stands and institutions are mostly horrible, they are so good in them. Despite a bizarre wind-swept hairstyle designed to make him look younger, he blows through every scene with so much bite and attack that you hardly register how thin the sites are. Here, he also has a great acting report with Lionel Atwill, who makes a wonderful repulsive professor Moriarty - a colorful cockroach with fine hints of sadism and depravity (it should not be, children). Against the climax, turning into a lab coat to drain Rathbone's blood "drop by drop", he is excessively sober as Seinfeld's arch-enemy Newman. The movie itself is an old kiddie matinee prize, but it benefits Roy William Neill's attention to staging and atmosphere. It also looks pretty sharp in the UCLA restoration of the DVD - don't even think about buying another edition, everyone blurs, brackets public domain prints.
