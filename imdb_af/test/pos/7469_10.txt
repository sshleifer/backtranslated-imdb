Written, acted and filmed very strictly. Violent, but not too much. Whoever edited it knew exactly what he wanted to portray. There is no wasted scene in this movie. "The Usual Suspects" was an excellent ensemble acting; it is a collection of excellent individual performances. I rarely buy movies, but this one is worth owning.
