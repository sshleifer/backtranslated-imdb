Under the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a quiet and very intimate installment. The most notable element of the film is its silence; no one is talking. I don't think Besson, despite what was apparently in most of his later work, meant it as a kind of cool gimmick. What I think is so clever and so effective is that each one has to communicate in a different way, based on intuition and emotion, no matter how small. Although I was not glued to the screen, I think that it is a very touching and sensitive perspective on human nature. His vehicle is the stylized sci-fi movie. Part of his reflection on the nature of the human world is that each one of his people is not necessarily played as a perfect human: The hero, a lonely drifter in the deserted new world, is packaged by an older vault, Refusing to keep her part of an exchange of food between him and a rogue, brutal character played by Jean Reno, and so Reno tries to get everything he can, mainly with brute force. So, the antagonist is right, though not a good person, and the protagonist and his sympathetic foil are both wrong, although they are both good people. <br /> <br /> It's shot in a bright and sharp black and white, edited and captured in a low key, but boasting and small-scale approach, and its actors are very real. How can they not be? They, like their characters, are left with the bare necessity of communication. This is one of the few really good movies that Luc Besson wrote. His previous work is almost always better than the fluff he now crawls out.
