After learning that her sister Susan is considering divorce, Kate decides to travel to the disturbed woman's remote home, spending time with her. However, when Kate arrives, Susan is nowhere in sight. This is because someone killed her and knocked the body in a cellar in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to find out where her sister could go and put her own life in great danger. The killer is still on site! In her first post-WITCHCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance. Merwin Gerard's teleplay is based on a short story by McKnight Malmar. Malmar's story was brought to television only in 1962 as an episode of Boris Karloff's THRILLER anthology series. THRILLER was very close to the story, which is a pity, because it could have used some punching. Granted Malmar wrote a moderate flu number, but Gerard (creator of the ONE STEP BEYOND show) adds several clever ingredients that increase tension and tension.
