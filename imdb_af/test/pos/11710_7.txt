Sharky's Machine is a crime drama in the early 80's Atlanta. It dies Burt Reynolds as an apostate police spokesman who is about to stop crime and corruption in his city. The story is about a dirty politician who is on top of a crime circle that has brought the city to its knees. Sharky's link to bring this syndicate down is a cheap hooker he falls into during the film. The action ranges were well done for the early 80's and the soundtrack / score is pretty good. The play is B-level, but it's a nice, fine movie to have in your DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Overall 7/10 <br /> <br /> Peace <br /> <br /> Buggy Leaves
