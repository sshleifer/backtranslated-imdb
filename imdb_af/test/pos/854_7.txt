It was a surprisingly good movie, and an interesting idea. However, it was only a little disappointing because the Twist was a little too predictable and just a little too early in the movie. While it looked, it became a bit bizarre and confusing to the point that the only reasonable outcome might have been the inevitable plot change, but it certainly didn't ruin the movie. There were excellent performances, there was never a boring boring moment, so totally worth watching this one. It interested me in the end, and for me there aren't many movies that can do it today. I recommend people to watch this fantastic little movie.
