That's right, we have a 2008 movie with themes of "Letter Encounter" and "The Bridges of Madison County." It is basically the story of lost love, salvation and a triumph of human spirit. <br /> <br /> The performances by Richard Gere and especially Diane Lane are very good. Gere gives the kind of limited performance here as a doctor looking for meaning after a patient dies on the desk. Lane is the mother of a rebellious daughter and a beautiful young boy who split from her walking husband and also sustained the loss of her father in the same year. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn stole the show in one scene meeting with Gere. He is the heartbroken man and he tells his love for his retired wife. This will bring tears to your eyes. <br /> <br /> Fresh from her triumph as a gratifying mom in "Doubt", Viola Davis appears as a friend in the film and hangs her hair literally in a fairly favorable performance.
