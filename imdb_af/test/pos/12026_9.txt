It was really one of the best deals I saw on TV. He's just an amazing artist. His personality shines through in each of the songs he does. I really wish it was available as an uncut DVD so I could watch it over and over without the -beeps-for explicit language. I didn't have the chance to see him live, but that is something I really want to do now. I can't forget his backup singers. They really added a lot of dust and humor. With their camp style, and flamboyant dance movements, they really complement Dan's true talent. I wish there were more of the songs on his live CD, which is also incredible. It is refreshing to see someone like him. Just as incredibly personal and really, I really can't say enough good things about Dan and this show. Again, I just wish it was available as an uncut DVD.
