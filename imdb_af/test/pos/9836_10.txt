This show is a show that is ideal for adults and children to sit down and watch. The stories are a bit slow for adults, but they are still good. There are many children in my family, boys and girls, and it's hard to get everyone to agree on what to look at, but they always agree with each other if they want to see the Mystic Knights. It's a great show and I hope they will continue to do so. All the kids in my family and myself think that Vincent Walsh is the best of them all. We saw that he did a lot of other work and thought he was doing a good job. We wish all actors, actresses, writers, directors and producers all the best and just want the good work to stop.
