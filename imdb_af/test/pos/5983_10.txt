In Belarus of 1942, two Soviet soldiers were captured by Nazi-friendly Belarus. In captivity, the attitude of the two men differs greatly from their lot. One of the soldiers manages an inner force and spirituality, incomprehensible to the other. Larisa Shepitko's latest film is one of the most beautiful war films in film history. The cinematography, by Vladimir Chuchnov, is incredible - especially in the opening sequence, where long, slow, shooting shots depicting the loneliness and almost desperate nature of the winter landscape in rural Belarus perfectly set the atmosphere. It is easy to compare with Tarkovsky's films, even more, since Tarkovsky's alter-ego Anatoli Solonitsyn has a small but important role in The Ascent. The acting is generally brilliant, especially by Boris Plotnikov, in the part of Sotnikov. The film reveals an old-fashioned belief in the power of religious passion, related to characters such as Dostoyevsky's Prince Myshkin, or Tarkovsky's Stalker. However, this is not a weakness of the film, but rather one of its greatest strengths. The religious content seems so honest and humane that it is impossible not to be moved. The emotional wealth of the film cannot be overstated; the answer is not that simple because a brief summary of the plot will make you think. The slow development of the characters, and the emphasis on their complex relationships with each other, remind the Commissioner, another great Soviet film. The Ascent deserves a second look, as well as a third and a tenth. It still offers interesting ideas, beautiful images and emotional complexity.
