I love money! I stumbled upon this brilliant movie last week in a local video store. Wasn't sure what to expect. Bring it home, set up the player and then start my journey to stupidity. The first show I did didn't laugh very hard. It wasn't until the second show the movie really started to catch me and the humor was so funny. It reminded me of Austin Powers, first to look, it was good, then the real fun started telling people about it, just about every scene and set-up. I make all my friends look at this movie, everyone I know. This movie may well be one of the most accurate "future" movies ever made. This movie is more than just 84 minutes of entertainment, which is a warning for the future of our civilization. Mike Judge, the fantastic mind that brought us office space, brought us a vision of life into the automated future. Luke Wilson's dead pan humor as "average" Joe improved the film so much more. Watch this movie when you're done, read more! Write More! THINK MORE! For the future, if it's not for your own!
