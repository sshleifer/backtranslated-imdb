This movie features the early eighties as well as FUN !! I remember watching this movie on HBO when I was little, and that was my favorite movie. Since it was a while ago, no one I ever met knew what it was. Then, about the time my roommate said she had seen it, and that it was her favorite, they started pushing it again! Fortunately I now have a copy !! If anyone ever wants to see the biggest (cheesy) scavenger hunt, it was probably the beginning of hazing for frats, this movie is it !!! (Watcher - must have a serious love for 80's cheesy 80's !!)
