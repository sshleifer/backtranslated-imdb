What fake documentary documents (fictional someone?), This one is there with the best! It looks very real and that is what it is aimed at. In recent events (Guantanamo), this movie is even scarcer, so you could say it was before that time, when it was released in the 70's! <br /> <br /> One can only hope that such a government does not exist! Looking for terrorists and interrogating people just like that? Of course, the people who interviewed all the same (70s mentality): Screw politicians and politics in general. Maybe it wasn't that smart, but one might think ... but hey, don't forget. It's just a movie! ; O)
