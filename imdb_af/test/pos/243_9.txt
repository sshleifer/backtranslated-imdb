A fantastic musical starring Genkelly and Rita Hayworth. He owns a nightclub where she dance. She is not yet a star, but she gets a big break when she is chosen as a cover girl for Vanity, whose owner actually fell in love with her grandmother. When he sees the deal, he immediately counts her for a game that runs his maganzine. Hayworth's newfound fame starts with wonders for Kelly's club, but her star is rising so fast and so high that his grip on her falls. It is not the most original of the plots, but the two really do make it work. It also helps that the script is great. Kelly is not yet at his peak, especially his peak as an actor. She's dancing, but, wow. Hayworth is the star, but Kelly claims the film's most memorable moment while matching his own reflection. Of course, this is the start of Fred Astaire's shadow in Swing Time, but I think Kelly one-ups it, which is hardly credible. In fact, this must be the most wonderful dance series in film history, except perhaps the final of an American in Paris a few years later. The rest of the songs are also excellent, and the musical numbers are even better. Bad, Rita did not sing her own songs (well, she may have some of them, as her singing voice is sometimes different). Her dance is wonderful, just like the rest of her acting. It's not hard to love her in anything. She is really one of the few truly beautiful women of the classic era. Not plastic like many of them; no, you can really see the warmth in that woman. Her smile was so disarming. Phil Silvers has the role of Kelly's best friend, and he is also very funny. The trio of Kelly-Hayworth-Silvers is, of course, the core that eight years later became the Kelly-Reynolds-O'Connor trio in Singin 'Rain. One of the greatest musical numbers in the movie looks almost entirely with the "Good Morning" number in Singin '. I think Singin 'in the rain is the better movie, as Cover Girl is a bit rough around the sides. However, this coarseness adds to the charm. There are aspects of this movie that defeated Singin 'in the rain, and even an American in Paris. For example, the central relationship is more emotionally involved. Instead of the dominant older man pursuing the girl (Leslie Caron and Debbie Reynolds were only teenagers), we have a very good relationship with two people who look more like equals. There is no pursuit - an aspect that unfortunately makes many of the best musical a little sour, you must admit. Kelly and Hayworth are a couple from the beginning, and when it started running out, I really felt it. 9/10.
