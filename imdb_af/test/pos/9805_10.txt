I rented the movie and loved it so much that I bought it. Elia Wood (Mikey) and Joseph Mazello (Bobby) are outstanding as the two boys. Their new stepfather physically abuses Bobby. The abuse was implied, for the most part, not seen, and brought a lot of passion to help abused children. There is a magical quality to the movie, as the boys' imagination helps them find a way to deal with the abuse. You should try to understand the story from a child's point of view. I still think at the end. I watched the movie 3 or 4 times and each time I think of possible new meanings. I don't know exactly what Richard Donner meant to me, but it's a great movie! Joseph Mazello and Elijah Wood will let you hug your children.
