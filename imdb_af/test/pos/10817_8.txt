I found this DVD in the library and, based on the jacket notes, it might look interesting: a black comedy that took place in France in 1940, just as the Germans entered. ("Boy, should they roll in the role?") But do it! It's a clever, original, exciting and funny movie. I don't mind thinking about it? Foreign or USA That writer / director can find humor when we know part of the outcome (the Germans will occupy France for four years) is remarkable. That he does it with such charm is part of the joy. What starts out with black comedy and fluff, even ends with some serious moments? including a "heavy water" cupboard race (part of the preliminary A-bomb research), and a fast-paced history 101, intro to the start of the collaborative Vichy government that will be South France governs many of the German occupation. * But don't let anything scare you: the movie itself is funny, charming and romantic and forward with a steady clip. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this is the combination of actors we've seen many times (Adjani and Depardieu) and others we've never heard before. Along the way there are two star turns: Virginie Leydoyen and Grégori Derangère. Both are impressive, but Mr. Derangère is especially so. According to IMDb, he was in ten movies for this one ?? but he also won the emperor as "most promising actor" for this role, so apparently he was not as well known, even in France. He is a combination of romantic head and comic actor ?? and he makes it all so effortless. You can be reminded of Cary Grant in "Bring Up Baby" and "Arsenic and Old Lace" ?? It's hard to do comedy on film, because the risks are huge that the actor can't see. But Grant pulled it off beautifully, and this man does too. I think we'll hear more about him in the future. <br /> <br /> For sure, this movie won't please everyone! There is a little violence, though nothing you don't see on TV every day. But if you are something original you can feel after you have seen that you have unearthed a spectacular jewel. <br /> <br /> * The so-called "spoiler" in this comment.
