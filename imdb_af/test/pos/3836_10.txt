"Terror Balance" is still one of the best Star Trek episodes ever made. It was inspired by the movie "Enemy Below" (starring Robert Mitchum), a movie about a cat-and-mouse game between two captains during World War II. In this episode, Captain Kirk and his crew play similar games with a Romulan vessel. This is the program known for the war-hungry Romulans, which is far-flung from the Vulcans. It is an incredible voltage episode, built tight for maximum effect. It is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra low meaning to the story. Mark Lenard makes his Star Trek debut as the Romulan captain (he will later play Spock's father, ambassador Sarek). A must-see episode!
