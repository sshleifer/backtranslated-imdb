This movie is one of the best of 1986 with creepy, but intriguing performances by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper! The Reagan years were pretty dark for many, not just teenagers, but this movie really caught up with the despair and despair. Well managed with a great script (apparently based on a real story), I don't really see weaknesses in this. The opening shot was brilliant. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves was good for a change and me. Skye was right on the money. Hopper had three other major performances that same year (Blue Velvet, Texas Chainsaw II and Hoosiers). I think it follows a cult and I wonder how this picture would go if it was released again. Super stuff!
