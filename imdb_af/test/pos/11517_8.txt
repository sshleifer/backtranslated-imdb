New York lights were the first all-talking feature film. There was, of course, The Jazz Singer, released in October 1927 as the first feature film to feature synchronized dialogue. This film, released in July 1928, is, however, virtually unknown to its location in film history. It started out as a short but gradually tackled up to - in 58 minutes - accidentally becoming the first all-talking movie. It opened for a closed home run and a $ 1 million Warner Bros. surprise. It was good money back in 1928. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple. Two landowners buy naively after a barber shop on Broadway, which speaks as a talk-maker to "The Hawk", a gunman. When they learn the truth, they can't afford to come out, because the younger hairdresser, Eddie, tied all his mother's money in place. Kitty is the younger hairdresser's girlfriend, and the gangster Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) has an eye for his older girlfriend (Gladys Brockwell) for a newer model - choir girl Kitty (Helene Costello). A policeman is being killed while trying to stop the Hawk's men from downloading a variety of bootleg liquors, and the Hawk sees it as an opportunity to frame Eddie to get Kitty to himself. <br /> <br /> This early talkie is fun for the enthusiast of this pioneering work. Certainly, the plot is elementary and the dialogue stilted, but there is something you don't see much in early talks - background music score. Vitafoon was originally used for this purpose, and they still use it for musical accompaniment with the dialogue. And there are song and dance numbers! The scenes in Hawk's nightclub are used as an opportunity to show which movies never happened before - musical numbers. There is even a wild-eyed emcee with some heavy makeup left over from the silent era that a hack is looking at. <br /> <br /> At this stage, the moisture phone could not go outside because of the static camera sockets. scene in the park between the two lovers Eddie and Kitty are simulated - and cheap. The green looks like something from an Ed Wood movie or perhaps a high school production from "Our Town". <br /> <br /> Gladys Brockwell, as the Hawk's throwing girlfriend, delivers her lines with punch. She is a true trooper considering which lines she should deliver. To the Hawk - "So you think you can have any chicken you want and throw me back in the deck!". Huh? mixed metaphors someone? And then there are her last lines: "I lived, and I loved, and I was lost!" Did anyone pay to write this dialogue? Brockwell had a great success with her talkie career after she played a triumph in silent movies (the evil sister in Seventh Heaven), when a fatal car accident briefly cut her career. <br /> <br /> Then there's Eugene Palette - the older of the two hairdressers in our story. His frog voice, natural supply of lines and cuddly appearance gave him a long career as a character actor who usually appears as a pleasant family man / businessman with a gruff side and heart of gold. In fact, Mr. Palette is the only member of this role who still has a significant career in movies just three years after he released this film. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the question of "where is the microphone hidden?" Microphones were still stationary and it was nice to find out where they were hiding. However, there is one well-known scene, where everyone can almost figure it out. Hawk is in his office to talk to his two henchmen - which looks as slow as they speak - to make Eddie a ride. If you watch this scene, you will swear the phone on the desk is a character in this movie. This is before and during the whole conversation. The microphone will probably be planted in the phone. <br /> <br /> There is something heroic about these pioneers who are blind in the face of new audio technology. You have silent actors accustomed to using pantomime for expression, vaudevillians who know how to play a live audience, but don't know how to make the same impression on a Vitafoon camera, and you have dialogue writers, or trying to write a conversation as compact as their title cards did or filled movies with endless conversations. <br /> <br /> Exit this one. It's not boring, fast moving and is great fun knowing what to look for. And no, I don't expect this one to ever be on Blu-Ray, but I hope the people at Warner Brothers will soon add it to the Warner archive so everyone can see it.
