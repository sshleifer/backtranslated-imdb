It was a television program that I watched as a child in the 1960s and enchanted. In the years that have passed, I often thought of this show and how good it would be to watch it again, but to think that things of the past are not always as good as you remember them. It was an excellent performance in the 1960s and has lost nothing, even now in 2007. Certainly there are some strange production errors you see when you watch old shows, and it takes a few episodes to get used to the shortened voice. After I did that, I was so enchanted when I was back in the 1960s. The Samurai is played by Koichi Ose, who plays the role in a very humble way. I remember in the 1960s, due to the popularity of the show here in Australia, he performed sword games, and was overwhelmed by the interest in the show and in him. It was wonderful that one of my favorite exhibitions still held the magic I did during my childhood. A must see series.
