(WARNING: SPOILERS!) Five young people ignore the warnings of ranger George Kennedy and walk to the foggy Oregon mountains where they pass through some large, distorted, in-breeding hillbilly twins. When only two remain, Warren and his girlfriend leave Connie back to their animal instincts to stay alive. The film ends with Connie who knocks half her arm down one of the killers' throat and kills him. A very powerful, if somewhat overstated, backwoods slasher flick thats effective use of lighting, sound and photography makes it a cut above the regular FRIDAY THE 13th cash-in. Lead by an attractive, enjoyable role, especially Deborah Benson (where is she now?) And Gregg Henry, this ninety companion to director Jeff Lieberman's SQUIRM (1976) and BLUE SUNSHINE (1977) should not be missed.
