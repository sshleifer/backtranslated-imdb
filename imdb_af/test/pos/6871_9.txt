Late one night on Tom Snyder's "Tomorrow" Show, I watched Tom ask his host Henry Morgan what he considered "perfect". Morgan replied, "Anything with Glenda Jackson." And although I wouldn't regard this movie as perfect, it does very well. I was about to use the clich√© about Hollywood, but no more like these pictures, but then I only saw 'Up in the Air', another intelligent movie about 2 people over 35 who falls in love. That's where the agreements end. "Home Calls" is just fun to watch 2 benefits like Matthau and Jackson turn it off and look completely natural when they're there. I saw this movie in the theater (18 years old) in 1978 and it took me another 20 years to get all the jokes. Any movie from the 1920s tennis match, Bill Tilden, and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain will not play too well at the megaplex today. Another thought: the original theater loss suggested a "walk on the beach / amorous" montage to the Beatles / George Harrison tune, "Something". That was a little forced at the time, but the song has since been exchanged for a rather generic Henry Mancini music call for the subsequent home video and cable release. Too bad, because that scene is right now, another victim of music licensing hell.
