If you are looking for a movie with great music, nice throws and a storyline that is not difficult to understand; FAME is for you. <br /> <br /> I have several scenes I love in this movie; Some make you laugh, others make you contemplative. The editing I think is wonderful, really fast and often funny. Shure, maybe there might be more potential in the whole thing, all the story's accommodation is somehow on the surface; maybe there are too many characters involved. But I don't mind, because the right stars are ... <br /> <br /> ... the musical scenes! One of my favorites: the hot-lunch jam order. The piece is just as raw, funky and filmed in a special way (hand-camera style in "music-hell-breaking-loose"), it's just electrifying! I miss this raw energy in today's music clips; The only similar energy I might have found in Bette Midlers "the rose," all the concert material. It's catching something "wild" that really happens, and not just perfect; take on the take. <br /> <br /> So, FAME is a wonderful nostalgic journey to when synthesizers where heavy and hikers aren't available. I recommend it once a year; certainly not for everyone.
