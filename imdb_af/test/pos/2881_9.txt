Author John Osborne's dramatization of Oscar Wilde's only novel is positive in the homosexual subtext of the original, perhaps too much. Nonetheless, the dialogue, the play, with a role played by Sir John Gielgud & Jeremy Brett, and the brilliant cerebral production (struck only by a "too quick" end) makes it worthwhile for any loved one theater, with a capital "T".
