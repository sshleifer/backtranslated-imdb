A wonderful, well-made film, featuring exceptional acting, directing, writing and photography. <br /> <br /> A newly-married person is married to life, not what she expected, and began to question her duty to herself towards her duty to society. Along with her sister-in-law, she makes radical deviations from conventional roles and mores.
