The show was wonderful and very professional. Madonna is a non-stop, dance and song for 2 hours. The opening was pretty good when she got out of the disco ball and also jumped a very good performance. The whole show was full of energy, so it's hard to tell what the highlights were, because each song had something special and unique. I saw a lively pair of her previous tours (Drowned World and reinvention tour). They were good, but you can't compare with this one. The dancers were fantastic, the lights and the whole show were just perfect. Madonna still looks very good. If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend you see it. You will enjoy the beginning of the show. Madonna is still the dance queen.
