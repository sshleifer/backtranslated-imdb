These movie rocks ... so difficult ... <br /> <br /> The cameos ... the drug references ... the part ... the love ... the ROCKING !!! When Jack and Kyle had previously met in Tim Robbins '"Actors' Gang" theater company, did he know that such a legacy would come from wonderful music and hilariousness? All that paid door-to-door rocking ... <br /> <br /> Although anyone who enjoys classic rock will get a big kick from this movie, I would definitely recommend the original 6 HBO episodes to rent your local video store. before you see the movie in the theater. They are on the Tenacious D Masterworks DVD, which is available almost every video store. There are a few in-jokes in the movie that refer to these earlier episodes that will make something more enjoyable for the overall viewing experience ...
