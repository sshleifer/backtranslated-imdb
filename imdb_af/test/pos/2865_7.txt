I didn't know much about this movie, but I realized that Kane was a wrestler, who didn't really excite me, but I kept "Santa's Slay" and it had a wrestler. So what the hell. The story started out very strange and promising, but after a while it didn't get much more than your typical teenage fright, though the institutions helped some. A lot of criminal youths are being rounded off and taken to an old hotel that was formerly a luxury palace, but is now a landfill to clean it up to prepare it as a homeless shelter. The driver is a man with a prosthetic arm, who is a veteran of the opening scene of this movie in which he meets this huge gallop who just killed his mate and blinded another woman. Of course, the teenagers, who are all punk-smart donkeys, object that they really do, but they are part of a unique collaborative program. Yes, that is a good idea of ​​course. Little suspects anyone that there is someone in the hotel who wants the hotel to pay that state's taxpayer money in its own way. Of course, it is the man who likes to collect eyeballs, and he has quite a collection. There won't be much here that horror fans haven't seen before, but there are some brutal scenes and plenty to satisfy the hard-core fan. The establishment of the old hotel also makes a perfect place for a bumper, and there are small sub-stories, such as the search for an allegedly safe full of money and the search for babes, as these co-workers alike. Most of the teenagers are also deserving, and it works well. Not great, but much better than Silent Hill, or when a stranger calls, and maybe better than the other shit I wouldn't want to see. 7 out of 10.
