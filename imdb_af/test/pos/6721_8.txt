** and 1/2 stars from **** Lifeforce is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen, so ridiculous, but then it is strangely compelling and never the least dull. Whether it's due to the incessant nudity, the huge amount of violence and action, it all comes together to make an entertaining 2-hour theater. <br /> <br /> Churchill's spacecraft has been sent to investigate Halley's Comet as they track down something hiding in the coma of the giant rock. A small team, led by Colonel Carlsen (Steve Railsback), was sent to search the area. What they discover contains hundreds of frozen bat-like creatures and three naked and seemingly unconscious humanoid creatures in strange crystalline containers, two male and one female (Mathilda May). They decide to take all three back with them, which causes a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> When London receives no crew response, another crew is sent to find out what's going on. When they dock at Churchill, they find the remains of the crew, which are all unrecognizable. The humanoids are still in perfect condition and they take them back to London. <br /> <br /> After several tests, scientists still don't know what these creatures really are. Then, late one night, a security guard in the connection felt compelled to enter the room the woman was being held. He touched her shoulder, and she woke up, stood up and smiled in a seductive and wicked way. She approaches him and starts kissing him, when it becomes clear that she is actually taking his life force and sucking on all his energy (the effect is slightly cheesy). <br /> <br /> She escapes from the compound and begins to leave a trail. Another man, Colonel Caine (Peter Firth), is brought in to find her. Then the men discover that there is a pattern for the life force process. The guard of the security guard wakes up in 2 hours, taking the life force of a doctor. It seems in every 2 hours, this process is repeated by a victim. With the help of Churchill's only survivor, Carlsen, they try to keep the girl off before it's too late. <br /> <br /> Lifetime entertainment is pretty good late in the evening. It has all the elements one can look for in such a movie, lots of nudity, blood / gore, and very special effects. It's definitely better than a similar movie, Species, thanks to a more resounding final. <br /> <br /> The performances range from decent to terrible. To go the worst is easy Steve Railsback, who switches to no end. Much better is Peter Firth, who comes through and convincingly and the beautiful Mathilda May (she is as beautiful as French actresses Sophie Marceau and Emmanuelle Seigner). May go through almost the whole role without wearing clothes, and there were reports that it was difficult to film her, so the fact that she could go through each scene without being uncomfortable and uncomfortable is impressive. There are times when she can be pretty cunning, but just seductive. Most of the movie can work because of her. <br /> <br />
