A hope of human flesh is asleep on a red pillow. It is the hunger of naked meat that is "Little Joe", a New York hustler who lives with his bisexual wife and baby child. The film follows a day in his life, after waking up from sleep by his wife and demanding that he go out and do the traditional male thing - be a breadwinner. But the use she wants to put the bread on is to pay for her new girl's abortion. We are definitely not in the traditional family unit here. <br /> <br /> After playing with his child, Joe hits the streets to travel for John. The customers come thick and fast: the ordinary gay man who wants to meet him again because they work well, the old English classical scholar who pays $ 100 to see Joe stand like an old Greek athlete. the female topless dancer who blows Joe boasts of being raped; the outdated gym that doesn't think what he and Joe do together is weird. After a hard day's work, Joe is exhausted again, just to capture his wife and girlfriend. He goes to sleep as they grind and undermine. <br /> <br /> Meat is fascinating because it has a traditional classic mainstream structure - it has an inciting incident (the money for the abortion) and setup, a confrontation and a resolution (though a very cunning one ), even a protagonist with a highly motivated goal, and then continue to focus on the details of the day-to-day routine of these people who are perfect for themselves, but extraordinarily for most "mainstream" people. It seems very authentic and natural - it's hard to see the play, the actors are so much their roles - yet the whole thing is a piece of artistic work - a beautifully drawn portrait or a complex carved image . Director Morrissey takes care of every incident, every encounter around his theme of human flesh becomes packaged commodity, but with such a cunning hand you hardly see him doing. The woman, "suits" Joe's sexual organ, the old English men, has a long rejection of classical beauty, which created art and poetry of human carnal beauty, the transvestite friends of the strip pack itself as women reading a Hollywood magazine in which "real" women are packaged as products; The gym-bunny buys Joe's friendship and love, thinks artificial pornography is actually and cannot tell, as we can't, that Joe runs his friendship and intimacy for cash. The film itself presents itself as the ne plus ultra of cinematic realism, but it can also be here with fine art or an early example of conceptual art. <br /> <br /> Morrissey's genius - a word that is not used lightly - was to find a way to make Warhol's film performances. It was interesting but boring as hell, making them salable products that are still among the most intriguing works of cinema art ever made - commercial cans labeled "Meat" and "Trash" and "Heat" with a product label - " Andy Warhol "- who sells an idea of ​​the product as much as the product itself. But just as you rely on Morrissey's cynicism, you are played by its ability to maintain the highest standards and depth of meaning. The constant flashing like camera seems to constantly focus on the cinematic nature of what one sees, but you are equally drawn into the illusion. Meat is surely one of the most extraordinary pieces of biomass to ever play an audience.
