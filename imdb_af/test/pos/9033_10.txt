I'm not a Faulkner fan (who is considered sacred, especially since I grew up near the author's hometown); However, I think this is an excellent movie. In line with the quality of the movie "To Kill a Mocking Bird". If you haven't seen it, buy it anyway. It's worth having in your permanent collection. TCM recently played the movie as part of the Race on Film series. I wish they would play it more often. Much move. <br /> <br /> On a side note, the people of Oxford, Mississippi, would also like to see the footage of the town square, as it was back in the 1940s. The court building, city hall, etc. They are all on the screen. I never knew the movie was filmed there until I noticed the familiarity of the buildings. When I saw the bow in front of the city hall, I became suspicious. Look carefully at the lashes on Chick's wall: You will see two for Ole Miss!
