Almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. Geena Davis is a teacher housewife who suffers from memory loss. She's even on the PTA! But then a car accident wakes up the woman she used to be, and it's HOT! Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as the low rent private eye trying to help Davis find her past, just to find out he's in the way over his head. Davis also has hilarious lines, and the interaction between her and Jackson works surprisingly well. <br /> <br /> Look for Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter, and David Moorse finally managing his St Elsewhere TV image. The film is directed by Davis's husband, who almost built the entire film around her, but it works. <br /> <br /> I pull out this DVD and repeat it often. I still love the make-up scene. Is Geena hot or what?
