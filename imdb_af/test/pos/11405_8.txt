All you need is a big house, a babysitter and a phone. Simon West leads this exciting and cold remake of the original 1979. This version is more of a thrill than a horror movie. Emotionally stressed with a rising fear factor. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) has to work on an excessive cellphone bill. she takes the job of the two children of dr. and mrs. mandrakis (derek de lint en katejennings grant) te babies. The house is a beautiful 1970s wood and glass masterpiece. Separate and quiet. The children are already in bed, the wind builds and is connected by rain. The phone starts calling, calling, calling. The babysitter will soon be in a beautiful way of survival in fear of the creepy stranger on the other side of the phone. <br /> <br /> Belle is wonderful as the innocent, smart and strong teenage babysitter. The voice of the stranger on the phone is that of Lance Henriksen, while the physical stranger is played by Tommy Flanagan. Also appearing: Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty. Kudos to James Dooley for the atmospheric original music.
