This movie was captured on DD while the channels were being swayed ... And thanks, even when it just started. After studying in Pune, this movie had many happy memories of the city ... wondering why more movies like This were not made. Every character is so well-etched-the grandfather, the child, the doctor ... except for the social worker who moves a little, the rest of the movie hardly has a mistake ... a deserving entry for the Oscars, even if it is not nominated ... definitely a lump in the throat ... who do you need to tickle your lacrimals? And to think that this movie Sachin Tendulkar needs to spread it. In spite of being in Marathi, there was hardly a moment where I couldn't follow the movie ... the captions were good. A must watch any fan of good theater.
