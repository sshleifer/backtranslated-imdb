The movie, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is made brilliant. It starts with a family of three, a doctor (James Stewart), his wife (Doris Day) - who is a former stage singer, and their young son - my guess is about 10 years old, who for free time by Morroco travel. On the bus the French agent bumps, and they are a little too nice to him. He was killed on the market after finding the information he was looking for. He wants to convey this information to someone, so he goes to the only person he even knows, James Stewart. The antagonists kidnap their young boy and say if he tells something about what the agent told him, his son will be murdered. Stewart has to travel to London because that is where his son is, and where the assassination the agent told him would be. The movie is very exciting. There are many twists and turns (typical Hitchcock movie). Also, it has just the right amount of comic lighting. In addition to all this, it won an Oscar for Doris Day's performance of "Que Sara, Sara." This movie is very good. It's hard to find a problem about it. I would definitely recommend it to all Hitchcock fans and all teams. I give this movie an "A" just because it's a little predictable.
