Great movie about a good man. Thomas Kretschmann is the first time in all his other films. I would never have proposed him as Pope John Paul. It speaks volumes to the casting director. Why do they hold him as German official in the movies? And he first came to the "pianist" for universal attention? Of course he looks so hot in the uniforms. I know many girls roll over his pretty face. But this man is a good actor and has such a great potential. If you don't believe me, check out "Stalingrad". I hope he will have many excellent roles with more diversity in the future. Otherwise, a heartbreaking waste of great talent.
