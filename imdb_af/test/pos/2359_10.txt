It looks like b grade and you probably think there's no reason to rent this movie! But do it! I didn't expect anything from this movie, just to pass the time, but I was hooked from the start! Two Interesting Premises - A bank robbery went wrong, missing a million dollars and two girls on the road to starting a new life. How will these two stories clash? Just when you think you know which direction the movie is heading, it does a 180 and you are blown away by the big twists in the plot! It has a good but unexpected end, and you want to be more - always a good sign - rent it or even buy it, you won't be disappointed!
