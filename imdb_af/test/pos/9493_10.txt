I just watched a few episodes of this series on very poor VHS tapes that I recorded the series. I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> Ramona is based on children's books by Beverly Cleary and follows the adventures of the eight-year-old title (Sarah Polley). She has fun with friends and family and gets in trouble like the eight-year-olds. All ten episodes are pretty good. "Mystery Meal" kind of like a vegan, but it's funny to see that parents are trying to get their kids to eat cow's tongue! And any episode that Godzilla Versus The Smog Monster twice calls cannot be bad. I like more of "Ramona's Bad Day". Although it is mysterious to see Ramona through a rough day, she sets herself in the revenge of her friend Howie's uncle (a pre-Psi Factor Barclay Hope) who always plagues her. The perfect day is also good. <br /> <br /> Lori Chodos plays Beezus, Ramona's sister. I swear I saw her on something else, but IMDb didn't list anything except this show. Unfortunately, this series is not on DVD. Why is every crappy show made on DVD today except something I really want to buy? An injustice if ever there was one!
