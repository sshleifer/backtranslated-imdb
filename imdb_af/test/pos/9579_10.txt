How often do you see a movie of any kind containing a talent program with refreshments? Waldo's Last Tribune is a refreshment. Here Waldo sells lemonade, but doesn't make money. Alfalfa, Spanky, Darla, Mickey, and Buckwheat come to him ironic, for in both men in a bath and The Brawn where there was competition between Alfalfa and Waldo for Darla's love. Back to the story: The Gang tastes the lemonade to see if Waldo has made it right. One funny moment is when Alfalfa gets a glass beaker for lemon and Waldo fillings and gives it to Darla and Alfalfa has an angry expression on his face. Spanky suggests a floor show to go with the lemonade and even Mickey agrees so cute. When the flooring program starts, there is no one at the barn, but then a client comes in (Froggy). Spanky asks him if he wants orange, but all he does is nod nod. Spanky asks him time shortly and every time Froggy nods, Spanky gives many expressions on his face that is funny. Spanky tries many ways to thirst. One way is when Mickey said so well: "The cookies are salt and they made me thirsty." There is also a lot of entertainment musical bit it is short. The opening number is by Darla she is dancing and singing. The second includes Alfalfa singing key (as usual) with Mickey, Leonard, Spanky, and Bokwiet about "How dry I am!" (I believe they sing it to make Froggy thirsty. It also made me laugh.) The closing number includes boys and girls all dressed in an old fashion. It was Waldo's last Our Gang card. A great musical short that is a pure 10 out of 10.
