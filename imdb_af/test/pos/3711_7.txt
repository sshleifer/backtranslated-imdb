This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to the village of Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one of about 18 and one about 8, seek bird eggs (of course, large ones). collectors item for boys in South Africa around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and older brother Pete decide to enter. He gives his prize-giving to his little brother, Willie, and heads off to give more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte. Well, Willie has nothing of it, if Pete can be a soldier, he can. He heads to Memphis, with his stubbornness and determination, as he gets the better of several adults on the road. After finding the entry center in Memphis, he demanded to see his brother, put a knife on a lieutenant, and injure him in the process. We are the dedication and love of a little brother (Jonathan Furr). He delivered an impeccable performance as a stubborn strong-willed boy in the softer times of last year. The movie mostly tries and manages to show how brothers can show their commitment and the importance of family ties in their youth. As the two brothers gather again, the movie produces a cathartic cry because the brotherly love embraces us all. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a cold bottle of water. Maybe Dasani or Aquafina, good, clear water with a nice mineral package, but not pure natural spring water like Evian. Yet, it is thirsty and you have no doubt about the purity and extinction effects. It is more run of the mill and cheaper than some, but gets the job done and later refreshed and detoxified. 10/07
