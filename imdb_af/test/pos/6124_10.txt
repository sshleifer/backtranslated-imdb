You know the word "Curiosity has killed the cat"? Well, I've heard so much about this movie, from a magazine that calls this one of the most shocking movies of all time, my 1001 movies you should see before you die, my sister who saw it at a movie festival and the I love the 70's on VH1. I just had to watch this movie as it is called the biggest movie of all time. And after watching this movie last night, I have to say that it really worked on his title. My God, this movie was so strange! I thought I really saw it with some of the sickest movies and TV shows I saw. Some things I think will always feel like a shock. <br /> <br /> Well, Babs Johnson, also a divine, is called the dirtiest person in life and competes for a jealous couple named Marbles for that title. They want to take Divine and are called the filthiest couple alive by kidnapping women, raping them, fertilizing them and selling their babies to lesbian couples. But it seems divine and her family of good ... I don't know, the title seems to stay by having sex with chickens, lips that synchronize, eating dog feces, meat up to their skirts, incest, and it just gets greener and greener. <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos acted horribly, terribly, and indeed, terribly. The reason for the 10 rating I'm going to give is because of the fact, well, how can you rate this movie? I always rate, so I just determined the heel? By the coarseness of this movie, you need to give John Waters some credit, who would think of this movie 35 years later? For the actors who worked on this movie, your guys are just dirty! <br /> <br /> 10/10
