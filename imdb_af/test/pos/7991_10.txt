I really remember BATMAN RETURNS, when it came out in 1992, but now I think it's the best of all the Batman movies (even about Christopher Nolan's tremendous 2005 BATMAN START and definitely over the seriously overheated 2008 THE DARK KNIGHT!) . I originally remembered that the 1st Batman with Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still love it). But I think this movie really touches the nail. The 4 main characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman, and Max Shreck) are all alive and unforgettable. You really get to see what Batman / Bruce Wayne is all about in Keaton's tremendous characterization. Keaton is the best Batman, not Kilmer, Clooney, or even the upcoming Bale, who was exceptional in BB and could have stolen Keaton stolen honors. His character is not destroyed by Nolan's hack movie-making in TDK! <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito as the penguin is upsetting, anything, hilarious and deadly. DeVito is big and doesn't have to chill out to give good performance like Nicholson's Joker. The viewer can actually sympathize with these deceptive outcasts and his fate to fit into normal society. I've never really been a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer to this movie, but it's definitely my favorite show of her. Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle is goofy and strange at first, when she's been transformed into Catwoman, she is simultaneously sexy and scary, a total deadly sex potty! I also feel that Keaton and Pfeiffer have more chemistry than Keaton and Basinger of Batman; they form a tragic love story. And Christopher Walken as Shreck is, as always, Christopher Walken! <br /> <br /> BATMAN RETURNS, more than BATMAN, is more confident and focused. This is assured from the beginning of the movie. The way Burton introduces the penguin's heartbreaking backdrop understands you from the beginning. The first 5 minutes are under my favorite start with any movie: Danny Elfman's music sets an ominous scene that defines the rest of the movie. This is a change from the original BATMAN and a wonderful one! <br /> <br /> Then forward 33 years to Gotham today and we are introduced to powerful businessman Shreck who wants to build a new power station in Gotham. At the same scene, we meet Shreck's gentle, rude, untrustworthy secretary, Selina Kyle. And not long, it's the exciting action series of the movie, as Batman has to fight the Penguin's Red Triangle Gang, a fun and deadly group of outcasts and circus artists. Penguin plans to attack the Gotham Christmas, kidnap Shreck in chaos and force him to help him set him back in society. Meanwhile, Selina discovers Shreck's criminal plans and so he kills her by chasing her out of his high office, then she is revived by cats. <br /> <br /> Sound winding? Yes, but Burton never claimed to be a realistic story. He created a world where the viewer can assume that things can happen like this, a dark, noirish world made up of abused, deformed outcasts, who just want to accept and embrace the world. Trust Telling If You Ask Me <br /> <br /> The action scenes are few and far in, but they are all exciting, entertaining and nail biting. They're not there just for the show, as some are in Batman. And they all make sense. The climate scene with Penguin's "army" in the center of Gotham with Batman zoning in the penguin's hideout and sidekick butler Alfred (Michael Gough in a welcome return from the original!) Arrives, helps Batman to be short and sturdy ! br /> <br /> I also love the Christian era, the winter environment, which adds to the super-dark, cold feel of Burton's Batman world. I also like the way Burton slowly introduces the Batman "toy" to us without kicking them. Every "toy" is suitable for the film at that moment and we are obliged to accept it for their purpose. And although dark, RETURNS is another funny movie. DeVito's penguin has lots of funny lines. So do Walken's Shreck. The Batman-Catwoman exchanges are also very stimulating and humorous! A great ensemble! All in all, BATMAN RETURNS is a tightly woven story of the dark forces playing in Tim Burton's fun book world.
