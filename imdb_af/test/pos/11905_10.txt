I love this movie and I recommend it to anyone. Damian Chapa and Jennifer Tilly played their roles perfectly. Just the characters alone draw you to the movie. The directing was also wonderful. The most creative shots I've ever seen. I was stuck on the screen throughout the movie, not one scene was slow. The movie also has many action-packed scenes, cars, etc. The movie is just a whole masterpiece. If you like really entertaining movies, watch it because you'll be on the edge of your seat all the time. I put this movie on my top ten all-time list, because there is never a dull moment in the movie, and it's my type of movie.2 inches on, totally up !!!!!!!!!
