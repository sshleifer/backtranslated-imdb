I saw the movie tonight (November 5, 2005) for the first time. I wanted to see it because I saw the basketball diaries (Leonardo Di Caprio) and loved it, but it was much heavier. I think it resulted in a good portrayal of drugs. I mostly empathize with Nick Stahl's character, probably because if I was someone I was crazy about, I wanted to help them get it. A promising student and athlete who spends all his time studying and studying. Well, it's understandable that he wants to try the teen life (the crazy side of it) and in his efforts as he starts, he helps his friend, he becomes addicted because he eventually becomes addicted. wanted to see what it was all about and because of his terrible family situation which resulted in his most tragic death. A real sad movie, but one mistake I've noticed is that you don't get enough insight into the damage that it brings to families, but great achievements on a truly heartbreaking movie.
