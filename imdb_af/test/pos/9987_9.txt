THE BIGGEST GAME EVERYONE PLAYED (TGGEP, 2005) is an amazingly uplifting, infectious, inaudible film that never really goes into juiciness or heaviness. Yes, it requires several freedoms, as most Hollywood movies do, but those freedoms are forgiven, as they actually add to the movie's enjoyment, not detract from it. In fact, there are many truthful moments in it. You can really tell that this is a "rocky" movie from the beginning of the movie, but who cares? Targeted by none other than Bill Paxton (I do not know, right?!), It has been expertly done and extremely viewable! <br /> <br /> TGGEP tells the story of Francis Ouimet (played with confidence, haste and class by superstar-to-be Shia LaBeouf), an amateur golfer of an Irish-French immigrant family living in Brookline, MA, in the early 1900s. Ouimet qualifies to play US Open in the 1913. Included in his competition is the legendary Harry Vardon (played with tremendous class, dignity and anger by Stephen Dillane). Ironically, Vardon is the 2nd in this movie! The film starts in Scotland in 1870, where land developers tell the youngster that they are building a golf course on his home and that golf is a game that is not like someone like him. Francis undergoes the same bias as a boy in the early 1900s Brookline. The stories come at the 1913 meeting. <br /> <br /> What is ironic is that Vardon, like an adult and multiple chief champion, still disappears in British society because of his education. Francis learned a lot from golf to read Vardon's books on the subject and Vardon is his idol who is growing up. Unknown to Vardon, they actually met in Boston in 1900 after Vardon, who won the year's Open, tour when Francis was only 7. <br /> <br /> In addition to Francis and Vardon, contestants in the 1913 Open included Vardon's friend and champion Brit Ted Ray (captivating Stephen Marcus) and the classless, breast-defending twice-defending champion John McDermott (Michael Weaver) . The movie is really a good job of showing the different personalities of these men. <br /> <br /> Redhead Marnie McPhail is indigiatingly serene and beautiful as Francis's supporting Irish mom and veteran Elias Koteas gives a strict, reserved, taciturn show. as his French father. In addition, the young Josh Flitter (like Francis's 10-year-old Caddy Eddie) steals the almost single handed proceedings. <br /> <br /> Paxton throws many modern details, such as special effects, zoom-in shots to show players' scorecard position and CGI for many of the golf shots to keep the movie exciting and fast so that the film is not made too much of a period piece. But the film still convinces us of a specific time and place. <br /> <br /> What's interesting is that, while Rocky likes, it's all based on a real story! So the end is satisfactory on so many levels. An entertaining movie about golf in the early 1900's. Wow!
