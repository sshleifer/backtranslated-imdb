Very nice love story between Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina. The whole story is very bizarre and funny. An entrepreneur (A. Molina) loves a married woman (B.Blethyn). They are trying to lapse her death to escape her husband and town. A scenario of strange situations begins. As good as savings banks and long-lived shelter.
