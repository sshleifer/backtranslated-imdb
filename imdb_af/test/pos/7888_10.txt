After seeing recently, Cry Uncle, by the same director, decided to search it out and am glad I did! It's an exceptionally good movie. Far, much better than it probably looks like the ingredients. How many times have we had the embarrassment of a middle-class player? Dad mix it with the flower children aagh! And yet here, thanks to a perfect writing, it is made credible. Not ideal, not good or bad, but credible. Peter Boyle, such as the working class, hippie and ni ** hater and Dennis Patrick as the kickback, play their respective parts immaculately and I can't remember ever seeing the two classes get together without getting sentimental. Susan Sarandon is effective as a hippie chick but doesn't have much to do in her first movie. This is a truth, the film must capture, as it is very short in Western and especially American times when the counter-culture is about to break open wide.
