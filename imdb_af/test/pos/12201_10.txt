I've seen one season all over and can say I've not enjoyed a show of this standard long ago, it's great to see such a show in the pipeline and hope there is a lot in the way the season finals best bar no one can wait for season 2 as far as i am doing things can just be better as how milles will change constantly will rick get his family back and how will they get off the church with the action of this level it is easy to see why the show is such a big hit with people, as long as people who show such programs will keep watching. I think it's hard to get an original idea now, as so many shows cover a wide variety of subjects. one as original as it is refreshing
