Based on the book "Space Vampires" by Colin Wilson. It is (in my humble opinion) one of the best pieces of Sci-Fi Horror to come out of the eighties. The effects (done by ILM) still adhere to today's standards. The actors are mostly British and it is British to give this film a greater depth of realism. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed by the critics and unfortunately did not perform well at the cash register on either side of the Atlantic. . Tobe Hooper blames the promotional work done before his release as the main cause of his low rates. But for whatever reason, it's still not detracting from the fact that it is an excellent movie with a good movie. <br /> <br /> Not to be overlooked.
