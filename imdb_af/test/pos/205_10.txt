I just want to tell you a few things before you consider seeing this movie. If at some point you thought you saw good camera work, be prepared to be amazed at this movie. For the record, this film was made in Russia in 1957, but the technique used here is probably something we saw later in the western world ... about 20 years later. The level of emotion through the film varies a lot: happiness-cross-war despair joy, but ultimately you stay with something unique: the joy of seeing one masterpiece of movies. The young directors from our time should study this kind of movie more and maybe they can create something similar. Although I think movies like this are very hard to come by ... If you have seen, "I am Cuba" then this movie will be very attractive, but if not, be prepared for a unique experience. The Russian directors had something in common: very small budgets, great actors and a joy to create art ... and yes, they can create more masterpieces than all the Western world together. I am not a big fan of Russia, actually I hate everything that is communist, but the film made in that part of the world manages such feelings that are difficult to describe. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it. </ br /> <br />
