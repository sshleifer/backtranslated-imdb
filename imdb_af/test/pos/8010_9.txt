"STEP FOR STEP," is my opinion, is a pure ABC hit! I can't remember every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to tell what episode my favorite was. However, I think it was always funny when an accident happened at the school. I always laugh about it. In fact, I think just about every one of J.T. (Brandon Call) and Cody's (Sasha Mitchell) lines were funny. It would have been nice if Penny (Patrika Darbo) stayed on the show throughout the race. Everyone has always produced a good performance, the productions design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope it will never stop in syndication.
