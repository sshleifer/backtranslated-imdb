I did much of the older doctor, who enjoyed many years ago, so when the new one came out, I just had to investigate it. I was so happy - with the characters, the story lines, the updated look, I got trapped! From Season 1 (27 for the old fans) to season 2 (28), it just keeps getting better. It also fits nicely with the old shows, although you don't have to know the old shows to enjoy this newer version. <br /> <br /> Although there is a change of cast, I strongly recommended Doctor Who - with Chris Eccleston AND with David Tennant. <br /> <br /> I like that they gave the characters so much depth. The doctor looks more vulnerable in this series, perhaps because he is the last TimeLord. The variety of emotions Chris and David show is truly remarkable, and I felt their pain, anger and sense of adventure with them. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper (Rose) brings a very human element to every episode, though she is much stronger than I would be. With her talent, Billie will go far into the industry.
