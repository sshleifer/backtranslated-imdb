First of all I must say that I am a great Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento fan. Although I didn't see all their movies absolutely, I really enjoyed everybody I saw. I really like Giallos and I thought Argento was the master of this genre after watching movies like "Tenebre" and "Phenomena". But after seeing Fulci at New York Ripper, I found out that he could do pretty good giallos and even redo Argento at some level, apart from his graphic zombie movies. <br /> <br /> I love Fulci's style, and yes, I love Gore, but this movie I think, although it has a more developed plot and characters than its other movies, is not she best not. What I don't like is that it can sometimes be confusing, especially at the end. And the fact that we go from one suspect to another and then another until we suspect the suspected girl for a moment, I think it goes too far. I know Giallos has to guess you to the end, and the killer must be very hard to find, but this movie plays a little too much with our minds. However, as the scene looked like the witch was killed, I think it's done very well and gave me the chills. The play is also pretty good and photography is good. Although it's not a bad movie, I think Lucio Fulci has made better movies than that and I think his best one is "The Beyond", a very different film but a more atmospheric and visual experience. <br /> <br /> I don't give a duckling a duckling to a duckling. <br /> <br />
