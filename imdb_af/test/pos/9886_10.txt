I saw the premier of this movie during the Phoenix Film Festival of 2005 and was very impressed with the skills director, Jeff Hare, who was exhibited to bring this timely topic to the screen. The character movie has perfectly spoken and allowed us to investigate the issue of a senior who wants to die on his own terms in a very warm and humorous way. Peter Falk was brilliant as Morris and the supporting group of family and friends were perfectly cast in their roles. The interaction of family, friends and outsiders with Morris has created a realistic image of how families age the issue of their parents and their wishes with dignity. <br /> <br /> Although this movie seems to be a movie about a Jewish actor and his family, it's really a movie about all families. The jokes the family and Morris crack during this life of a "Force of Nature" are fresh and realistic. Childhood rivalry, adult successes and failures, and hope for the children is an integral part of this script. While many will ask you to "humorously" make the subject of suicide, I thought the treatment was logical and timely. If you're not afraid of tears or laughter on the stumps of a family struggling with this problem, you should see this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is the best picture awarded at the Phoenix Film. festival.
