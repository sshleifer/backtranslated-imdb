Another great musical from Hollywood's Golden Age! I love this movie story about a threesome of friends performing at a small nightclub far from Broadway and all its glory. Although it is not the big time, they are very happy with their lives and the small group where they act. Gene Kelly is the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of his dancers, Rita Hayworth, who is receiving attention as she gets the opportunity to be on a magazine. Trouble starts for Gene Kelly, as his girlfriend is talking about the town. Phil Silvers plays one of the three friends and does a good job. Of course there is music and dancing. One dance performance by Gene Kelly stands out. He walks alone in the street at night and sees his reflection in a shop window. His reflection soon begins with him in the streets, great cinematography. Don't miss this one, wonderful entertainment.
