Zachary Scott does what he does best, ie plays a worm, in "Danger Signal", a 1945 B movie that also starred Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman and Rosemary DeCamp. Scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money. On the lamb of his last murder he rented a room in the house of the Fenchurch family, Hilda (Emerson) and her mother (Mary Servoss). Scott throws himself at Emerson, and she's blinded. Middle Romance, her younger sister Anne (Freeman) comes home from a medical treatment. When she mentioned that she was Uncle Wade's favorite and he left her $ 25,000 (big money according to 1945 standards), Scott lost interest in poor Hilda and made a play for Anne. Anne looks like Rebecca from Sunnybrook Farm until she starts sneaking with Scott - overnight, she is 10 years old and gets really nasty to her sister. Eventually, the message that her tenant is not good, Hilda said in a psychiatrist (Rosemary DeCamp) to psyche and advise her. <br /> <br /> Psychological dramas were all the rage during and after World War II. Scott does an excellent job as a smooth sociopath. It was his forte - as a poorly-desired sheriff in "Flamingo Road" he did not exhibit a true presence. Regarding two-timing, we saw him in Mildred Pierce, where he proved very good. Emerson is a book-like stenographer with her hair printed from her face and her big glasses printed, but after hours she is beautiful and gives it a strong performance. DeCamp was always an underrated actress - here she plays a soft German accent and is lovely. <br /> <br /> It's a highly entertaining movie, but a very routine story. The acting really elevates it.
