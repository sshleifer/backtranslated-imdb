The movie eXistenZ is about a futuristic video game on a "pod" system that is almost like virtual reality. The only copy of the video game is damaged when a murder attempt on the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is made. Unless it can be repaired, the many years and 38 million dollars will spend on development. However, the only way to restore the game is in the game with the only person she feels she can trust (Jude Law). This movie was pretty good, but didn't really get into the movie until late. The best thing about this movie was the turn to the end. Definitely worth seeing. 10/07
