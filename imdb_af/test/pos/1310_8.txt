I have never heard of Mishima before I watched this movie and although parts of it are a bit boring, I still find it worth seeing when it is repeated on the box. At the beginning of the film we are told that a celebrated Japanese writer acts like a madman and commits seppuku in public. As the film progresses, you are gently used to the twisted logic of Mishima's mind. The stages of his life are presented in four chapters. Each chapter itself is a blend of two contrasting stories, the first continuing with the scene from Mishima's life and appearing in black and white. The second story is an adaptation of scenes from a novel and it is recorded as a play and filmed in bright colors. There is another novel in each chapter. Between each chapter comes the narrative back to the present, as Mishima goes to his ultimate ritual suicide. This means that drama and tension are maintained until the end. <br /> <br /> I suspect many people will find this movie boring fun. I respect it, it's not a movie for people who want action and a strong story line. On the other hand, if you are the kind of person who gives the opportunity to get a bizarre person in mind while watching his life story in collage of beautiful photos set by Philip Glass on music, you will love it . I loved it. <br /> <br />
