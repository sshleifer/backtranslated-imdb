I first saw Robin Hood: Men in Tights back in 1994 in the theater. I went to see it because I always liked Robin Hood and I saw the fan of this movie and thought it was hilarious. After I saw the movie, I must say it was even better than I thought. Not only is it very funny, it is also a very well made movie with beautiful sets and costumes and a very beautiful score by Hummie Mann. The movie is also good, Cary Elwes is funny like Robin Hood and also Tracey Ullman, Richard Lewis, Mark Blankfield, David Chapelle, Amy Yasbeck, Megan Cavanagh, Eric Allan Kramer, Matthew Porretta and Mel Brooks. But the best part in the movie is played by Roger Rees as the evil sheriff of Rottingham. He has the best plays in the movie and also the best dialogue ("King illegal forest to kill a wild blow", which stands for "It is illegal to kill a wild pig in the king's forest") ). He somehow mixes up All the words and expresses a meaning that nobody understands. Robin Hood: Men in Tights are in my book one of the best Mel Brooks movies to date and I can't say I laughed so much about a movie like that. It's just to stop laughing.
