In 1242, Russia was invaded by two sides: from the east of the Mongols and from Europe, by the Germanic Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. The city of Novgorod is the last free city in Russia. The population, to organize the defense of Novgorod and the countries of Russia, calls Prince Alexander Nevsky, who defeated the Swedish in a previous battle. His successful strategy defeats the Germans after a huge battle on a frozen lake. This film was made in 1938 because of the threat of the German in Russia, in a pre-Second World War. The idea was to make propaganda pro-Russia. However, it is an overwhelming, wonderful, wonderful powerful masterpiece. It is incredibly the battle scene on the frozen lake. The current generation is very used to special effects, as in the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, and may not understand how fantastic this black and white battle is. If the viewer can forget the ideology and see it as art, then he will surely be surprised with such a masterpiece. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Alexander Nevsky
