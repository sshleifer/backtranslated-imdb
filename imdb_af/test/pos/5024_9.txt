A result, but very good performance by John Travolta, puts this very funny comedy off. His interpretation of the archangel is like a rogue, female, overweight, lady man. And he definitely has a fascinating effect on the women he meets on his trip to Chicago. John Hurt is very low in his role as Chief Reporter for Chicago Tabloid, Bob Hoskins. Angie MacDowell plays a great role as she did her role in "Four Weddings and a Funeral". Maureen Stapleton is neat in a cameo. Her commentary, "Michael doesn't fool," is just one of the many memorable moments. Bob Hoskins is the only one of the leading artists who fails to couple, a little off the wall. Mainly you are there to see Michael take a bull, relieve the waitresses and lady dancers at a western style restaurant and fully demonstrate that he is a complete free soul. It's a memorable comedy that's worth more than one show.
