This film is all about it: Fully developed characters, a realistic depiction of Washington's work, bathed in warmth and humor that is unique to Albert Brooks. The dumbing of network news is now more of a problem than it was in 1987. Remember, it was pre-cable! So satisfying to take care of complex people who are trying to achieve complex goals - and they all move with lightning speed. Such a real life show of friendships looking for romance. See if you can see John Cusack as the evil messenger! And do you recognize Peter Hackes from Real Broadcast News? Lastly, if you are from DC, see if you agree with Holly Hunter's directions to taxi drivers!
