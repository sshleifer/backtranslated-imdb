After I watched this movie, I had no choice but to write a review in the hope that there are others like me out there who were fired by the rocket fired by the rocket and white, hot sexual titulation that ninja III is: The domination. /> We all know Sho Kosugi rocks. It's a given, but what about Jordan Bennett's ultra-macho interpretation of his character officer "Billy Secord"? Bravo Mr. Bennett, bravo. You prove early, while trying to trick the buxom Christie (played to perfection by one Miss Lucinda Dickey or Breakin 'boast) that you're not afraid to take chances on your vessel. I especially enjoyed how you didn't feel like intervening and trying to help her when 4 thugs try to rape her outside her gym. Oh, you could have helped, but by standing there and watching, let her know who the boss was. Secord will wear the pants in this relationship. I also enjoyed how Mr. Bennett was not afraid to repeatedly take off his shirt or carry the women's hanger tank, despite his gorilla like shoulders and back. Back and shoulders are warm and Secord knows it. And how about Lucinda Dickey? All I can say is "KABOOM" - I see a sex bomb ready to explode. She has moved all the rights as a requester and a martial artist. The chemistry behind Dickey and Bennett is what makes this movie. You'd think she'd hate him because he's kind of a cheesy jerk, but not my friends. Animal magnetism is too strong to resist, and they bind as slapped. Sho Kasugi is not as prominent as you might think, although it is still a main character, which is good to me because all I wanted was more Bennett and Dickey. He looked like he was wearing many eye-catching things that were nice to see. The special effects? Wow. That's all I can say. I won't end, but let's just say it won't disappoint. I love Ninja III: The domination, and can only hope there is a Ninja 4. I give it a 5 out of 5 throwing stars. do not disappoint.
