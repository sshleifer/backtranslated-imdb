I saw Director's Cut version and can't be anything but content. Excellent acting (especially Cole Hauser, I was sad about small space for Claudia Black though), subtle visual effects and photography in overall, credible plot (genre consideration) without many logical holes, really unpredictable twists, up characters. These are the biggest assets of the movie. Combined with style - some may consider this movie as a B-degree, but I won't agree. The whole thing is really very original and stylish. <br /> <br /> And although I'm not a fan of Vin Diesel, this difficult old role of Riddick suited him well. Can't wait for Riddick's Chronicles, it's really cool, this movie is going to have a sequel ... <br /> <br /> 9/10 if you ask me
