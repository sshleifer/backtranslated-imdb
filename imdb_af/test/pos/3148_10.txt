I saw a reader at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films did. In ten or so minutes, it tells a gripping two-card story that resonates deeply with me. Duncan Rogers did an excellent job of capturing many real, fun moments on film. What I really admire about this movie is that the director chose a story that is suitable for the short format. These are really interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect time. It's not a small thing. Have we not all seen shorts, are there only longer stories that are cut to fit the format, or stage stories that are not properly adjusted on the screen? I rejoice "The Reader" to do it right, and I encourage someone who is interested in film and storytelling to look at it seriously. Worth every moment!
