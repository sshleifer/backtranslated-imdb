I returned this interesting movie with the Chinese / French film "2046" at the recent Dubai Film Festival. Both are intelligent works that were made the same year (2004/2005). Both lived the main characters in a "hotel". In both films, the hotel is more a metaphor of exile than a place. Both dealt with love between a man and a woman. Both had great music and sounding performances. What a coincidence and how the two movies differ in the treatment of the subject! Somewhere at the beginning of the film, a man turns on a pavement to look at a woman and raises a lamppos. The audience breaks innocently into a volcano of laughter. But is it not so short shot the synopsis of the movie, which entertain you for 2 hours? While the movie is a wonderful combination of black comedy (eg using a stethoscope to listen to the neighbors' conversation), the film builds on what Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati had previously introduced. the equally intelligent world of Robin Williams or the heartwarming Danny Kaye. A sudden madness of activity is changing a different Stoic character as the money of the hotel moves to the bank, and reminds of Tati's works. <br /> <br /> But the movie is not just comedy. The anti-automation statement (cash count and the response of the banking staff on the related statements, the dummy serving as an ineffective warning to the speed lady, refers to the reference to Moulimix as the fictitious "company" to which he works. .) are several directions that the director is offering a loaded comedy to the viewer. Download, yes, but reflect on and enjoy. <br /> <br /> The film's strength lies in a short, staccato script (by director Paul Sorrentino) containing comedy mixed with philosophy ("Truth is boring," Dad is dead, but no one has "Accident does not exist - it is inventing the losers and the poor." Then the director gives you a fascinating lecture from the main character to Sorrentino entertaining the topic that the Italians know best - The Mafia - This is an existential mafia movie. <br /> <br /> Since then, Sorrentino "" Truth is boring ", the director gives a dessert as part of the fine gauge of wonderful acting (Toni Servillo), good music, clever camera work (Luca Bigazzi), a beautiful, enigmatic actress (Magnani, big daughter of the great Anna) and powerful manuscript.The appraiser is for the viewer to determine if the previous film in the film was the truth. It would have been boring, I f it was, wouldn't it?
