The beloved Rogue is a wonderful time. It portrays 145-century Paris in great Hollywood fashion, but offers a paler side to exist there as perceived by the poor. And the snow. It constantly turns over and adds to the seriousness of the environment - brilliant!

Louis XI to perfection. And yes, Veidt deliberately hits his nose and prints his performance on wonderful borders.
