Finding this piece confronted by an old prequel and a rehashed 80-year-old macho movie on a UPN-affiliated afternoon's Saturday program will be misleading. It deserves better and definitely uses its talented leaders' best features to its maximum advantage. Bracco and Walken team to give a film that, while possibly predictable to those who are familiar with their genre, does the street-oriented, "troubled thoughts" routine that portrays them so well. For a chance to ride a psychic hitch, a la Fuqua's "Training Day" goes back into the world of early 90's TV movies to find "Scam"!
