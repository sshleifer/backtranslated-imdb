This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. A 14-year-old boy, Jason Shepherd, wrote an English newspaper entitled "Big Fat Liar". When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to college in time and he hit a limo. When he entered the limo, he met a well-known Hollywood producer, Marty Wolf. When he left the limo, he forgot one thing: his paper! So Marty Wolf took it and he changed Jason's English newspaper into a movie! When Jason admitted that he left his newspaper in the limo and Marty took it, his parents and his English teacher didn't believe him! So Jason and his friend Kaylee had to fly to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood to let Marty steal his story to Jason's parents. When Jason told Marty to name his father that Marty had stolen that paper, Marty criticized him and burned his paper! Jason got so angry that Marty burned that paper so Marty called security to get Jason out of his yard! Jason and Kaylee realize Marty will not admit the truth. Taking Marty in Phase 2: The Takedown, Jason and Kaylee put permanent blue dye in the pool and when Marty enters, his body gets blue and it won't come down! Then they put permanent orange dye in Marty's shampoo and when he uses it, his hair is all orange and it won't come down either! Eventually they put a lot of glue on Marty's ear piece to have Jason's father call and when Marty uses it, bump it to his ear! It was funny if Marty's hair and body were all blue and orange and his head was glued to his ear! Then they defrauded Marty by telling Monty, who was Marty's assistant, that Duncan was moving to a house where there was a party. When Marty entered Duncan, he was at the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him! When Marty was in the house, Jason and Kaylee turned on the controls of his car. When Marty drove his car, he knew all the controls were switched and he didn't know which button to press. He's stupid enough to fall for it. When Marty hit the back of the mask, the mask ruined his car! It was so funny. So Marty starts calling Jason's dad and deceiving him again! He was on the phone, but it wasn't his father, he called safety! After the security Jason and Kaylee got from Marty's website, they suggested they go home. Monty goes on Jason and Kaylee's side because she knew Marty was a liar and a while, so she told Rocco, who is one of the security guards to look after the children. Jason told his father the truth about what he had been doing for the past two days and got his parents to L.A. When Monty comes to the kids, she will help move the children in Phase 4: The Payback. Jason divides the team into 3 teams for Stage 4. One team will win Marty's tricks and tricks until Jason's parents arrive. Marty first drove with Frank Jackson, but his car broke down, so he drove with Jaleel, but he brought him into the desert and left him there. When Marty was in the desert, a helicopter came to rescue him. Then one of the blades was jammed so Marty and the helicopter pilot came down. Then he was on his way to the set. When Jason saw him, Marty stopped and saw what Jason had: his monkey! So Marty went to Jason and Kaylee and when they saw Lester, he let go of the water and when the water came, Marty pushed away. Marty was still after the kids and when Kaylee went the other way, Jason Marty brought to the top of the apartment. In addition, Jason challenged Marty by acknowledging the truth and Marty would never tell the truth. When the crew was surprised Marty, all the people, including Jason's parents who were at the set, knew what Marty had done. Marty is going to kill Jason, but the only way Jason escapes is to jump from above! Then his parents believed that Marty had taken his story. When the people on the set were the end of Marty. In the end, Jason's story, Big Fat Liar, was a movie. I can't get enough of it.
