I noticed people were asking if anyone had this show. I have had 26 episodes broadcast in the US and will be willing to share it with anyone interested. All I need is to provide the VHS tapes or blank DVDs. I have them on both formats and pay for shipping. My email is creator67@pipinternet.net, send me an email and request and I will notify you and we can make the arrangements. The quality is very good and they are very pleasant to watch especially if you couldn't see it, as they were broadcast in the 60's. It was one of my favorite programs like a child and has a very special place in my heart because it brings back many memories of my childhood, as well as other programs like Ultraman and Astroboy. <br /> <br /> Peter
