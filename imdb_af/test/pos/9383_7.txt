I can honestly say that "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" was a much better movie than I expected. Allow me to explain the plot if the title of the movie is a bit too vague - there is a bed that eats. An evil bed. It eats people. Several unsuspecting women on an "outing" of some kind stumble over the sinister "bag" and eventually fall prey to hunger. The bed's swallowing process consists of a yellow foam that enters people inside ... stomach acid; everything completed with cold sounds. It is a very strange cult flag and the only film by George Barry who forgot to make it until the mouth-to-mouth of his newly-found cult status returned, he decided to release it on DVD. Not a bad movie, if you can watch the boring play and enjoy the hokey effects - the best part is the man whose hands are eaten off and he only sticks to the skeletal fingers with plastic ....... ................................. also as very surreal and deviant - mainly the whole thing the artist behind the painting and the demonic story of the bed. If you want a bizarre no budget, oddball flicks will definitely look for 'Death Bed'.
