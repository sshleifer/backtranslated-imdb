I have read many reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the point. I have noticed many reviewers who call it the typical "friend" movie. De Niro is by no means Murphy's buddy in most of these movies. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be with someone. <br /> <br /> Murphy really shines in this one. He's back to do what he does best, like a full ham. He is a policeman who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. De Niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the whole thing is stupid. I thought the two had good chemistry and were a perfect choice. Rene Russo is also big like the TV manufacturer. Of course she loves everything Murphy does and tries so hard (with Murhpy) to go DeNiro. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with William Shatner, who played his role as TJ Hooker to train Murhpy & De Niro how to act like police. But my favorite scene involves Murphy in the "confession" hoping he could get a Westly Snipes-like police instead of De Niro. Man, it was hilarious! Comedies often depend on your personal taste. Certainly you can put holes in the plot, mostly you can with a comedy. I was psyched to see the mating of Murphy and De Niro. I think it was the best in Murphy, which was nice to see him at the top of the game again. I can only think it was a great honor for Murphy to be with the great De Niro. Rating 8 out of 10 stars.
