This movie is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien movie (it's great). It lends the main premise - a man is poisoned and spends the rest of the film finding his killer. But I like the authors as a protagonist preferring an English professor instead of a private dick. The plot is also fairly original. Generally, the film moves fast enough to keep you awake. But what march this movie is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrible 80's original music score) combined with an affected "noir" feel. Dennis Quaid smiles inexplicably throughout the film on strange moments, but he is still compelling in a general way. Meg Ryan is fine as a student helper / love interest. When the film gets bad, when Dex (the prof) meets the British bodyguard / driver and their twins are pretty lazy. The guard works for the rich widow (played by beautiful Charlotte Rampling), but those scenes are too self-conscious "noir" to help the movie together, although the family "plotline" is very interesting. Dex also stays in the same place and finds this bodyguard, which is rather coincidental. In the last part of the film a man was shot through a window, and from outside you could see him coming out - it was pretty bad. But apart from some of these clear mistakes, I think it's still OK. I definitely did not predict the end, so it was good - there is a twist, and although some posters here think they were deceived, I thought it was a fine and credible end. Dennis Quaid, with his odd smirks and black eyes, is more enjoyable in The Right Stuff, Great Balls of Fire, Inner Space and Cold Creek Manor. But here as Dex, he's supposed to be a bit of a jerk, so he did well. Fairly decent movie.
