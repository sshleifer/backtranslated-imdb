This film is an honest but interesting movie. I'll tell you why it's nice later in this review. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting because it was the first movie ever to contain sound. No, it may not be an hour and forty-two minute movie, no it may not contain great action scenes, but it is still a wonderful movie for me. It has brought about a whole new knowledge of revolution, if you want, from audio films. It may be a bit fair to look at, and know that everyone in that movie is dead now, I can hear the voice of a man in the beginning who no longer sees the Earth visible and that the sound is broken and broken is. <Br /> <br /> I recommend this video to anyone to watch. It created movies as we know it today!
