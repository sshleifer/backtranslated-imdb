Of all the actresses in the film today, Kristin Scott Thomas would be my choice if I had to choose one to beach on a desert island. <br /> <br /> I could just see, say, sit in a chair for a few hours. So it's hard for me to be objectively completely at one of her films. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoyed this movie and its story, per se, more than the average position among the many people who previously responded to this site. <br /> <br /> However, Harrison Ford is not one of the actors, but whose performances I enjoy the most. But he is one of a handful who has reached the level of moving from 7 figures to 8 per film, so who should I argue? <br /> <br /> However, Ford is often in his acting, and sometimes he seems to be in serious need of an antacid and a caffeine cookie - and "Random Hearts" is in this group. <br /> <br /> His obsession with investigating the losses he and Thomas both understand about their affiliate spouses, given his profession as a detective - but not at the level offered here. Although not far off, it crossed the line in the "annoying" category. <br /> <br /> Most of the scenes after he and Thomas became involved were interesting and well-played. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a 9 * but I'd lower it a few levels, based on Ford's overall performance, and another, because it's a bit more of the stranger. contains subplot elements as needed.
