I like the movie, it's the best pirate movie I've seen so far (forget about bad Errol-Flynn stuff and Pirates of the Caribbean). This movie is wonderfully melancholy. I compare it to "Johnny Guitar" at sea (only 3 years earlier), two women fighting for a man, where crazy love can lead one. <br /> <br /> The character of the female (anti-) heroine, Anne Providence, is excellent, without compromise like a child, lost solely on her quest for her own female identity in a real man's world . She is a very funny movie hero, not a funny pirate, like most of her companions in this genre, doesn't always make jokes, fight for the poor and the good and just kill the stupid Spanish or British soldiers - better governors, but she killed all the poor prisoners of war after catching a ship (look carefully at the beginning of the movie), she is primitive (she can't even read), she is desperate and she gets an alcoholic, she loses all her friends because of her stubbornness and she carries the cloths most of the film. This movie shows a pirate "hero" a bit (!) A little like him (or in this case "she"), but there was a female Anne-buccaneer, Anne Boney, in the cruel reality. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty short and the story is told in a breathtaking way. Certainly, a 1950s movie has no exciting special effects for current viewers (the ships are very obvious in a bath tub), but this real drama about love (which kills), trust, betrayal, revenge, hatred and sacrifice drive a fool. Perhaps Anne is supposed to be Judas Iscariot and Jesus of Nazareth in one person, betrayed by her friend (French LaRochelle) as Jesus. after being disappointed by the friend, he handed him a death penalty (like Judas); than to repent (like Judas, committing suicide according to the Gospel of Matthew); and in the end sacrifice herself for the salvation of the beloved enemy (like Jesus). But even if you are not interested in these philosophical questions about guilt and reconciliation, the film brings much (cheap) action as sword fighting and burning (plastic) ships for a very short one and a half hours.
