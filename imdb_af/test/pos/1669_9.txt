A recent re-release of the French crime film (original title 'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes'), with its well-known 20-minute silent jewel heist series, is now in the US in a beautiful new print from The Criterion Collection with enhanced captions and a few extras. Jules Dassin was an American (born Julius Dassin in Middletown Connecticut) who was forced to make films in Europe because he was Blacklisted. Rififi was well known in the US and performed well in art houses. Later, Dassin became widely known in the US for "Never on Sunday" (1960) with his wife, Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri. (Greece was again glamorized and popular for Americans and others with Anthony Quinn in Mihalis Kakogiannis' 1964 'Zorba the Greek', which was even a big hit in Cairo.) The new Rififi DVD contains a recent interview with Dassin. I did not previously realize that one of the main rescuers, Cesar the Milanese, was played by Dassin, who entered when the original actor was not available. He is one of the most memorable characters, a dandified Italian safe that doesn't speak French. Although this classic has all the bumps of the French film noir - the black and white twilight world of well-lit apartments, shiny black cars, men in suits, the nightclub scenes, including a dramatic filmed and enlightened title song at the club, the stony faces and the Gauloises are performed in the hand or in the mouth. I don't think it's as atmospheric or as similar to a style like Melville's movies do. But there is the enchanting robbery, which is still being used as a tour today. It's like clockwork, with a fine sense of craftsmanship and teamwork among the robbers. Some nasal police are handled efficiently. Things go wrong soon after they go home and spread the booty when one of the players gets messy and a lady gives a million dollar bracelet ring in it. Was there ever a movie movie that the perps have happily ever lived? <br /> <br /> This is the wordless hoist sequence that guarantees a special place, and Dassin, an American director who had an unusually varied and exotic career, deserves full credit. He made a novel so conventional that he would reject it, adding some key elements that make it special. In that case, he couldn't do the adjustment: he needed the money too much. Jean Servais, who plays the main character Tony le Stephanois, was rather an actor on his luck. His grim face is perfect for the role. He later starred in Dassin's He Who Must Die (1957), who used French actors in Greece for a political story. 'Topkapi' is a somewhat disappointing 1964 hijacking film (it is compared to 'Rififi') which also has American spread. It does have a good environment, but it is messy, completely sweet and bright and beautiful. Van Dassin's post-Hollywood workout, "Never on Sunday", with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine, is the popular choice (and won the best film in Cannes 1960); "He who has to die" is the political choice; 'Rififi' the genre choice. A strange piece is his 'Phaedra' with Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). Purists of hard Hollywood genre work will disrupt it and Dassin's early films, including a prison drama, "Brute Force" (1947), a cop movie, The Naked City (1948); and two hard core noirs, 'Thieves' Highway' (1949), and 'Night and the City' (1950). Personally, I tend to keep French noir and American neo-noir spinoffs better than the original American noir source material - hence my lasting fascination with 'Rififi'. But Dassin is quite unique not only to make Hollywood noir, but to go to Paris and make an unforgettable example of his fifties French derivative.
