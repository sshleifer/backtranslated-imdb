If you don't like subtitles, you like comedy and really interesting characters, along with a taste of something other than the mainstream American cinema, then take a chance and hire this movie. <br /> <br /> Two contrasting friends, (one very neurotic jersey, the other the strong silence once) working for a blunt slaughterer in a smaller Danish town, decide to find out that they are together and themselves open a butchery. Not successful, they take something new in their recipe and become an immediate hit with the town. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting story in itself. This clever, humorous film becomes even more tense (friendship, romance, crime, death, personal tragedy) that makes this movie so funny, but still with many subtle interests that make it so interesting but rather hot and vague. <br /> <br /> One must mention, the characters are created and the actors make them credible. You can still have the best script if the characters aren't credible, it can sink a movie and with this, the director, acting character promise and story all so well, it makes it a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood to stretch a lil, you want to see something very good, but have done a little differently then I suggest you rent this movie while I is on the way to finding more by director writer Anders Thomas Jensen. .
