Thomas Mann's controversial novel is the basis for the film "A Death in Venice." Although in the book the hero is a writer, director Luchino Visconti, who also wrote the script, turned into a composer in the film. As such, the author / composer, Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde) is on the verge of spiritual exhaustion, a burnt out craftsman. After a long and successful career, the tranquility of a less hectic life is now looking for. He decides to go on holiday to Venice, where he wants to rejuvenate his urgent ambition. However, while staying at the picturesque bathing place, he draws the attention of a beautiful teenager, Tadzio (Björn Andrésen), who sees him with curious interest and is immediately beaten by him. Although Gustav is enchanted by the wonderful youth, he must still get a private time from the boy's governor (Nora Ricci), while dealing with an invasive plague that infects the city. The movie dialogue, like the novel, remains subtle as the few brief encounters between the boy and the artist. In the end. The audience, unlike the book, is hampered by innuendos and imaginative flight of fancy. Their relationship is never winged, dusted, or afforded, and it was not for the short resolution in the book. The movie only allows the possibility of 'what if'. Nevertheless, one can sympathize with the hero and wish him a moment's peace to obtain what is forbidden, elusive but certainly criticized by burning eyes. Great story and a Bogarde Classic. ****
