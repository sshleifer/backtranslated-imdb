This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not the extensive Renny Harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups. This is the Shane Black writing and his sophisticated delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two principals deserves a successor. Thanks, it's never been made. Too much danger of marking the original. <br /> <br /> 'The Long Kiss' checkerboards from actionable scene to action scene to repeatable scene and back. Never a dull moment. <br /> <br /> It must be Jackson's funniest role, and the great thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career. No fun Tarantino hit, super-cool shift, or frontier psycho. In TLKG, Jackson is the allman we identify with. The poor schmuck is dragged on this mad woman's odyssey to expose the dangerous secret of her past. Although the story claims Davis's character, Samantha Caine suffers from memory, the author and director treat her condition. as if it were a multiple personality disorder. <br /> <br /> Samantha Caine is not just a new identity taken by the amnesiac Charly Baltimore - she is a separate, fully developed personality. The traumas that Samantha suffered in the first half hour of the film help the darkened discipline personality of Charly appear again. <br /> <br /> The material of her previous life, unearthed by Jackson's detective Mitch Henessey, facilitates Charly's retraining. Good timing, also in light of Samantha's target of herself. <br /> <br /> But Charly must fight herself to stay the dominant personality. One collects from pieces of dialogue that Charly developed after her father died and she was recruited by the "Chapter". <br /> <br /> In the eight years, Charly was buried in the psyche, but her Samantha identity developed into the dominant personality. (She is even nicer than Charly.) It was probably due to a mother, as it is the reunion with her daughter who breaks Charly's struggle to suppress Samantha, leading to their apparent integration through the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to choose a "best quote" from this movie: <br /> <br /> "Now you are a sharpshooter?" <br /> <br /> "I saved your ass. It was wonderful!" <br /> <br /> "Continue to die." <br /> <br /> "I socks in the jaw and scream" Pop goes crazy ". <br /> <br /> And a couple of thirteen more, too much to quote here. br /> <br /> Geena Davis looks good and comes out as an action hero without shining over the fact that she is forty. (Listen to Charley's history, do the math). <br /> <br /> Fantastic soundtrack, including Santana, Muddy Waters, Elvis, LaBelle, Marvin Gaye. <br /> <br /> I give The Long Kiss Goodnight a 9, just because I don't believe in a perfect 10. Seen it a dozen times, and it still remains fresh. Beautiful holiday holiday to put on your shelf next to "This is a wonderful life."
