* Can contain spoilers, read only after the last episode season 2 has been seen. * Think about it. The guys on the north pole? Center of the Earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something: "Did we miss it again?" So was there another abnormality? It was of course when the plain crashed! I think this whole island is a setup. Drafted by her father. She invented it and was looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for. <br /> <br /> So basically it's an island in a magnetic shield. Even if it's fake. All the signs are there. False beards, false doors, false medicine, false observation stations, with false air shafts that lead to nothing. It is indeed a project, and because of the final stage of the season 2 final, I know that it has to do with Desmond, his chick and her dad (and probably Libby, she is weird, maybe she has something to do with the plane crashing, OK now, I'm drifting off.) <br /> <br /> Also in this episode, Henry Gail tells Michael to go to coordinates, and he'll find their salvation. This is probably a kind of door in the magnetic shield. Once you are gone, there is no way back. <br /> <br /> I think it's pretty obvious, despite the many questions I still have and hope to get answers for the next season. Thinking back to what we learned in season 1 and 2, I'm sure we'll get a lot of answers in season 3. <br /> <br /> Can't wait. <br /> <br /> Can anyone agree on this theory? Hope to hear from you ...
