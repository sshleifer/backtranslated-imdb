A genius. My genius. I remember the exact second in 1994. I was in a pub in Shropshire, England. I remember the exact seat. "Bill Hicks dies of cancer," said the head in the NME. I felt like someone was beating me in the stomach. Buy this DVD. If you find nothing in one way or another, I'll be surprised. <br /> <br /> RIP Bill, I wish so much that you were still here.
