.... but at the same time part of you think: Am I ready for what I'm going to see? <br /> <br /> Finally, you're happy to see it. At least I was. Jackass number two laughed twice and twice the action. Some stunts will leave you breathless. In addition to Little Miss Sunshine, I think it was the best movie I saw this summer. Maybe even this year. <br /> <br /> The whole movie delivers, except some like Chris Raab and Rake Yohn. I don't think any of the role players had a dull moment. Each stunt was funny or dangerous or a combination of both; stupid. The beginning was just as funny as the first one, and the end was interesting hilarious; the movie that performs a musical number. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two is the perfect movie to see with your friends. Stay on credit, there are a few funny moments. One of them involves Luke Wilson.
