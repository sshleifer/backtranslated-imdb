I've always liked Barbara Stanwyck, who was perhaps the hardest working lead of the 30's and 40's, though few of her movie roles are unforgettable. Today she is most remembered for the TV show "The Big Valley". Stanwyck worked so much because she was durable; She seems to be taking the most part and using most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many ordinary photos gained her credibility. <br /> <br /> And so for 'Connecticut Christmas' it was a very common attempt, plotting credibility and not really Christmas. However, Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan as well as some top character actors such as Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. Indeed, there are plots and funny moments that undoubtedly look more real in 1945 than they do today. To begin with, the plot relates to a magazine writer (Stanwyck) who believes the magazine's readers are a domestic goddess, married to a child and on a farm in Connecticut, but who is really single, living in New York and knows nothing about cooking or homemade. Can anyone even get away with such a fraud? Apparently, and even the owner of the magazine (Green Street) is being deceived, although one would think he'd seen the fraud a long time ago, but the story goes on and Stanwyck, Greenstreet, recently has a sailor off his sunken ship (Morgan) survive and Stanwyck's restaurateur friend (SZSakall) finds himself Christmas in Connecticut on a farm belonging to Stanwyck's boyfriend (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine that all the possibilities are there, as the fraud extracts as it should. Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to endure the rose, but one wonders how she can't stand him. Morgan and Stanwyck fell to each other, but he was supposed to be engaged and she was supposed to be married. Regardless, they begin to look like they are a beloved affair that makes dance cheek to cheek and steal in a horse-sled. Meanwhile, the incredibly naive Greenstreet character who Stanwyck and Morgan have seen together but still do not understand, sees one of the neighbors taking back a child who was loaned as part of the deception and calling the police for a abduction report. Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the sledge and the hoax starts to relax. <br /> <br /> At this stage, the movie is funny than in ridiculous or absurd, not funny ha, ha and it ends regularly as screwball comedies always do. The good guy gets the girl and they probably live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Every year, I look at Christmas to enjoy these characters at their best in a story that reflects what it was like in 1945 and because of a long hold with Barbara Stanwyck. Thanks, it was Christmas or like 95 percent of Stanwyck's movies, it would have been forgotten long ago and we won't see it again every year.
