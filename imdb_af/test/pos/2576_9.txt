I was amazed at how big Black Snake Moan seems to be. To be a fan of Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson. ID ID gives it a try. Well, when it was over, I was just amazed at how well this movie really was. I mean everything was dead. It is fantastic and very accurate. The film shows how great director and writer Craig Brewer (who made Hustle & Flow still a good film) can do just anything that seems and works in the past. it. Well, I love how it's just a good time, like a movie that just owns it. I also like that it doesn't show big steroids from the south and how it is portrayed in things as the most repulsive place to be, but not this movie, makes it very accurate and therefore it is very redesignable. The stocking in this is just phenomenal, especially of Christina Ricci (who deserves an Oscar for this role), the always wonderful Samuel L. Jackson, and even Justin Timberlake also did a good job. Generally speaking, everything is good about it, and although not everyone's movie, it is definitely worth watching from someone who can enjoy a good time. Three Cheers For Black Snake Moon !!!! <br /> <br /> 9.3 out of 10 stars
