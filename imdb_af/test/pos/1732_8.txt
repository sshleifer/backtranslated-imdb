I just watched the Season 2 Final of Doctor Who, and apart from a few dull episodes, this show is fantastic. <br /> <br /> It is a sad loss that we are once again taking a main character in the season finale, but moving the show. <br /> <br /> The BBC does not have to raise the budget for the show, there are so many things that can happen in London and the surrounding areas. Also, some of the special effects, although very good on the head, should be slightly polished on the odd occasion. <br /> <br /> It was a great game for the BBC to bring back a show that was lost. The road is a long time ago, and they have to be congratulated. <br /> <br /> Specially until Christmas 2006, the Christmas special for 2005 was by far the best on television.
