Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a teacher who is getting married. Then one of his former students wins an Oscar for a movie in which he plays a gay soldier and thanks Howard in his acceptance speech, which also leaves him gay! This film follows the aftermath as reporters come across Howard's town and he tries to convince everyone he is straight. <br /> <br /> I love this movie! Kevin Kline is wonderful, it has some very hilarious moments and it always makes me feel good with a big smile on my face. As a result, it is one movie I enjoy watching as often as possible. If you haven't seen it, you'll miss out!
