Based on the 1952 autobiography, a very beautiful thing, "Love is a Many-Splendored Thing" (1955), the story of Han Suyin, which focuses on the romance Han, a widowed Eurasian doctor 1949 Hong Kong, with a married American correspondent named Mark Elliott. "I never want to feel anything again," Han says shortly after meeting each other, but the two soon develop mutual irresistible things to each other, and who can blame them? Mark was played by William Holden on the nearby peak of his female period (next year's "picnic" will be the highlight) in the first of three films over the next seven years that Holden in China (1960s "The World of Suzie Wong "and 1962's" Satan Never Sleeps "is the other). And dr. Han is played here by Jennifer Jones, who, although not a Eurasian (unlike nice Nancy Kwan and pretty France Nuyen of those other exotic Holden films), is a credible work of passing as one. Whether dressed in cheongsam, European dress, surgical gown or (hubba hubba!) Bathing suit, Jones looks ridiculously beautiful here. No wonder East meets West in this movie so dramatically! Featuring its two leading main stars, breathtaking Hong Kong scenery, stunning CinemaScope and color, Oscar-winning costumes and that classic Oscar-winning title film that awards the movie like a sweet incense, "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing" quite the win and romantic concoction. He himself did not care about the picture, so I can only imagine that great freedoms were taken with her source material. Yet I enjoyed it. And when the end of the movie causes a tear to come to mind, Mark's words of wisdom remembers: "Life's greatest tragedy should not be loved."
