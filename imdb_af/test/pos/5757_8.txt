Bottom is my favorite sitcom since I saw it on for example and the movie is even better than your bottom fan I say it's a must buy !!! The plot is that Eddie and Ritchie manage a hotel called Paradise Guest House, but not everything will be right for them as clients until a well-known actress comes along, they try best to impress her, but not everyone is right, it is an education for the British cinema so buy it and you will water yourself with laughter. Also Simon Peggi (Shaun of the Dead) and also Bill Neigh (love actually) may not do well in checkout or by its appearance on this site, but do not listen to them buying it and I swear your will love it
