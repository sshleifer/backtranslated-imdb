Not heard from this movie, it was a surprise when it was recently shown on the cable. Gary Ellis, the talented director of "Tough Luck", wonders with the screenplay written by Bill Boatman and Todd King. The movie involves the viewer from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Archie, the young hustler in the middle of this story, is involved in all kinds of crime. In fact, we see a confrontation right at the start that brings him from New Orleans, as fast as he can. He ends up in the carnival run by the mysterious Ike. Archie falls to Davina, the woman he should have been to stay away from. The result proves a deadly judgment for Archie who then becomes the object of double crossing around the world. <br /> <br /> The director is to be commended by Norman Reedus, who is of course loved by the camera. Despite his nature, he feels to him because we know his heart is in the right place. The beautiful Dagmara Dominczyk is perfect like the exotic dancer Divana, who, despite Ike's lover, seduces Archie to fall over her heels. Armand Assante is barely understandable with the thick emphasis he speaks in the first half of the film. <br /> <br /> "Tough Luck" shows a new director, Gary Ellis, who shows he's going to do bigger and better things because he knows what he's doing.
