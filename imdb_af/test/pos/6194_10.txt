I accidentally found this show and was surprised to find that no one I know ever heard of. It was by far one of the best shows I've seen in months, or not years, and I can't wait for more episodes to come out. Sleeper Cell depicts a psychological struggle by a shelter agent in a terrorist cell that has to make tough decisions to maintain its cover while remaining true to its real cause. It's a very well done show. It keeps you from the first episode to the end, and while you're slowly progressing, it's quick enough to feel the edge. Completely realistic and human, it becomes important topics and every episode offers an interesting question to think about. This show is not 24 or any of the police shows on TV and doesn't try anything. It is genuine and unique. It's a show about a man, his difficult choices and his life of struggle where a simple mistake can cost him everything. <br /> <br /> I have this show a 10 for great storyline, great progress, excellent cinematography, great music and realistic characters, each with a story to tell.
