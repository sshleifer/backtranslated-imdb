Mickey Mouse is now 75 years old. He was created by Walt Disney, a well-known creator, manufacturer, director, etc. I love the Disney movies because it's nice to watch the cartoon movies. Altogether, Walt Disney, I think, is the king of the creations. Everyone should love these creations and movies by Walt Disney. Thank you Walt for all the classic characters you made.
