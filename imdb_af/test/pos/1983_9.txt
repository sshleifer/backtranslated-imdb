eXistenZ combines director David Cronenberg's traditional love of blood and gore and explosive heads with the confusing aspects of a David Lynch movie that distorts reality. And it actually works effectively. I won't try to give even the bare bones of a plot synopsis, because it will just cause more confusion. All you need to know is that the movie is about a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly lifelike that it becomes difficult to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality. The movie seems almost like the technological point of departure is coming to an end, but then it throws the last turn in the last line of dialogue. <br /> <br /> There are also some very rough sexual images based on the "bio-sports" in the protagonist back, as well as some very gross acting of Jude Law. He manages to get so naive and stupid and boring and any other annoying habit you can think of. Jason Jennifer Leigh is much better off and everyone can be called a supportive character, including Willem Dafoe in a functional, as well as unpredictable, role as a money mechanic. Overall, eXistenZ is a very effective sci-fi movie about the possibilities that technology can offer and the possible consequences it will receive.
