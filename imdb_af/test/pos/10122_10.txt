As one who regularly goes to the movies, I have to say that this is one of the impressive movies I've seen this year. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. delivered excellent performances that lost viewers in different emotions and really felt for the characters. It is nice to sometimes see a movie that is not entirely dependent on special effects, but lets the characters of the story touch the human psyche on many levels. I wish Hollywood would produce more movies of this caliber.
