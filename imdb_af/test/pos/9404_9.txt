I was very impressed with the narrative by Martha and how it touched on the emotional heartbeat of the audience, as well as how it influenced the family. The forward-backward motion of the storyline was well done, and I usually don't enjoy movies with flash back / flash effect effects. During the whole evolution of the movie I felt "Tommy definitely did it". It gives you a sense of how these people almost completely had their lives apart and the consequences of not having the desire to answer the question: "It's 10:00. Do you know where your kids are?" And further, "What is the gate they do?" !! Or "do I care?" !! Rich, spoiled brats who literally get away with murder. Or so they thought .......
