All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman the Viking guardian has a few memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, will always be killing Max with a mad link. The writing is the best. <br /> <br /> When I was younger, I was glued to the set. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made, I would be forced to buy it. These and a Conan's Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss most of childhood. I think these cartoons are the most unaffected by all the big cartoons. I watched these cartoons on Channel 13 in the Los Angeles area. <br /> <br /> I remember the owl was always scared, warns Max that he was in trouble and that he was the chosen one. Max didn't believe he was the chosen one and always gave the owl's trouble. Norman was less talkative, but his simplicity was funny. He will say things like "I eat samples for breakfast" when he fights them. And when he struggled with zombies, he would say, "I eat zombies for ... never." Classic cartoon comedy and action. <br /> <br /> I agree that they revive Mighty Max.
