The premise of the story is common enough; average family wants to find the simple life out of the rock ... so they move from Sherman Oaks, California to Lake Tomahawk; kids in tow. <br /> <br /> The lake is beautiful, they rented an old house .... but wait; there could be something in the lake; people are killed, and no one knows how (no matter why). Gerald McRaney is excellent, a well-known face for lifetime viewers; Valerie Harper is also good; Since this film was made in 88, the writer may be a sequel! <br /> <br /> You'll also enjoy Barry Corbin as the eccentric city, and Darryl Anderson as a Bruce Dern lookalike / mad military man. <br /> <br /> While the story is a bit overhead; If you're a movie buffalo, you'll be reminded of similar scenarios of "" Psycho ""; "" Liberation ""; as well as other horror stories of that genre. Several camera shots and sequences will give you deja vu. <br /> <br /> Sit back and enjoy; if you do not take it too seriously, it is very entertaining; and better than, for example, the more recent movie: <br /> <br /> "" I know what you did last summer ""; They seem to have made better movies in the good old 80's!
