Treating Williams has reached some degree of stargazing with this movie, and it really wasted it. Don't be deceived because of his poor movie choices. This movie really comes out. "Hair" is a musical that really handles the attitude, and probably more so with the persona, of the 60's famous peace movement. There are many spectacular music in spectacular ways. Unlike the music videos of the late 70's, 80's and 90's, the video flashes with the subject of music. In other words, the video makes sense when it matches the songs, so you know it could never have made it to MTV. The subject is drugs and is hippies, but it is mostly an anti-war film dealing with the senseless tragedies of Viet Nam. One of the key players is an Oklahoma boy who is aiming to make a difference. He believes all the patriotic dribbling he has donated, and he happens on a gang in New York, which is more or less glorified. their characters are very unique and will probably not make sense, but this group of ties together by burning their concept cards. What happens in a spectacular landscape and enchanting scenes involving not only the three leaders, but the other 3 gangsters, as well as a newcomer with a small child, whose entry is easily one of the ten greatest entries of all time in cinema, partly because she sings one of the greatest songs of that generation. Despite their mistakes, you come to love these people, a cinematic triumph with a heart failure and great final.
