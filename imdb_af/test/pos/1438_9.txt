Great book, fantastic movie, good soundtrack. Frank Sinatra shows in this movie that when he made the effort, he could act. The end is a bit schmaltzy, but for the time being understandable, the studio wanted a happy ending. The graphical nature of the heroin addiction (pioneers of the era) is a plus. Add the awesome soundtrack and you have one of the great American movies.
