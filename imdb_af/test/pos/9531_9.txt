The railroad kids were on TV again this weekend, and I forgot how good it was. <br /> <br /> If I have criticism, sometimes the episodic structure shows too clearly, there is little narrative sequence sequence. The charm and beauty of the film is such that it matters very little. <br /> <br /> I will not visit the comments of others, except to add my voice to the final stage on the platform as being possibly the most emotional scene in the history of the British cinema: as a cynical old git that is moving too fast through the ages, I can also find that I can't even think without a serious matter of "I have something in my eye." In fact, it is not just something in my eye, it also moves things inside of me too, with that beautiful, happy pain we sometimes feel. <br /> <br /> And Jenny Agutter was beautifully beautiful in this movie, one foot in childhood and one in young women, and features both of her portrayal of a girl growing up too fast. <br /> <br /> Plus a quick placement for Bernard Cribbins. He is mostly regarded as a lightweight actor, and made a perk of great humanity.
