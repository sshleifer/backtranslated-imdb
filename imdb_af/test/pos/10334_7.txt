I didn't see this movie in 30 years, so I don't know if I did as much as I did when I was 12. By this time I loved this movie. This is a good "starter chick spot" for young girls. But be careful about the end. There are tears and difficult emotions. <br /> <br /> Looking back at this from a 2008 perspective (with so much more knowledge of child psychology, politics and political correctness), I think it would be interesting to look again. Patty's careless, abusive father, careless mother and beneficiary sister, all contributed to making her vulnerable and hungry for company. Patty was sad when Anton left. She was sad when he was murdered. The anger directed at her was shocking. She was only 12 years old. <br /> <br /> The thing I kept the strongest is how this movie taught me, even "enemy" soldiers are also people. Not all German soldiers were hateful Nazis. When I was older, I saw TV programs like Hogan's Heroes and The Rat Patrol that also made the point that the "ordinary" German soldiers were not the same as the Gestapo. <br /> <br /> "Regular" soldiers have been set up. The Gestapo was selected among volunteers for their particular attitude of hatred. I believe one of the privileges of being a Nazi was that they had special assignments and therefore did not go into battle. Their specialties were questioning and torture. <br /> <br /> Later, during the Cold War, I would think of Russian soldiers and remember SOMGS. We were taught that the Soviet Union was "angry". But the reality was that Russian soldiers were not from America to destroy America. They had a job. Their government probably told them that our government would destroy their way of life. What was in a way was true, as the US fought to end Communism. <br /> <br /> The lesson is still applicable today. German soldiers were not the same as Nazis, just as Muslims are not al-Qaeda.
