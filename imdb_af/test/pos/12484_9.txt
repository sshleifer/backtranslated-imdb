Clouzot followed Le Corbeau, where no one knew what the poison was, so everyone was suspected, with another masterpiece, Quai des Orfevres four years later, where we know from the beginning or think we do. Louis Jouvet, with the highest rate, does not appear for forty minutes. By then, Clouzot has a rich environment of Music Hall, music publishers, etc. And established a good role-play of colorful characters; Angela Lansbury lookalike (Lansbury appeared the same year in Paris Woman). Suzy Delair scores as the chanteuse whose desire to improve her fate inspires the jealousy of her husband / companion Bernard Blier who follows her to the home of an elderly lacquer to find him is already dead. From here, it is seriously wrong, his car is stolen before leaving the premises, so his prescribed alibi is out of the window while his wife is not known, acknowledges his wife on the murder of the photographer's neighbor, a cupboard lesbian in love with her returning volunteers to the crime scene and retrieving Delair's scarf and as long as she is there, thoroughly wipe off her prints of the murder weapon, a champagne bottle. At this stage, investigator Jouvet becomes involved and from then on it is a case of turning the plates into the air. Clouzot's output was relatively small, but almost everything was, like Spencer Tracey said in a different context, "cherce," with Le Salaire de leur and Les Diaboliques still to come. In short, this is a requirement for French movie buffs.
