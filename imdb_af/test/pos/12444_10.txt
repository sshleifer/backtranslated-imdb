I can't remember exactly where I heard from them, but I listen to a bit of one song and like it. Purchased and bought the CD and finally found the kind of music I found. I heard about this video and knew I should have it. It has lots of cuts from those playing in concert. Let me tell you, watch this video not even compare with them in concert. I confronted them twice and never wanted to ever see them again. The other two things it has are an interview, and even a video for one of their biggest songs. Some small lace notes ... I saw them at ozzfest 2001 and they ruled there, but they saw in a smaller interior much better (they had some very cool things to do to cut out the lights) in case someone wonders, means a wordy follower.
