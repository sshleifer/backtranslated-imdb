John Parrish is a former Union official who plans to sell his farm and sell to the Wilkison resort at Anchor. The problem is that the price offered is too low and when they start to blame Parrish and his workers, he has a heartbeat, especially if things start a cruel turn to the worst. <br /> <br /> Initially After looking at this one, I had a sense of frustration, mainly due to the role involved. When you got Edward G. Robinson, Glenn Ford and Barbara Stanwyck in the same movie, you hope they get a story and script to excel. Unfortunately, they don't get the chance to make a Western classic worthy of several repetitions, or is it my expectation of doing a disservice? Well, I slept on it and decided to think about the picture further. I think yes, it is fair to say that the actors in question deserve a better story from which to work, that is, when everything is said and done, a plot that has been mourned for all that is worth it, and some. But the violent men are still a very rewarding film, regardless of the opportunities missed in the production. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford as Parrish is really like eskimo's nose and it's always great to play Babs Stanwyck. a bitch because she is good with it. While Eddie G, when someone gets used to him in Western, is good at what a subscribed part is. Robinson, who used the last moment when the first choice like Lee Wilkison, Broderick Crawford, was injured, is the one that has changed most by the makers, even supporting characters such as the devilish Wade Matlock (a trustworthy smile). Richard Jaeckel} and Judith Wilkison {a radiant Dianne Foster} get something to give, but for what it is, Robinson's bad guy is at least memorable for all the right reasons. /> <br /> Not shy about action and gun, it's with the twist and almost Shakespeare tragedies that Rudolph Maté's film rises above the everyday, with everything in the eyes of Burnett Guffey's spectacular cinematography. was used on many Western photographs (see Seven Men of Now for another glorious use of it), but here Guffey is really excellent and manages to blind the eyes every turn. The Violent Men is not a great Western picture, and maybe a better director than Maté the Donald Hamilton novel (The Big Country) has given an adaptation to be proud. But for every niggle and irk that I personally had with it, I found two more reasons to really keep it, so it's certainly recommended. 10/07
