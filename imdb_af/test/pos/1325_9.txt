The first season has pretty much told how all elements of the Marine Corps would work (ie ground, air, helicopters and jets) as a team. It's the season I give the high rating! (True, there are still many freedoms in season 1, but the stories were more credible.) <br /> <br /> The following seasons were a terrible attempt to meet Melrose Place at Top Gun! <br /> <br /> At that time I was a Marine stationed at Miramar and I remember shooting the show around the San Diego area. I talked to Rod Rowland and James Brolin. <br /> <br /> Rowland's character was good to go. <br /> <br /> Brolin's character was just fine in the first season. For some reason he shuts down to the first ep of the second season. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a LITTLE how the Marine Air Ground team works, then the season is one that looks. /> <br /> If you are in Melrose Place and soap opera such as plots, trying to put them together in Top Gun, then see the last two seasons.
