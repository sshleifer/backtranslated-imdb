These kind of movies just don't get the credit they deserve. This is my 2nd all-time favorite movie. (I stand for the first place.) The reason I watched this movie was because Wil Wheaton was in it and he is my most favorite person in the world and I think he did a wonderful job in this movie and so did Sean Astin. I actually just watched it last night and it just surprised me. Everything in the movie is very exceptional. The writing, the play, the script. I was 80% of the time on the edge of my seat and if my mother were not in the room, I would have absolutely blown my mind when Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) died. I didn't see it! Some Sins !! I was really surprised when I heard it wasn't really back in the 90s. I was born a few years after it came out. Of course, I didn't see it in the theaters, but I'll make sure I would live. If any of my friends watched it, they would be like, "Oh, okay?" but that's just because they're not cool enough to appreciate work like this. If you haven't seen this movie or want to see what the bomb is, it's the movie you should watch.
