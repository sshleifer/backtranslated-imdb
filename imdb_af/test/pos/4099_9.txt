Really, this movie should be released on DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio movie and I was completely satisfied !!! It was on my list of movies to own simply because of the cast. Three of my people, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both in Romeo and Juliet, and also John Gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, there was so alone. I thought for the small amount I spend it would be good. Boy, I'm right. I'm not going away from this one, but you'll already know the story, but I'll just tell you if you can get a copy in any format. Do this! @ You won't be sorry. . JPC
