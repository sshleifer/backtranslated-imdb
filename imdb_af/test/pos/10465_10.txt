This is one of those movies that is getting better every time. I watched it three times and actually registered on IMDb because I wanted to respond to it. Films "about food" have been done before, some of them are really good - for example, a certain Japanese comedy that will know aficionados of Asian cinema anyway. But this one is really in its own league. In its core, a Protestant Christian parable that symbolizes the ideal of kindness, but by far dogmatic, also speaks of the "good" in each of us, regardless of our religious beliefs or lack thereof. There is an overwhelming understatement and refinement in Babette's Feast, but it makes the message of the movie, if anything, stronger, not worse at all. If you are not attending Babette's extraordinary physical banquet, you are still welcome at this feast of the soul. Highly recommended !!
