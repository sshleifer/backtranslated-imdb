Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us how much she hates her mother, Adele (Susane Sarandon). So the movie starts. Adele decided that she and her daughter were going to California without asking anyone and leaving her husband for no reason. The story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter. It is very deep and touching, thanks to the great work of the actresses. Natalie was nominated for this role as a Golden Globe. She is one of the most talented actresses I've ever seen, and so is Sarandon. They really look like mother daughter. The soundtrack is also wonderful. The movie is incredible. * 10 out of 10 *
