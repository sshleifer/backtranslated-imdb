It was good to see John Denver again, though he passed a few years ago. I found this film very heartwarming and a good movie to sit on the fire on a cold winter night, remembering what Christmas is all about. The scenes of Georgetown, Colorado were wonderful and made one straight away. While sitting in my own mountain in So California, I loved the story and the plot. I hope everyone who sees this somewhat older movie enjoys it as much as my mom and I did. Merry Christmas! A great movie for the whole family to see. Enoy and tell others about it. Thanks for the memories. We need more movies like this from Hollywood.
