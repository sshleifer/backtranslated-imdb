Kannathil Muthamittal was just one of the most beautiful and sincere movies I've seen in a long time. The story of an adopted girl who learns the truth about her parenting on her 9th birthday. She tries to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is a terrorist. <br /> <br /> The greatness of the film lies in its simplicity. Mani Ratnam generally has a tendency to create unreal and turbulent overflowing characters in this movie, every person really looks and their interactions touch and sincerely. That's why it's one of his best movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is emotionally drained and ties in the heart of the viewer, but as 9-year-old amudha and simran as her adopted mother is simply brilliant. their relationship is the cornerstone of this movie. There are some notable flaws here, especially the scene where amudha teaches that she is an adopted child, and it seems totally unreal. It is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would break such a news in the way they did. Another mistake is surprisingly enough, the brilliant songs. they seem to be forced and stand out, not landed with the rest of the writing. <br /> <br /> It said it was one of the most beautiful and beautiful movies ever to come out of India. . This beauty is not only in the script or characters, but also in technical brilliance, ravi chandran's camera work is pure poetry. all the characters are creditworthy and the realistic humor, especially in the flashback scenes, is entertaining. <br /> <br /> A Sincere 9 !!
