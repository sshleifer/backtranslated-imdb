I'm ashamed to say this, but I have to admit that the first time I saw this movie was just about a year ago. After I saw it, I immediately rushed and bought the DVD collectors' edition. I've been watching it many times. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing on many levels. It works as your straight sample or action-type movie, as a horror / sci-fi and also as a very interesting look at the human psyche. The incredible sense of paranoia, distrust and fear, not only lends itself to Carpenter's direction (it is beautiful), but also through the tremendous performance of the roll-cast. Kurt Russell (of course) is spectacularly underestimated by MacReady, and as a direct result, he feels like a real person rather than a Hollywood American hero. The other role players all carry their roles with style, and the net result is a strong credible atmosphere and a fantastic movie.
