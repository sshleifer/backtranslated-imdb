I completely forgot about "Midnight Madness" so far I found it while navigating the IMDB. Now, it all comes back. <br /> <br /> It was one of Naughton's first movies (as well as Fox's) and sharp-eyed connoisseurs will also be Kaplan (TV's "Alice"), Fiedler (he does the Piglet's voice the "Winnie the Pooh" cartoons) and Blocker (son of Dan "Hoss" Blocker of TV's Bonanza). <br /> <br /> But the two who stand out In my mind are Furst (from "Animal House") and the superdude self - Eddie Deezen. Furst plays a bath this time and has one of the best scenes when he asks his father, "Why can't you just accept me for who I am?" His father looks over his obese messy frame and gives a simple one-word response - "Yuck!" <br /> <br /> And Dees ... he's a show in himself. Like last year's Jerry Lewis, he stumbles around, blows through mini-golf dams, puts melon halves on his ears and ends with Maggie Roswell falling for him. My hero. <br /> <br /> As far as the film is concerned, it is typically early-80s folly with college kids arriving after the pedestrian and going on a city-wide hunter to prove which section of students is best on campus is. : The jocks, the nerds, the rich children, the feminists or the group consisted of a bit of everyone. <br /> <br /> Who wins? Who cares, you will be delighted to look at Disney Pictures' first incident in the PG area before making Touchstone Pictures. <br /> <br /> Seven stars. Catch "Midnight Madness" any way you can! <br /> <br /> Long life Leon!
