Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated filmmakers over the years, and 2002's Puckoon is no exception. The novel, set in 1924, relates to the division of Ireland, especially its effect on a lonely community (the "Puckoon" of the title). Due to a colossal blunder, half of the town is now in Northern Ireland, the other half being in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence that blocks their path. Drinkers move like sardines in a corner of the bar to enjoy a cheaper pint. A dead man must have a passport in his name before villagers can reach the church yard to bury him. <br /> <br /> 'Puckoon' is a kind of Irish 'Under Milk Wood' with comic characters and surreal events abundant. The main character, Dan Milligan (called 'Madigan' in the film) is played by Sean Hughes and has talks with the narrator (Richard Attenborough). Also in the film are Milo O'Shea, Griff Rhys Jones, David Kelly (from Robin's Nest), Freddie Jones, Joe McGann and Elliott Gould. <br /> <br /> Interviews for the 'Making of' Puckoon documentary, writer / director, Terence Ryan, have unveiled the book. It shows on the screen. But unfortunately, like the bad movie of 'The Hitch-Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy', a good book doesn't necessarily make a good movie. The problem with 'Puckoon' is that, like Milligan's other books, they simply don't work on the big screen. "Puckoon" is essentially a collection of jokes looking for a plot. <br /> <br /> No way can the movie be compared to train wreckage such as "Sex Lives Of The Potato Men", "Fat Battles" and "Lesbian Vampire Killers", but then it's not as good as it should have been. The last half hour has been a lot of police, British army, some locals who have killed explosives in a coffin, and are very boring to go through. Ryan's decision to keep the book closer is the main reason for his failure to work as a movie. <br /> <br /> The other problem is the total absence of charm. 'Waking Ned' had it in the kicks, while the TV series 'Father Ted' became more surprising. Spike lived long enough to watch the movie, and apparently enjoyed it. His daughter, Jane, has a cameo as Madigan's bride. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me, however, was the quote at the beginning: "I don't mind," Spike said. Don't want to be there if it happens! ".
