Oh, I remember watching this show at 4pm. during my junior high days. It wasn't a pleasant experience, because I remember seeing it when I did my homework. <br /> <br /> However, the show attracted my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and the typical junior high issues. <Br /> <br /> But the show isn't just about adventures and special powers; It was more of an educational effort for a younger audience to be more interested in school and biology in general. <br /> <br /> The main actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) has made a fantastic show. She made the show visible. <br /> <br /> They just don't make such shows anymore ...
