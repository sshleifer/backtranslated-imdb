I was very excited to see a documentary on one of my favorite Italian directors. D'Amato turned in everything from Horror, post-apocalyptic to hardcore Porn. He has become genius several times with films such as Buio Omega and Emmanuelle & The Last Cannibals. This documentary is a long and informative guide to the movies of D'Amato. He is continually interrogated with English subtitles rolling over the bottom of the screen. The excerpts from his films are told by a narrator (with English subtitles). The documentary was extra interesting when it analyzed the often-censored "Emmanuelle In America". Here, D'Amato explains in detail the faded snags and remembers some funny stories. In fact, good uncle Joe is very hot and funny, always wears a smile and smokes a cigarette. The one disapointing aspect of this documentary is that it spends little time on D'Amato's Horror movies such as Anthropophagus and the brilliant Buio Omega. It spends too much time on the erotic theater and hardly touches the post-apocalyptic films. But I can't complain. It's great to see that D'amato gets the respect he deserves. Highly recommended for fans of D'amato. May he rest in peace.
