I agree with msinabottle; this is a good movie. Here are some snippets: <br /> <br /> Raisuli (Sean Connery) to Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen): "You see the man at the well, how he draws the water? When one bucket empties, fill the other stuff It is so with the world, at the moment you are full of power, but you are wasting it dirty, and Islam is loading the drops as they spill out of your bucket. "<br /> <br /> Raisuli : The English paid very well in the past. Pedicure: Well, you won't go with the Americans. President Roosevelt will have your head for this. Raisuli: Roosevelt. This President Roosevelt - will he try to take it himself? Pedicure: He'll definitely! He is a man of grit and strong moral fiber. He does not abduct women and children! Raisuli: What kind of gun does he use? Pedicure: A Winchester! Raisuli: Winchester. Winchester. I have no knowledge of this gun. Pedicure: You will. <br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt (Brian Keith): The American Grizzly Bear is a symbol of the American character: strength, intelligence, anger. A little blind and reckless at times, but deliberately beyond doubt. Oh, and another feature goes with all the previous ones. Newspaper reporter: And this, Mr. President? Teddy Roosevelt: Loneliness. The bear lives only his life. Indomitable. Unbeaten. But always alone. He has no real allies, just enemies - but none of them is as big as he is. Newspaper Reporter: Do you feel it can be a US feature? Teddy Roosevelt: Sure. The world will never love us. We can respect that. It can even grow to fear us. But we will never love that. Because we have too much pride. And sometimes we are blind and reckless.
