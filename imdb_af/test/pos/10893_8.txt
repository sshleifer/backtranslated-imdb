This is one of my favorite James bundles in games because: The missions are fun to play, they have a lot of action in them, they can be hard to make fun of using the weapons you use is good. The way James Bond looks in these James Bond games is beautiful. You can see Brosnan in him who is cool and all the other characters in this game look like the actors they played in the movie. There is no way you can't play a good time playing this game, but I love it. Also the game follows the picture, maybe some added things, but it follows pretty much the movie. Also, this James Bond game has pretty good graphics for Nintendo 64 and too badly there was no voice over actors in this game, but who cares as long as the game is fun. <br /> <br /> Overall score ** ****** from **********
