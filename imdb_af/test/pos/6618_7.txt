This documentary traces the origins and lives of the Zephyr skateboarding team, using original movie shot in the 1970s (mostly by Craig Stecyk), combined with interviews of team members and other influential people today. <br /> <br /> The first part of the movie documented the creation of the Dogtown section of Venice, CA, began around the turn of the century when the town was created to host a Venice, Italy-European city. be. By the 1970s, one remaining local attraction, the Pacific Park, had left, with a beach with many exposed piers and other hazards. The poor children living in the area have nothing better to do than burn, and they excelled in spite of (or perhaps also) their environment. Because the waves disappeared in the afternoon, they picked up skateboarding to fill their time. The empty pools caused by the drought during those years, plus their following backgrounds, created the vertical skateboarding style that is today. <br /> <br /> I found that the movie covered much more about surfing than I expected, which looks like a bonus, because I didn't know much about surfing or skateboarding before I watched the movie . The soundtrack, not surprising, was also good. I also liked how these kids just follow their passion and generally got better for the experience. The parts that did not work well for me were the drama they were trying to create, which was slightly forced, and the team's somewhat overloaded sense of self-interest (although it is probably just remaining street attitude from where they grew up). It is not to say that they did not have significant influence, but that it was very likely that there were other factors as well. <br /> <br /> One note: My wife is more affected than most to nausea when using films referred to as "SpastiCam" (wiggling camera movements). This film is often guilty, so if you are harassed, you are warned. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone, but especially to anyone with skateboarding and / or navigating in their history. <br /> <br /> See on 5/11/2002.
