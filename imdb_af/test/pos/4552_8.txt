Well, the day Rob Schneider throws himself further into the black hole of infamous bad movies by playing in the absolutely non-coveted "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" (hmmmm .... there wasn't a movie called Roadtrip followed by a sequel called Eurotrip? And now there is Deuce Bigalow: Man Gigolo followed by sequel Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo ....... I smell a pattern, maybe there will be Spiderman: European sites are Hotter ..... or not) I am writing about this very malicious (at the time of release) film. I was one of those maligneurs, I have to admit. I turned my nose over it while Chris Farley put cocaine on his nose and the SNL cast struggled in one of the worst seasons in their history in '94 -95, the Norm McDonald's anchor. Films such as Happy Gilmore, Tommy Boy and Black Sheep came out in the few years after this period and we realized there was a dark future for the caliber of Spade-Farley-Schneider-Sandler movies. However, I watched this day, ten years after and 8 years after Chris died and couldn't stop laughing. Yes, it is not very sophisticated. Farley does what Farley does (not Manny Manny), but his "From Down By the River" motivational speaker, in which he complains while perhaps not "enough" or "wearing attractive clothes" or "more deodorant used as twice a week "translates well here as the stupid character who realizes he is not the brightest, not the best and can lose a few pounds. Likewise, he tries his best to do what he is supposed to do. And David Spade just throws his slices one-liners as he did for Spade's Hollywood minute and basically Farley's self-esteem. There really isn't much more to say than that. I love the one scene when Farley Spade catches and splashes his monkey and then makes a few queens about it. Can't remember what the first one is, but the second one is in their hotel beds and Farley says to Spade: "Do you like baseball?". Spade muttered something inaudible and Farleys said, "The New York YANK egg?" Anyway, Farley does his awkward, painfully sensitive, frat-boy shtick. If you like, you like it. I couldn't stop laughing.
