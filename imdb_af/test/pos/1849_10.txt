I love this movie !!! <br /> <br /> This beautiful, sweet love story instantly penetrated me with her lovely characters and heart-warming romance. I've been so to the characters in the movie that I felt like I knew them personally. The storyline is very enchanting, and it has led me to tears in several moments. Duchovny and driver have a very cute, smart relationship that you can't help getting involved. This one is worth watching more than once and showing to all your friends. I'm just curious, why wasn't that a big hit? <br /> <br /> I give it a 10 out of 10! Spectacular movie! (And it comes from a man who thinks that 9 out of 10 movies aren't even worth watching.)
