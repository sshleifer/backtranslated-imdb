My mom and I went to the Fort Worth premiere, especially to George Street, but eventually got the chance to see the movie premier at Bass Hall. What a wonderful, beautiful film that not only depicts the beautiful Texas landscape but also a wonderful story. It was well written, directed and produced and my mother and I loved it from start to finish! Thank you Jay for giving us the opportunity to be part of the premiere of this wonderful movie. It was a night we will never forget. As if the movie wasn't enough, we were also happy to put 4 rows ahead of my favorite singer, George Street! Thank you, thank you, thank you !! Keep up the great work and thank you again! <br /> <br /> Debbie McClendon & Maureen Daugherty Ft. Worth, TX
