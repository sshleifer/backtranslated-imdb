It was the very first movie I've ever seen in the theater. I was 7 years old and to this day it is one of my favorite movies. This is pure smarmy cheese. The cartoon is marketed for young girls, selling dolls with soft bodies and large plastic heads, one for each rainbow color, their own special animals, sprites and even a rainbow horse. Typically of the period, each show about how hope, togetherness and magic can make everything 'better'. <br /> <br /> The movie is about the advent of spring, when all the light and color return to the world. But this time it doesn't just happen to our beautiful hero. A spoiled Princess plot to overtake the soul-lightening (and implied life-giver) of the universe, which is a giant diamond, for its own destructive purposes, without considering reality and now Rainbow and her newly found friends. Orin, Onyx and Chris have to save the universe. As I said before, it's cute, but it's cute, and it's just like any other cartoon from the era, like the CareBear movies, Strawberry Shortcake, Rose Petal and the Smurfs. All movies created to sell dolls to children. And it works. :)
