It was clear to the final credits this film made in 1989, as all the elements of its production were made to look after the 1960s - the acting, the characterizations, the sets and the props all have an aesthetic of a had earlier. /> <br /> The movie opens for the moments before the A bomb is being dropped on Hiroshima and how this tragic incident affects one family: a young woman, Yasuko, who lives with her aunt and uncle. Even in black and white, and with special effects that are quite primitive according to modern standards, but emotionally and effectively, the imitations of the immediate aftermath of the bomb are quite terrible. Family members are unrecognizable to each other, others look like zombies while wandering and shocking the streets. <br /> <br /> The title refers to rainfall that falls shortly after the bomb, which is radioactive as mixed, and in what Yasuko is caught. Rumors of Yasuko's essence in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing influenced her marriage prospects and later it is taught that black rain is indeed causing diseases. The film is not only concerned with the physical effects of the bomb on the Japanese, but also on the social and psychological damage done. <br /> <br /> I found the movie compassion and a fascinating journey to a unique culture. While the film is mainly concerned about the pain felt by one family, the film's soft political message today is relevant and likely for all time. Wars have horrific effects and should not be incurred unless absolutely necessary. It is said that history is repeated, and the current leaders of the "Coalition of the Wild" have learned nothing. While nuclear warfare has not been revived since 1945, other deadly effects have occurred. This movie is compelling viewing.
