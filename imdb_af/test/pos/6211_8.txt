When I first saw Colleen Moore, it was in the excellent series of silent films called "Hollywood". There she was in 1980, her hair bobbed like it was in the Twenties, a sparkling, witty and charismatic elderly lady - the definition of "presence". Then I saw her fantastic silent comedy work in films like "Ella Cinders" and "Orchids and Ermine". Then the disappointingly gloomy talkie is "The Scarlet Letter". And now she's in "The Power and the Glory" which gives a show of staggering power. He also works expertly with one of the best films of the Spencer Tracy talk. <br /> <br /> I found the movie a bit lackluster story-wise, but Moore and Tracy give such brilliant performances that the story almost looks. Both actors are aged from youth to age in the course of the film - and this is mostly done by reacting alone with minimal makeup and hair changes. Moore is almost unrecognizable, as the elderly woman and the scene where she finds her husband see that a younger woman is one of the most wonderful scenes I've ever seen. She does most of the scene without dialogue, and that's where her quiet working experience gives her the edge, even about Tracy. Contrast this with her beautiful cartoon that plays in a different silent sequence if she is a young woman and Tracy struggles to imagine her. Amazing! What this film reveals more than anything else is how embarrassed it is that Hollywood is abandoning this remarkable actress through his fingers and spending most of her life in retirement.
