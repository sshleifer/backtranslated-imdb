I only saw it once - in 1986, at a artsy theater in Minneapolis ... but I remember it as I saw it a thousand times this morning. Hilarious ("Sawing for Teens", Scrabble plays with all the "e" tiles), beautifully animated (takes her eyes off, shakes them back in position and puts them back on), and offensive (the end of the world, the pettiness of a cut) ... <br /> <br /> Required display for the human race. To call it just a cartoon is to name the BIG GATSBY fine typing.
