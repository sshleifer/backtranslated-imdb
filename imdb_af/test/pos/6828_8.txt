"Confirmed Death" is an important episode in the series, as it introduces four new characters: the rescue team who contacted Naomi before Locke got through a knife in her back. However, as the quote in my one-line summary says, their true purpose is to be on the island, perhaps something else entirely. All the new characters appear intriguing (especially Miles, a kind of psychic / exorcist), but at this point it is too early to make solid judgments. I felt that this episode was a slight step from "The Beginning of the End" (it's not flash, short-term flashbacks instead), but it still has its beautiful moments and steam near the end. *** out of 4.
