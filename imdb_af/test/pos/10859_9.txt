It's amazing that a production like this is made today, especially for television. Because of the strong sexual themes and explicit love shows, not to mention lesbians, it is wonderful treatment and direction given. <br /> <br /> The sets and costumes are flawless, the direction is stylish and the characters are nice. There is a good amount of humor, but it has surprisingly dark interludes. The protagonist is really a tragic figure, but not without luck. Also, this production avoids the mistake that most movies / shows make when dealing with homosexuality / lesbianism. The characters are very human. It seems to allow people to be comfortable watching gays and lesbians on television and movies most shows fill it with cliches and obsess the characters with gay. Not so with this. In the Tipping the Velvet, the protagonist is hardly aware of what lesbian means! <br /> <br /> The BBC has made some amazing productions in the past, and this adventurous period piece just confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts.
