Well, it's a good movie. However, you must admit that Van Dame's movies have not been so good lately. On the other hand, if you are a hardcore of Dame fan, you have to see it, because there is a big improvement on fighting scenes. Also what I liked very much is the music beautiful music. I'm sure it will kill time if you are acting fan. What Isaac Florentine is the director of undisputed 2, I don't think he did a good job as he did with Undisputed. I can't wait if one day Van Dame's movies hit the theater before the DVD. Maybe, someday :). <br /> <br /> In the end, it's worth it if you have no other action movies to watch, it can make your hour and half fun.
