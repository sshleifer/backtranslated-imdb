I am surprised that Memento (which is an excellent movie) is so well regarded in the Top 250 and this one does not even appear !! What the hell is that? To be honest - when this movie ended, my movie was better than Memento. After the euphoria of the wonderful end turned out, I came to the conclusion that they were equal in their excellence. I'm just confused about why it's not in the Top 50 with Memento. I'm guessing it's unfortunate because it's black and white, or because (again) the characters all have British accent ... unfortunately because it's no reason not to appreciate such a good movie. <br /> <br /> I tell you that if you loved Memento, you would also like the following. Brilliant!
