Walter Matthau is best remembered for the long series of comedies he did with the same comedian Jack Lemmon from THE FORTUGE COOKIE to THE ODD COUPLE II. But people tend to forget that he appeared in two films with another partner in the late 1970s - a female partner. It was Glenda Jackson, the English double Oscar winner, who demonstrated her comic abilities against Matthau's first in HOUSE CALLS and then in HOPSCOTCH. Matthau's role was slightly larger in both films, as his characters were more central to the plots, but the chemistry between them was pretty good. If you ever want to see two benefits of sexual intercourse, Walter and Glenda look like Dr Charley Nicholson and Ann Atkinson are experimenting to see if two people can have sex on a bed under the old movie code of the two parties. each one has one leg on the floor! Sex has never been looked at from such a clinical and mechanical point of view. <br /> <br /> Matthau's Charlie is just widow before the movie began. He had only one wife in his life - his wife. So now he is the qualifying bachelor. He is also the leading surgeon in the hospital where he works, but the chief surgeon is Dr. Amos Weatherby (Art Carney). Carney is apparently nervous (there are moments later in the film showing that he switches his senility on and off - see the scene where he ties Richard Benjamin's car). Amos is looking for re-election (Charlie is his closest competitor to the post - if he wants it). However, Amos succeeds in persuading Charlie to make him work for reasons of self-esteem. <br /> <br /> One day, Charlie Ann marks the hospital. She had a slight accident and was resting in bed, but Amos placed her in a cage like a device (which Charlie remarks have not been used since about 1920). He gets her out of the device and makes her busy soon. She joins the hospital staff, but she is critical of Charlie's willingness to provide Amos, and she is critical of some selfish tendencies she sees among the doctors in hospital. <br /> <br /> Amos's bungling causes the death of a wealthy patron of the hospital (Lloyd Gough), which owns a baseball team (its biggest innovation is separate dual entry fees). Amos tries to calm the young widow of the team owner, deliver the salvation to the cemetery. (The line in the summary above is the promise of the promise). However, she is still determined to sue (her lawyer, Thayer David, says the hospital is the most incompetent he has ever seen). So Amos suggests that Charlie's romance should have the widow to satisfy her expensive trial. But how will Ann respond? The movie is quite amusing and so successful that it also caused a sequel to Jackson and Matthau. It also led to a television series.
