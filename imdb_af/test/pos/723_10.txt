In the back streets of Toronto, NG is a dark, mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman (Vern and Sarah). Each has a fascination with puzzles and a disastrous incident in their past. Fine dialogue and first-rate tasting this low key, noirish travels to the girl's quest for the meaning behind the word puzzles that appear in her life.
