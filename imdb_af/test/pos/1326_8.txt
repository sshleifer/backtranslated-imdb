I just want to point out (besides the plea for the series to be released on DVD) that a show should not be realistic to be entertained. Nowadays, with all the blood and gore in the news and in crime dramas, reality shows, etc., it's nice to get lost in a good, cute show with entertaining characters. PWOG adjusts the account. Was it Emmy material? No, but it was incredibly exactly the same. <br /> <br /> I also need to vote for the second cast - they were more charismatic than the first season. I would definitely agree that the first season had a more serious vibe than the second, but I was definitely more sucked by the latter cast. Although the series has been out of the air for years, I will never stop hoping it will be released for purchase.
