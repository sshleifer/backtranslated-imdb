Long ago and far away they knew how to make a musical and "Cover Girl" is no exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> A story of a dancer in a nightclub that becomes a cover girl. The old expression applies here - that happiness and fame do not always interfere. <br /> <br /> The dance routines are wonderfully choreographed. What about dancing and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> Otto Kruger is the older gentleman that Hayworth discovers when he sees her photo showing a strong resemblance to the woman who left him at the Hayworth's trail, Grandma Maribel. <br /> <br /> An avid reaction by Kelly drives Rusty (Hayworth) into the arms of Broadway manufacturer Lee Bowman. <br /> <br /> The picture is basically history that repeats itself at the end. br /> <br /> To add to the glory of this fine movie, there is always the sensible Eve Arden and hilarious Phil Silvers, appropriately Genius in the film.
