There was a very dumb teenager who had sex movies of the 80's and a bunch of slasher flicks, but there was only a handful of thoughts made, made you laugh and managed the duration; it was one of them. Cage is Hillarious, so Forman who got rid of her bio-accident from the Hollywood limelight. I'd love to see it on DVD, in a special version with comments from Cage and Forman. Wishing to think, I know. Do you ever want to plan a real 80's movie weekend, rent it, Sure Thing and 16 candles and Breakfast Club. It will take you back to a "Total Rad" time it looked like was much easier. Studio Memo: Time to release the DVD!
