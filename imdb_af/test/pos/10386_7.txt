First, the positive: an excellent job of depicting urban provinces that fit the sphere of the movie. Some of the shots can be paintings by De Chirico. Sophie Marceau, beautiful. <br /> <br /> The negatives: The stories are hard to believe. Unreal, unidimensional characters preach and posture 100% of the time, as if they were in a kind of cat walker. It's also not the Antonioni of his earlier, much better movies or the Wenders that we all know and appreciate. Malkovich is excess baggage in this movie.
