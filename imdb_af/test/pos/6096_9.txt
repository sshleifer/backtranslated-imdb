It must be one of the funniest Danish movies ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are hilarious while driving across Sweden. I don't know how Ulrich Thomsen does it, but somehow he can play crazy in a very healthy way. BUT if you don't understand Danish (I'm not referring to your dough here) don't waste your time on this? I don't think it will work with captions.
