Crackerjack is a hit and miss film located in the Cityside Australian suburban lawnmower. Mick Molloy plays a scammer who played free parking spaces at Cityside. When the club is pressured to install poker machines in the premises, they have to raise $ 8,000 to make it happen. The club needs new members to help and that's where Mick Molloys comes in and has to bowl to save the club. With many emerging and aging Australian actors, Crackerjack is a hidden gem. Be warned, though most jokes are for those with a knowledge of grass scales, but there are many amusing sight-cats that offer comic relief. Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy co-star. Overall, the movie should be recommended for people who play or play toy balls, but there is plenty of other stuff for an entertaining game if you have some understanding. If you enjoy Australian humor, I suggest you get your whitewash and go to the theater, as they are the premiere lawn cucumbers of the year (also the only one).
