It's really not worth considering a 'best picture', but as entertainment goes, it's the job! This is one I watched, every time with a pulse boost, at least a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Most of these actors were unknown at the time it was done, and we can recognize them from other work. Those who do not recognize current names probably do not want it. <br /> <br /> It was a fun adventure. Similar to The Little Rascals if they had to be serious.
