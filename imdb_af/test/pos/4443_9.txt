This early film by future gorist Lucio Fulci is a great addition to the Giallo subgenre. In rural Italy there is a serial killer of children in general. Add to the mix a variety of characters known to fans of giallo cinema? a malicious, newspaper reporter, ineffective police, a sexy siren, a priest, a dumb girl, a mentally handicapped, and so on. It is one of the best Italian players of the early 70's. <br /> <br /> Exceptionally For a big thing, the victims in this case are young boys, making a change from the more typical women in danger. The fact that it is children who are the target of the maniac only serves to make things a little more uncomfortable. Fulci pushes the envelope a bit here and goes even further into a glorious unPC scene where a young boy is subjected to the somewhat inappropriate attention of a sexy naked young woman (Barbara Bouchet) with the task of drinking to deliver. She shows herself openly and actively invites the youngster to unleash her; Eventually he asks if he wants to go to bed with her. Although she is clearly playing with him, it is quite an unusual scene. There is one or two unintentionally funny pieces of dialogue here, but it is very well photographed and Barbara Bouchet sets high levels of confident sexual appeal. An outstanding scene. Although you may feel a little wrong to see it! <br /> <br /> Together with Barbara Bouchet is the other outstanding show by Florinda Bolkan, who plays a madwoman accused of killing the children. She is not directly responsible, but it is left to the viewer to decide whether her black magic can or cannot kick the subsequent murder tree. Regardless, she is chased by a lynch gang and a chain slaughter while a car radio blows out rock music. This scene is very strong and unpleasant. His ominousness indicates the way Fulci's career will go. <br /> <br /> Despite the visceral impact of the murder mentioned above, it may be a bit surprising that the other murders are either bloodless or dedicated off-screen. The only other death scene that is comparable to the lynch mob is the death of the killer at the end of the movie, although this series is kind of foolish. The plot is intricate and overwhelmed with red herring, although I personally find the identity of the killer a little predictable. This weakness is less problematic on subsequent views though ?? Like most gialli, do not torture a duckling, it is actually viewable again. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is made great with impressive camera work, solid acting and effective music by Riz Ortolani? especially good are recurrent unaccompanied female vowels that sound as if coming from a distant hill. Fulci apparently made more graphic violent horror movies, but here he shows a talent for slightly more limited material. These are still wild things and are highly recommended for fans of giallo theaters.
