I laughed my ass for an hour. I didn't know who Dan Finneity was. Why haven't I heard of Dan Finnerty? He is hysterical and so are his Friends singers. They make all these women songs that we never want to hear a new experience. They blow away these songs. It was on Bravo last night. Why isn't this Dan man like "ultra famous"? Great voice! Charisma to burn! He blew me this show! I just read on the internet that he was once a member of Stomp. I think there's nothing he can't do. I saw "Stomp" at a UCLA theater years ago and those guys were wonderful. This show was done by Dreamworks last night! Does this mean that Spielberg did this? Why don't they watch this Dan Finnerty in a movie? There was a standing ovation at the end of this show and every time the camera was cut to the audience, everyone was so in, singing or dancing. The whole show had this wonderful energy. My only complaint was that it was no longer, but looking back, if you see how much energy these guys pour out, I think it would be impossible for anyone to carry out so much gusto over an hour. Man I loved this show!
