Michael Polish's hypnotic "Northfork" is a movie that has long been in memory. This beautifully crafted film written by Michael and Mark Polish is visually one of the best things that came out of the world of independent films last year. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, you shouldn't read it anymore. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​putting the film in Montana was a big coup for the Polish brothers. The majestic views of the country and the mountains have never been as sharp as in Noordfork. We don't need any color! The beauty is in the dark colors of the film, which raises the story of the devastation in this remote outpost. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the story is Irwin, the sick child under the care of the mysterious Father Harlan. This boy is seen in his bed where the kind of priest administers the medicine for his body. But is he really there? We see him interacting with the strange group we first meet around the cemetery. There are two fresh open graves. Will one of them be Irwin? <br /> <br /> At the same time, another plot line plays parallel to this first theme. We see the six black men who came to the area to remove as many people from the area as they can. It will be the bed for the man-made lake that will be created. Their reward is one hectare and a half of the front property, if they move a certain number of people. <br /> <br /> The third story line centers on the mystical group composed by Flower Hercules, Cup of Tea, Kabeljou and Happy. They follow the possibility of a link to an angel injured in this area. When Irwin meets them at the cemetery, he offers help only if they take him away at least a thousand miles from here. We watch the quartet examining the feathers that the boy placed under the pages of his bible. Can Irwin be that angel? <br /> <br /> The closing series shows us that all parties leave Northfork in different directions. The men in black drive their cars, maybe go home to enjoy the newly acquired properties as a reward. The mystic group is seen as a plane and goes to a higher place. We also realize that the child in Father Harlan died, despite the medicine and the care he received from the holy figure. <br /> <br /> Michael Polish has one of the best ensembles of all the principals. Nick Nolte, like Father Harlan, has a low key performance in his portrayal of this kind of man. James Woods, like Walter, one of the men working for the developer, does a good job. The biggest surprise is Duel Farmer, who makes an excellent impression as Irwin. This kid actor, with the right guidance, shows great promise. <br /> <br /> The mystic group is brilliantly dealt with by Daryl Hannah, Robin Sachs, Ben Foster and Anthony Edwards, the man with the funny glasses. Peter Coyote, Mark Pools, Ben Foster, and the rest of the cast are faultless under Mr. Polish direction. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie relies on its simplicity. Mr. Polish's vision will haunt your memory. The images of Montana, as an unreal landscape, may have been one of the best things in American movies for some time.
