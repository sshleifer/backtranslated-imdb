A pretty enjoyable kidnapping captain in New Orleans, but the biggest downfall in my opinion is that it packs too many political intrigues and double crosses, and not enough of the sexy young actors, scenes of vibrant color, original cinematographic style and bite. humor. These aspects combine refreshingly daring theater, which seems to be a lot of recent things seemingly dull. Let's hope Sebabian Gutierrez continues with such flair - he looks like a talent to notice. The mismatching crowd of small crooks in the film is spelled out by the investigative partnership of Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. The humor whose screens are needed to make the movie what it is. The two draw their mandatory southern draws just as well as the Yanks, and it is a pleasure to see these two stalwarts of the British film, which are blunted by Lethal-Weapon-style fluidity. Just sorry that the only scenes they have The opportunity to steal is solely from them. Anyway, with a little less politics and authoritarianism (!), The movie would be almost perfect, so I'll give it a healthy 8/10 and hope a few people remember it a little better than what cash office.
