Looking at this series, you get an interesting 10 chapters on a sleep story and every character. And more intense with an infiltration of the FBI. <br /> <br /> Nice story, nice characters and performances, but something is wrong (of course to me). The final is wrong. You wait ten chapters and hope for a great final (no matter if they reach their goals or not) but ... well ... I don't think enough. It's a small final for a big series. I also hoped for more definitions of character stories. <br /> <br /> But I repeat it's and interesting miniseries. If you don't want to wait with huge ranges (22-24 chapters), watch it. I give 7 out of 10.
