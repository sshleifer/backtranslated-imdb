I saw and loved this movie in Australia, I was very eager to get my feet on a copy. I had one on DVD back in the UK just to find that it was a very different edit. <br /> <br /> The local Australain edits I've seen are snapper. The UK, and I suppose European, amendments spend much longer on the narrator played by Jimmy's dead brother. And indeed, this and little other points make no real benefit. <br /> <br /> This is not a serious criticism, but the Oz changes are only faster and I think more assured. <br /> <br /> I can't say why they feel it needs expansion for the overseas market. <br /> <br /> So careful about which one you're going for. <br /> <br /> I went for both.
