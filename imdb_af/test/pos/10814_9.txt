[Fewer followers] <br /> <br /> Steve Allen said that topical humor about serious events can be found by many, based on the formula: Tragedy + Time = Comedy. 1939 before the German attack on Poland was almost a fun period and the subsequent events, including the Blitzkrieg (after the Sitzkrieg) who took Germany to the Channel, resulted in the heroic evacuation in Dunkerque and the world the sickening spectacle of A pursuing France proposed his honor before the Nazi conqueror. <br /> <br /> Things about romance, comedy and a big pop of serious drama? Yep. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau, with a well-played and outstanding role, creates in Bon Bon a surprise of events and scenes from history and imagination that entertain a lot. <br /> <br /> Viviane Denvers (the sloe -eyed and beautiful Isabelle Adjani) is France's top actress as war clouds come together across Europe (which is an overused cliche, sorry). A veteran-self-supporting bedhopper with lots of credit to her credit, her inner motivation seems to be: "Everything that is good for Viviane is good for ... Viviane." Following a premiere of her latest movie a pastor in the incompetent Reynaud administration, Jean-Etienne Beaufort (Gerard Depardieu in an unusual role for him), his interest in her, she goes home for tired encounter with an ex-lover who is not the word "no "understands. She definitely decides the problem but then there's another former beau, still occupying Frederic (Gregory Derangere) to help deal with the mess in her apartment. Frederic is a novel-in-expectation . <br /> <br /> Once again, a comic accident, which is again a public service message, emphasizes the importance of work riders making Frederic in most serious cases, and fortunately, the Germans break out of their static positions. great transfer of prisoners to the south of France, but our boy escapes, makes his way private rather than a state ward. <br /> <br /> The panic and fear in France, as the Germans flung after the victory, is well portrayed and a new twist is entering the story. Who should meet Frederic but the wonderful young research assistant, Camille (Virginie Ledoyen), who accompanies the compulsory Jewish refugee scientist, Professor Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehle). Kopolski has a few bottles of "heavy water" that he needs to get to England. Of course, the Germans are not captured on this important ingredient because you know what (this part is pure fiction - there was never any heavy water in France in 1940 - just Perrier). And Camille is so popular and dedicated. <br /> <br /> What next? Peter Coyote as an alleged French journalist, Alex Winckler. Be typed over his name. He is really an officer in the Abwehr (German military intelligence: a spy). And he also thanked Viviane (and wanted a repeat of their relationship). Apparently, the kind of Kopolski is the only great male character who doesn't want it with the actress. <br /> <br /> What follows is a series of adventures and accidents seamlessly integrated into a very fast, fast and enjoyable movie. Partially a tribute and a spookie on Casablanca, it's a remarkably funny movie (except for the heavy Nazi bits). Isabelle Adjani deserves kudos for the best portrayal I have. seen in years of an adorably cute total narcissist with little or no redeeming features. And Depardieu, disloyal to Reynauld and ready to jump ship and join the traitor, Petain, is convincing as a man whose fears for Viviane exceed his diluted sense of duty towards the Republic. In a critical moment in French history, Beaufort is dirty everywhere. <br /> <br /> Not shown in too many theaters, "Bon voyage" should be available soon to buy or rent. See it! <br /> <br /> 9/10
