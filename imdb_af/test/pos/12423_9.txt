Great horror comedy by Michael Davis. I laugh so hard I almost planted! Great performance by Eric Jungman as the good guy who saves the day and the big show of the Jack Black esquire as performance by Justin Urich. He was just divine in this movie. This man deserves a great star. Also, Aimee Brooks was well into the movie as well as the girl in danger along with the guys of a killer reminiscent of Jeepers Creepers. The gore was given in large quantities and I loved it. I just hope they release a non-rated version. Great Low-Budget Horror Comedy. The dead cat in the hotel sex scene is just funny funny! ***** from *****
