Surface, from the day his teaser only showed in the summer of 2005, was a tossup. On the one hand, it was so high concept and plot driven that it seemed to the predecessor that it would work out better than a movie (or more). In addition, it felt it was NBC's attempt at a "Lost-killer". On the other hand, one can realize that the story was too expansive to tell in a movie or two, and fans of Lost were intrigued. <br /> <br /> So, after one (and possibly only) season on NBC, the show is on an indefinite hiatus that can put it in the safe, on Sci-fi, or in the summer or fall of 2007 or then fill a gap in NBC's series. His ratings were of the better on the network (which doesn't say much), but the show was taken off the air without any real official announcement of the future. <br /> <br /> So, is it worth it? Yes. <br /> <br /> The surface follows a continuous story format, driven by plot with no-fill episodes. Almost everything that happens at the show is important to the plot, much like a movie. No fill episodes, which have put a pain in your side if you missed an episode. Yet the show's double edge helped it; Big things seem to happen every episode, but as it feels like a movie, you end every episode, feel like a little bit and you want more! However, that feature of the show shows how great it is. The throw is solid; The three main leaders, including the beautiful Lake Bell as Laura Daughtery, made every episode a solid show. Everyone has their own reasons for finding / studying the creatures. The supporting role, including Ian Anthony Dale and the short show by Rade Serbedzija, fill in the throw. The story is slow to start (one regret, it doesn't really take up to 3-4 episodes in the short 15-episode season), but the latter half of the season makes it right. The visual effects are amazing (the jaw will fall if you see an overhead view of one of the creations' attacks a ship). <br /> <br /> Much of the show's problems can be rectified by purchasing the finish first season and don't have to wait a week (or three) to watch the next episode. <br /> <br /> In short, if you missed the first season and you're curious, go back and watch it. It's not Twin Peaks in terms of flawlessness, but its high concept puts it in the league with Lost, and other similar shows, with a flair for action and adventure. Enjoy it.
