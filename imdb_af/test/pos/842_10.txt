The third film in a cycle of incomparably brilliant exploitation movies, and the third masterpiece in a row, "Joshuu Sasori: Kemono-beya" aka. "Female Prisoner Scorpio: Beast Stable" (aka. "Sasori: Den Of The Beast" where I live) from 1973 is a movie that differs from some of its predecessors, but it compares them (or will probably even surpass them) in brilliance. The whole original Sasori series featuring the wonderful Meiko Kaji stands out as the absolute highlight in the WIP theater, and all the movies, especially the first three, combine exploitation and home cinema uniquely, like no other movie. "Beast Stable" is the third and second to the last "Sasori" movie with Meiko Kaji, the last one directed by genius director Shunya Ito and, in my opinion, the biggest of them all. The first film "Joshuu 701 Gô: Sasori" of 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of Exploitation cinema and merely the Definition of Exploitation Art. In the equally brilliant first successor, "Joshuu Sasori: Dai-41 zakkyo-bô" Ito added more surrealism and symbolism. The third "Sasori" movie, "Beast Stable", holds surrealism (though not quite the same as the second) and has even more social criticism than its predecessors. Topics such as poverty, forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central themes of the film. <br /> <br /> This third Sasori movie is engineer and sublime in all respects and probably the largest of the overall brilliant cycle (to me this is the one, with the first one being a close second). Again, "Best Stable" is both very artistic and very exploitative. The visually impressive film again has an enormous amount of brutal violence and sleaze, as well as series of enormous surreal beauty. The beautifully beautiful Meiko Kaji is again brilliant in her role of Nami Matsushima (aka. Sasori). I absolutely adore this wonderful actress, and I'm sure I'm not the only one to do it. The rest of the performances are also great, especially Mikio Narita is wonderful as an inspector of the police who is catching Sasori. The musical score is the same in all three films, with "Urami-Bushi", which was sung by Meiko Kaji himself. It's a big theme, as the point is simple, pure perfection. As its predecessors, "Beast Stable" is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of Exploitation-Art that cannot afford a serious movie lover to miss. The entire Sasori cycle varies greatly on my personal overall favorite list. "Beast Stable" is probably the most brilliant masterpiece of them all! 10/10
