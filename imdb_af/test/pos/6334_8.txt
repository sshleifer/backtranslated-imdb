It's a good episode, but it's not my favorite. Many people love it and creatively brilliant. Most of the episodes have no dialogue, which is such a cool idea and Hush really does handle the silence. Plus, this episode introduces Tara, which I love. But I don't like Riely or the Initial or Maggie Walsh, and they look very much like "Hush." In addition, I don't think the Lord is so scary and I get tired of watching the raft to Sunnydale. I know I'm in the minority, but I tend to progress to parts of "Hush". Of course there are other parts of the episode that I think are great, so if you watch DVD, I recommend seeing this episode. It's really a classic. <br /> <br /> "Hush" revolves around the town, losing their voices. Skeletal search demon guys called the Lord come to collect seven hearts of human victims, but if they scream, they die. So they steal the voices of everyone in town. Buffy and the Scoobies are trying to figure out what's going on, while the Initiative is also investigating. Meanwhile, Xander comes to realize how much Anya means to him and Willow meets a fellow witch named Tara. Buffy and Riely eventually come face to face while fighting the Lord. They are both amazed at what they are learning ... He is a commando and she is the Slayer. In the end, Buffy gets up on the day, but now she has to deal with her new knowledge of Riely's secret life. <br /> <br /> The creativity of "Hush" can't really be seen in a basic outline of his plot. It's the overwhelming silence of the episode that makes it so good. The characters try to communicate in different ways, (White plates, pantomime, obscene finger gestures, etc.) And it just works really well. After a while you forget that there is no dialogue because they are all so good at expressing themselves. During the "talking" parts of the episode, there are many references to the importance of really "hearing" one another. Anyone claims that Xander won't really talk to her. Giles ignores Spike and Xander's protests and insists Spike moves into Xander's apartment. Buffy quickly replaces the word "petroleum" for "patrolling" when she talks to Riely so she doesn't have to explain her calling. And then, when Buffy and Riely really learn the truth about each other, they sit there with nothing to say. It's pretty cool. <br /> <br /> There are many good parts for this episode. I love that people forget that they can't talk. Buffy and Xander are trying to use the phone. Riley can't use the voice recognition thing in the Initatives lift. People are trying to shout. It's basically what everyone really would do if they had no speech at all. And I think it's scary that Spike should move with Xander. (They will also be sharing for a while in the season.) Xander and Spike have a fun little kid who is just hilaries. I also like the beginning of Tara and Willow's relationship. Tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and Willow are nice together. It's nice to just start them. <br /> <br /> I don't understand how gentlemen choose their victims. They just seem to drive dorms and choose random people. Also, I don't like Riely. I have never loved him, but from "Hush" I just wait for Angel to come back to town and beat him. Finally, what happens to Olivia hereafter? It looks like we just met her, she and Giles have a relationship, everything is going well ... and then she's suddenly dropped. I don't get it. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the episode: Giles "" Who is the Lord? "Reading to the Scoobies. The whole scene is wonderful and its overhead is just hilarious. He makes similar flashcards in season seven's" First Date. "Pleasant every time Giles starts drawing monsters, it just gets nice.
