This movie is just one of the best movies I have to own. It took me years to come to this movie and it was worth it. The film is meant to be anti-drug propaganda, but it turns out to be the opposite while it's not even halfway through the movie. The delighted look on the faces of the players, as they receive their abundance of drugs, is pleasing to all who observe. To the final stage of their drug-induced lives, heroin occurs. Yikes! This is the anti-drug message that has been so wonderfully sought after. The soundtrack for this movie kicks! It's by far one of Pink Floyd's best albums ever! If ever the chance, watch, listen and moment to see a spectacular movie.
