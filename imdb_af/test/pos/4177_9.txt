Chief had to be a proud moment, not just for his stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or his director / co-author (Bob Rafelson), but also his fellow co-author Jack Nicholson. As it turns out, most of them seem to be over, and for outsiders the movie is best considered a cricket. <br /> <br /> While the TV series was famous for the Beatles' fiancee! "This film is also judged by the same agreement. Far away from the trite and painfully overwhelmed by Beatles movies, and even the dated Monkees TV series, Head has a low depth. An undercurrent of the darker nature of man is here at work, and while it may be a bizarre thing to say about a manufactured pop band, the use of certain themes and images (hitting women, laughing at lame and real footage shot from a Vietcong POW shot at a point space) gives the film an edge that won't dare to hit many 'serious' movies. <br /> <br /> There are also fun moments, ranging from James Bond, Big Victor 'and my personal favorite, Mickey Dolenz, to horse riding by Arab soldiers. (One of them turns to Mickey and picks up 'pssst!', Just for the 'pssst!' To appear in subtitles!) The group is aware of their crafted image in the movie ('I'm the dummy, Mickey ?? I'm always the dummy, "says Tork, who summarizes his one-dimensional fiddle role of the series, meaning their characters ?? they play 'acting' acting and non-acting here? is opened, and therefore less generous and annoying than they were in the series. This level of parody and self-awareness even takes their fab-four origin, with more subtle Maharishi and out-and-out acknowledgments with a waitress who asks, "Well, if not God's gift to the eight-year-olds?" Do you still pay tribute to Ringo Starr? 'Also listen to Tork flute' Strawberry fields forever 'while in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Of course there are the songs. Six of them here, slightly more psychedelic than usual, who might have alienated their fanbase, and even a Frank Zappa cameo, would not have turned on an adult audience for their charm at this stage. Probably the best is the beautiful 'As We Go Along', although the first, a Carol King pen 'Porpoise Song', interestingly talks about the desire to live while time is relentlessly ticking and still approaching death. On a lighter note, it seems to be a nose of "the porpoise", a direct microphone of "I'm the Walrus". <br /> <br /> Constantly inventive with direct references to silent film and drug culture, perhaps, Head's best feature is his narrative structure. Not the only one? but most importantly ?? reason why it improves with multiple views, the story goes left, right, forward, backward, circular and through various levels of reality. Essentially, a series of sketches loosely hangs together, the cohesion is enhanced by the space-time debugging plot that puts its internal logic together through flashback, dream series, jail sentence and remote control channel change. <br /> <With a perfect start and end, this intelligence-written, well-known film was not what The Monkees' pre-teenage audience expected and had a negative critical reception. Now the expectations have gone, this one has a serious need for serious reconsideration.
