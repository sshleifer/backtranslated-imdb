I watched Linda and this is a Top Rate Movie! The lives of Paul and his wife, Linda, whom he adored and eventually married. They meet another married couple, Jeff and Stella, and the four are very good friends. But their friendship takes a turn after the holiday at Varona Beach .... A twist that never returns married couples to their previous friends status. <br /> <br /> Linda is a must-see !!! ! Virginia Madsen's actions are acceptable; Richard Thomas, however, steals the movie with his incredible acting ... and the emotions he shows. <br /> <br /> A Wonderful Movie! "Lotta Honey"
