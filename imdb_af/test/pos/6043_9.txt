Misfit recruits private Owens tests drill instructor Sgt Moore (Jack Webb) skills. No explosions or bloodshed or hip soundtrack or sex. It is at the USMC's Parris Island S.C. camp, and most of the role-players were real Marines. Memorable one-liners are abundant, and the closing credit's "dedicated to ..." is intense. With such strong male and female characters, this movie cannot be made in today's sensitive world.
