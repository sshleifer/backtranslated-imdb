I feel this movie differs from so many others because it shows a family girls who actually care about each other. They may have mistakes, but bitterness and pit-downs have no place with these girls. Try to find it on TV or in the ordinary movies. It's a fresh air to see how girls are female - wear beautiful, feminine dresses and shoes. Contrast this with the clothes in stores today, ie ragged and faded jeans and jackets, etc. The story line has an evil thread running through, but it makes it more realistic and interesting. I know it's animated, but it still gives you a feeling that families can stay together and get out. I would recommend this movie for boys and girls.
