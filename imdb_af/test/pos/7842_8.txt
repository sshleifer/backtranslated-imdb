Here you see Mr. Eastwood in all its glory (ie at the top of its form as an actor and at the height of its physical appeal), but the "ladies" portrayed are hardly typical of the South, then or now. The young girls at the boarding school are incredibly naive, some showing signs of the development of really depraved women, and Geraldine Page, who is full of corruption, represents more or less the average when it comes to girls' school principals, or then . (It's not to say that there aren't any bad apples in any barrel someday.) Eastwood said it was one of his own favorite movies. <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled" has an original plot, very attractive characters and lots of surprises in the shop for the viewer. It's really annoying and entertaining, but not really realistic. (I know I grew up in the South and attended a girls' school and school. I also met countless girls who did the same, not to mention their retired teachers, or even "suppressed professors" says "far from the main figure depicted here." She is straight in her portrayal of a Southern gentle woman who doesn't look exactly what she looks like. <br /> <br /> This movie was a little shameful when it first appears and is still, I think, but you will not be sorry, you spent your time watching it.
