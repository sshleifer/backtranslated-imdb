Do you like explosions? What about battles? Well, this movie is both. You know the other thing that you can't have a movie for: a Skopassel motorcycle, the type that repels someone's head and simultaneously emits them. You bet the Stabilizer has one. There is even a classic wreath scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'm quite proud that I've even seen this movie ... and even more to be my review is the first one ... YES!
