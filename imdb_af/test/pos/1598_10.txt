His music, especially what we hear from it, is very slow. From around the time of Bach's death, composers made ways to progress the music at a slower and slower pace: in a century later, Wagner and Mahler wrote pieces that are as low as possible to get music. Of course, one can cheat by writing a 4/4 March and then specifying a rate of, say semiquaver = 1, but the rate will not be the right rate. Wagner and Mahler wrote music really played in a snail's pace. Given that the inertia in no sense sounds too slow "snail speed" is the wrong expression. A critic wrote of a well-known Wagner conductor: "He doesn't beat time, he beats eternity." For everything I know, it was a compliment. <br /> <br /> I have the feeling that directors worked out around the early 1970s how to make the slowest possible movies: there is "Death in Venice" and there is "Solyaris". I prefer the former. For one thing, "Solyaris" steps across the line, or a line, and becomes soporific; Death in Venice is from beginning to end. Not much happens, but it all happens in the right order, in the right fit, with photography you can get lost. <br /> <br /> Another way to cheat with music is to write something that I don't have at all. Such music sounds slow, but is actually just unmusical, just as many movies feel slow because they don't have rhythm and form. Death in Venice is not one of them. Beautiful in all respects, it will remind you of the timelessness and quality of quality. You don't need any theoretical knowledge to respond to Visconti's mastery, as you do to respond to a lesser director's incompetence. It's a good job.
