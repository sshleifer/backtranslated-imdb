I watched many short films in my day. Often I don't find it too compressible (too much information is given to the viewer in the short time they have to run), "artsy" or a clear vision. I can't say anything about Starcrossed. In this review I will do my best to avoid any dramatic spoilage, but I will also accept that the reader understands that the theme of this movie is brotherly incest. <br /> <br /> As with any short movie, The story is pretty simple, straightforward and easy to digest. Clearly, the film seeks to shine a light one of the most modern society's most complicated taboos. This movie succeeds in every way. In the fifteen minutes of running I felt like feeling a spectrum of emotions. With just a small dialogue, the viewer is quickly drawn into the most personal moments and thoughts of these star-crossed brothers. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning in their early childhood one can see the close relationship the brothers have. As the film progresses to the present day in the next scene, the excellent acting and honest, sincere performances remind the viewer that love can come in the most unexpected and hard way. As the relationship progresses, any dislike that the viewer initially feels can be quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress, as the viewer suddenly realizes that there can be only one possible resolution. And the aftermath of that resolution is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Anyone with an open mind will do well to see this movie and absorb its message. If it is nothing else, it challenges the boldness and honesty of the viewer to investigate some of our deepest beliefs on the civilized and mysterious taboo of incest. Although the movie is only fifteen minutes long, it resonates in the viewer long after the credit roll. It may be my favorite short film I've ever seen. I can't recommend it highly enough.
