039: Anna Christie (1930) - released 2/21/1930; seen 3/10/06 <br /> <br /> On October 24, 1929: Black Thursday, the stock market collapses. Now the country and indeed the world will look to Hollywood for escape from the global Great Depression. <br /> <br /> BIRTH: Anne Frank, June Carter, Yasser Arafat, Bob Newhart, Barbara Walters, Doris Roberts, Ed Asner, Dick Clark, Roy E. Disney, Gene Hackman. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Finally, our Odyssey seriously goes back with Greta Garbo's first sound film, a simple character study called Anna Christie. An excellent view of me. Garbo, who showed straight from the bat that her talents could be transferred from the silent era (I wanted to see her quiet work, but Netflix didn't seem to be solid. One thing I noticed over and over was how the Swedish accent sounds, like replacing the letter J with a Y-sound, Anna ends the only character I liked, I didn't really care for her estranged father or her allegedly. systems get better (no one leans to talk in the riddle) but the camera is still moving KEVIN: Our first film of the 1930s is the first sound movie of silent asterisk Greta Garbo, Anna Christie, a very simple movie , with just about five different places where we run long streets of the movie's 89 minutes, often with a static camera, it was great to see Marie Dressler also in sound, and quite hilarious as we hear, is an endless chain of sad but unashamed slurry t enjoy much of Garbo's performance as she maintains the movie through even the most winding moments. I didn't really like George Marion or Charles Bickford, maybe because I wasn't one of them, so I was relieved and excited when Anna finally stood up and showed herself that she was not her estranged father or her muscular Irish boyfriend. It is also nice to see that the famous silent screenwriter Frances Marion did not miss a step from silence to sound. <br /> <br /> Last movie watched: Speedy (1928). Last film chronologically: The Love Parade (1929). Next film: The Blue Angel (1930).
