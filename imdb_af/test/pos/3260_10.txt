Many years ago I saw this movie (maybe on television?) And loved it. So I decided to rent it on DVD, to see if it was still in my estimation. It did. <br /> <br /> In Sydney's infamous King's Cross district (where prostitution, drug abuse and sex shops flourish), it tells the story of "Jimmy" (played by Heath Ledger). Jimmy is a young man ... maybe late teens or that, who didn't have a stable family background. He is on the verge of society, and works as a tout for a sex club (encouraging people to enter the store). He is aware of an underworld figure called "Pando", which is a local greatness in the Cross. It is Jimmy's hope that he will get himself on Pando's radar and come in with him ... a short cut for upward social mobility, he hopes. <br /> <br /> One night Jimmy meets the beautiful young woman Alex (played by the beautiful Rose Byrne). You only know that a love story will play between them. That night, Jimmy was first contacted by Pando (played by Bryan Brown). Pando has a 'work' for Jimmy. This is the 'foot in the door' after which Jimmy waited! <br /> <br /> Too much publicity will spoil the surprises that this movie has in store for the viewer. Stylistically, if you like Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie movies, you should fit in with what to expect ... turn and turn and black comedy. <br /> <br /> What's so nice about this movie is its a lot of Australianness. It's not just a beat of Tarantino or Ritchie, but a real Australian contribution to the genre. <br /> <br /> A fascinating aspect of this movie is how it all goes along. Sometimes you are introduced to characters you wonder how hell does them there. In the end, all these 'loose ends' are beautifully bound. It's like a celluloid Moebius strip. <br /> <br /> A highlight of the movie is Bryan Brown's character from Pando. Pando loves puzzles, and it's fun to see him playing with his cronies. From the Heath Ledger movies I saw (The Dark Knight, 10 Things I Hate About You), the little details revealed about him are so nice ... its taste in music, to get started! <br /> <br /> this may be his best role. Not taken with "10 things". If you're a Heath Ledger fan (Ledger recently died a tragic accidental death), it's a chance to see him in his biggest Australian role, I think. There is great chemistry between Ledger and Byrne in this movie, so on one level it functions as a lovely love story. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have the horror of Tarantino and Ritchie underworld movies, but it does have adult themes ... scenes that surprise you with their coldness and beauty. In this respect, it's not an ideal movie for many young viewers, but it's not a movie that gorehounds get excited about. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to say that it's great that Australia can make good movies. Usually the kind of movies that make my own country can be uniniviting. This movie has strong points where many Australian movies have weaknesses ... i. It has a wonderful story, great acting and good writing. We have more popular, quality films like these that have to be made here in Australia. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. Other Australian movies I loved loved include: <br /> <br /> Breaker Morant (10/10) Mad Max 2 (10/10) My Brilliant Career (Not yet reviewed by me) Proof (No) The Devil's Playground nr) The Year My Voice Broke (no) Bad Boy Bubby (no. A big, dark comedy) The Dish (no. A Great, charming comedy)
