I slowly collected the films on DVD from both Catherine Deneuve and Francois Truffaut. Both actress and director did stinkers in their time - fortunately the Mississipi mermaid is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Next to "The Soft Skin", by chance, Deneuve's sister (late Francoise Dorleac) has to be my favorite Truffaut movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing, Truffaut also wrote the script. Something that always strikes me over Truffaut is his almost childlike innocence when he presents a story - one can hardly call it. <br /> <br /> There is a scene at the end of the movie where Belmondo returns to the Lyon apartment. with the remains of the booty. He calls the doorbell and Deneuve answers a negligent. In the time it takes Belmondo to get their room out of the street, Deneuve changes into her dress, puts on her best pair of socks and shoes, then lies on the bed and pretends to fall asleep. It's a scene that can almost come from a child's mind - but it's Truffaut for you. <br /> <br /> Watching Catherine Deneuve in her late 60's movies, is indeed a sensory pleasure. She is so extraordinarily beautiful, it is almost painful for us to look. By the way, for the fans, there are some topless scenes of her in this movie - indeed a sinful pleasure. <br /> <br /> I disagree with previous posters. I don't see anything 'Hitchcockian' about the movie. Regarding the look of it - I like the appearance of the older movie stock used in the 60s. It certainly gives films of this period a unique look. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for both Deneuve and Truffaut fans ......
