To see this hilariously retro, yet very entertaining career girl story, I was buried by Joan Crawford's first appearance. All I could think of was, "My God, it's the same face as Michael Jackson in his notorious discussion photo!" <br /> <br /> About 34 minutes into the movie, Diane Baker and Hope Lange come from a taxi in Greenwich Village. As they walk in the street, you can see part of a sign behind them for the Stonewall Bar - scene of the epochal "riots" considered the trigger for the modern gay rights movement. <br /> <br /> Talking of Baker and taxis, I had to laugh when she came in and tell the cabbie, "56th and Sutton Place, please - and be careful of the bumps." Can you suggest the response of a Manhattan manager today? Of course she says this because she is pregnant and does not want to hurt the fetus. But it doesn't stop her from jumping out of a moving car if she finds out Bob Evans wants her to have an abortion! Well, they had to find a way to lose the baby (1959 and all). <br /> <br /> Sue Carson is lovely like Mary Agnes. Why was this her only movie? There is no biographical information about her in IMDb.
