Lifeforce (1985) was a canon funded movie directed by Tobe Hooper. This is a very interesting film that deals with some space vampires that were accidentally brought back to Earth during the latest space mission. Steve Railsback stars as the only survivor of the tragedy. But really the film is a mere representation of the natural beauty of Mathilda May. She is one smoke hot number. The director was a great fan of Female Vampire (ie Erotikill). May May recreate Lina Romay's title role The film is beautifully photographed and targeted. There are many gore effects to keep genres friends happy. <br /> <br /> I need to give this movie a very high rating. Tobe Hooper was the man. During this period he made three interesting films for cannon (Texas Chainsaw Massacre II and Invaders from Mars). If you like science fiction / horror movies, Tobe Hooper movies, or Mathilda May, this movie just got on you. <br /> <br /> Highest recommendation! <br /> <br /> Did I mention Mathilda May is hot?
