This is the latest Ghibli movie and it is also a BIG departure from the studio's established style. First, this movie was apparently aimed at young children, much more so than any of their previous films. It lacks the depth of the other movies and features a brand new, less realistic style of animation? and yet it is ever so entertaining. Although there is nothing to attract adults, I still drew myself on the screen and fully immersed in the story. The film's secret is brutal honesty with regard to the plot and the characters. The story and the characters are very upfront with their feelings / intentions etc. But it makes them more and more encouraging. Special attention has also been paid to the soundtrack which is absolutely wonderful, despite the fact that it is different from previous Ghibli soundtracks. I find all the cute theme song all the time, and everyone who watches this movie!
