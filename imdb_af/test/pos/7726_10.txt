Even for the non-opera loving public, the name CARMEN is immediately recognized as an opera by Bizet about a gypsy girl whose erratic love destroys men. But as much as the opera is now considered a staple in every opera house repertoire, the actual story of the wild gypsy lass created by Prosper Mérimée in 1845 has never been as good as in this movie version by the abundant gifted Spanish director Vicente Aranda ( 'Juana la Loca AKA Mad Love', 'Amantes', 'If they told you I fell', etc.). Creating the author of the novel as the main character seeks Carmen's story of one of her lovers - José - just outlines the story of this famous gypsy wild lady to tell. <br /> <br /> Carmen (the incredibly beautiful and talented Paz Vega) works in a cigar factory in Seville, a factory adjacent to the military station where real José (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is stationed. Carmen is attacked by a co-worker who is in a gypsy, Carmen murdered the co-worker and was arrested. José is physically attracted to the affluent Carmen and when Carmen thrives with him, he agrees to escape. His repayment is the promise of a night of passion with Carmen. Carmen holds her and gives José his first sexual encounter, and José is doomed. His lack of military discipline causes him to lose his rank and be detained for a while, but José again meets with Carmen, a fellow officer, and fear goes down to the hills with the smugglers and gypsies, Carmen's people. . Many incidents take place to try the passionate bond between the lovers, but if Carmen's real man is released from prison, destructive behavior takes over. Behavioral change includes Carmen's promise and relationship with a bullfighter and the passion of Carmen and José comes to a tragic end. <br /> <br /> One factor that makes the story (as adapted for the screen by director Aranda and Joaquim Jordà moving so well is the role that Prosper Mérimée (Jay Benedict) plays: his question about José completes the story that The play is excellent, the movie by Paco Femenia and the excellent musical score by José Nieto greatly contribute to the success of this very fine film, which is a must for opera Carmen lovers. A wonderful action drama for those viewers who admire historical pieces, highly recommended.
