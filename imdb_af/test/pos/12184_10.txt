I have to say this movie is absolutely wonderful. I don't understand why it's so low. It has romance, music, darkness and vampires. Stuart Townsend also had a good job of being Lestat, the acting was great. Also, usually I'm not in that music, sometimes. But I have to say in this movie that the music fits it perfectly. If you like dark videos about vampires, it's definitely for you or even if you're not there, there's a love story. But all I can say is one word: Amazing! My rating is challenging: 10 out of 10. Anyway, I'm serious about it before you look at it. I remember not seeing it for years, I looked at it again about a year ago and I'm addicted to it again. lol. Great movie !!!
