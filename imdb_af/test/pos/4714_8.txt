I got this movie on TV. I haven't heard it yet and almost changed the channel, but it promptly encouraged me. <br /> <br /> The story of the Burmese people's battle against a military dictatorship was tempting. The level of brutality that some are willing to use to keep power is hard to believe. It makes me grateful to live in a country where the government probably won't shoot people in the streets. <br /> <br /> The story of Laura Bowman was a good thread to keep the story of political struggle together.
