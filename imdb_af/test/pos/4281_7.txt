I really love this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has something to blame, everyone is real. No cardboard heroes or cold, almighty, know-all characters. <br /> <br /> I read many other viewers complaining about Anne morality and about James wanting to maintain her love for her despite her fraud on him, but I disagree. <br /> <br /> I found Anne (Emily Watson) absolutely wonderful and I loved her. <br /> <br /> She was a heavily repressed woman, her actions were not planned: as soon as she broke loose, she was confused and made many mistakes. But so it is in real life, if you get freedom, you will probably make mistakes (especially at the starting point). Was she a little too ungrateful? Can be. But we must remember that she was running for the first time with her feet. She knows James is a good man, maybe a little too stiff, serious and work-centered; but she also feels the urge to live life as herself. <br /> <br /> Is she more than his fault? I think no. <br /> <br /> But the turn that happens in their lives brings some changes. <br /> <br /> James instead of letting his wife go out of his life (as other viewers suggested as the right choice) bites the bullet and waits and hopes for the better. He began to understand that what he was superficial (his marriage) was in fact a control game he played on his wife. <br /> <br /> It's not a story with characters about emotional and uncertainty. (ie the usual clich√® Latin American or Italian jealous guys), it is a story of men and women using heart and brain. <br /> <br /> It can be very painful, but if you really love a person (women or man) and if you are not a very unstable nature, you will probably forgive his / her fraud and let him / her go. Unless you are a jealous, prehistoric, crime-of-passionate, possessive and mentally unstable individual. <br /> <br /> A very good movie. The last scene, when James, in spite of all the things that happened before, really moves with Anne to the train station: She is free and He understands what freedom means to man. <br /> <br /> Guido
