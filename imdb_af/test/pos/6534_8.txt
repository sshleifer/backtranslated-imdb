Although I am slightly older than the recommended age group, I really enjoyed this movie. It's a little break out of reality and it must be that every little girl dreams of becoming friends with a pop star. I know it was mine, to be sure! The first 10 minutes were really cheesy and the average girls said a few things that were also slightly cheesy. Once you get there, you can really enjoy it. I loved the relationship between JD and Jane. It was really sweet and you could see how much they were closing each other. The soundtrack is perfect and it really fits well into the movie. I also liked the family that was Jane, her sisters were nice. Very well made movie.
