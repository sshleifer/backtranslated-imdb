I first watched the Istanbul Film Festival in 1994. It was so good that I took some friends with me and saw it the same week. The characters play very well and the humor here and there is wonderful. It's definitely a very powerful gay movie. Some scenes make you feel like watching an episode of friends with much more sophisticated lines. I think I put it in my video recorder and watch it tonight ...
