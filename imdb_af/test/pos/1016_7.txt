Distributor: GOODTIMES home video <br /> <br /> Plot: A fun high school student is marked for indifferent terror in this thrill filled TV movie. Gail Osborne is new to the town. She makes friends, has a boyfriend and everything looks like her. This is until she gets an ominous and frightening call while sitting with children. After more and more calls she is raped. During most of the movie she tried to prove that the person had raped her. <br /> <br /> Audio / Video: This 1987 VHS edition of Goodtimes stinks. There are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen. <br /> <br /> Extras: No extras from Goodtimes home video. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: This tension filled for TV movie was made in 1978, so don't expect many deaths (there are none). If you can find this movie with the Worldvision home video logo in front, buy it. But the Goodtimes version is pretty crappy. It can be a bit boring, but if you are patient, the end is pretty good.
