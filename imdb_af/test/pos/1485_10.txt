The 1990s were a great decade for British sitcom with many popular creations like ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVES, ABSOLUTE FABOULOUS THE THIN BLUE LINE, THE BRITTAS EMPIRE and PEOPLE arriving on TV screens for the first time. <br /> <br /> But, MR. BEAN is, hands off, the biggest sitcom of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> MR. BEAN represents the first major attempt at a blow to the era of silent greats such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton for several decades. This gives the audience a single character - Mr. Bean - is perfectly played by Rowan Atkinson. <br /> <br /> Many people who commented on this page, as well as on the message boards on this and other sites, got busy. In debates about whether Mr. Bean has a mental disability or not, he has considerable learning disabilities due to such a disability. However, I believe this debate is unnecessary because I very much doubt that the creators of this show were expecting anyone in the audience for a moment to m. Bean even consider in such a context. <br /> <br /> Mr. Beanie is shown to be a very little character, rarely speaking and choosing to solve problems on his own without the guidance of others. Some of his methods of checking daily tasks, such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist, are approached in a bizarre way to look at anyone at the show. That's where the humor comes from. Mr. Bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he may just be an eccentric who is used to things that are his own way. And of course, some of his methods to complete a single task often lead to a disaster, which we then see, Bean is trying to solve. <br /> <br /> Sometimes we see Mr. Bean, a medium or small streak, often tries with those to compete or play pranks on those who least expect. But at the end of the day there is no real damage and outcomes are always reassuring. <br /> <br /> Unlike most examples of British comedy in the past 30 years, MR. BEAN is simple, inexorable, harmless U-rated entertainment that is suitable for everyone in the family to enjoy. That's why the TV series has become a big hit in dozens of countries around the world. This is also why it will be remembered for many years when many other TV shows will be over. <br /> <br /> Some critics claim that the show only appeals to children, but I laugh at Mr. Bean's killers like me when I saw the episodes as a child in the 1990s. Rowan Atkinson used his natural ability to create effective visual gags that look just as funny on repeated views as they did for the first time. <br /> <br /> So far, the TV series has two spin-off films, BEAN and MNR. HOLIDAY HOLIDAY. As is known by the type of humor shown in the TV series, it will not be translated to big-screen success. The two movies do little on the TV series and fail to catch the magic of the episodes. The biggest failure in both movies may be in the change of setting. In both movies, the producers Bean from his normal British environment to America (the first movie) and France (the second movie). As a result, the movie characters around Mr Bean respond differently to his behavior than their TV series counterparts. Both movies use gags from the TV series, and the evidence shows that the gags were done right the first time. In the second film, Mr. Bean showed that he is out-of-character with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem stupid rather than funny. At different times, I thought myself the character I saw was not. Bean wasn't, but a pale caricature. It is clear that Rowan Atkinson did not enjoy himself as much as he did in the TV series. His heart just wasn't in the show. After the second movie came out, he publicly said he would not be back again. Bean doesn't play. I realize how he felt. <br /> <br /> Back to the TV show, each episode shows evidence of meticulous planning in terms of writing and performance in every single scene. Even the worst episode is still very enjoyable and good for the two movies. <br /> <br /> My favorite episodes are the first three - it sets the high standard that continues. I consider the final episode to be the worst but still hilarious. <br /> <br /> To summarize, MR. BEAN is a wonderful sitcom suitable for the whole family. Rowan Atkinson is a true comic genius and the evidence is in the 14 episodes of this TV series. My recommendation - look and enjoy. But just watch the movies if you consider yourself a hard fan if you've seen the TV show.
