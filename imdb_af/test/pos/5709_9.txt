Four lovely young nurses in their previous year of nursing school experienced all kinds of turmoil and excitement in their lives: Sweet Susan (winning brunette Elaine Giftos) is trying to comfort the bitter, terminally ill Greg (a moving display of Darrell Larson), eagerly, but the neurotic Phred (beautiful blonde Karen Carlson), romance, the spectacular gynecologist Jim Caspar (dearest Lawrence Casey), the generous hippie Priscilla (the incredibly beautiful Barbara Leigh) are fertilized by the drug dealer Les (the solid Richard Rust) and compassionate Lynn (Beautifully played by Brioni Farrell) helps out the Angry Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie (the excellent Reni Santoni). Despite the fact that this film is made for Roger Corman's legendary New World Pictures swap, it's all but your standard mindless piece of soft core schlock learning. Instead, it is a very pleasant, charming and even often thoughtful time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the early 70s (the subplot that Lynn and the revolutionary are particularly strong and challenging). Special kudos are in order for director Stephanie Rothman, who brings a welcome and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity to the material. In addition, the four attractive and attractive women lead everything into good and laudable work. Scottie MacGregor also impressed as a wise supervisor. Mrs. Boswell and ubiquitous 70-year-old voter Ronald Gans provide the official voice of a psychiatrist. Stevan Larner's sophisticated cinematography, the fantastic soundtrack, and the tasteful full-color score of Clancy B. Grass III are all speeding up. A real sleeper.
