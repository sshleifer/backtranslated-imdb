It's interesting to see what people think of this movie, because it's actually very unique (though it contains some of Clive Barker's trademarks). Although it may seem a bit cynical to say this, the movie is just complicated enough to cover, and lay down, those who need standard Hollywood flags, so if you're expected to be fed, you'll have a normal monster flip see with lots of monsters and an uneven plot. <br /> <br /> Those who require a linear, specific and unobstructed plot line will hate this movie, because the story, as in the novella, is partly between the lines, or in this case, partially off the screen, in comments and imagination. <br /> <br /> Another possible suspension is the end, which I can say without spoiling it, that it is not quite good and not quite bad. It is not much defined at all. I know that some people send out in wild tantrums that they could not know what happened, but for me and for many others I am sure, just add another by dimension to the story - the dimension of speculation, and in addition The point is that great disruption tends to cause wrinkles that are quite far away. <br /> <br /> There is definitely morale here, but of a slightly different kind to the standard Hollywood-in-your-face-on-the-end-of-the-movie type display. The summary of morals is simple, though not quite simple; prejudice and human inclination to hate the different. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, though, as many of the reviewers have noted, the expressions of the actors (with the exception of David Cronenberg, which is a wonderful look) are quite tough. I'm not sure they are completely blamed for their strange appearance and lack of depth, as it is common problem with converting literature to the script. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good movie, provided you don't expect it to be a standard horror movie.
