While watching this movie recently, I always had to remember that it was made in 1957 .......... and in the USSR! This makes it all the more remarkable. Much of the cinematographic effects in the movie look clicked in 2002, but they were pretty original in 1957. I only saw this movie in 1963, when it was first released in the US, and then I hit its originality. Now, just 40 years later, I have no reason to change my mind.
