I found this movie on one of my old videos, "Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster" (which should immediately give you an idea of ​​the show) and I didn't see it, so I decided to see it . I didn't remember much about Rainbow Brite, except that I was the cartoon and that it was cute. Most people feel about her. You probably do. <br /> <br /> Well, when the movie started, I wondered if it was the right one! It didn't fit the shape of Rainbow Brite as I remembered her. But it seems she is kicking! It must be the weirdest animated movie! I can't believe these characters were so popular (the series is not much different) while it is so bizzare. As soon as I watched this movie again, it became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> I really don't want to give away too much. Just know if you see the movie in the video store, rent it and watch it. No questions asked. You'll get a kick out of it. Especially the outrageous Princess character. And the robotic horse. And the hypnotized sprites. <br /> <br /> If you can't know, it's an 80's cartoon that is truly an undiscovered "head" movie in disguise! Have fun!
