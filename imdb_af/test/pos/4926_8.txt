I love this movie ... it can make me laugh! = ^ _ ^ = What is kinda hard to do. This movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations ever. It doesn't make the characters like other movies out there. Everyone is in character and has a role to play! <br /> <br /> The movie focuses around Buster and Babs after a flood down to a flood (thanks to Buster), running Plucky on a journey with Hamton (hilarious stuff), Elmyra to Torture (as usual), Fifi follows her for a signature, and Shirley and Fowlmouth go to the movie. <br /> <br /> In my own personal opinion, I didn't like the Buster and Babs segments so much, though they had some notable dialogue and jokes. I have to say the Plucky and Hampton 'Vacation' parts were the best! Hamton's family is HILARIEUS! I especially like Uncle Stinky. Fifi in the hotel was also hilarious. I love the actor came during this scene. : D <br /> <br /> Probably the best known part in this movie, again IMHO, is when Fowlmouth and Shirley are in the movie ... LOL! You have to see it to appreciate it! And when Hamton and Plucky go through the tunnel to make a wish ... :) <br /> <br /> Although this movie is moving slowly during the Buster / Babs parts, the rest is pure gold! I rate this movie 8/10. One day show it to your kids ... or even adults themselves - watch this movie! You won't regret it.
