After the main movie of the opera is killed in a car accident, her young boy, Betty, is brought to the forefront. It is very happy for her, with one problem: she has an admirer who has decided to kill all her friends and make her watch. What is his connection with the opera, and what is his fascination with Betty? <br /> <br /> I love Dario Argento with every part of my body. And I'm not an orthodox fan, I think. Many people, especially critics, praise his previous work ("Suspiria" and "Deep Red"), but really frown on later movies, like "Sleepless", which I liked. My favorite, "Phenomena", is usually much underestimated. "Opera" tends to fall somewhere in between. Some see it as one of its last big movies, others see it as part of its so-called decline. I loved it. <br /> <br /> The picture is sharp, the music is great (unlike other critics, I like the metal soundtrack), the female head is someone I can feel about (no other than Jennifer Connelly of "Phenomena "). And the images ... great. Great cinematography, and some great screenshots. The concept of taping needles to a person's eyes so they can't shine ... brilliant. My assistant, Tina, thinks it seems false, but if it does, the idea is more than enough to pay off. And some great effects, like a knife coming into the mouth of a man? Awesome. <br /> <br /> Jim Harper calls the movie "stunning" and calls attention to "innovative cinematography, well-built shots and extremely violent murders." I totally agree - one shot follows the camera through tortuous tunnels, and there is a very interesting visual use of crows throughout the story. Mike Mayo also calls it "visually fascinating eye candy" and lauded the "sharp editing and flowing camera work". It's really a wonder that it's not one of Argento's more highly-priced works. <br /> <br /> Argento returned to the opera with "Phantom of the Opera", which was a bit of a failure despite its decisive daughter Asia and Julian Sands. Even more interesting, the same year, the release of Michele Soavi's "Stage fright", which, like "Opera", lost a killer in a theater that killed the people involved in the presentation. Both are fantastic movies, with Soavi's more on the scraper side. (Soavi actually served as second unit director on "Opera". You can draw your own conclusions.) <br /> <br /> My only complaint to this movie is its length and pacing. While it is very beautifully shot and the screens are glorious, they are not as regular as they should be. The first one takes half an hour and then we get times between them. The main actress must be in constant terror, but she gets time between death to calm down as if everything is normal again. Not cool, Dario. We need to keep the voltage low and the intensity high.
