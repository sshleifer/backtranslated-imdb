Opera opens up with a very close-up shot of a bird's eye-catching eye and thus begins one of Argento's most bizarre, pleasant features (my second favorite, in fact, behind Deep Red). Allowed, sometimes the movie is very absurd (the lack of real concern about murders, the attack of the bird, the burnt dummy, which ends?) But this is Argento's fantastic world and once you agree with it, you'll find that it works . I don't mean to completely dismiss these mistakes, rather that the artwork of the movie is more than just for them. For example, the above bird trap is completely over-the-top in theory, but looks at its wonderful performance; Crows flying in chaos, knocking their devastated squawking in the rock, panicking the crowds, as seen through the circular, bird watching camera work, and then the focused attack; aria of terror indeed. Argento's wonderful flowing cinematography is on full-screen in Opera, and clearly one of the highlights of the movie. I also enjoyed the soundtrack of operational themes and rock music, a nice contrast of music with each one being used effectively (the rock kicks in with the murders in perfect timing and gives the screens a very frenzied feeling). The sound effects also deserve a nod, sting, scissors, bills, and all. <br /> <br /> Inspector Alan Santini: "I saw a lot of your movies. Yes, you really are an expert in this field. I would be very interested in expressing your opinion." Marco: "I think it's unwise to use movies as a guide to reality, do not be your inspector? "<br /> <Inspector Alan Santini:" Depends on what you mean by reality. " <br /> <br /> Since it's a big, attractive murder, Dario shouldn't be disappointed (the bullet through the door may be one of the biggest deaths ever shot, if you forgive the word). The black-gloved, deep-voiced, pulsating brained (cool shots!) Killer is cold and brutal, and with him tape pens under our heroine's eyes, forcing her to look at the murders, was a good touch. It all said, like a giallo, Opera didn't like a riddle as it should. The killer is good enough of the audience's secret but there is little trouble in the film dedicated to actually solving the murders. That, and the strange end, could have used more work. Despite these problems, Opera still manages a valuable and satisfying horror movie. <br /> <br /> One final note: it was nice to see a movie, for once the right show by binoculars (just a circle), not two circles together! Beautiful eye for detail, Dario!
