Alfred Hitchcock made many brilliant thrillers, and many of them were named one of the best films of all time. One movie that tends to get lost in the Vertigo's and the Psychos is this movie; Strangers on a train, the most compelling movie that Hitchcock ever made. The story follows Guy Haines, a tennis player and a man who will soon marry the Senator's daughter, if he can get a divorce from his current wife. One day, on his way to seeing his wife, he met the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and was soon drawn to a murder pot that he couldn't stop or stall; and the one who could eventually cost him his life. <br /> <br /> The onboard Bruno and Guy conversation is one of the theater's most interesting and ongoing challenges. What if two people caught up with "murder", releasing themselves from all suspicions of crime and making their motives irrelevant? Can it really be the perfect murder? What makes this movie more frightening is that the events that Guy is leading can happen to any normal person. Everyone has someone they want to get rid of, so if you meet an insane man aboard a train that forces you to kill you and then you do it? The chances of this happening are unlikely, but it is the idea that someone can be a killer who is central to the message of strangers on a train. and in this situation anyone can <br /> <br /> be there any actor on earth who could portray the character of Bruno Anthony better than Robert Walker? The man was simply born for the part. He succeeds in capturing just the right mood for his character and completely recommends every scene he is in. Bruno's character is a madman, but he is not mad; He is a calculated, intriguing person and Robert Walker makes the character credible. His performance is extremely malicious, yet underestimated enough to hold the character firmly within the realms of reality. Unfortunately, Robert Walker died just one year after the release of strangers on a train, and I believe this is a huge loss of cinema. No one in the role-player shines as much as Walker, but worth his fellow star Farley Granger. Granger never puts him so much, but his performance is good enough and he keeps his own against Walker. Also remarkable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person; and so it must be. Ruth Roman is Guy's wife to be. She's not really in the movie enough to make a lasting impression, but she does the best she has. Alfred Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, takes the final role of the four central roles as Barbara, the sister of Guy's fiancee. She is fit in this role, and she tends to steal many of the screens in which she is. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock's direction is always sublime, and that's a lot in this movie. There is one shot especially, which sees the murder of the film in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses. It's an absolutely brilliant shot, and one that creates a good atmosphere for the scene. Hitchcock's direction is completely confused and many conform to the film noir style. The climax for the movie is spectacular and exciting, and I don't think anyone other than Hitchcock could pull it to the great effect it showed in this movie. It's really overwhelmed, and outside of the rest of the movie; but it works. There is a reason that Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time, and the reason is that he not only uses the writing to tell the film's story, but he also uses the camera to do it too . Aliens on a train are one of the greatest thrillers ever made. His story is both interesting and thoughtful, and is probably a fan of the theater. N masterpiece.
