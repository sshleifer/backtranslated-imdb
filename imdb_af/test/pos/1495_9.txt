"Mr. Bean", with legendary Rowan Atkinson, was a big hit during his 1990s, and I probably saw it for the first time when I was about ten, shortly after it ended. At the time I wasn't much of a fan and didn't see too many episodes. I didn't really come to my late teens a few years ago when I finally watched each episode. Unlike before, it made me laugh a lot, and since then it's always been the case with recurring episodes! <br /> <br /> Mr. Beanie is a mysterious, self-centered, antisocial, extremely naive buffoon whose best friend is Teddy! He is almost isolated from society, and life is not easy for him, because he is constantly struggling with very simple things! This is because he does not have a little basic knowledge and has the mind of a child. He finds himself in various kinds of trouble wherever he goes, and comes in many bizarre ways to solve the problems he is facing! He not only causes trouble for himself, but sometimes also for other people, which he often does not tend to realize! In other words, Bean is a disaster! <br /> <br /> The humor in this show is very visual, and there is very little dialogue. The gags are almost always gags, which is mostly about the show. While there may be an occasional shiny button, I would say the vast majority of them are funny, often hilarious (there are so many highlights)! While Mr. Bean is definitely not the most sophisticated comedy ever made, it is still ideal for many of those who enjoy visual humor. Due to the very limited dialogue, you don't even have to speak fluent English to enjoy the show. , and therefore it has received such a worldwide reputation! The show ran for a few years, but the episodes were made very gradual, so only fourteen were made in total. However, this is a classic series, and deserves its wide appeal!
