This is an unfortunately unknown classic. <br /> <br /> The look is great, design, costumes, etc. Is flawless. The after-fight screens and the cavalry charge are cold and exciting. <br /> <br /> The characters are alive and really human. Ardent is right and Fabrice Luchini as attorney Derville steals the movie with his clever pedantic rodent-like performance, gratifying in the up and down of others' discomfort. Depardieu is good, but perhaps too big a presence for this role. <br /> <br /> Where the movie really excels, is the story and also his changes to Balzac's novella. These changes are editorial because Balzac has many conversations about society and breathes this movie with characters. Nonetheless, Yves Angelo retained the key ingredient, not just the missing man trying to restore his place in society, but every character should find its place in society. The Comte Ferraud is trying to buy a peerage, his wife (Ardent) comes from a humble birth and when she married Colonel Chabert, they gained their position in the turmoil of post-revolutionary France. Everyone has something to lose in terms of status and it makes a good drama as their goals are in conflict with each other. <br /> <br /> It also feels very modern: money is critical to buying status to achieve power, but someone can go as fast as they go. Derville enjoys the strategy, he saw the worst people he told Chabert when he took the matter. The original place of this speech is at the end of the novel, as Balzac summarizes human comedy with great irony.
