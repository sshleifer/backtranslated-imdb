The film starts with a dowdy housewife (Norma Shearer) to establish that her husband (Rod La Rocque) has been deceiving her. Three years passed and apparently they were divorced over the years because of the infidelity. Strangely, during this time La Rocque did not see Shearer or his two children, as Shearer took them to Paris. <br /> <br /> Marie Dressler is a wealthy community lady and she has invited a new and improved Norma to come to her home for the weekend - apparently helping Marie break an emerging romance between her daughter and La Rocque! Apparently Norma is a super-vampire and with her magical sex appeal she can run out of romance - and no one seems to realize she and La Rocque were married. Several others are there for the weekend and immediately Norma is a hit with her gay, carefree sexy ways - and almost all the men (including La Rocque) are captivated by her. No one tells them they are married, but it is obvious that she is returning the new and improved Norma! This film is a sophisticated sophisticated under-crust comedy - similar in some respects to Jean Renoir's rules. Strangely, despite the seriousness of the Depression, such films over pretty rich people were very popular, but many today will undoubtedly find themselves a bit too dizzy. Luckily, in LATE WE ARE GAY, there are many cute and funny moments (especially at the end when Marie Dressler shows her true colors). Although not a good movie, it's definitely a good one and more than just another time driver. My only real regret is that I didn't love it for granted. You just have to see it for yourself - maybe you'll agree on the end, maybe you won't, but I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this clever movie.
