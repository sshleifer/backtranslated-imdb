Excellent work around, especially by the actress Gerda (Claire Price) played, of course, like David Suchet. I really found out whodunit but it is next to the point. The end, which I will not disclose (someone describes it on the Council in response to someone else's question if you are interested.) I really found sadness. Despite Agatha Christie's reputation for writing cardboard characters, I thought it was really well-rounded. <br /> <br /> The pace of the story was good and I enjoyed seeing Sarah Miles as Lucy and Edward Hardwicke (Cedric's son I also believes in a well-known Dr Watson.) as her husband.
