I can't see how a movie of this quality only gets 5.7 on average from IMDb voters. It is a classic Australian production that is in line with recent efforts such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES, SUGAR FACTORY, OLD-STUDY LANGUAGE, RUSSIAN DOLL, COMPLETE PEOPLE, SECRET LIFE OF USA, LA SPAGNOLA, STRANGE PLANET, FRESH AIR, FABRIC OF WINGS, DO TIME FOR PATSY CLINE, etc. ... As a 19-year-old uni-student (Newton, perhaps his best role yet, compared to CHANGI at least) with a bored, christian mother gets the shock of his life when She decides to enter the same course - and before you think of another movie, it's not, there are some real content here. Certainly, this is a simplistic view of life in general and especially art students (but then they are rather simplistic among all that philosophical mumbo jumbo they are?), And perhaps the study of Sinead Cusack's character is sometimes disappointing. , but the movie is bright, funny and has important messages. The principle is great: Cusack and Newton are wonderful, and Rose Byrne (see her also in the 1967 wickedness) is so underestimated that it is not funny. She is a beautiful, fresh, confident actor who earns every award she receives. I gave MY MOTHER FRANK 8/10.
