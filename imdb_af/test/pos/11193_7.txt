"Distant" is a cut-of-Turkish life movie that follows the everyday activities of two adult male cousins; one a photographer and the other an unemployed underachiever. There is little doubt that author Nuri Bilge Ceylan is doing a job with considerable talent. However, this tiny, weird, minimalist artistic drama is so full of empty fillers and so without a story or something that is tempting or challenging that it will probably be just the most enthusiastic of the theater and the mainstream audiences should look elsewhere. Personally, I quickly got bored with the slow pace of the movie and I quickly found the empty spaces - and there are many - between dialogue, plot development and denial. "Distant" is a very nice little bit of esoterics. (B-)
