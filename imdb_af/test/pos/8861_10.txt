Many people have a movie that they think is their favorite movie. My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing! The main reason why this movie is a cult film is perhaps the shattering effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the movie Kurt Russell made what he is today (with Escape from NY). This is my opinion Not a good movie because of its effect, it has to do with the story, the atmosphere and of course the acting. I watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day for the past 10 years), but no one had the impact on me than this one, not even the big Das Boot. <br /> <br /> Here's my suggestion for those who love sci-fi and horror movies: Put yourself in the good chair of your home. Make sure you are not interrupted by anyone. If you don't have a projector, sit close to your TV and watch this miracle of a movie. Let it absorb you, and you'll see it! <br /> <br /> Best showtime: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.
