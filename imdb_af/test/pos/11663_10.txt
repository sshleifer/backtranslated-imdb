it was very sensitive very deep. It's my favorite all the time that you can't see the movie more deeply than this amazing movie. Susan Sarandon played her role as an outdated mind actress, and she realized her role. She earned the award. She convinced me that she was a nun. The music was very impressive and sensitive. Really I like this deep masterpiece.
