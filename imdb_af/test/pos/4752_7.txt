This movie is not about the soft drink, nor is it the French connection. <br /> <br /> The Seven Ups are a group of elite policemen who use tactics that do not match the NYPD protocol. Separator heads the group with his post or regular look. They are overseeing a local costra nostra cartel and things are going wrong if a police thread is found out. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Richard Lynch, the most evil man in film (Invasion: America, Little Nikita) and his partner ended the accident by killing the Scheider in the coolest chase I saw. Bullitt and French Connection are not as good as their one on the west to George Washington and on the Palisades Parkway in New York. Jersey. <br /> <br /> The stunt drivers are fantastic and Lynch makes it go away, though he looks scared of the dangerous journey. Roy Scheider is almost dead when his car moves in the back of the Mack truck in the exit of the vehicle's roof. <br /> <br /> Things come to mind and one has to keep looking to follow up on such a drive. Quickly moving and intense, fresh for thirty years.
