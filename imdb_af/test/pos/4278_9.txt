I have to admit that I have a special affection for the humor and storytelling style of British movies, although it does not include everything. <br /> <br /> This movie made me think and finally put me on my face with a quiet smile. It's about character development and relationships, truth and lies, and whether love is simply not enough. Some very accused actors of all the contestants, especially the two leaders, Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of excitement about Gosford Park, but with this piece I feel Fellowes actually produced. A better movie, though not a mainstream release. <br /> <br /> An intelligent adult story about real people who are undeniably flawed, but also capable of acts of just grace.
