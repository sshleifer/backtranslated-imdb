The copy of this movie I saw is not very good. It is granular and has virtually no color in some parts. It ranges back and forth between English and French, often in the middle sentence, and sometimes even in the middle of a word! To make matters worse, there are no English subtitles in the French language parts, which I think is at least one quarter of the film. But incredibly, the movie is still very understandable and enjoyable, even in this state, and I think it says a lot about how good this movie is. <br /> <br /> It's a spaghetti western wine with great acting, an interesting story, and an excellent music score. It also has a cool main character, a beautiful dark-haired girl, some strange characters and events, and an overall feeling of melancholy. This film has 'Euro' written all over it. <br /> <br /> I hope there is a pristine negative or print out of this movie out there because it deserves a quality DVD release, and if it comes out, I'll be one of the first in line for this to get!
