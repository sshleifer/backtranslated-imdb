I was switched to this movie by my flight instructor and now I wonder how the heck was there for almost five years before finally discovering it. If you do not love at all, especially an attachment to World War II aircraft, this is an absolute must see, much better than the pathetic "Pearl Harbor" and filmed above in competition with the famous "Battle of Britain" more filmed . than thirty years ago. There are moments when you feel like you are a wingman, literally killing the leader of your leader while working on a Me 109 or He 111. <br /> <br /> As a historian, this film touched me deeply as Well, it's about the necessity of tens of thousands of galling poles, Hungarians, Sloves and Czechs who fled their homelands in 1939-1940, after England fought, with the greatest bravery fought for the survival of Western civilization. And then it was so called by the "us" after the war when they were arrested by the communists when they returned to their homeland. I stood on top of Monte Cassino in Italy and was moved by tears by the cemetery for the Polish troops who stormed that mountain that British and Americans couldn't take. I also traveled to Prague (the most beautiful of cities) and studied their history. Their story of abandonment, I believe, today should be another lesson on obligations towards gallant allies. <br /> <br /> But back to the movie. If you like flying, see it. If you are interested in the World War II plane, you definitely see it. Undoubtedly, the most brutal, direct and extremely fast aerial scenes have ever been repeated for film. And yes, if you are even looking for a pleasant romance, it is also in heartbreaking detail. <br /> <br /> Bill Forstchen Professor of History Co-owner of World War II Replica "Warbird" P-51 Mustang "Gloria Ann"
