this movie is not as bad as some say it's infact. I think it's better than the original. Maybe that's why some people hate it, because they don't want to give it a good (not good) movie. <br /> <br /> Most if not all, CGI I didn't think anyway, it was a nice movie. Phil Buckman - (Chris) was, in my opinion, the best man in the movie, Julie Delpy, was quite attractive. She took the sexiness to the movie. <br /> <br /> There were lots of jokes in the movie I thought was good. this movie is in my collection but the original is not because I don't like it as much as this one. I was not bored when I watched this movie that looked at me, unlike some horror movies, I could say oh say driller killer & suspiria (dario argento's movie) it's just two. <br /> <br /> this is a good werewolf movie that should be in people's collection if they want to have werewolf movies, maybe I'll get the original at some point. I just had one complaint and that's Phil Buckman - (Chris) had to be more in it than he was, but apart from that the movie was fine. <br /> <br /> Rating for this movie 8/10 An ugly werewolf did not film the worst out there. <br /> <br />
