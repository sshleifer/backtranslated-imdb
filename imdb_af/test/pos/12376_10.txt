All right, so it wasn't what I expected. I rented this movie just to see how it would be, because I want to see the first one anyway. But this film had B-movie about it. But when I saw it, I realized it was very funny. For the first 30 minutes It was just how the snowman lost people and one man. But the first few minutes had some funny one linen in it. When he threw the first of his little minions, I knew it would be very funny. They all play like the gremlins in the nineteen-eighty-forty hit gremlins. It made it look like spoofing and let me forget it's a B-movie. So if you would like to rent this one.
