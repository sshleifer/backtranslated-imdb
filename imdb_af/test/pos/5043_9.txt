Starring: <br /> <br /> Vlastimil Brodský .... Frantisek Hána Stella Zázvorková .... Emílie Hánová Stanislav Zindulka .... Eda <br /> Director Vladimir Michalek gives this beautiful story Frantisek Hana has retired and his previous occupation is unknown on his pension. He lives in a very nice apartment with his 40-year-old wife, Emilie. His son Jara desires the spacious apartment as a problem solver, as he has to house one of his former wives and several of their children. The boy is not an evil twilight, just a guy with a previous spouse too much and a blind eye to the attachment his father has for the apartment (which he retracted after he left a former residence on the boy traveled). <br /> <br /> Hana and his elderly good friend, Ed, spend more than enough free time to do small jobs, not for money, but for the pleasure of skipping over to easy-going people like estate agents. A favorite effort is for Hana to return the part of a retired divo from New York's Metropolitan Opera needed for a vast mansion. Ed is his companion, as gullible brokers go everywhere and produce chauffeured limousines and good French meals in the hope of profitable sales. <br /> <br /> When the duo is not involved in well-planned scams, the duo quickly enters as pretending to be railway security agents to relax kissing breathtaking and cardless teenagers on the train. Chaste kissing, that's: there's no delicacy here. <br /> <br /> Hana's long-suffering wife is obsessed with saving enough money to ensure that the couple, individually and collectively, have a great funeral, to love Frantisek, is not in a hurry to experience. <br /> <br /> Disagreement over money and Frantisek's promiscuous disposition of marriage funds leads to a crisis whose resolution is both real and engaging. Michalek fishes for the viewer's emotions, but he does it openly, honestly and effectively. <br /> <br /> "Autumn Spring," subtitles of course, is a product of an increasingly vibrant Czech theater. It's not widely shown in the US, but its availability on DVD will hopefully bring it to a wide audience. Unfortunately, Brodsky recently succumbed to cancer, so this movie is a fake version of a fine actor who has pervaded his character with a passion for life's enjoyment that must reflect the actor's own values. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
