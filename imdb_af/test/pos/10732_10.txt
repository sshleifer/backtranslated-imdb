I saw a lot of Dustin Hoffman's movies like Straw Dogs or Rain Man and I loved them, but his characters are often very calm or even shy. I expected him to be the same in this movie as he was in Straw Dogs, but I saw a totally different person. He was much more energetic in this movie and reminded me of Al Pacino in Serpico. The movie was very interesting from beginning to end. I like the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about anything to stay with his son. This movie is also revealing. Personally, I find it clear that people must learn to find a compromise themselves without involving others.
