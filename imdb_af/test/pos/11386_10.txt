A few times ago I saw it when HBO showed it and what I saw it looked like it was a good movie. So I'm in Blockbuster today and I see it at the DVDs and I decide what the hell is. So I rent it. After watching it, I was shocked by how good it was. <br /> <br /> This movie just touched my heart. Everything in it was so wonderful. The stories, the actors, the dark humor, the MUSIC !!! Oh, don't let me start with the music in this movie. PT Andderson is one of the big ones. Definitely the best thing to come out since Quentin Tarantino (a god.) <br /> <br /> After completing the first show, I watched it again with Anderson's comment (I was surprised at how so) cool guy he is.) <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in movies should see this movie if they haven't. Anderson, of course, is a movie lover. In the movie he makes so many other directors techniques. Like the pool scene with the camera following the girl through the water. Obviously torn off "I'm Cuba." But I don't have such a beef. The film is very respectful with its ripoff's. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who can handle some of the content of the movie (porn). <br /> <br /> 10/10
