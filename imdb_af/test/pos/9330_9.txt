Before being shown on MTV or VH1, it was at my local theater just before the main movie. I remember this short film more than the movie I saw that day. It was the first time I ever had such a music movie, but I will tell you that the view on the large screen of a 35mm print in a dark theater gives it a much better impact than a cut view pan and scan version on VH1. Halloween.
