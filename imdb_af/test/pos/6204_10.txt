I confronted Sleeper Cell with some concern about whether the terrorists would be glorified. This fascinating series not only deals with the subject matter, but creates depth and substance for almost every character. Oded Fehr just boasts on the screen in every scene he is in and although his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell, he still has hypnotic appeal. Michael Ealy kept his own good, but in some scenes I wondered why he wasn't shot in the spot because of the shoe he was wearing on his face. <br /> <br /> The benefits of the series are the two clues, Fehr and Ealy, the well-written characters - all of which were credible and tragic, and the disturbing issues addressed in the story. If I was married to a Muslim myself, the atmosphere created was pretty realistic. The downside, for me personally, was that the female T&A was left over. Most were free of charge, as well as some of the sex scenes. Despite this, it's a raw grip series that will make you think. Someone gives Fehr more juicy roles like this one and lets him run with it. He has incredible screen presence and a strange kind of native power coming from him.
