For many years I thought I was the only person on the planet who saw TEMPEST, and I am so excited to learn that I am not the only person to experience this sleeper somewhere in their movie. Loose based on the Shakespeare play, TEMPEST follows an architect (the late John Cassavettes, in one of his best performances), bored with his work and his crumbling marriage (to husband Genrow Rowlads), who decides to chuck everything, says hell with the rock and goes with his daughter (Molly Ringwald, in her film debut) and a new girl, Aretha (a body of Susan Sarandon), lives on an island. Although Paul Mazursky is credited as director, Cassavette's hand is everywhere in this movie ... the long scenes filmed without cuts, the improvisational sense of dialogue ..., the self-reliant storytelling style, that is definitely his performance of the Beginning to end, and if you're not a fan of his work, the movie looks tedious and slow, but if you're a fan, there are rewards to have. Cassavettes are surrounded by a first-class cast ... his scenes with Rowlands crack with intensity and his surprising chemistry with Sarandon is a stark contrast to his scenes with Rowlands. Ringwald shines in her film debut and there is a play-telling performance by late Raul Julia as Kalibanos, Cassavette's slave on the island. Julia stops the show in one scene dancing with sheep sheep, accompanied by Liza Minnelli who sings "New York, New York". This film is sad and tragic and funny and intense. Yes, it is a little long and unpleasant and it works a little too hard to be different (there is even a curtain call at the end of the movie), but it never fails to attract the attention of those who have something else in their film going.
