1957 Edge of the City, led by Martin Ritt, star John Cassavetes, Sidney Poitier, Jack Warden and Ruby Dee. This is the story of a troubled man, Axel, who has a mysterious past that gradually emerges during the film. He has a connection that works on a loading tray for Charlie (Jack Warden), a real common man who takes and runs returns from his workers. Charlie has an intense dislike for a black man, T.T. (Poitier) who holds the same position. T. T. invite Axel to work on his team; Axel defies Charlie and does it. Axel finds a place to live and socialize with T.T., his wife (Dee) and their son's white teacher (Kathleen McGuire). When a tragedy strikes, none of the men will speak to the police message, and Axel must enter his values, what he stands for and the meaning of friendship. <br /> <br /> It is a very outstanding black and white film that is odd, not really black or white! It's about the boundaries you set and who you are. Charlie is a bigot and hates that a black man has a good position on the harbor. T. T. bother Charlie and give as good as he gets. There is no discussion about T.T. and Axel spending time together or from T.T. his son with a white teacher with whom the family also socializes. What Axel, a loner, finds difficult, is to accept any friendship or trust in someone - these things he learns from TT <br /> <br /> Poitier absolutely shines in "Edge of the City" - he's hot , energetic, loving and smart, a man with real enthusiasm for life, afraid of nothing. Cassavetes are excellent and play a character totally opposite - hiding in the shade, chronically depressed and always nervous. <br /> <br /> The film opens with Axel. Whatever, he is now another man. <br /> <br /> Strange underrated and unfamiliar movie, possibly in the shadow of many of the evil young men films that came out of that era.
