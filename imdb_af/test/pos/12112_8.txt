The director of Buffalo Bill, the hero of the Far West director, Mario Costa's careless Spaghetti Western "The Beast" with Klaus Kinski, could only be produced in Europe. Hollywood would never have dared to make a western about a sexual predator on the prowl as the lead role of a movie. Remember that Kinski is ideally suited for the role of 'Crazy' Johnny. He plays an individual completely without sympathy, ironically dressed from head to toe in a white suit, pants and hat. This low-budget governor has nothing to eat. The typical breathtaking Spanish landscape around Almeria is nowhere in evidence. Instead, Costa and his director of photography Luciano Trasatti, who shot another Kinski-western "And God Kissed Cain" shot this perdopera in the everyday environment around Tor Caldara, Latium, Italy and Monte Gelato Falls, Treja River, Latium, Italy. Nevertheless, "The Beast" qualifies as a continental western because it deals with completely unscrupulous characters and the action can be classified as film noir because the hero and heroine are trapped by untenable circumstances that force them to use criminal activities. Predictably, their well-planned plans are the fire that is largely due to the Kinski character. Indeed, the vicious Kinski character looks like a Wily E. Coyote-type character. Consistently, he struggles to have sex with several beautiful women, but either lawmakers or offenders frustrate each of his efforts. Ultimately, "The Beast" comes down to a tragic irony study. The orchestral score of the Stelvio Cipriani sounds as if it was being lifted by Tony Anthony's western "The Stranger Returns". The Mario Costa Scratch takes place on the western boundary between San Diego and Mexico, which is due to a notorious Mexican bandit named Machete (Giovanni Pallavicino of "We Still Kill the Old Way") and his gang of terror. They prey on the stage coach and no one is safe from their apostasy. The first time we see 'Crazy' Johnny Laster, he's waiting to refresh himself on a stream and see a beautiful woman dressing in clothes. He crept behind her and attacked her, but a bigger gun with a gun intervened and he had to flee. He appeared in a nearby town, and a snuff-snorting rifle assaulted him to help a wealthy man, Mr. Powers, on the trail to rob him. They found him dead and didn't get any money. Mr. Snuff-Sniffer accidentally left his snus at the scene of the crime and the sheriff's arrest on suspicion of murder. 'Crazy' shoots his accomplice from his hotel room so he doesn't have to worry about what's involved in the crime. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a young couple in love have trouble making their way into the world. . Riccardo (Steven Tedd of "Requiem for a Bounty Killer") lives a Mexican couple on their farm and helps them raise their real son Juan. In the village Riccardo's lovely girl Juanita (Gabriella Giorgelli of "Stranger in Sacramento") sings and dance in the canteen. Riccardo and Juanita are planning to marry, but the last place Juanita wants to establish is on a dusty farm. She dreams of living in the city, but life in the city requires more money than Riccardo or she has. They team up with a blonde, exorbitant name Glen (Paolo Casella of "Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead"), and they plan to mr. Power's daughter Nancy, kidnapped when she gets her legacy. Glen makes the fatal mistake of winning a Crazy Johnny, because Glen knows Johnny needs the money to get women. <br /> <br /> They kidnapped Powers daughter and held her to a remote cabin with Johnny Standing Watch over her. Meanwhile, Juanita is conquered as a daughter of forces and he is taken up in town to get the money from lawyer Gary Pinkerton (Giuliano Raffaelli of "Blood and Black Lace"), but he becomes suspicious because Juanita looks nothing like he remembers Nancy. Riccardo brandishes his six-gun and warns Pinkerton that they have kidnapped Nancy. Unfortunately for Pinkcardon and Juanita, Pinkerton can only lay his hand at $ 50 thousand, because Machete so feared in the hearts of everyone that the total legacy of the powers could not be sent through the scene. Meanwhile, back at the cabin, horny Johnny tries to rape Nancy, but she fuses him, knows him with a chair in the foreground that she should be alone while she withdraws. After knocking him unconscious, she steals a buggy and drives it back to town. Johnny recovers, pursues her and kills her at the same time Glen, Riccardo, Juanita and Pinkerton meet on the trail. They inform Johnny of the complications created by Machete's reign of terror and give him $ 12,000 when she cuts the money. Pinkerton is afraid at Nancy's blood-stained face and threatens Johnny. Of course Johnny can put him in the cold blood in the place. <br /> <br /> Things are really starting to deteriorate as San Diego's law strikes to capture Machete. Glen, Riccardo and Juanita return to Mexico while Johnny attacks two women at a farm and escapes to get caught. He drives to Mexico, finds a cantina whore and goes down on her when an abundance kicks a revolver in his face. Johnny admits he knows where to get more money when they release him. Machete's men follow Johnny's tip and take Juanita. The residents join Riccardo to attack Machete and Johnny saves Juanita, but she later dies after a big shooting. Riccardo is now left alone. Machete and his men returned to his stepfathers, not only killed them, but also Juan. Everything Riccardo and Juanita dreamed up in clouds of rifle smoke for an unfortunate end. 'Crazy' Johnny dies and never gets his desire to do it. If you think of Costa's inexorable sagebrusher, the "Beast" appears as an interesting character study and an exercise in film noir in a western environment where everyone is punished.
