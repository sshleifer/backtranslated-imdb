It's a unique movie because it gives us the only chance to see the young Noel Coward in all its ironic glory. Being so reserved and detached, he is perfect for the role of an unloved cad that uses virtually all those around him. But in the deadly serious (no pun intended) last action, when Coward has to make the Flying Dutchman, he is much less comfortable. <br /> <br /> But his way with an epigram is random and Hecht & Macarthur has given him a few jewels (Macarthur, really - he was the white of the couple). <br /> <br /> The movie is beautifully lit by the great Lee Garmes, but has a small camera movement apart from a storm sequence. Hecht and Macarthutr did one thing - to get their dialogue on the screen. (PLEASE NOTE: H & M itself has shiny-and-you-miss-they come as bombs in the flophouse scene). <br /> <br /> The most noteworthy supporting player is the only Alexander Woolcott, infamous Broadway columnist and good friend of both Macarthur and Coward, who appears as one of the bitch writers who are always waiting in Coward's publishing room. <br /> <br /> Curious that Woolcott will agree to make a film that was the legendary Algonquin round table, of which he was a founder, and Macarthur something of a helper. <br /> <br /> The Scoundrel has actually won an Oscar for the best story, though that victory is probably more to Coward's imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot. It's Coward, Woolcott, and the dialogue you remember ...
