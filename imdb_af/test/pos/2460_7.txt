This movie can easily resist the emotional power, the dramatic impact and the leading performances of "12 Angry Men". I rented it and was surprised that I hadn't heard it before. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it's Emilio Estevez's director debut, but the pacing, interaction and development of characters as well as some smart camera work around the character Estevez all play a natural eye. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie. Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters, subtle despair and escape; a variation on her character in "Play in the Fields of the Lord". She is annoying and yet one can simultaneously empathize with her. <br /> <br /> There are a few moments where I feel the plot slows a touch and the moments between Estevez and his ex-girlfriend almost look like another written movie, Estevez comes off as a different character all together. But these are small complaints. <br /> <br /> This movie should be based on a true story or should be written by someone who lived these experiences. I rate it 8 out of a difficult 10. <br /> <br />
