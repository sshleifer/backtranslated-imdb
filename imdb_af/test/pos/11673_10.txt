Penelope Spheeris (of Wayne's World celebrity) made her mark with the documentary "The Decline of Western Civilization", about the LA punk scene in the late 70's and early 80's. Most of the documentary features interviews with the punks and footage of concerts (which are often violent). In general we see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies. While the hippies were natural, the punks wanted to change themselves as much as possible, with speckled hair and everyone. But also, we see how they become really rude and sometimes become skinheads. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a very good time capsule. We're not really sure if we want us to be but it's definitely not a documentary that will leave you neutral. Actually worth seeing.
