Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbolic Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels & Demons, which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code, as the latter's more controversial topic hits a rough nerve on faith itself. The Catholic Church was about the first movie in the arms, but apparently careless about this one. And it's not hard to see why Ron Howard decided to do a flat-out action as a major tourism video of Rome and Vatican City. It will probably increase the visitor numbers of the very beautiful on-site screens, except for St Peter's Square and Basilica, which was a scale model used. <br /> <br /> So I think with the bulk of the budget going to the sets, the ensemble guests must be scaled down accordingly. Ayelet Zurer tried to enter the female gap left by Audrey Tautou, but since Tautou's character had much more in the movie, Zurer's scientific Vittoria did far less than just waiting for wings batteries on a container filled with anti-matter. In the book, she is of course the lead for Langdon to discuss his extensive knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati and the great feud between the two, but here she is not a love interest or his intellectual equal. <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, on the other hand, visits every scene he is in as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who temporarily takes care of the Papale office while the other prominent cardinals in the Sistine Chapel are to a new Pope. choose. And he is watching Patrick with that glamor, with nuances enough to let you know that there is more to the eye. There are no surprises for the readers of the novel, but McGregor's action here is one of the highlights of the movie, as Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks. <br /> <br /> The book itself is rich in possible accurate content as always, and has much more plot points about science versus religion, and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked into an engaging fictional piece of work . Having read the book a few years ago, I thought that if a movie was to be made, it was easy to fall out and live on the given action pieces. Unfortunately, this Ron Howard movie has a pass that does not allow for temporary breathing. Unlike the first movie where you had the characters for a "talk time" over a cup of tea, this one moved so fast, it's like reading the book again, page after skipping the page just to the thick of the action. <br /> <br /> Catholic reviewers call Angels & Demons harmless, because I think it didn't go on its many controversies, unlike the Da Vinci code that is a rough nerve in the midst of faith. And if anything, this movie served as a great tourism promotion video with a nice showcase of the very prominent sights that many people around the world would attract to visit. Of course, certain areas such as the catacombs beneath St Peter's Basilica, and the Vatican archives remain beyond the boundaries, but the walk along the Lighting Path, now it is almost free. <br /> <br /> Nothing new to those who read the book other than seeing it come alive, but for those who don't, this movie can only force you to pick up Dan Brown's novel, just to read more about the meaning of the landmarks and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini, which are intricately linked to the plot, but many left unnoticed. Enough popcorn entertainment that leaves you with nothing spectacular.
