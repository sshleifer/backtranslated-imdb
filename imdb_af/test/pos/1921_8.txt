Even if you don't usually enjoy documentaries, chances are you'll find this one fascinating. Not only does it have a well-mapped plot that, while easy to follow, contains its interesting revolutions; It also has a very strong emotional resonance, and not one that relies on a simple specific tone. Instead, the emotions here are as deep and turbulent as the seas that occurred. <br /> <br /> It is said, if you don't know anything about Donald Crowhurst and the 1968 one-hand boat race around the world ... as for me ... please stop reading and rent / see this movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOLLOW <br /> <br /> My friend, Brian, recommended it at the same time that my aunt had linked me to pair this movie with Antonioni's work. In 2007, I went through several of Antonioni's films, still! Connecting this movie to Antonioni, I think is a bit of a piece, the character most likely to be seen in one of Michaelangelo's movies, is Francoise Moitessier de Cazalet. It's funny on the main IMDb page, he's not even listed as "Himself" which is probably a feature of its long name, as opposed to its self-fulfillment / renunciation. As Moitessier goes straight out of the race, it can be considered just like Anna in L'Avventura. Although there are many things to love about this movie: the real footage of the time, the stubborn best friend, the sheer power of the Roaring Forties, I walked away with a simple connection. A man, really at sea. There were times in my life where I wondered how I got to such a point, caught between dreams and reality, feeling like a sleep in my own skin. It may be that I read too much in this documentary, and this has read the directors too much in Crowhurst, but I saw that sentence as a play boundary as the other secrets held in this movie. <br /> <br /> On the odd chance that Crowhurst's wife (who had a remarkable study of restraint on intelligibly confronted overtones) and his children (as young in the standing footage and still young at this late date in the sense of their pain and pride for their father), I'm sure the comment here and the film itself fails to catch the man your father was. However, in his death he gave the world a glimpse of something like a lost myth, he is a pre-GPS Odysseus. The fact that his body is never found adds to the air of poor immortality, if not the stature of a cosmic being he wrote. <br /> <br /> This movie sticks with you to the look, as if you're expecting another twist from the deep waters. Or at least you hope for the Moitessier persecution. <br /> <br /> Thurston Hunger 8/10
