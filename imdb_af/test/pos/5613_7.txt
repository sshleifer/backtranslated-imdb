I thoroughly enjoyed this movie ... and I still watch it from time to time. I used it in my music classes at the school where I learned. The kids seem to enjoy it, but they wish it was in color. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is for me, who grew up after Heifetz died, chances are really the Master violinist works his craft! I was amazed at how "up to date" the story line is. Although references to "reform school" are outdated. A son, whose father died, was raised by his mother and stepfather. Most of our children are educated by steppers today, although the movie seems to be the most steppers. I am VERY angry when his mother does not take his side and defends his actions against the stepfather. <br /> <br /> The musical choices are also hard to believe. I find it amazing that a child who is about 8 can play the "Minute Waltz" or that a 13-year-old girl can sing a Rigoletto aria. <br /> <br /> Unlike that, it's a very nice, feel good movie and I recommend it. I wish it would come on DVD.
