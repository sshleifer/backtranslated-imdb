First, I want to say that Ang Lee did a very good job! I watched it yesterday and I was amazed at the moment. The story is very good, but all the ignorant will say, "It doesn't suck people to fly!" to them I say it's fiction and that it is. It should not be considered a film about reality. You can say it's a fairy tale. And a very pleasant Asian fairy tale. The picture can actually blow your mind. Because of the artistic filmed, Ang Lee has a lot (untouched you can say) great talent. The battle scene is very cool and beautifully brought to the viewer. But it is sad, but this film did not get the appreciation it needed. But Ang Lee has fortunately withheld the attention he deserved with his devastated mountain. So even for viewers who are not interested in the story, the images are enough!
