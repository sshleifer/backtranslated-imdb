The different Law & Order and CSI franchises were better pleased. Dolomites don't go through. The ladies policemen, ADAs and coroners will all be surprised and the males are subject to such soul movement, the badge that melts the candle speed kicks. (Don't just want to love David Caruso's Horatio and know everything about CSI gets Dolomite's Hush Puppies pulled out of their respective asses). Ice T can start crying and returning to the Playa Route. <br /> <br /> Low low budget, bad but enthusiastic, and a vision of which nightclubs are offered to its customers soul singers, the last parents of Chitlin Circuit entertainers (this weirdling dance group). James Brown, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, and others hosted these clubs to glory, while their counterparts were in local or local stars. Rudy Ray Moore came from that background and the character of Dolomite is a mixture of the fat black swords that have penetrated. He did not have to go to the joint, the pig did not have a warrant, how his middle-aged parent, blubbery himself maintained a loyal stable of kung fu wenches, is a mystery that only a student of cults can explain, but everything next door is the point. It is a wonderful home movie by a legendary artist who fights his performance with the mirrors of actors ranging from established Hollywood to indie movie strings. A nice silly movie!
