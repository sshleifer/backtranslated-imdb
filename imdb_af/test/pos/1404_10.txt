Was hit on how even the play was throughout. William Haines had a play that is great for silent film. Not over the edge. There are moments where the camera work is great and combined with the story, like when he wants to see the Superintendent, done very well. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the movie thoroughly. <br /> <br />
