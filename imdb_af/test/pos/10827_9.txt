On its surface, it's one of the most classic entertaining action / comedy / romance movies I've seen in the past, reminding me of pleasant old "Saturday afternoon" movies that just got the right balance from unexpected twists, timely humor and integrated action . In addition, there is our knowledge of the context of this film. It has the same elements of "Casablanca", but it is set just before many characters really understand the gravity of what happens to their country (and the world) and the consequences of their own behavior. It adds a strong irony to the humor (we feel that one of the female characters has a radical change in hairstyle in her future). It's a movie you won't regret watching.
