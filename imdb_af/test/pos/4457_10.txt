The name "Lucio Fulci" highlights images of graphic death and mutilation in the minds of power-fans. Thanks to movies like "Zombi 2", "City of the Living Dead", "The Beyond" and "The New York Ripper", Fulci has a reputation for being one of the prettiest directors in history. And while many of his later movies probably justify his reputation for the release of "Zombi 2" in 1979, Fulci's films have never been released anywhere near the amount of blood and intestine he knows. rely on more traditional shocks and disturbing images at work. "Don't torture a duck" barely contains a gore, but stands out as its best. <br /> <br /> "Don't torture a duckling" is in a small Sicilian town where superstition ruled instead of logic. The townspeople are very distrustful of outsiders as well as anyone else who often avoids them. After a series of child murders, many people fall into the village, including Andrea Martelli (Thomas Milan) trying to uncover the truth about the murders while continuing to happen. <br /> <br /> It's a remarkable movie. It is very well made with an excellent throw filled with many favorites from Italian exploitation theater. It also contains a solid score, as well as many creative camera moves courtesy of Lucio Fulci. But the true sign of "Do not abuse a duck" is the disturbing nature of the movie. Little ones, about twelve years old, are shown, with an older woman, mocking people, visiting prostitutes and sex. It also contains some very biting comments on the middle class and the Catholic Church. It is for reasons like this that "Do not abuse a duck" sorted across Europe when it was first released and never shown in the United States. Still, "Don't Torture a Duck" stands as a monumental achievement in giallo theater as well as the best work of Lucio Fulci. I really can't recommend this one, check it out.
