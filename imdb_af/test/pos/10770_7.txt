Mas Oyama was the most successful karate master of the late 20th century. He refused the "training" of the karate clubs of the time to focus on an intense, non-keeping form of training. He eventually built his system into a great business world with hundreds of schools around the world, without harming his teachings. The testing at Kyokushin schools is still some of the most physically challenging tests any art school requires. A non-physical hardship confronted by Oyama was a prejudice due to its Korean descent and spent time proving loyalty to Japan and Japanese Karate. This cast was part of the effort, though anyone who had the opportunity to meet Oyama (I did) never question his allegiance to Japan. In this series, Oyama's best-known student, Sonny Chiba, is asked to portray his master. <br /> <br /> Oyama comes from the countryside where he is trained alone. He challenges and makes short work of the established Karate schools he meets. Stunned by the state of karate, Oyama returns to his lonely education. He eventually attracts a student, falls in love and gets in the way of gang members linked to established karate schools. In the middle of this is the legendary bullfight with a mad bull. How much of the movie is true is questionable. <br /> <br /> That Oyama can kill a bull with its bare hands is true. He was called to repeat this feat numerous times. There are filmed cases of Oyama to actually do so, although the bulls have sometimes tied up, as Oyama is starting in years. Sonny Chiba portrays his master with conviction and the karate is pretty good. Chiba may not be the best karate practitioner, but at this stage he was probably above average. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is good, much better than most martial arts martial arts films. I always wondered why it was no longer known. Perhaps it is the very realistic depictions of martial arts. People are touched to be tired and sore, as opposed to 99% of the action movie where the hero is an unlimited fountain of energy. Each bladder immediately sends an opponent to death. Chiba looks so exhausted at one point that it hurts to look. Perhaps viewers are not their entertainment rather reflecting reality now. <br /> <br /> Recommended especially for martial artists.
