I copied my video from this to DVD so I can enjoy it whenever I want and it also makes a very successful (and rare) wedding day! It's just a wonderful adaptation of a beloved novel. Everything about it is just perfect and it matures very well. There is always a chance with something so old that it may seem a bit crunchy to more modern dramas, but "Precious Bane" more than its own. <br /> <br /> The quality of the play is wonderful with Janet McTeer's superior caution and a young Clive Owen makes a stump like the taciturn Gideon Sarn. <br /> <br /> I challenge someone to look the final order without sniffing on the sheer romance of it all. This is the perfect movie to watch when it is cold outside and you are washed on the couch. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend it enough.
