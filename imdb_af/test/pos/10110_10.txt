"A Sister of Two Sisters" is a brilliant South Korean psychological abomination that left me speechless. The movie offers some wonderful moments of horrible horror and is extremely creepy. The small role players are really great, with Im Imoyingly starring Im Soo-Jung. The direction of Kim Ji-living is well treated and cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The plot is slightly confusing, but some scenes are wonderful anxiety. The action is pretty slow, but I was not bored in the Tale of Two Sisters "with" Ringu "and" Cairo "one of the most original Asian horror movies I've ever seen. as soon as possible My rating: 10 out of 10.
