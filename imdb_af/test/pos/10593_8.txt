I don't know what it is about the CKY crew, but everything they produce seems to be genius in its simplicity and stupidity. Haggard is so incredibly stupid and funny that it is almost comical excellence. Sometimes it makes absolutely no sense, but who cares? <br /> <br /> It made me laugh my ass. A must-have for the CKY / Jackass aficionado!
