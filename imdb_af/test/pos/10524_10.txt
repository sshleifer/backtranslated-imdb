Since this movie was released 8 years before I was born, I didn't feel so bad about watching it for so long. Back in January 98, however, I attended the second annual Quentin Tarantino film festival in Austin, Texas. The particular theme of the movies was the Night "Ignore 70's Crime Movies" and the boy was her right. "The Gravy Train (or The Dion Brothers, as it appeared)" was an absolute gem. Wonderful performances, peculiar characters, clever plot, hilarious comedy, and just a great time. Rarely do you see a crime movie that is so entertaining and fresh. Margot Kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is also very sexy. I hope some cable networks take up this movie and it allows much more to see it. Meanwhile, go to an indie video store and hope they have it.
