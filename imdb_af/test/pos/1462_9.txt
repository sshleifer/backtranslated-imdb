The new series, Man to Man with Dean Learner, focuses on Garth's manager, publisher and publicity agent, as played by Richard Ayoade. <br /> <br /> Nightclub owner, restaurateur, publisher, international playboy - Dean Learner is a one-man brand. <br /> <br /> Following his co-financed Garth Marenghi's Darkplace Channel, Channel 4, he has now invited you to his luxury penthouse apartment for a new, entertaining and extremely stylish TV talk show. <br /> <br /> Man to Man with Dean Learner will include all Dean's remaining well-known friends, as well as very lively music and delicious fish dishes in a show-class range - but not fish! <br /> <br /> I attended two of the live recordings and it had me in stitches. There are clear comparisons with Alan Partridge's Knowing Me Knowing You in the layout, but Richard Ayoade and Matt Holness's unique writing style takes it to another level. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Darkplace, you can't miss it. Catch it if it is broadcast late in summer
