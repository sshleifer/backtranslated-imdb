Well, I have to say, this movie was probably the funniest movie I've seen all year. And that doesn't make it good. It's probably the most pathetic movie I've seen for a while, yet it is so hilarious. you can say that these people are really trying to act, unfortunately for them they do not do such a good job, and so even lines delivered in what is supposed to be a serious tone come out sounding really funny. Aaron Carter basically plays a character that is actually similar to himself in real life, and he still manages to make the character look ugly and not realistic at all. This movie is one of those movies where everything that is supposed to sound serious comes very funny and all the things that are supposed to be funny are just as stupid and stupid to laugh because you know how hard they try. This movie is so bad, it's really good. I would definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for a good laugh.
