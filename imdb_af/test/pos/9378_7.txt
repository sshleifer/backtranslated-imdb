Edward Dmytryk directs this shadow film about a murder investigation with demobilized military personnel. Robert Young teaches us hate, Robert Mitchum runs most of this photo, and Gloria Grahame repeats the feestiness she exhibited in "It's A Wonderful Life." This is Robert Ryan who gets the heart of the matter: anti-Semitism. He's so deep in his role as Monty Montgomery (Imagine parents named Lawrence call them son Larry!), That the drama is squarely on his shoulders, and he's more than the challenge. Without him, the movie would be commonplace. In his day, Ryan played some unforgettable villains ("Bad Day at Black Rock;" "Billy Budd"), but this show put him on the map. With Sam Levene as the murder victim.
