This movie was a pleasant surprise because I didn't expect much. I didn't know that some of the actors have since become bigger stars in the big pix. As you move to the Matrix, it's not a plus in my book (it hates it). I'm sure it's a career plus for Hugo. James Purefoy is great in this and Jennifer Ehle is sweet and wonderful. It looked like a Carnaby street 30 years later, but I enjoyed the savings store Janis Joplin, blended with the modern mindset of sexual and gender disorder. The broker who has an erotic relationship with his lists is great fun. The Iron John man's group meetings are a bit dated, but I still loved them. This is a social satire sex comedy in the best way and reminds me a bit of the old "Carry On" movies. The British know how to do sex comedy and this is an old tradition, unlike the United States which is too adorable to really understand that sex is funny.
