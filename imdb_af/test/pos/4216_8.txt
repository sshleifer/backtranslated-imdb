It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series is, in my opinion, the best of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just fantastic in this movie. For dolls it was better than a few actors who came to mind (Freddie Prince Jr. for one) and more funny than many comedies I saw in the past. <br /> <br /> The plot wasn't good, but I really didn't care. Just to see how Chucky and Tiffany bump and fight each other. And the end leaves it wide open for a 5th successor (which I hear is in the works). Idle Hands premiers next week and seem to be another horror / comedy, but I doubt it will be the one.
