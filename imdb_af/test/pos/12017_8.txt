This movie is a sought after member of my movie library. While it's not a mainstream movie, it is, in my opinion, a highly effective film noir in which Eric Roberts is totally underestimated as an actor. (I will qualify him as a much better actor than his sister Julia, who is over-rated, but it's another review ...) Roberts plays the former reporter with the perfect blend of narrative precision idealism: two components that are part of any effective film noir. The first person told by Roberts increases the quality of the movie and keeps us the right motive behind the crime. <br /> <br /> In Palm Springs, everything about the environment in the movie becomes slow as a metaphor for the theme of oppression: Asch (Roberts) is being suppressed by his past; Police are oppressed by the rich inhabitants of Palm Springs who treat them as servants; Meanwhile, the rich are suppressed by boredom (see Johnny Depp's classical performance as the enlightening rich child who just wants to be loved ...); the isolation of each character is omnipresent and is further enhanced by the heat and isolation of the desert. <br /> <br /> There is an audience for this movie if they are looking for a more contemporary version of film noir. While there are elements of the movie that might be stricter, I recommend getting a copy of this movie and fix it between The Big Sleep and Chinatown in your movie library. (The film is based on the Arthur Lyons book, CASTLES BURNING, and if you like Roberts's play in this one, you might want to get a copy of The Ambulance, showing his lighter, lighter side.) BEST LYN IN THE MOVIE: "Careful? Careful about what? I had to ask. Only foolish ignore the strange warnings of trailer ladies."
