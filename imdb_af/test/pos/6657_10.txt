I just saw the DVD and loved it. I especially thought the director and Jude and Nicole did a wonderful job with the kiss between Inman and Ada just before Inman left. It was the most romantic kiss I've ever seen in a movie. I thought it was necessary to set the tone for the rest of the movie; It succeeded in making it credible that Inman and Ada would wait / wait for each other, respectively, without ever having a relationship. I thought the movie managed this important plot point much better than the book itself. I'm sure many of you will be quick to call other movie boxes that are the best of this one, but this one is for me! Jude and Nicole showed incredible chemistry in the lack of scenes they had together.
