This film makes several nods for various science fiction films. The prologue reminds me of one for the original theater version of THX-1138 (the trailer for BUCK ROGERS, here it was from some early Japanese SF TV shows). Then the opening shot of the city in 2345 hit the dragon's leaf with a billboard, and immediately reminded BLADERUNNER. The BLADERUNNER aspect comes even more <br /> <br /> when we meet the hero, who is called a Replicant. He is blonde-haired and named Ryo, a tribute to Roy Batty, Rutger Hauer's character in BLADERUNNER?). A battle scene is coming soon, which one reminds you of THE MATRIX right away. The government, which forces the drug to take drugs, is like THX-1138 and the chief enforcer, while it looks like a cross between Elvis and Dan Ackroyd, seems to be a robot, much like the TERMINATOR. The final reminds one of TERMINATOR 2 and the end result is hilarious. Probably not one of the best SF movies out there, but is nice, definitely much nicer than a trip like BATTLEFIELD EARTH.
