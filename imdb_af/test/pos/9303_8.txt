I find it remarkable that so little was actually done with the story of the a-bomb and it has been developed decades after the Manhattan project is completed. My suspicion is that this was due to serious fears in the film and entertainment industries (in the 1950s and 1970s) with "McCarthyism" and related national security phobias (including the Hollywood blacklist). There was one film in the 1950s (with Robert Taylor) about spotlight. Paul Tibbits who flew the Enola Gay into the Hiroshima bombing, but otherwise nothing else. One can look at a tragedy of the U.S.S. Indianapolis shortly after the delivery of the bombs to Tinian in Robert Shaw's description of the shark attacks on the survivors in JAWS. But the real trials of Groves, Oppenheimer, and their team were not considered filmmaking. <br /> <br /> And in 1989, two films appeared. I have already checked one (DAY ONE) I feel the better of the two is to discuss the long technical and emotional and political issues in the Manhattan project. The actions of Brian Dennehy as General Groves and David Strahairn as Oppenheimer were first class and neatly balanced. Small side vignette over the anti-bomb crusade of Szilard (Michael Tucker) helps fill the story well. <br /> <br /> This is the problem here. Paul Newman is a good actor (like Dennehy), but Newman approached Groves in another way. However, it's not terribly less than Dennehy's intelligent but soft-spoken military buyer. Newman seems to pop over the possibility of the weapon as the biggest stick to confront other boys in the after-school yard. Yes, it certainly was, but the real Groves would have been more if Dennehy didn't think about that big toy of the future, but on the business of creating that big toy. <br /> <br /> Dwight Schultz's actions as Oppeheimer help maintain the film's basically interesting and good production, with the help of Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. But the most interesting aspect of this movie is the upgrading of the two tragedies of Daghlian and Slotin, especially the latter, in the character of John Cusack's Merriman. In all technological advances, people are killed. It's just that these two tragedies (on top of the tens of thousands lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) brought home the dangers of the new unleashed power in a so-called peaceful controlled experiment. The two tragedies (especially Louis Slotin's slow, malignant death by radiation poisoning) have shown how much care was needed to use atomic power - and how the chances of the chances are still causing disaster. The only other thing I saw in Cusack's performance (and the writing) and the actual incident at Slotin was that Slotin actually took a while to find out where all his fellow research scientists were when they by the radiation of the accident (he could show that he only has the full effect of the accidental explosion, so only the other relatively small treatment is needed). Perhaps the complete story of Slotin's actions is too technical for the screen, but due to the terrible pain he eventually suffered, he took time to think of the other who was a first-class person he really was.
