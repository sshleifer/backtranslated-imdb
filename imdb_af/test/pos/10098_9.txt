This film definitely deserves to be placed within the horror genre, but not for obvious reasons. The horror of a story of two sisters does not lie with sudden shocks or great help from CGI intestines and gore; It is a psychological horror movie that captures the viewer's curiosity from the beginning and builds an exciting aura of mysteries and questions throughout. Best of all, the end doesn't give a clear answer, forcing the viewer to analyze what they have seen and making their own thoughts about what really happened. <br /> <br /> Don't be put off by the seemingly. Slow down the speed at which the movie starts, and don't expect to jump out of your seat right away. It's not the conventional hack-and-slash movie with orchestral sticks designed to scare you especially for nothing. A story of two sisters slowly builds an atmosphere of terror, a horror of the unknown and a fear of things missing until the end of the statement. Even when the final conclusion is revealed, it is not so heavy and obvious that the whole film falls neatly in place. The movie requires the viewer to look back at what they have seen and to try it squarely with the frightening revelation of the final scene. Some things will still be open to interpretation, and it is one of the joys to watching a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The true fear of a story of two sisters is not in shock or striking scare. ; It is a psychological, gut-wrenching horror that covers the convention and expands a genre to proportions so far unexplored by traditional horror film.
