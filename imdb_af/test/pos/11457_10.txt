I remember watching this movie as a kid and I was full of awe, I couldn't lose sight of the television. This movie has everything for horror fans! This movie didn't expect any funny moments to make some one liners at Stooge (who was my favorite character in the movie). Kevin Tenney directed this jewel and did a great job with a low budget. I thought the end was wonderful the only thing that could stop them from surviving by night was their unstoppable killing machines! the effects done by Steve Johnson are excellent. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a love for low budget horror movies, because as the old saying goes, they no longer make them like this. The successors were also pretty good, but not as good as good as the original. It's a must in any horror collection, buy it if you can get it, you won't be disappointed
