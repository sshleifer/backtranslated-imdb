I saw this movie as a child about 30 years ago and I haven't forgotten it yet. I couldn't tell if it was a good picture. But in those days I immediately fell in love with Jean Simmons. The memories focus on the very erotic feel of the movie, but I still remember the plot. Simmons was very young, and there is another movie that gave me the same feeling: David Lean's GREAT EXPECTATION. And again it was the young Jean Simmons. It is a pity that BLUE LAGOON is not available on video; I'd like to fix my memories ...
