This Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle comedy is best remembered for a young Buster Keaton, fresh from the division of his family's rugged Vaudeville act, into his film debut. Buster plays a significant role in this movie and it is quite a funny one overall. "The Butcher Boy" laughed a lot and was an example of pure old-fashioned slapstick well done, but it seems to come from the short period of two-line comedies when filmmakers have still featured in one-line segments as a matter of course . <br /> <br /> The first half of the film takes place in a general store, with Arbuckle as the butcher of the title. It is an excuse to exploit the many possibilities for quick physical humor that a general store offers, and Arbuckle reveals himself as a 300-pound acrobat, showing subtlety, skill and grace in carrying out that awkward slapstick. Routines were raising them to another level. A running prop accidentally overturned him a large slaughter knife so that it stuck accurately in the correct position in the cutting edge and I am still amazed that Arbuckle really looks it every time. There is also a very nice yawn that leans on its scale and is confused as to why its slices of meat weigh so much. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is a boy who comes in to buy molasses, and he does well in a foot-to-floor routine that follows. Apart from the strange and almost restless half stroke, his idiosyncratic attitude and body language immediately make him recognizable as the Buster we know. He even has his ultimate brand-weary hat. Here it is first destroyed if it is filled with molasses, of course. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film moves into more situation-based comedy and Arbuckle and his rival Al St. John dressed in the drag to infiltrate Fatty's girlfriend's boarding school. Much of the humor also comes from the generally surrealistic and mysteriously laughing impression of these two strange fellows wearing suits and trying to be "girls." Buster is also in this segment, but sometimes there are occasionally occasional help. John. <br /> <br /> The ending of "The Butcher Boy" becomes a little emptily-frenetic, but overall its interest in its curiosity is a well-done comedy that just gets the knockout laugh it go for it.
