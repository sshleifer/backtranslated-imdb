People seem to be here for Citizen Kane! The planet is a B-monster movie and as such it is fun and different enough to enjoy. The director clearly has something to offer - not so sure about some of the role players. As for the securities? Â£ 8,000 is not a lot of effect budget. I'd like to recommend this outing for a sci-fi head or someone who doesn't take monster movies seriously. If so? Look 3colors blue instead. I noticed one review says it ripped out of Alien. Like Alien, it didn't break. The best thing about the movie? The director. The worst thing about the movie? The cast. Maybe it's time for the director to move from Glasgow to London and find talent. Meanwhile - well done. At least you try to do something.
