It's a wonderful romantic comedy about love, work, public taste, and middle crisis. The main character is a talented film director who decides to make a crazy PG-13 movie to get rid of with the IRS. It has an excellent role-play, a wide variety of humor (from dodpan to slapstick) and fine print. It is also a furious act of the film industry. The meta commentary includes several excellent cuts between the reality and the film being made, and in some cases the film departs from strict realism. The result is a multidimensional masterpiece of brutal midlife humor.
