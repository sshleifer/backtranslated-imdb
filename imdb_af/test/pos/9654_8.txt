Philippe Garrel lets us breathe the forgotten atmosphere of the Nouvelle Vague, almost lost under the remnants of his old splendor, but ready to rise again if he is reminded of the past. Those who are a little familiar with the directors' subjects may well know how he is obsessed with a passing sense of loss as to the reality of reality. "Les amants regulars" thus show us the parallel stories of an "amour fou" and of a requested revolution under the guidance of young French students. <br /> <br /> The first part of the story About the dramatic events of May '68 in France, it's in a series of amazing plans, a kind of cinema verite style, the student uprising in anything other than ' an enviable light against a black-colored background. <br /> <There is much that can be said about the peculiarities of black and white photography used to describe the struggle between students and police, where the high contrasts give an unrealistic atmosphere to the rows and darkness. include the excited bodies they pack. in mystery. The images, completely deprived of words, show the real consistency of the myth, made of rough violence, which is increasingly emphasized by the rotten reality of the film shooting. The individual does not count anything here: he tends to disappear into the mass. What is really important in this scene is the meaning of the mass proposal, the blind rage of the youth assault, sinister promises of the power of the gang, even if they are apart from any kind of emotion, with the cold and Far look at an entomologist who wants to catalog his insect collection. <br /> <br /> The second part of the story is described in a quieter and most intimate way. Standing on the horizon from the disturbing portrait of a self-centered generation in search of its lost time, totally disillusioned with the individual values ​​of men, who tend to turn on their own between opium gases and a funeral ration in the praise of his. recent defeat. <br /> <br /> "Les amants regulars" seem to occasionally call, review and correct the shadow of the great Robert Bresson by Garrel's particular sensitivity without drifting away from the main argument on the subject of human disillusionments which, although painful, can bring us to the truth. In my opinion, trying to penetrate deep into the underground of the story, if one lets himself play with the ear, he will probably find that he can bring out the dark side of his self with tremendous and irreparable consequences.
