Great movie! The soundtrack is great! Very relaxing sound. Elton was in his own time even in 1971. Lewis Gilbert has done a wonderful job and directed this film! The film was romantic and fresh air. The soundtracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie on a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song "Honey Roll" and the poem "Richard Le Gallienne, what I want to do," was incredible! Kudos for everyone involved in this fantastic movie! It was no surprise that many of the people involved in this movie became the best in their field.
