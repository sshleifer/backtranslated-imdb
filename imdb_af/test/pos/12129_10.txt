"Let me ask you another question." Ha! what a great soon .. this movie was brilliant fantastic acting, great writing. The only reason no one noticed it was because of the low budget that everyone would agree with me that it was a cult, like Donnie Brasco. It shows another young Joe Pesci as a mobster. This film is with the cults. it had some sopranos and some goodfellas chased his idea for the soprano when he watched it and Scorsese found Joe Pesci while he was watching it. It proves to be good, I'm right or am I wrong? I must admit they showed one brilliant scene where they throw peanuts on a piano player "Stop with the friggen peanuts".
