After a long time in the West End, this charming film Margaret Rutherford as the chieftain 'Miss Whitchurch' in this financially successful adaptation made in 1950 is re-entrusted. <br /> <br /> All indoor shots took place at Riverside studios in Hammersmith. , London. The outside tones were filmed at a public girl's school near Liss in Hampshire. During the 12-week shoot, both Margaret Rutherford and Joyce Grenfell stayed in a hotel in the area and would regularly visit them the night where they would enjoy the right schoolgirls. <br /> <br /> Although the movie's script contains only two original lines of the original play that are leading and supporting actors in fine form and you can only feel sympathetic to their problems, especially in the final scenes.
