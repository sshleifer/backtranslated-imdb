This is one of Stan Laurel's best solo comedies, before 1927 with Oliver Hardy. Laurel is a very good actor in the film and offers good comedy. The best scene in the film is when Stan dance with Mae Laurel (his real common law lawyer), at the Cafe Espanol. Stan does stupid dances that are funny, without hearing the music. I would recommend it to any Stan Laurel fan.
