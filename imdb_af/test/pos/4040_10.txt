It's a great movie, and I'm still crazy about it! It's just as magical and fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you won't be disappointed! The characters are always so tempting, so really, you just love them! The story of Gerda and Kai who fall in love will really surprise you and put that little spark of magic into your life. <br /> <br /> I don't see how anyone would care if the movie fits the book, I mean the movie was incredible! I didn't even read the book, and guess what? I do not care. In fact, if the film and the book are so different, you can call them two separate stories and be happy. <br /> <br /> I thought the acting was bloody brilliant! Bridget Fonda plays the Snow Queen, so angry and so cold - you just hate her. Chelsea Hobbs plays Gerda, a beloved girl who is determined to find her love, no matter what it needs, and continues on a wonderful adventure. And I love all the Snow Queen's sisters (spring witch, summer princess and autumn robber). They are so nice and different in many ways. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie yet. , so forgive me if I make a slight mistake .... but there is no doubt that I will always love this movie.
