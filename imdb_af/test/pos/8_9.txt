I am a Nursery 1st Class (E-6) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and feel that this movie represents the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were caught far away. The disturbed was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) invaded the sink to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room ... this would never happen. Swimmers may not enter inside any vessel, regardless of the circumstances. Secondly, the Command Center (presumably in Kodiak), it looks more like a NASA mission center ... we don't have any hi-tech equipment. Third, the Captain of the Airstation will not run the search and rescue business with about 10 people on the watch. In fact, it would be an E-6 or E-7 as the SAR controller and maybe 2 other support staff such as an assistant SAR controller and a radio wizard. Otherwise, the film was dead, I think they had to take up more of the other rates in the CG and their roles in search and rescue instead of just aviation-based tariffs. Some of the screens of a school reminded me of my days and the stupid things I did and got into trouble in my younger days.
