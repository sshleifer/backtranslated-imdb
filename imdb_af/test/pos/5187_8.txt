I recently bought it on DVD, as I didn't hear it and like Robert Carlyle. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie won't have Hollywood special effects, as it said the special effects were decent enough, and the play was also good. <br /> <br /> I found the movie to be enjoyable and unpleasant. For almost 2 hours it's just the right length for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> Don't expect exciting explosive action from start to finish, but it's a pretty balanced movie with a decent storyline!
