It is an art film and a festival film, which is confronted in a Roman cinema in the Italian festival (not as bad as it sounds). It is guaranteed to charm and entertain such audiences for its distinctive style, droll humor; ability to draw comedy from the suffering of others; attractive, joyful music; spot-on performances; dominant sweetness and humanity - but doomed for its strangeness and lack of a compelling story line, to surprise the average audience and to wonder what they are watching it and why someone admires it, even how it was made. <br /> Andersson gives us almost a series of dry sketches. Going through them is different themes. Money: A man at the next table (Waldemar Nowak) notices the wallet of a rich drill that speaks on a cell phone in a restaurant over a glass of brandy, and then orders a set of good packs to order; A dead boy calls his celebrated father away from an extensive meeting to beg him for another loan. A shrill worry aloud about his exhausted investments while his wife wears him in bed in bed, just a shiny Viking helmet. <br /> <br /> Depression: An elementary teacher (Jessica Nilsson) breaks out in class because her husband is a "harpy;" The fellow's spouse (Pär Fredriksson) falls in front of clients because he called her so. Several men have depressed dreams. But hey, it's Sweden. Not everyone is depressed? Love Problems: A fat bohemian couple continually breaks up; A girl group has fantasies about a main guitarist, Micke (Eric Bäckman). Women sneak doors when their men start practicing their instruments. (Of course, music is also a unifying theme. Besides the guitarist, there is a tuba and a drummer who is in a Dixierland band and also plays in marches and funerals. Each scene has an extra lil of music, which niftily connecting to another one.) An outrageous storm outside the window of many scenes, violent rain, people out there, thunder so loud, it looks like a battle that moves across the country. It also facilitates the tone and gives the impression that different scenes occur on the same frightening day. <br /> <br /> Andersson is a master of visual composition and the static middle spacer and the film has a dull gray-green look designed by DP Gustav Danielsson who is perfect because it evokes the dark winter of Swedish winter. but also with the subtle colors of the director's white, ending every scene with a smile. One who hardly ever knew could be so beautiful. (Or maybe one has done: Alexcanr Sokurov sometimes creates such effects in many different contexts.) Within scenes and in the film as a whole, there is some kind of silence from the visual style, the tempo of scenes and the detached humanism of the general. prospect. There is something about a fully mastered style that is soothing, reassuring. <br /> <br /> Not everything works equally well. One can feel impatient with the follow-up of rare related scenes, which read too much, such as the work of a Live Night writer who needs Prozac. As some scenes move you clearly or make a laugh, it is obvious that others are falling flat. <br /> <br /> But some scenes are real singers, and a clear triumphant climax of pure magic is a dream described and then digitized dreams are another important thread in which the girl group suggests itself in a wedding dress recently married to its versatile guitar specialism, which plays a delicate series of riffs while a crowd gathers admirers outside a large window. The view varies from outside, and the window slowly slides away as if the building that looks like the dream is true, is a train that moves from a station to take them to their honeymoon. It is a fresh, subtle and rather sublime effect. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, one can feel everything in you. The Living (Du Levande) is a dream, including the recurring scene where the barman always beats a bronze bell and announces the last ordering time, after which all the foolish customers come out of their tables and go to drink one more drink. <br /> <br /> An Italian reviewer called this a small, good movie, and that's right. It limits him in a dozen ways, but there is greatness in it. Roy Andersson is a small master (like a medieval miniaturist) of the inner comedies of Scandanavian's gloom, and this is a film, unlike any other. This year, as an "Un Certain Regard" series in Cannes, is also the Swedish award for the 2007 best foreign Oscar. Hard to say what Bergman would think, but Andersson worked with him; is known for its excited TV commercials, some of which can be seen on YouTube. Bergman calls them "the best advertising in the world." It will be interesting to see if this director, whose vessel is as subtle as his point of view, will start working in longer segments in a certain time. Meanwhile, any good movie buffalo should really look after this. <br /> <br /> "Schadenfreude" is not quite the right word. This means enjoyment in the misery of others. Andersson teaches us to enjoy in the misery of all of us.
