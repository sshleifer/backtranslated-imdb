The Oscar Award 'Kramer vs. Kramer 'follows a funny businessman Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and his divorce with his bored wife (Meryl Streep). One day, Ted's wife leaves him and their child looking for a better life, forcing Ted to get closer to his son (Justin Henry). The two bands are very close (but just after friction), and just as everything goes perfectly, Ted's wife comes back to town and wants to supervise their son alone. Ted then goes on a mission not to take his son away from him, and fights his wife in court. Dustin Hoffman gives Meryl Streep a tremendous performance and young Justin Henry is impressive. This is a sad emotional roller coaster of a movie, but it is a very well-made and inspirational movie. The film featured the Best Picture Oscar at the 1979 Oscar Awards, along with Best Actor for Hoffman and Best Supporting Streep. If you're not a tearjerker, Kramer vs Kramer is a great movie to watch. Degree: B +
