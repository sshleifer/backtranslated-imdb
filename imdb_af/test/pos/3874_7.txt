"Back in the day" is an interesting but erroneous attempt. Yes Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, an honest but sad man who tries to handle the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie is also in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the minister's daughter. Now he must choose: Love or Crime. <br /> <br /> Yes Rule does a good job as Reggie. At least he tries to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone. He brings a lot of energy and threatens the role. Joe Morton as the preacher is his usual excellent self, but he does not do much. Same problem for Giancarlo Esposito as Reggie's Dad. He needs more screen time. I don't want to say that, but Pam Grier is pretty awful like Mrs. Cooper. She persuades every scene and brings the movie down. Tia Carrere and Frank Langella are in it, but do nothing for the plot. <br /> <br /> In the end: You should see it for the capable performances of Ving Rhames and Joe Morton and the eagerness of writing and directing.
