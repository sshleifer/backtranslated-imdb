I watched it at a local station the other night because I didn't feel like watching a hit like 'American Idol'. Peter Strauss gives a good performance as an offender named 'Rain' Murphy who likes himself. He acknowledges his crime and makes no bones that he is not ashamed of it. His cell is bare of any comfort that other prisoners have books and pictures. The only time he feels in another zone is going on. He does this often and can last a mile in less than four minutes. When a college coach hears about this, he wants to predict himself in the Olympics. Initially, 'Rain' doesn't want a part of it, but when his best friend is killed, he shows interest. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie season. Strauss is very good (what did you expect, anything less?) And Michael Mann shows great tips that will be full of years later. This movie had that little realism (probably because it was filmed under convicts). It almost feels like it was a real story. The additional casting is good. There are many notable names like Brian Dennehy, Roger E. Mosley and Richard Moll. <br /> <br /> My heart sank when a pumping board of directors wouldn't let him run because he didn't. feels bad for his crime. His final act left me alone and brave. When they took away his dreams, he took them back hard. It was back when TV movies were really good. "The Jericho Mile" is a jewel of a movie. ESPN Classic, PLEASE SHOW THIS FILM !!!
