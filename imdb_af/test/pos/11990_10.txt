I'm here in a big minority. I also don't care much about the original caddyshack, except the chase / murray duo scene and choose rodney jokes. okay, break it down: rodney vs jackie-both jewish and have similar humor. rodney is a bigger name and more obvious. Jackie has a casual and more observational approach to his jokes and is more "up yours" in this sequel. Jackie's attitude towards everything is memorable and in a way, inspiring! his quick lines and confidence left me and wanted me to express myself like that. Rodney was good but there wasn't enough of him, and he was more "in your face" and dismissal. Jackie, in a rare movie look, makes a perfect sub for rodney (come on, a gun-shaped hairdryer?!?!) Really, look at the little things! <br /> <br /> Walking vs Knight both play snobby yuppies very well. ted knight, despite his wonderful TV / movie career, he shows his age. but he pulls the sneaky demands off the part and we want to see him fall. Ted looks a little weak and is pretty annoying, slapstick his anger and frustration, while pile is more clever and shaky; you really hate him and enjoy him constantly failing. stack up with me. <br /> <br /> Both murray vs uykroyd-well, both have large, vintage SNL-like scenes featuring the ever-present and enjoyable Chevy Chase (ty web). I like the murray / chase one better. murray plays his big, annoying, chattering character with obvious improvisation skills and is loving - but annoying. and exactly the same can be said for everyone. both become annoying after a while, but it is a tie. <br /> <br /> I really loved part 2 first. they are two completely different devices. part one is more drug / bathroom / sex humor with a throw full of big names. Part 2 uses golf as a backdrop for a stick-it-to-the-rich type of comedy that makes people feel better than the working class. 80's script? Yes. a little far-fetched? Yes, but wasn't the first one? an insult to the sport of golf? Yes, it's a movie. thin story? Yes, it is a comedy with real humor - not 'dancing with wolves' !! Except - Part 2 has a much better soundtrack !! PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT SHARE AN INSURANCE! It is 98% its own movie and should not have the name CADDYSHACK in it. that said, i'm a big fan of caddyshack 2 and it's a great exponent of 80's fluff entertainment with quality humor. VIVA JACKIE MASON !!! after all the reducers-lit! It's a great comedy of its own. Randy Quaid was wonderful, Jonathan Silverman was wonderful, heck, everyone was !! All this chat and now I feel it! I think I will
