Brain of Blood begins as Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley). The leader of a country called Kahlid is close to death due to cancer. If he dies, however, Kahlid will tear apart without anyone so doctor Robert Nigserian (Grant Williams) and one of Amir's dedicated Mohammed (Zandor Vorkov) designed a plan to take Amir's dead body to America where the bad scientist Dr. Lloyd Trenton (Kent Taylor) will transplant his brain into a fresh body and with a little plastic surgery no one will ever know he was even dead. Things don't go according to plan, but when the time comes to deploy Amir's brain. Trenton's freak assistant Gor (John Bloom) brings a dead body from someone who has fallen off a balcony, Trenton needs a strong fit body and since there is no more He decides to put Gor's body as a temporary use stop gap until another suitable one can be found. Unfortunately when Amir wakes up in his new body, he is not very happy with what he sees. I mean, would you be if you found out that your brain was in a bad combustion? <br /> <br /> Also known as brain damage, The Brain, The Creature's Revenege & The Undying Brain, this cheap exploitation movie was produced and directed by one and only Al Adamason, and frankly, I am insulting at the pathetic 1.5 rating. Brain of Blood has on IMDb, personally I think it's fantastic. fun in so bad it is a good way. The highly entertaining script by Kane W. Lynn and Joe Van Rodgers is so funny and silly as they come from messy blood-soaked brain transplants to crazy mad scientists, from 7 foot tall scarring freaks who play with toy cars up to 4 feet long midget medical assistants, from basement bats to raffles, from car accidents to murder, kidnapping of skinny, dressed women, from Regina Carrol's hair to be self-reported during the opening credits for teenage girls trapped in the basement for blood to a laugh-out loud hilarious that includes some deep meaningful speech! It's all here and Brain of Blood stamped quality cheese everywhere. If you are a fan of bad low budget exploitation with a pleasure, then this movie should be right at the top of your list of movies. Despite the low 1.5 rating, I am proud to admit that I loved Brain of Blood. I thought it was an absolute must to watch, it weakened slightly to the end with a few too many shots of people wandering around doing nothing. Particularly, but until then, it has overtaken a rocket. At only 85 minutes, it's relatively short, it's hard to guess the mercy. I just think it's great fun. <br /> <br /> This is director Adamson's masterpiece as far as I'm concerned with Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971) he made a year before that. Those who have previously seen an Adamson movie will know about the non-existent production values, cheap special effects and cardboard sets and all this adds to the fun. This film manages the fine between impossibility and seriousness to create an unforgettable viewing experience. I love the opening shot of Kahlid, which, of course, is just a picture of the Taj Mahal in India, complete with stately people in the foreground! Regina Carrol's hair looks like it's a separate entity on its own, the styles seem to change between shots and are frankly horrible, don't start me over her makeup, or she should apply with a paint sprayer ! There is another hilarious moment when we see that Amir's body is transported to America, which looks like ordinary tin foil. Why is the question I asked myself why? The effects are variable, there is a terrible search net spider. Gor's burnt makeup work is pretty bad, though there is a surprisingly gory brain removal that's actually pretty impressive. <br /> <br /> The budget for Brain of Blood should be virtually nonexistent, I have to admit I thought Trenton's lab was pretty good with various computers and medical instruments, although the rest of the movie was cheap and look nasty. The production values ​​are low, the music is taken from another movie Beast of Blood (1971) and the play is terrible, but in a nice way. <br /> <br /> Brain of Blood can have the best title for any mining film ever and as far as I'm concerned, it's a very entertaining piece of nonsense I've had a good time watching and laughing . Not only do they do it, they can't do it anymore, it's impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good movie, but bad movie lovers should enjoy it. I like it, but then I'm just strange.
