It's a simple fact that many of us are from the 80-year-old who grew up with the dear John Cusack comedies made by Savage Steve Holland. And while I was there, there is even more bizarre, out-there flick, Better Off Dead, it's hard for I love One Crazy Summer, a movie I grew up in, and loved my heart as a kid my teens. OCS was a sequel to Beter Off Dead, who returned Cusack and Curtis Armstrong. <br /> <br /> Cusack is Hoops, after graduation profile Joel Murray (George) to Nantucket for summer for anyone having fun on the beach. Hoops find himself in a feud designated with a blonde, buffy punk named Teddy Beckersted whose lecherous father has designs over the home of a neighborhood to build a giant condominium. One of the homes that need to pay the mortgage belongs to Demi Moore (Cassandra). There is a sailing boat race that can be their only hope to save Cassandra's grandfather's home. He has recently passed, but has been won by Teddy for the past few years. Hoops are deadly afraid of boats over water. But, with the help and motivation of the new Nantucket friends (such as Bobcat Goldwait and Tom Villard as auto-mechanical twin brothers!), George, and emerging love interests Cassandra, Hoops may be able to win the race for the environment with his fears and win. ed. Armstrong has a supporting role as the son of a boiling manic weapon seller, General. Raymond (.. SCTV's Joe Flaherty in an inspired piece of casting), Ack, using his father's training to help Hoops and the company win their race goals. <br /> <br /> Memorable scenes include Bobcat jammed in a Godzilla suit (!) chasing an entire model of Aguilla Beckersted (Mark Metcalf, barely recognizable as Teddy's rather unhinged pops) condominium, Hoops by George, a victim of venomous flatulence, Bruce Wagner's quirky uncle Frank's growing madness, has tried every time his chances of winning 1 million dollars from a radio show and the wonderful Billie Bird as George's grandmother the group after dinner! Jeremy Piven as (you guessed it) a brutal jerk associated with Teddy and causing problems for Hoops and his posts, the nice Kimberly Foster as Cookie. Teddy's girlfriend trying to make out Hoops while attending a lunch at his attendance. father) and one and only William Hickey as Old Man Beckersted, who will not reward his son and grandson if they lose the sailing boat. Demi Moore is cute, but it is Cusack's vehicle, though Bobcat and Villard steep most of the scenes. Another beautiful animation from Holland is sprinkled by the film (Hoops is an artist, appropriate). If you like his movies, I guess the underrated How I was at college.
