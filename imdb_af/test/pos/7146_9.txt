This movie was recommended to me by the same person who blessed me with a copy of The Chronicles of Narnia. Shadowlands is one of the most wonderful screens ever written. It is well executed, acted and directed. The cinematography is a little dark for my taste, but I'm sure it was meant to be so. The screenplay is like poetry in parts of the movie, through the movie I found myself thinking about the comments made just on the screen. It's a wonderful piece of cinema and I can only hope more people will run over it and add reviews. Just a warning though it was a 6 tissue film. Very gripping. Very cordial achievements.
