Since this cartoon was made in the old days, Felix talks with cartoon bubbles and the animation style is very rough compared to today. But compared to his contemporaries, it is a pretty good cartoon and still holds good. This is because, despite his age, the cartoon is very creative and funny. <br /> <br /> Felix meets a man whose shoe business folds because he can't sell shoes. Well, Felix needs money so he can go to Hollywood, so he tells the guy at the store, he'll get every shoe sold. Felix spreads gum all over the city and soon people get stuck and let their shoes out to buy new ones from the shoe store. In gratitude the man gives Felix $ 500! Felix's owner, however, wants to take the money and go alone, so Felix can make a way to sneak along. <br /> <br /> Felix is ​​there in a studio and a bit of a nuisance to himself. Along the way he meets cartoon versions of comics Ben Turpin and Charlie Chaplin. Eventually Felix is ​​discovered by luck and offered a movie contract. Hurray!
