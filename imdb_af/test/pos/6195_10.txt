Imagine your "24" totally uncensored, given free license to explain the situation in any detail needed and show how and why both key players do what they do to kill / prevent and you have an idea of ​​how good this is. TV series is. People in the US have long known that Showtime is the new HBO, they make much better cutting edge, powerful performances and that is no exception. The show completely captures the viewer by creating a sleeping bag until an attack is attempted, and incorporates important aspects such as faith, religion, funding, resources and needs. For the uninitiated, there is plenty to teach Muslim faith here. Unlike the mainstream shows such as "24" where the terrorists are only bags that shoot the good guys, their purpose and reasoning are fully investigated. What gives the show more credibility is the latest technology that the cell / FBI uses and the authentic shots in Europe, the US and the Middle East. No cost is spared to tell the story accurately. The role is relatively unknown, but the play is wonderful with the help of a tightly written writing that keeps the viewer constantly on the edge with many unexpected twists and turns. This show does not have the credit it deserves and ironically it is a bit of a sleeping slave himself, should anyone be interested in this genre
