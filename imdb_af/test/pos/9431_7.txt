Not too bad entry into the series, but with the sincere propaganda, but Rathbone & Bruce's sincerity keeps me happy. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic story from start to finish, how much McGuffin is there? Holmes (and Moriarty independently) decoded the Dancing Men code so quickly, was Amazing Watson - so why were you not surprised! The post explaining the bomb sight / reliever hurt me. It was just the kind of cheap trick Universal would play. It reminds me again that they did not expect people to consider it more than 60 years later. This (and I think every other Universal Pot Boiler during this period) was meant to see and forget once or twice. They may have realized that basically people do not change, that what was entertained for ordinary people in 1942 will still entertain a selected group (2005) and be written and fixed! <br /> <br /> At this time, Lionel Atwill fell into his Hollywood rape court, and I wonder if it was such or very effective makeup that made him look as bad as Moriarty? <br /> <br /> However, the key aspect of SW is that it was the first Holmes movie, Roy William Neill, I thought he aimed the rest and made everything but one, and thus a wonderful environmental continuity created.
