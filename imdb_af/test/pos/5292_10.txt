Maybe not Miyazaki's best work, but I couldn't help it, but I love it. A five-year-old boy finds what he thinks a goldfish is in a bottle. He saves his life and keeps it as a pet in a bucket, but it really is a magical being, the daughter of a human wizard and a sea goddess. Ponyo, as the boy calls her, is withdrawn by her father to the sea, trying to discourage her from returning to the land and man, but she gets his magical elixirs and does what she wants to do. The story is simple and cute. However, where the movie really gets alive, it's in his awesome artwork. The drawings are more childish than any of Miyazaki's other works, but there is beauty in his simplicity. As with all his films, Miyazaki creates this world of imagination that I was just as upset. To see it in the theater brought memories of how it was when Jo Hisaishi's opening notes washed Princess Mononoke over me and gave me a few dough a few years ago. The score is just as wonderful. I wanted to live in this world and never leave it.
