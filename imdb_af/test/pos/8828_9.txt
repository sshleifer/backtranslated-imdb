I strongly recommend it to anyone who has good plots, good actors (even if not known) (often just better), science and / or science fiction intelligently presented on the (small) screen, good special effects even if they didn't have billions of dollars to produce it. <br /> <br /> Much better than any war in the stars ... <br /> <br /> There was only one comment that was not needed: about the comet the commentator speaks that LIFE might be through a brought on earth. It's fun, there must always be a chance for a magical way, huh? It's great about LIFE, can come anywhere, no external power needed
