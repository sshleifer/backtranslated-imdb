Wow, I can't believe I'm the first and only one to comment on this big movie. <br /> <br /> Although the movie itself looks interesting enough, the real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt Lillard given the most people, thinking he is too caffeine happy or just sucking but we are the same age and the same sex and I have seen this man so many times that he is now one of my favorites. This is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and star type as in SLC Punk, another great Lillard movie. <br /> <br /> Bishops are storywise your ordinary movie, but with more twists and turns than anything that starts to fool. Also very remarkable in this movie is another great actor named Vincent D'onofrio, a very valuable person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she is not bad, although you know they rented her mainly for her accent and the latest scene.) <br /> <br /> This is a game jack vs jill vs bob as each. want to reap the rewards but not share with anyone. They all try to kill each other and it is a time bomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his true ability as the scheming JAck that initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and wife play a few artifacts that need money because of a lack of business. Vince's character is a bit corrupted and skitz's throughout the movie, but it only increases the intensity of the movie. <br /> <br /> The left and right surprises are well received and the end is very non-clich√© and makes you happy, maybe it depends on the type of ends you want. This movie was very interesting to me, except that Matt was on it, it's a good movie and I recommend it to everyone who likes movies. Critics will probably not like this movie, but they don't watch movies, because they like movies anyway.
