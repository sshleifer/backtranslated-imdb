For the sake of propaganda during World War II, Sherlock Holmes was moved to the then presence. One of the results is "Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon", with a top Holmes, Basil Rathbone, along with Nigel Bruce, Lionel Atwill, Dennis Hoey and Kaaren Verne. This is Holmes's mission to a scientist, dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) and his arms design to deliver to the British government before the Germans can get it. Once the man reaches England, his problems have just begun. Can Holmes decode the message Dr Tobel redeemed before he falls into the hands of the evil Moriarity, except the weapon and possibly the scientist? It's an effective Holmes story, located in the atmosphere of Switzerland and Blackout England. The series has just worked fine in the current day. It was not without his problems, but the problems had nothing to do with the period. What idea was it to make Watson an idiot? Nigel Bruce's characterization - supported and supported by the scriptures - has always been the false note. I prefer the characterization of Edward Hardwicke in the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series. There he is attractive, intelligent and a credible companion to Holmes. In the Rathbone series, Holmes is often judgmental and treats Watson like the clumsy fool he is. In this particular movie, however, Watson has the opportunity to be very helpful in several parts. <br /> <br /> I admit I'm a complete juice for Rathbone's recitation of Richard II - "... this blessed plot, this earth, this England" - I can't imagine how much it means to the British had to watch the film in 1942. Sherlock Holmes served his purpose purposefully.
