One of the best sitcoms to run with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar udhar on Indian television. Great acting, good pace and a very amusing script made this a memorable series. The fun-filled opening montage (sung by none other than the indifferent Kishore Kumar) has given a very accurate picture of what one can expect. I borrowed it from my local video library year after it stopped airing it. I wish Indian television would return to series like this rather than the asinine saas-bahu soap and reality television that is all good for these days. Anyone who is found to be really good comedy should go and get this series. You might also enjoy some Pakistani sitcoms like ups and downs and aik that are definitely comparable to India's best.
