This is not a BIG movie, as the cast (especially the kids) helps to carry this very sad but confronted plot together. This is filled with cliché on cliché. Poor family in 50's Central America, dying mother, alcoholic father, 10 children (one of whom has epilepsy) and a terrible decision. It is very easy to watch and some of the children's performances move without being sickly or naive. And little Frank and Warrnen steal the show for me with the last scene that makes me skew, no matter how many times I see it. A great rainy afternoon movie I recommend to everyone. Only those with the hardest of hearts could not be moved. Not to some extent Sophies Choice, but a good TV movie equivalent !!!
