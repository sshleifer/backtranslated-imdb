This movie is hilarious, bright and informative. Although the story may work well with virtually any ethnic group, the inherent Jewish character of the characters adds extra meaning to the abundance of wonderful dialogue. There were so many social issues covered in the plot that it would only be worth seeing; But the right treasure was in the hot laugh which spread throughout the appreciative audience. The medley of complex characters with their different strengths and weaknesses play their roles with all the pathos and humor one would expect from the Shakespeare drama that their lives seem like parody. It's a family movie; - about the often fragile, sometimes invisible bond of different personalities and lifestyles, first among brothers and sisters and parents, and inevitably among the larger family of friends and even strangers. The technical aspects of the film have given the movie a pace and development that keeps the viewer busy to the final scene. Peter Falk is incredible, as always, in his role as family patriarch Morris Applebaum. Strong performances by good role players include a surprise guest. Don't miss this movie!
