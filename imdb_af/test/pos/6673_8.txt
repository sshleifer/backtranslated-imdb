If you like movies that make you think, it's definitely one of the good things. I always liked David Lynch and Cronenberg. They always made high quality films. <br /> <br /> Iain Softley brilliantly aimed K-PAX. The movie tears in the feelings and philosophy of the mind and the world. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges both deliver excellent acting skills. It caught me, I didn't take my eyes off the screen during the movie. On the other hand, if you are looking for a special effect sci-fi movie, it is not for you. The story is dragged a bit, which can be a bit boring, but also works as a way to build the theme of the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this movie, I've done it.
