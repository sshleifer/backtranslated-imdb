Last night I saw a PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Oddly, it was 137 minutes long - slightly longer than the time listed on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Initially, I lost my interest in this movie because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me. The context for what happened was lacking and I am happy to stick to it. In the beginning, a young couple were married and shortly after the wedding broke out in their native Sri Lanka and the loved ones were divorced. Months later, the woman is very pregnant and aboard a refugee vessel to India. At a refugee center you see the woman giving birth - after which the titles after the film are finally revealed. <br /> <br /> The whole focus of the movie then changes completely - to a young girl who is about to turn 9 in Madras, India. You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family. Neither of these seem interesting or important and you wonder what is missing - how about the woman about to give birth? My wife and I discussed it and we finally guessed that this girl was actually the woman's wife in the first part of the movie. Somehow she was adopted and she talked to her mother and father # 2 about her life - although she didn't realize these people were not her biological parents. <br /> <br /> Shortly afterwards, parents revealed themselves to be total idiots (one of the complaints I had about the movie), as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parenting and that to tell you that the girl is emotionally screwed and confused. Despite a stupid decision and the worst way to tell her, the parents decided to help her find her biological mother. Since the impact had it all on the girl and parents (especially the adoptive mother), it was impressive to look at and surely give me interest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sri Lanka is involved in a very, very long and brutal civil war with Tamil militants, from and including, for three decades. The family's decision to return the mother to Sri Lanka was indeed noble, but sometimes stupid - because they took so many risks and were almost killed by just jumping into the middle of a war! It was all exciting and engaging, but also surprised me by the common sense of the adoptive parents. First you tell her she is NOT your biological child and now you take her in the middle of a WAR zone !!! Certainly, the child really wanted to meet her biological mother, but it was really stupid. If that were me, I might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and deceive the child - to be in the midst of a war! <br /> <br /> Despite my complaints, the movie was nice to watch and was very rewarding. Far from perfect, it certainly hits an emotional home. Also, while I was expecting it, since I watched several Indian movies, many Westerners will be a little surprised by the live songs that seem to come out - this is standard in most movies from India - including those in Bollywood is made. (Bombay) and Tamilwood / Kollywood (Madras).
