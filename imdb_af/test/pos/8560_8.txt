Of course, go in there, one would expect it to be a typical, stupid T&A flick, and that is. But it does have some pretty well thought out humorous moments. Given the era in which it was made and the obvious exploitation aspect, it is still one of the better B comedies of the time. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, you will of course see many of the screens in "Revenge of The Nerds" and many other movies of the same genre. Most of the acting is terrible, and WEG at the top, but that's exactly what I expect in such a movie. What it lacks in the way of acting ability, makes it more than the camp value, and ignores everything for merit. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing about this movie is that of course there was money going in it. Movies like this made today just don't have the same style. If you can turn off your brain and change your sense of humor for an hour and a half, you'll enjoy this movie. I dare anyone to at least find something in this movie that they think is funny, if not hilarious.
