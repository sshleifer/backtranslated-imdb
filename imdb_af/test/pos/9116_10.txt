I saw the MTV premiere of this movie last night and I had to tell everyone that this movie brought the thunder. Obviously, this movie will be most enjoyed by fans of the D, as it has many jokes for those who have seen the HBO series and more than enough D for newer fans and the mass of soon-to-convert. The music really shines with the new songs "Kickapoo" (which is much better than it sounds), "Master Exploder" (possibly the 3rd best song in the world) and "Dude (I miss you completely)". There is a load of excellent scenes (the car hunt, the rock-off, the meeting) and cameos (including Dave Grohl as Satan!). I can only keep on for hours, but I don't want to give the movie away. Go see it. You won't be disappointed.
