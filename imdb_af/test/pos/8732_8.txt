CACTUS FLOWER was a wonderful 1969 comedy based on a Neil Simon play about a dentist (Walter Matthau) who has a relationship with a young generous woman (Goldie Hawn). He is totally unaware that his dedicated nurse / assistant (Ingrid Bergman) is in love with him. Matthau can play this kind of role in his sleep and he does not disappoint as the doctor, dr. Julian Winston, who is one woman, but really has no idea that he is in love with the other. Goldie Hawn has won an Oscar for her sparkling performance as Toni Simmons, the obsolete flower child who realizes she is trapped in a dead-end career and not as dull as she is on the surface. But the real pleasure for me in this film was the performance of legendary Ingrid Bergman as Stephanie Dickinson, dr. Winston's completely dedicated assistant, who is willing to bury and sacrifice her own happiness, as long as Dr. Winston is happy with Tony. Bergman is light in this movie and looks absolutely beautiful (although the camera has always loved her) and shows an unforeseen talent for light comedy. Yes, the dialogue and settings are slightly dated, but the story is timeless and the performances by the stars immediately alert them.
