I will admit that in the past I had the opportunity to watch this movie, and after about 5 - 10 minutes I felt like many did. I expected a Monkey movie similar to the television program, but instead I was given. Well, I didn't know what I was given to be honest. <br /> <br /> But after I finally watched this movie I realized that I had not only a closed mind for the brilliance it portrays, but I also looked at myself over and over. It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, just because it watches me, because I'm trying to decipher its meanings. And just when I think I found out something in the movie, it destroyed the answer as soon as I watch the movie again. Glitter indeed. <br /> <br /> It seems that most people who didn't like this movie want to see a movie with a clear plot. They want to explain everything and answer all the questions in the final. Well sorry, if that's what you want, it's not the movie for you. But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and even better, their successors), I think you'll appreciate the thought-producing, ingenious experience this movie offers. <br /> <br /> Think of the movie as a dream. In our dreams things don't make sense, things we expect to happen, don't do, people's places and things talk, do or function as they actually do. To complain about "Head" is to complain about a dream you have that you feel you cannot understand. The mind is a complex system, and because a movie titled "Head" is just as complex, is it difficult to relate the two? <br /> <br /> The music (and musical numbers) really comes out, especially Peter Tork's two compositions, which keep the best songs in the movie, can you dig it? and a long title: should I do it all again? <br /> <br /> This movie proves that The Monkees was much more than just four zanny guys in a prefab group (if their critics mentioned them) on a television program, but they were actually much more intelligent and talented. is like the world, they will give credit. There are so many messages that can be derived from the film, both in terms of the Monkees and the "entertainment industry" in general, that it is a masterpiece of film making that was far from the time. <br /> <br /> I feel, if this film is released as an independent piece at this time, it would actually bring about the respect and admiration it deserves. <br /> <br /> And one final note: <br /> <br /> This can be compared to the The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour movie, as the Beatles movie looks just as weird and bizarre. But in my opinion, "Head" stands far above anything The Beatles put on celluloid.
