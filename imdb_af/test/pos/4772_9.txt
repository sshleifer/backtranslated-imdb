SPOILERS <br /> <br /> As you may know, over the past few months I have commented on very quiet short films. Now, I have no idea why I'm commenting on Steamboat Willie, I think I was just desperate to comment on anything, so I watched it, and now I'm commenting on it. This, or of course, is one of the very first cartoons, and I believe it's not the first cartoon with sound. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot. Mickey Mouse drives a steamboat when Pete throws him and he drives it. When they stop for cargo, Minnie Mouse tries to continue but fails. Mickey gets her up with a tap. Then a goat eats her paper with Turkey in the straw there. They use the goat to make the song. If I say I mean they used the goat as a Victrola. Mickey plays the animals on the steamer for instruments for the song. Then, a malicious Pete Mickey throws in a potato room and Mickey is forced to peel potatoes for the rest of the day. <br /> Overall, this is another groundbreaking short film. I mean, this is the third Mickey Mouse cartoon. Yes, the third. It's also not the first cartoon with sound. I believe there were two more before this one. Anyway, this movie is really groundbreaking. Mikcey was also more violent than he did. I mean, he throws a potato at a bird and may have slaughtered it brutally. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> Featured Movies: Plane Crazy.
