America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately I've become bored. <br /> <br /> Cycle 1: Yes, I'm glad Adrienne won, I wanted her to win from the start. <br /> <br /> Cycle 2: It's too bad, I think Mercedes deserved it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 3: I didn't like Eve, but I didn't love most girls in this cycle. <br /> <br /> Cycle 4: Kahlen had to win. I don't know what they saw in Naima, but I definitely know what they saw in Kahlen. <br /> <br /> Cycle 5: Like Cycle 3, it wasn't a good cycle either. but from all the girls, NICOLE as a winner? eww! <br /> <br /> Bicycle 6: I love Sara and Joanie, but Danielle is also ok. <br /> <br /> Cycle 7: Caridee definitely deserved it. <br /> <br /> Bicycle 8: No, I didn't want Jaslene to win. I didn't like her. I saw other girls in that cycle with definitely more potential than her, although I didn't see much of this cycle. <br /> <br /> Good performance, I've seen it all too often to keep it much more: D
