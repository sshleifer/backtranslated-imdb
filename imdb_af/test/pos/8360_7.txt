As a fan of time travel stories, I was surprised that there was no 'device' that Russell Johnson's character had sent over time. He just appeared in 1865. It was a disappointing part of the episode. I have enjoyed the prospect of changing the 'dangers' of the future by changing the past. Other Twilight Zone episodes on time travel such as "No Time Like the Past", "Once Upon A Time", etc. Was more of me due to the use of time travel devices. Perhaps if Russell Johnson's character was the same character he played in "Performance", it would be more acceptable to fans like me. As sci-fi fans know, no characters should ever "die" in the time series appointments. All kinds of plot 'twists' can be used in these types of stories. This was the only mistake I could make for this episode.
