Anywhere But here's not exactly something new, but the excellent performances by both main roles made it worth watching. Sarandon and Portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills, California, looking for a better life. The main conflict comes from the fact that Natalie has stayed with all her friends and relatives in Wisconsin, and she felt compelled to go to California with her excessive mother. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) While it is true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable, Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman are performing so well that they almost look like the material. Anywhere But here is not a new ground cover, but it has the rare quality to use overused topics and make it quite interesting again. Also seen in this movie is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen in years on Natalie Portman's face as her mother dropped her off the road and she watched the car fade away. Particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot of Natalie's mother pushing her to become an actress, as well as a very convincing performance by Shawn Hatosy as one of Natalie's closest cousins ​​from home. His death is a tragic cliché, almost always seen in movies like this, but the rest of the film makes so many weaknesses like this. Not big, but any place But here is definitely a look.
