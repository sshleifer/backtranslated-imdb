This review might be a spoiler if you never read the book or watch the video box cover. So if you want to approach the movie, I don't know anything about it, except that I like it a lot, stop here ... <br /> <br /> The production values ​​aren't the first time, but the acting between the leads is and they give the romance between them more life than Shute does in his novel (although I usually prefer the novel). My very poor objection to the film, unlike the book, is that the movie immerses some of the relationships with secondary characters and between the main characters in a scene up to the end of the film, so as not to be realistic to some. not to make dramatic tension and as a common plot device. All these things are much better dealt with in the book, with the result that I end the book much more than the end of the film.
