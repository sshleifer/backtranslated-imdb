Boogie Nights may be one of the best examples of a filmmaker's filmmaker. Sure, you can spend a lot of quality time reviewing the Hitchcock classrooms after Scorsese; but we can only follow the modern generation and study half-heartedly. <br /> <br /> Wherever I start, I can watch the movie, just a story, maybe even docudrama focusing on the late 1970s porn industry And what an industry it was! The other half can focus on the incredible detail that a brilliant filmmaker can achieve by simply using polyester and * ahem * rubber. But honestly, Boogie Nights brings the pure, no-bulls! Shi $ back, in your face kind of cinema I haven't experienced since the movie memories of the 1970s ... ironic ... or a stroke of genius. The story is full of richly detailed characters, neither of which you can relate to, love or hate; But the impact is clear - you feel something for them. Among the characters are the two appearances that stand out, Burt Reynolds as director Jack Horner and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams / Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is also brilliant, like Heather Graham ... but if I focus on one actor, it must be John C. Reilly. John's performance is a perfect balance of comic timing and character-driven emotion ... I'm a sucker for the line. "Ever see the movie Star Wars? ... People say I look like Han Solo." Anyway, the appearance of the movie is incredible, the Director of Photography and Director / Writer / Producer has a lively color and a flashy style that compares with Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick (in terms of his perfection of his craft ); but with creating its own unique look, and the edge with the longest single shot I've ever seen ... it's the New Year's party order. <br /> <br /> The music, like any big movie, is a character of its own. Sometimes it uses yourself with grief or grief ... but especially it's all fun, dance and a good time; the spirit of the 1970s. OK, back to the performances. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of "movie" means for his genre. The terrible transition from shooting to film after recording on magnetic tape. The loss of his art, as it were ... and the changes in mentality to the people he works with. Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocence and sexual bravado needed for the character. For all the individuals who saw Burton's planet from the monkeys, don't pay attention to the performance of Wahlberg in that movie ... rent boogie nights and see what a difference can make a good script! <br /> <br /> Julianne Moore takes the courage for everyone, and with that comes the agony and anxiety she feels like imitating life after art; and she lost all those who were near her. Heather Graham is the candy but later holds her own and steals some of the scenes from even the big Mr. Reynolds herself. Each character is multidimensional, rich in life, and performed by actors who seem to be perfect for the part. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is often funny, tragic, exciting and offers a uncompromising look at the turblulant lifestyle of the fast 1970s. It makes no excuses and does not tell lies; and offers the audience a journey back. But more importantly, the movie gives us a great example of how films should be made; and a new director whose brave visions bring back art in film.
