Stephen Hawking has one of the biggest thoughts, or if it is too simplistic to make him one of the most curious and bravest, it also happens in a body that is crippled by a disease that gets into a wheelchair and let a computer communicate. . Maybe I didn't know enough about Hawking to go in (I always knew him as "that man who speaks like a computer that knows a lot, the universe and things, you know") that he is British, that he " Rather, it was normal child, and perhaps most remarkable, the disease that could have killed him at 21, put him in a position to focus his life. <br /> <br /> According to Errol Morris's equally curious and cool visual brilliant portrait in a short history of time, Hawking was already brilliant, in spurts (when other Oxford students were faced with frightening algebraic comparisons, he had more than three times the quantity answered in an hour's time), but when faced with challenges, mostly from other theories by other scientists, he returned with his own. Among some of the complex scientific talks - and if you have less than a B in astronomy, like me, you need to relieve your ears especially in explanations of time's possible infinity or the peculiarities of the black hole - there is a man who just wants to enjoy his goose on his birthday. <br /> <br /> Morris catches Hawking right for those who can't get enough of his theories on how particles go in and out of a black. hole, or if there is even a creator or not, depending on how much you consider Einstein and time. But he also captures the story about the man and his condition, which makes it much more interesting than Morris did either. Too much talk about the cosmos will hurt your head and too much about his personal life and one can wonder what the fuss about this block is. Whose book of the movie's title has been on bestseller lists for over five years. <br /> <br /> Almost in spite of his appearance, Hawking defines what it is like to be a conscious entity in a universe, what he observes, he will not disagree with and when the universe continues 10 billion years further don't go. Through all this, in a short history of time, we get a glimpse of a genius and his humility (not to mention his colleagues and relatives' ten cents here and there) through an incomprehensible hypothetical and mathematical thought process of the universe.
