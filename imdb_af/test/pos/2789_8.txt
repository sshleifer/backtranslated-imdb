L'Auberge Espagnole is full of energy, and it is honest, realistic and refreshing. Not a comedy or drama, but more a piece of life film about this particular group of very interesting but still ordinary young people sharing a flat in Barcelona one year. Beautifully photographed with a good soundtrack. If you are older, this movie should bring back a flood of good memories. If you're young, learn through this example.
