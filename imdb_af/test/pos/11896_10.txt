I love movies that take you in them. A movie that makes you feel is poor when its over and this kind of movie is scarce. <br /> <br /> Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways to write and portray different characters on the screen. This movie has a cutting edge on it. A mainstream for such a low budget. Why is it that a man with this great talent and Charisma (not to mention sexual appeal in other ways) can do so with so little money with ????? These actors really believe in his screenplay and Raw talent as a director, writer and actor. I am so glad to know that such a contemporary genius is out there, that he is a passion for art, driving him and taking us as an audience with him. Damian, I've heard from so many different circles about you and don't let the jealous people of this world come to you. Martin gets it, Fellini has it and you'll always get it. The fire and passion in you is what we would like to see on the screen. Thank you for being different and writing as you do. You're one of a kind Director, don't listen to the empty vessels.
