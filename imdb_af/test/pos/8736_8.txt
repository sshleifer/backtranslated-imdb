I discovered this late night on Turner Classics. I told myself, "I'll turn it off as soon as it ceases to be funny", but needless to say, I've looked the whole way. <br /> <br /> I'm a movie junkie, but I've never heard of this movie (or if I did in 1971, I forgot). It's just worth watching for the performance of Goldie Hawn as the Tart Tongue genome. Her play is a revelation in this movie. Yes, the writing is sharp and excellent (when was the last time they made a Hollywood comedy with a smart script?) But her play is extraordinary. I never realized how funny Goldie could be, and it made her actions in roles like Laugh-In and Private Benjamin a bit sad. In her later career, she is way over the top compared to her minimalist, angry, funny look. <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to watch the young Matthau, the great Bergman and the star-supporting role, but it's Goldie Hawn who makes this movie worth watching again.
