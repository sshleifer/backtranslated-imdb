Remember it came out before the Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's "Lessons of Darkness". <br /> <br /> Le Dernier Combat is not Sci Fi. It's more like Judgment. I watched it at least a dozen times. It's really a fitting companion for Herzog's "Lessons of Darkness": "At that time people will seek death, but they won't find it, because death will flee from them." <br /> <br /> One day, unfortunately, can be in Iraq today. <br /> <br /> But, back to Le Dernier Combat, be sure to watch the last minute of the movie. I don't call it a "surprising end", but it's something you will miss if you just assume the end will be nothing more than you have already seen.
