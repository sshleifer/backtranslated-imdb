This movie is just nice ... It really starts slow and boring, but as the movie progresses ..... the fun is coming. The power of the movie may be in subtle references to many (and I mean a lot) of other movies. For me, the best part was possibly the Bruce Lee / Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon scene. How the two actors switched from French to Chinese or what Asian language it was, it was wonderful. Then the jokes with the names, they are hilarious, but maybe you won't understand them as your American (no offense). Overall a good movie
