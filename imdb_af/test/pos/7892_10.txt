22. JOE (drama, 1970) Joe (Peter Boyle) is a racist factory worker who is known to hate "hippies and nurses". He met Bill, a businessman who just killed the lover of his drug addict, young daughter Jill (Susan Sarandon). Jill walks away and joins a hippie town on the outskirts of town. Bill turned to Joe for help. Their search leads them through the sweetest parts of the town where both men's inner hatred and evil are further tested. <br /> <br /> Criticism: It was John G. Avildsen, director of the first spinner, "Rocky", "The Karate Kid", "Split-Image", "Weekend at Bernie's". Movie is interesting enough because it was thought of the themes and ideas of the turbulent 60s (Vietnam War, Black Power, Female Lib, etc.). It also has a good performance by Peter Boyle as Joe, one of the first anti-heroes of the theater. He has always played well in creepy, heavy clouds whose abstract ideas are enforced by his intimidating presence (he plays the Frankenstein monster in Mel Brook's spoof Young Frankenstein). He reminds me of a little child trapped in a big, stupid, uncomfortable body. Film has a bad writing (Joe's and Bill's meeting, for example, is a bit coincidental), but it has a particularly horrific after-taxi driver who ends up. <br /> <br /> NOTE: Title Song: "I saw a fella salesman with children. He gets nervous every time I pass. Because he knows that if I catch him, I'm going to kick his head and fat. A $ kick kick. "
