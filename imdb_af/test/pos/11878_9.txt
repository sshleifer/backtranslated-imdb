What's not to love? <br /> <br /> Tonight I caught it and marvel at Hugh Bonneville's capturing of the essence of Philip Larkin without thinking of tics and caricature. <br /> <br /> There are many Low to portray the complexity of the main character and Hugh brings them to life. His prudent mother, his unresolved problems with his father and his inability to commit to one woman. <br /> <br /> His poetry is interwoven and some scenes are captured in telling them to the friend of a friend he later proposed, but rather involuntarily, almost innocent. It's not hard to see where his appeal lies to the many women who fell in love with him (and knew each other, to start and see him!) <br /> <br /> Cerebral, loving , jazz aficionado, loyal friend. It's always more than looks, women move beyond baldness, deafness and short-sightedness. And a beautifully nuanced performance by Eileen Atkins as his mother is an added bonus. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
