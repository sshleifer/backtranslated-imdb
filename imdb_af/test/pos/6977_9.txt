Newly-conceived Knight bolts of the man for non-specific reasons apparently self-related. On the way she gets entangled with Caan, the brain-damaged former soccer player, and Duvall, wacky, but abusive cop. The kind of movie that could only have arisen in the 60's. A look for his non-formula plot and for early performances by future stars. <br /> <br /> Disappointing resolution doesn't take too much of the rest of the movie, showing an interesting cut of life.
