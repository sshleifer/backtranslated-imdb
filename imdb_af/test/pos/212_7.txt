Nothing like it was seen on TV at that time and will probably never be again. From the first image of that police light that blinded you and from there you heard the words: "Police group - in color", you were shocked to see that it was by no means a common sitcom. <br /> <br /> To kill a "Guest Star" and then never refer to him again, where ever you saw it. Then the real show started and if you didn't pay attention, you would miss several jokes in the background. Don't pay too much attention to one thing, or you'll be sorry. It was the show that video recordings were made, before the Married to Children or The Simpsons. <br /> <br /> The stories didn't make any sense and the dialogue was sometimes so strange that you had to think about it for 5 minutes before realizing it was a joke. <br /> <br /> The characters Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken came straight from Dragnet and they were absolutely straightforward (no funny accents or expressions), but instead there were words and twisted sentences played absolutely deadpan. Just once I can remember, there was a segment played for foolishness - a scene that had a journey to a dentist, sow and lots of saliva. <br /> <br /> There were some boring moments - like the informant Johnny and a familiar person's appearance. It was strictly a one-joke moment, but they had to use it in all six episodes. Oh, well. Everything can't be perfect. The most important thing is that you were deep in the knees for the rest of the time. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen was fortunate to have resurrected his career when they had the Frank Drebin character in 3 features, but it must have also been an Achilles heel. Can you remember seeing him in anything except Naked Gun type work since? And don't count the horrible Mr. Magoo not for real action. He probably made a lot of money.
