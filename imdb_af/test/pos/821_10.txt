Van Damme has done some good films over the years and these one hits a great ten in my books. From the area around Mexico to the five-star battle scenes, this movie was incredible. The film is about border patrols that protect land from the border of Mexico. Ex navy stamps smuggle drugs from Mexico in the United States (USA), Van Damme and Scott Atkins give great performances as the policeman and the villain. Although this movie wasn't as good as death, it still gave the action, acting and film a five-star look. I always look forward to these b grade action movies and they keep getting better. Keep them from Dams. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you enjoy movies - To death, The hard corps and the second in command.
