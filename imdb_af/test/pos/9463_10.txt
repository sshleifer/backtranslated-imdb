Okay, now I thought it would be another cheese-romantic comedy that held back on the comedy, but it wasn't. I mean how could it have been with the fabulous Amanda Bynes staring at it! She was wonderful, very funny and still stunning! The boys in it were also extremely fit, one of the big reasons girls go! The plot is strongly based on the Shakespeare game 'Twelfth Night', as it was very similar, there was even a spider called malvolio, which belongs to the malvolio-like character. The writing was really well written and pulled together and it was very funny. The soccer skills in it were also wonderful, it even made me think of soccer myself! Anyway, it's a light film about young romance, which gets very confusing! Go see it!
