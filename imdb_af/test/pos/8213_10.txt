Finally !! Sandra Bullock is indeed a beautiful woman, but I finally got a movie she's got to be an actress! Forget the predictable Keanu feed of SPEED, forget the predictable Kleenex feed of WHILE YOU WAS SLEEP - it tests it! <br /> <br /> And she's great! A techno-feminist role that works really well on the screen, on a subject very close to the leg. The issues raised don't seem to be over, and the whole experience, helped by a fine supportive role, makes a few hours uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> You should never enter another chat. -room again, in fact I get very nervous just to write this review ... there ... do it!
