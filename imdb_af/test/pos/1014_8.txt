I finally saw LAURE and I must say I enjoyed it too and was upset about it. What is nice about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story certainly doesn't exist, but with these movies it doesn't really matter. The speed in horrible and the settings are exotic. The movie has a lot for it. Unfortunately, it also has a few things to do with it. The first thing is that the beautiful Annie Belle and the attractive Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever. Because the two play a few and stand on the screen for almost the entire length of the film, the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. They certainly showed their attraction to each other to show on the screen. <br /> <br /> The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous. There is one sex scene that sticks out as one of the silliest I've ever seen in a soft porn flick: our young blonde couple is picked up by a helicopter pilot who is a crossbreed! The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) And they have an orgy in the helicopter, in the air. And Al Cliver film it all with its 16mm camera! I don't kid you. Ridiculous. We later see that 16mm footage is edited on a moviola. As the footage rolls, Al and Annie start out. This scene is actually good, but the footage on the screen behind them was sometimes too much. When I watched the footage of the cross-dresser, he hit the bimbo while I launched the helicopter. I ran out loud on the floor. Is it supposed to be erotic or credible in any way? The last thing I want to see is a woman who enjoys a man in the mourning, certainly when the man in a dragon makes such an ugly woman while driving a helicopter, no less. All that Annie had turned on was like the music throughout the scene. I just wish the footage on the edit screen wasn't so stupid. <br /> <br /> If you speak, another dull plot point in LAURE that really pulls the movie into a crawl, all those moments are with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and his two wives. A married trio is an interesting idea, but it's rare to register here as hot or even interesting. The two women are so dull and we rarely see the three having sex. In fact, Orso keeps his clothes for almost the whole movie, even when he is at Annie Belle. It's another small complaint about LAURE: there is nudity, but it's not as much as other movies of the same era. It just needed more skin to refurbish it. <br /> <br /> Apart from the small complaints and the drag queen moments, LAURE is actually very viewable. I love these types of 1970s movie films when the attention was to mood and atmosphere, not the rough stuff we see today. <br /> <br /> PS: Make sure you look at Emanuelle in Egypt, which star Annie & Al but also a well-known screen saver, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music in that movie is also wonderful.
