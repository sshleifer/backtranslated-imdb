Director Jay Craven's adaptation of Howard Frank Mosher's "Where the Rivers Run North" is one of the finer transitions from literature to screen. Craven is an admirer of Mosher's work - he also directed a stranger in the kingdom. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent - especially Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal. Torn offerings that could be the best part of his career - Noel Lord, the completely independent former woodcutter in the middle of this story. Tantoo Cardinal's portrayal of Lord's living housekeeper / common-law wife is also dead. I am both surprised and disappointed that none of them was nominated for Oscars when this film was released. Execution of this caliber must be recognized. The only character that's a little difficult to swallow is the power manager Michael J. Fox plays. He just looks too much like a child in this role. I think there is a curse to youthful looks, no matter how many people they want. <br /> <br /> Craven has done a good job here to bring the character of early 20th century Vermont to the screen - places, corners, sets, everything combining to transport the viewer to the time and place of the story. Movie Paul Ryan was exceptional. The score of the Horseflies is also the first time. It fits perfectly with the atmosphere and nature. <br /> <br /> And the story itself ...? One of the most compelling portrayals of the ever-independent American pioneering spirit - a feature that deviates in this day and age. When it comes to modern times, the person is often viewed with suspicion and contempt. In Noel Lord we have a character that we can admire for his values, and even for his stubbornness. <br /> <br /> It's not a stodgy 'period piece', but a lively look at an era gone by and a kind of character that has all but disappeared. These are not painted heroes, but real people, with both strength and weaknesses within them. struggles in a difficult environment to live their lives and at the same time be at peace with the world they live in. As of today, there are those who use power that would have it differently.
