This film is so lovingly made you want to be part of it forever. The movie is straight but not without malice, the goods are transparent, and malicious people are barely there. Even the "cabaret" is so naive that they will compare your daydream with nostalgia with everything available on TV. Leaf is good, as a little aside. Louis Jouvet is perfect, you just can't have a better buyer. He has the best line: "My father cleaned other people's dirty, and I do the same." Susy Delair is unbearable, but I think it's the songs, wardrobe and hairstyle. Simone Renant, on the contrary, makes a good femme fatale, if it's a little quiet. I didn't realize she could be a lesbian if IMDb user dbdumonteil and others suggested over time.
