First of all, I must point out that I really enjoyed watching this documentary. Not only did it have good music in it, but the shots and editing were great too. However, all these positive things about the film do not change the fact that it plays to the Eastern "East meets West" clich√© that many Turks think I am. Well, this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary Turkish music in a very attractive way, which is a good thing, something that illegal Europeans and Americans show that this country is not just about the murder of Armenian and Kurds. The problem with the film, however, is that it looks at what it calls "east" from the "west". I mean, like one jazz musician in the movie says maybe there is no east and west, maybe it's just a myth, a lie created by the ruling leaders of the "Western" countries for fear and hostility keep alive so they can continue to rule the world and "keep cash flow"? <br /> <br /> Why don't you think about it?
