I saw this movie more than once. In fact, El Padrino was one of the best movies I've seen in a lot of time. <br /> <br /> There was a great movie Jennifer Tilly, Faye Duanway, Brad Dourif and Damian Chapa who really shine a true star in this part of Kilo. <br /> <br /> I heard this movie was shot for less than two million dollars. I watched movies shot at 33m that can't compare to the quality and production value. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa, why don't you get more offers and more filmwork !!! Excellent work !!!!!!!!!! I can't wait to see the sequel, and I hope it has the same action. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly made a cult classic with Sabeva. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa moves cool in every scene much like the movie stars of the 40's and 50's So sick that these non-charismatic actors like Ben Stiller get all these movies if there is such a talent that shows something has. a good movie. <br /> <br /> GO VIEW AND ONLY SELL EL PADRINO !!!
