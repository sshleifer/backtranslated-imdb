Tim Burton is essentially an expressionist filmmaker, uninterested in dimensions of character and obsessive with Gothic scope, and chooses style over fabric unceasingly throughout his career. But with its style so engaging, I forgive, like many movie-goers, all the countless errors that can be found in many of its movies, and are devastated by what is actually a hundred million dollar art films. <br /> <br /> It's almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic, emotional spirit within the second installment of a mediocre franchise, especially when the franchise target audience is the 15-year-old boys. Batman Returns both had to be as commercial as its predecessor, so checkout and cheap (actually very expensive) excitement were entertaining without ever involving his audience. If that were the case, Tim Burton would surely have to register a third installment. Instead, Burton delivers something that can only be determined by the phrase 'out there'. <br /> <br /> From the melancholic opening in which a high-society couple throws a prison basin containing their newborn deformed baby In a river, it is clear that Batman Returns is not a picnic at Buckingham Palace. Thirty-three years later, during a political speech by the bad old businesswoman Max Shreck (sinister depicted by Christopher Walken), the Red Triangle circus gang attacked Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton returns to the role) makes his first appearance sport a new logo, eventually saving the day. Shreck will soon be kidnapped by the circus gang and sent black to endorse the baby's political return. It is now a mature Penguin man (Danny DeVito in an amazingly perfect composition), whose motives for return are only suspicious of Batman. /> <br /> Meanwhile, Shreck is trying to kick off his nosy and uncomfortable assistant Selina Kyle (played perfectly by Michelle Pfeiffer who deserves recognition for her performance) that turns into the nice sexy and psychotic Catwoman, out of revenge and ports, for an inexplicable reason, a deadly vendetta against the Dark Knight. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns is dark. The production design is breathtaking and delivers a cold, ghostly Gotham City with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor. Danny Elfman's score brilliantly supports the film, ranging from refreshing to tragic. The tone and direction of the entire film itself is intensely devastating, shot like a sad nightmare. Burton's direction overshadows what justifies a deadly script with an almost totally irrelevant plot, yet perfect for Burton's visual style of filmmaking. . And while Burton's action ranges fight excitement, the real excitement lies in the choice of the fall of each of his main characters, the Penguins death, the Catwoman's spiritual state and Bruce Wayne's lonely destination. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers hated it while mixing critical and hearing reactions. After all, they wanted a Batman successor, not a strange, somewhat horrible horror movie, in which a malformed psychopathic orphan attempt to kidnap and drown a pack of babies, all the vomit that can only be described as green mucus. The production company wanted a hearing-friendly feature, something for the McDonald's clan to promote their happy meals, not a movie of insatiable characters, including a sexually repressed secretary being pushed out of a skyscraper and revived by a gang cats that awaken her unconsciousness by chewing on her bloody icy fingers. <br /> <br /> It is easy to understand the mass loss that followed the release of Batman Returns. The movie never felt like a Batman blocker. It is doubtful whether Burton really knew what Batman actually was or even if he cared for the character as much as he cared for the movie that matched his usual themes of gorgeous haunting art and misinterpretation, lonely characters rarely in line with societal standards and expectations. That's why Burton didn't create a good Batman movie. However, he did; creates a nostalgic and beautiful, evil piece of cinema that remains a personal and nostalgic favorite of mine. <br /> <br /> It may not be a big Batman movie. But it's a good Tim Burton movie.
