If we didn't see the movie in the commercial debut, we just caught it through DVD. The expectation of the worst, "Hitch" was a pleasant experience because of the three principals in it. Thanks to Andy Tenant's direction, the movie has an easy pace, and although it's predictable, the comedy has a few winning moments. <br /> <br /> Hitch is a sort of date coordinator for losers like Albert, who isn't exactly. what one would consider. However, Albert is a real man who, without any professional help, would be unnoticed by the same women he would like to take out. Enter Hitch to prepare him to overcome the obstacles he cannot overcome, and although Albert remains overweight and never gets social grace, he conquers us because he is real, in sharp contrast to all the phonics making the rounds in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> The basic mistake that most production designers make is preparing sites for Hollywood movies, how out of touch they are. The apartments in which they put these characters are so scarce to find that only the magic of the movies can make these people live, it likes them. Apparently, most of the filmmakers are busy with fantasy as most of the city's inhabitants would kill for spaces as fabulous as those in the movies, let alone the same people portrayed in the film cannot afford them no. <br /> <br /> Will Smith is a charismatic actor. He has a disarming way to charm without doing much. The surprise of the movie, however, is Kevin James, who overcame us not only by Albert but he proves he is his own in his screens with Mr. Smith can hold. Eva Mendez is fine as Hitch's main concern. In less important roles, we see Adam Arkin, Amber Valletta, Michael Rappaport, and Phillip Bosco among others. <br /> <br /> "Hitch" is a fun movie to watch thanks to Andy Tenant's inspired direction.
