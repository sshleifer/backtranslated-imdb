A group of teenagers decide to take their slumber party to a deserted school where 27 years before a terrible massacre took place. Unfortunately, the person responsible for the slaughter still hides the hall of the abandoned school, and he is not happy with their presence. <br /> <br /> This movie is not like most modern teenagers we saw. It is much darker, much more exciting, no wise-killing murderer, etc. And I loved them for those reasons. From a film making point of view, it's not good. The acting is below average. The writing was pretty bad and full of claws, which played randomly in references to American horror movies, some that didn't even make sense (like ... "Did you see Scream 3?", Ask a girl. , and it has nothing to do with running the doors of an old school so it is in no way related to this movie. But hey, it's a shooter movie, it's part of the fun. The under-utilization of characters was also heavily exhibited in this film. There were six main characters (not including the Security Guard) and honestly only three or four were really used. Two characters (the token black man and another girl who wasn't important to get a label) barely spoke: between them I would estimate about five or six lines altogether. The girls (except one) are also not well-formed enough to distinguish them from each other. They could have replaced each of the girls repeatedly through the movie and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. However, the pacing works well as the horror begins from the beginning and rarely stops. The atmosphere is well utilized and the direction reveals a few cold moments. . . Although overall appearance seems a bit cheap because of what I assume, low grade camera equipment (and operation). The end, although I had the idea of ​​going, was pretty poor. It felt rushed and without explanation enough to make it effective. With the amount of time they spent searching for and looking for nothing, they could spend a little more time making sure it didn't feel like a random event was being thrown in for good reason (that is, ' a mistake many modern horror movies are harassed). However, if you ignore some turbulent issues and try to focus on the first 98% of the film rather than the end, it's actually a pretty good modern treasure chest to be controlled, especially if you're a fan of Spanish and / or atmospheric horror. <br /> <br /> Compulsory Slasher elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There is a good bit of blood and gore, realistically done, but not buckets. The violence was done extremely well, not too much, but fairly cruel at points. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: Little, and with the hottest girl in the movie. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer: Well, security guards are barely considered 'cool', but this guy is pretty angry. His creepy smile was chilling. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: The voltage is on top. . . very tense, very well done. There are also some awful moments that cause smuggled jokes and the haunting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: None at all. <br /> <br /> - Indifferent Dance Games: Of course: between a few guys and a half-reluctant woman in the flashback. <br /> <br /> - Classic quote of that movie: "Another trophy." <br /> <br /> Final ruling: 7/10. This may stretch, but fans of Session 9 may just want to look for the similar tone and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
