To my eternal shame I have never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire movies, "Nosferatu". However, if they show half of the creativity and sheer joy of this Buster Keaton effort, I'll probably try to watch some more. It's really funny as well as a great introduction to the world of quiet comedies. The premise, as it is, focuses on an unfortunate case of wrong identity, as Keaton is wrong for the well-known bad man Dead Shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St Clair). This leads to a number of foxes and escapes as the authorities come closer to the increasingly desperate Keaton. <br /> <br /> You are amazed and entertained in equal measure. Keaton is a natural comedian, but also a perfect stuntman. He judges the way he jumps like Jackie Chan at speed. And the comedy is also of extremely high standard. My better half had to call her parents because she laughed too much! If you have never experienced a silent movie, it is nothing more than a revelation to watch - surely it has blown away any ideas I had about silent movies. Of course, it's not as polished as today's movies - the acting is pretty terrible, the truth is told, but it doesn't matter, because you enjoy the movie regardless. Anyone with a passing interest in movies in general should take the trouble to see it because they will not be disappointed. Brilliant!
