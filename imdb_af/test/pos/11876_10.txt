Has brought Philip Larkin to life in a way that is worth the best of all time, not just those measured by popularity. It shows a sharp portrayal of Larkins' life as the greatest unknown poet of his era - exactly how he wanted it, so was his contempt for cancers and medals. It shows dramatically the raw beauty in the intense sadness of Philips' observations of our relationship with our own deaths and lies in a way that even the great philosophers have missed. For anyone interested in profound observations of our relationship with life, love and death, it is a must.
