I was in bed, flashing through the channels ... and boy did I have channels ... 500 of them. With over 70 movie channels, I'm probably watching a movie on the cable, once or twice a month. DVD smothered me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm flashing and I come to this movie and because I see Natilie Portman, I'm taking interest. 110 minutes later I'm still interested. How can this be? When I first saw the previews for this movie in the theater, I remember having fun. I never thought I'd see it ... never like that. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a book and you can tell it. The movie is very episodic, and it's not as if the movie has a big plot, it just sucks you. Maybe it's the actions it does. I'm pretty sure it should have been. <br /> <br /> This movie was good for no reason. <br /> <br /> Peter's film rating (out of 10): 7
