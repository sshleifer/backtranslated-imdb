Death in Venice is a movie I have to see once every ten years. It is always different, because I am always at another stage of life. <br /> <br /> The movie is about art, beauty, longing, death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others are just annoying to watch, especially if you look like it before. Yet I don't want to miss a single frame. The music is repetitive, the main theme of the adolescent from Mahler's fifth being used again and again. Yet I don't want to miss a single note. When the last image disappears, the last note dies, I'm numb and exhausted. <br /> <br /> This movie is a monument to movies. As with most good movies, the Saturday night crowd should stay away from it. And it's simply the best movie ever.
