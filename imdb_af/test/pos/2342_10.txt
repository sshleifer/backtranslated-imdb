I saw One Life Stand when it was presented at the 2000 International Film Festival in Edinburgh and was blown away. Made on a micro budget, this black and white digital movie is a very European film and brilliant, despite the limitations of DV. The film works because it is in Indian tradition - dealing with complex issues but moving and relieving through attacks of understated humor. One Life Stand avoids falling into the fall of other British realistic films, featuring ordinary working people portrayed as hopeless victims or comic stereotypes. The performances are strong, especially Maureen Carr as the mother, Trise. I understand the movie was recently released on DVD and I would definitely recommend it. The rating on this site is misleading, so I gave it a high score, because filmmaker May Miles Thomas made her heart and soul clear and earn better than 2.8 for her incredible performance.
