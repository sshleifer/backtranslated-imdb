Pola X is a beautiful adaptation of Herman Melville's' Pierre; or, the ambiguities'. The comment on this surprised me, which makes me wonder what led to the overwhelming negative reaction. <br /> <br /> The shock value is the least attractive thing about this movie - a small detail that has been blown out of proportion. The story is about Pierre's demise - and the subsequent destruction of those around him - which are fully demonstrated in his attributes, attitudes and idols. The dialogue and the soundtrack set this film apart from anyone I saw and transform a fundamental traditional storyline with controversial twists and turns into an unforgettable emotional epic. <br /> <br /> I can't stress enough how important it is to ignore everything, have heard about this movie and watch, as I did, with an open mind. You will hopefully be rewarded as I was. I feel on the edge and nervous about the half hour point, but the film is far from scary in any traditional sense. This will leave you with 1000 minds, each one at a time difficult and exciting. I know I'm going here, but I feel the need to make the negative perception of this movie. It's the best I've seen all year round.
