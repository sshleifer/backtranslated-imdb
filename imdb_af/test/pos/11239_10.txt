I think it's a brilliant performance with cool talking heads and very cool action. 2 guys pretending to be masters of women's seduction demonstrate their skills at different nightclubs and 4 experts (bakkie artists themselves) comment on them and choose the winner. Their jokes are amusing, and some participants are really fun to watch. More so, this show really teaches men how to get in touch with women. Many experts' comments are helpful as you can see how it works in the field. Actually, I think this is one of the best TV shows and I recommend it to all men who love women. <br /> <br /> Psef broken for me.
