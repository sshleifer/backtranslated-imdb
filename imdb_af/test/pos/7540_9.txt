Great fun, both as a movie and as an excuse to sit back and play the 'Oh, it's Whassis Name' game. Every star of the golden age of English movies seems to be in this one and it was a pleasure to see it. And the biggest of them all, Richard Wattis, was as big as ever. <br /> <br /> There is actually a plot that rotates very well, there are also some wonderful jokes and comic moments, but the key to these films' triumph is the characters in it. Alastair Sim is beautiful and somehow convinces you that a six-foot, big-legged shoemaker can be the head of a girl's boarding school. George Cole, Beryl Reid and Irene Handl all have their moments, but with Alastair and Richard the star of the show is Joyce Grenfell. She is an absolute one-off and brings a smile when she is on the screen. Its rolling-and-plum accent is perfectly executed. <br /> <br /> And for those who play the Whassis Name game, you can even see Arthur Mullard, Barbara Windsor and Ronald Searle if you look carefully.
