"Sister Helen" is an excellent documentary on a rigid, intolerable, dirty, bitter, undecided (civil) nun that is a shelter for drunks and dopers in a very stray environment in the southern Bronx. All but one of the 21 residents are drunkards / addicts. Robert, the only middle class representative ?? He had a job, home and even a BMW? Sorry, she died before he could tell her. Why? <br /> <br /> Robert, like six of the residents, was on parole. He complained that Helen wore a big stick over him and constantly threatened to turn him in if he didn't have her couch. In an "extras" interview he said Helen ran the center to compensate for the death of the three men in her life ?? her husband and her two sons. <br /> <br /> The man was an alcoholic who died of heart attack at age 55. One boy died of overdose of heroin and the other was beaten to death at 15 hours. Helen left with one daughter, which she left after running the center. The daughter was not satisfied. She wanted her mother <br /> <br /> What is fascinating is how little Helen changed. Outside, it looks like she has made a great sea change. But having seen this sounding and disturbing video several times - once telling the directors - it became clear that Helen replaced 21 male addicts to replace her three dead men. <br /> <br /> Helen acknowledges that she has ignored her children and spends bars every day. But her austerity, intolerance and sharp tongue did not occur at the age of 56. Living with her had to be very difficult. Even Robert says he was clean despite Helen. <br /> <br /> The film opens with Helen abusing a man who wants to live in the shelter. She apparently showed her street expertise. Once again she remembers Mel, Mel, her "assistant" not to bathe for a year. Then his dirty pillowcase blows in the air. The film is viscous with Helen who threatens and humiliates people. Her signature song is "My Way." Her favorite phrase is, "I'm going to be completely honest with you." Often, people who use such phrases seem to be the opposite. <br /> <br /> The residents are really occasional. Only Robert has marketable skills when a broom is not printed. They all immediately need a roof over their heads, and Helen, as she's the place on her own, has the power to admit or delay who she wants. She has no governing council to answer and does not receive public funding. This is her performance. <br /> <br /> In the cookie approach, Helen believes in austerity. She stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone can. She blames drug abuse on the drug or liquor, not the underlying issues the men have been driving to drink and drugs. She is not a therapist, just a landlady who colors her hair, carries a habit, and has full power over her tenants and has stopped drinking. <br /> <br /> Helen also condemns it on her prisoners by claiming urine (urea calls it) tests on requests. Twice Major, a very solid and respected long-term older resident - whom she trusted - failed his tests. Helen was furious and put him out. Major put his ground and said the results were wrong because he never did heroin. Helen didn't deliver and didn't think a mistake could have been made. It was especially disturbing because she was Major for a long time. Yet she discounted her relationship with him, believed he was a liar and relied entirely on the results. Bulk eventually discovered the codeine in its cough syrup, showed opium. Helen never apologized publicly, but presumably had big private. <br /> <br /> Helen also had a very humble reputation in her old environment. She was quiet for Robert. She once stayed one night to cut someone's ties. The person was wronged and surely cut his ties. She wasn't a good woman. So finally she decided to keep the only way to keep the Travis name (her last name) alive ?? since the three male Travises died ?? was to start the Travis Center. <br /> <br /> For many of the residents it was a lot. They obeyed Helen and in return received a cheap, safe, sober and structured place to stay. However, one said he preferred prison. Addicts and drunks do not all need to be treated as children. Helen used "old school" techniques that were discredited. However, no one was obliged to stay at the center and for some it was definitely a positive experience. The Travis Center is not a treatment center. It is a residence for alcoholics and dopers who rectify their lives. <br /> <br /> To get the full Sister Helen experience, see all the extra interviews plus the audio version in which the two directors share their experiences with Sister Helen and her guests.
