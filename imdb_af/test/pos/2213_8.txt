I really enjoyed this movie and I think most fans of Lauren Ambrose will too. Her character is much softer than her role in Six Feet Under and all the performances are strong. I especially enjoyed how the role of Emily, a mentally challenged savant, was handled. Despite some other misinformed user reviews, the role was performed accurately and without click by actress Taylor Roberts. Also a look was Fran Kranz, whose natural convenience complements the more season veteran actors. Although the direction hit here or there in the direction, it was the only problem with an underdeveloped writing. What might have worked well as a stage play didn't hold on to the screen as well. But the stunning cinematography by Paul Ryan certainly makes up for it, as well as the pace of the movie, which is surprisingly slow. I recommend this movie to fans of six foot below and also fans of regular good acting and cinematography.
