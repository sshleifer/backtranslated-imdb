"Gooi Momma From the Train" is a simple dark comedy with lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal plays a frustrated writer on the verge of collapse; Danny DeVito plays a man in one of Crystal's writing classes. Crystal's ex-wife is a * hag * to make it beautiful, and Crystal hates her. DeVito, which makes it more sensible, offers Crystal one night a deal: DeVito will kill Crystal's wife if Crystal kills the DeVito's night from a mother. Crystal, of course, refuses, but later corruption is deeply in his heart to say yes. And as things spell out, we see what happens when you throw someone's mom off a moving train. <br /> <br /> This story is an interesting character study; a story of evil, greed, revenge, ego, trust, doing what is right, but above all corruption. We see that Crystal's white-collar writer is still accentuated by events clashing around him, and because of DeVito's constant nagging, he says "yes." But we know deeply in his subconscious that he wants to say "yes" and he is happy that he told DeVito. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit of a dark spoof on Hitchcock's immortal movie. "Strangers on a train," and it plays a tribute to the movie in time when there is a play "Strangers on a Train". We see DeVito watching the movie, and a light bulb appears in his head. He gets an idea. Throw Momma out of the train! <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal gives another convincing and strange comic performance as a constant writer on the verge of collapse. He was so struck by everything around him that his inner emotions came out and he agreed to throw DeVito's mom out of the train. <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito arranged this movie excellently. He only uses the right touch of the comic darkness to create a world of corruption and disease. Everything is demented, but not extreme as in other dark comedies. It has just the right touch of the darkness that goes through in "The War of the Roses." <br /> <br /> Not only is "Throwing Momma Van the Train" a simple story of corruption and morality, but is also an interesting character study. Definitely worth catching on TV. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 Stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
