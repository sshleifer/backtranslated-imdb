Bad someone didn't have the smart to make this movie play. I never heard it appear on the cable. After the first shock to realize it, it's not like any other movie you've seen since Bringing Baby, let it whip and run it. Not until it is over, you realize that it covers things that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she was never better. The whole movie has the plot of the plot and knows what they are doing without keeping going, except where it is called, as with Julie Andrews' pieces or Jonathan Pryce's camp videos. If you are not open minded, you will not find it. (See Mark Adnum's bizarre review, which he devotes to the succession of Stephanie Beacham, her career and her brother's OBE for the introduction of vegetable oil or something for residents of the islands.) If that is an idea, I can just as much time spent by Amo Gulinello's star cameo as a TV station internally or Jack Noseworthy's shower scene. So, throw away all the previous concepts of movie comedy and enjoy it. I loved it.
