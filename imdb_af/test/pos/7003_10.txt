As a zombie fan, I really love this type of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by wicked monsters! PB is also an excellent link with Kronieke van Riddick (COR). The gang must run as fast as they can get away from the darkness. There are so many metaphors in the story! Riddick is this bad guy, but he is also the hero who tries to save the slow people. The Muslim man, Imam, relies on the sun's positions for the five times daily prayers, but he is stuck in a land where darkness will rule. Overall, I recommend this movie to any sci-fi fans. You won't be disappointed.
