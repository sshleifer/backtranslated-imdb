Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is the old familiar feel of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb, who plays in the title role, does a good job, but I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that offers a good job of presenting Karen and Richard's professional careers, as well as the personal struggle that Karen has dealt with and her illness. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio were done very well. But Karen Carpenter turned out, there was a time when she was very special and congratulated her supporters and music lovers. Even if you were not a Carpenter fan, it is a beautiful story depicting how a great talent can be the victim of the pressure of society.
