When a group of escaped prisoners fly to a remote island, they soon find that their new home is inhabited by a strange threatening doctor (Richard Johnson of Zombi 2), a crazy scientist (Joseph Cotten), his beautiful daughter (Barbara Bach) and a horde of superstitious natives. The chiefs say the doctor has created mostly half-human, half-fish creatures for evil and mysterious purposes. And even though the prisoners don't believe it, as they disappear, one is beginning to change their mind. "Screamers" is a very entertaining mix of "Mysterious Island" and "Humanoids from the Deep." There are many gores with a very cool decade scene and throat tearing. so-so, but the film is fast and entertaining. Give it a tin.8 out of 10.
