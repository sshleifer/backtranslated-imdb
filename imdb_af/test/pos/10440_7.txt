Reality for reality TV? Copy of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"? A precursor to saying "Say Anything" is it bigger? I can't decide, but the soundtrack * is * the 80's - Blondie, Travel, REO Speedwagon, Devo, Lionel Richie and U2 - I can't believe it. They will never throw all those genres together in a teenager. movie of today. <br /> <br /> I remember it as a teenager - mainly the sex parts and not a hint of altruism. Why? I was a horny teenager in the 80's. Looking at it again, I just can't describe how much I love that Rose, played by Kimberly Richardson, seems to be the voice of "Pepper Ann" in the 90's and she was nearly 30 when she was in the Last American Virgin , play with 16-year-olds - fantastic! Complete cheese, reality, fantasy and comedy - with a real cherry on top.
