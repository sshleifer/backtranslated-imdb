I probably like this slightly more than Terror by Night, though not enough to give it extra. The start is just brilliant, as we look at the Nazi agents who are twilight to get their hands on a new collision and his inventor in a small Swiss village, just to be whispered by a disguised Holmes who push the scientific back to London. Once there, he does everything he can to drop the scientist into the hands of the man - not Hitler, but worse: Holmes's arch-enemy Moriarty. Of course, the scientist, with a sad coded note, disappears, and Holmes will pursue again. A climax in Moriarty's doctor's shop is exciting, and we can all guess that everything ends well, can't we? Little over-the-top patriotic message as the credits roll. Now that I think about it, the delicate sense of place in spite of the obvious sets, Rathbone's disguise and the way so much plot is packed in just over an hour - how completely it gets the extra * and is my favorite of the 5 Rathbone / Bruce movies I've seen yet. <br /> <br /> Watch DVD, join the "50 Mystery Classics" set of Mill Creek Entertainment. Many of the transmissions on these low-cost cell phones are of very poor quality, but Holmes fans note that the Rathbone / Bruce movies (there are 4 on this set) are all pretty awake and pretty sharp.
