This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the search for the almighty goat exceed all racial and ethnic barriers. Eventually, the market determines the message sent to the public. This movie dramatizes the point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is being taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans, chaired by a black man who doesn't want anything, and believes he can sell products by telling the truth. But the movie shows how hard he also tries to do something else, the market and the political system he requires, which doesn't make him different from his predecessors. Interesting, discount movie.
