It is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs (although I will openly admit that I haven't watched many others yet.) It's very stupid and funny, it's almost over a few minutes away the whole two hours of running, where you are not entertained. Almost all the gags have a great comic effect, few of them fall flat. I watched this movie after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard. And I compare these two flippers, and I realize exactly how high this film really is. It's funny from start to finish, nothing of the comedy is exaggerated or boring. The music is wonderful, just like the choreography of dance and fighting. The acting is exactly what you normally expect from this kind of movie. Elwes is a good comedian and makes a good Robin. The plot is typical Robin Hood, more or less, all of the legend is fit in this movie. If you like Mel Brooks, or you are just a fan of stupid humor, or if you just die to watch a good parody of Robin Hood's legend, it's definitely the movie for you. The HBO First Look special on the movie is also worth watching, and you also want to look through the credits. I would recommend it to any fan of Mel Brooks movies, and to people who enjoy silly humor. 10/07
