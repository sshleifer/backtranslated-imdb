POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> No one will probably pick up a red dust DVD without knowing it's about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile returning to her hometown as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament tortured by jailer Pete Muller (Ian Roberts) is. to escape the jail by witnessing before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who could or could imitate a South African accent; Mrs. Swank makes no attempt to cover her unmistakable American accent. Nevertheless, she is the only known actor in the movie, and it probably would not have been equally known to her. She does an acceptable job. However, Ejiofer and Muller (pronounced in the German way with an "om" about you) are excellent as police chief Jamie Barlett, who is responsible for murdering Mpondo's comrade and fellow prisoner. The torture scenes are briefly displayed, but they are alive and credible. What is not credible is the Truth and Reconciliation process - except that it actually happened. "Red Dust" should therefore be seen alone, because it was and is amazing that the ANC prisoners can actually forgive the martyrs, and it is as close as we are likely to see the process in action.
