I am collecting movies on Super 8, and got a full length of this one on E-bay last week. It looks right now, it's the only way to watch this movie in a country that has NTSC video. I have seen it many times on Region 2 DVD, but never region 1. <br /> <br /> I just watched it a few minutes ago and I was amazed at it. It is a powerful proof of freedom and to find your own place in the world. Photography and music were wonderful, and I really had some empathy for some characters. <br /> <br /> I like the idea that I was probably the only one in the US watching "When the North Wind blows" tonight! <br /> <br /> Long Live Avakum !!
