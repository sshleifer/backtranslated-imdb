I may differ from many people on this board, but I enjoy watching Mind Of Mencia. The reason I like Mind Of Mencia is that the host is not afraid to speak or exploit stereotypes. Carlos Mencia does what we all do with our friends, but is reluctant to give in and to. Mencia has no problem making jokes about any race, religion, sex or orientation. Although he gets a lot of it, in these politically correct times it is a fresh air. Mencia does not care if he offends anyone, but he is not a racist and even jokes about his own race. <br /> <br /> The typical format for the Mind of Mencia goes as follows: there will be an open skit fun of a person or a recent event. Mencia then comes out and raises up 5 or 6 minutes to talk about various issues. The show then shared 2 separate sketches by advertisements. In these sketches, Mencia does a variety of things like enjoying people, giving his personal opinions a funny twist, or just doing parodies of people, events or movies. At the end of the show, Mencia comes out for a moment with some last thing. <br /> <br /> People criticize Mencia for exploiting stereotypes and saying that his statements are too offensive. Carlos does just what everyone else thinks of certain races, but is afraid to say. As Mencia is offensive, he only speaks in his mind. I find nothing wrong. <br /> <br /> The show isn't perfect. The sketches can't be best composed and sometimes Mencia goes over the game in his jokes. For the most part, however, it is a show where the comedian says what he has in mind, no matter what the consequences are in a humorous matter. So if you're not afraid to die on stereotypes and see someone talking their minds and often say what you want to say, see Mind Of Mencia. But if you're easily offended, don't look at this show, because you'll be offended or worse, but you can even laugh.
