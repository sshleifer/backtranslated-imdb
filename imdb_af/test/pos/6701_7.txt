Okay, let's get it out of the way: As a piece of cinema, Lifeforce is rubbish. As a little cheesy entertainment for SF buffs, it has many merits. If you like looking at the old black and white SF B movies - giant mutated spiders / ant or alien monsters wandering around the desert - you'll really get a kick from Lifeforce. <br /> <br /> Bad things: The story makes little sense and the acting is pretty poor. Good things: The special effects are halfway decent; It has a welcoming different British-centered story (that's in London) that feels most SF movies different. and it entangled Mathilda May (amusing as "Space Girl") to look naked. <br /> <br /> In short: it's fun. <br /> <br /> I've seen it a half dozen now, and every time it comes on TV, I make time to watch it - though it's partly due to the naked Me. May - but it's also to do with enjoying a little rude and stupid SF.
