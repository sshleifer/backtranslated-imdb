OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now I ADORE her! How innovative. I love the fact that she has a cooking section - I admit that I sometimes overshoot that part just because it makes my WAAAY hungry! But I also love having the next day's grocery list on her website. I love to have regular helpers and that she has made her viewers become regular. I love how personal she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her secret guests. She looks as much more real as many other talk show hosts. She sometimes gets a little star truck and I love it. I love her talking about her personal life and reminding people how happy she is. She even mentioned tabloids before and it's so funny! She also has the funniest stories! Anyway, I'm a fan of life. Even my 2 year old knows who Rachael Ray is and he also loves her!
