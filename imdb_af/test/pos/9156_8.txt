This show was really good in many ways, but definitely an atypical western with the hero (?) Riding on a motorcycle rather than a horse, due to the establishment of 1914, is very late for a western between 1866 and 1890 established. At the time, I remember a controversy about its cancellation, but didn't really look at it at NBC. When I came to see and love it, it was a decade later when I was stationed in the army in Germany and it was armed every week from the beginning on Television. By that time, Margot Kidder was known as Lois Lane, but I would always think of her as Nichols's friend. In many ways, Nichols was much like Maverick; both were much more attracted to getting rich with little effort than they were fighting. It was in the small TV magazine they distributed at the PX (not really an authorized issue of "TV Guide", but made it as close as possible without getting into copyright issues) which I found the right story behind the cancellation learned. I really wonder what the next season would have been with the more violent twins as if they really made it as planned. Of course, by the time this show was made, the "Western era" of TV had been declining for about a decade. One day I hope to write that the "reality aura" has been in decline for a long time! While "Gunsmoke" and "Bonanza" are still running, they both approached their ends and it was years since a new Western really caught up; I think this trend did a lot to hold back "Nichols" and was the main reason why NBC executives doubt it will ever find a big audience. But to me, a good Western, as opposed to a show in contemporary times, is somewhat timeless, as other "era" shows; changing fashions and similar do nothing to make them look more dated than they were supposed to be. And I think it looks 10 years after it was produced, about which it brought me the point. Also, this show is an early combination of Garner and Stuart Margolin, which is actually one of the all-time awesome sidekicks, and not just in the Westerners.
