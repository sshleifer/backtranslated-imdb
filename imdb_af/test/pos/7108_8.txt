"House of Dracula" is a good successor of "House of Frankenstein". There isn't much action, but the acting is just as good. Onslow Stevens is the benevolent Doctor who gets worse after receiving blood from Dracula through a transfusion. Dracula actually received the transfusion to overcome his "misery" but he placed a play on a hunchback nurse and then transferred his blood to the doctor. It seems that Dracula didn't really come to look for a cure, but to drain blood from a beautiful nurse. Dracula is destroyed and the Wolf Man is next in line for a healing (which is successful). Meanwhile, Frankenstein's monster is discovered and revived shortly before being burned to death (don't worry, the same trio comes back in "Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein"). John Carradine again plays a sinister Dracula (Baron Latos is his alias at the start of the film and in the "House of Frankenstein"). Lon Chaney is the sympathetic Wolf Man and Glenn Strange returns as the Frankenstein monster. Lionel Atwill again plays an inspector, who he often does in Universal Studios monster movies. An officer for your collection.
