I love the mock documentary format that Chris Guest and crew has developed over the years. I really like this and "Wait for Guffman" better than "Spinal Tap", which was the first of the group (and made by Rob Reiner, but died Guest and several others of his mockumentary regulars). This humor is not for everyone. It is fairly subtle and not too physical, so some people may not be related. But as a dog lover (and a dog show fan), I loved this movie. There are so many funny lines in it! My daughter and I often get them together. I find it wonderful that these people can ad lib so much funny material for every movie! What a fun bunch they have to be. I highly recommend it to people who prefer their humor on the cerebral side.
