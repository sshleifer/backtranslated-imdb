Now, surely, one of the lightest stories that Bruce Willis has been so far. And it's still touching. I really like Bruce's style and persona, I haven't loved everything he has ever been in, but he brings it to me in most time in the big time. <br /> <br /> The story starts ..... He's power, confidence and style with a capital 'S'. He manages a Porshe, he lives well in a beautiful estate overlooking the fair city. This is Russell Duritz. He is an image consultant for those on top or up. His acknowledgment, he is Russell Duritz, he knows what it takes to make it. It just seems like life is moving quickly and basically, there is a problem, an intruder at his home, the alarm is activated! <br /> <br /> Russell doesn't seem to (for the moment) what happens to him. It is different and yet it is known. A little boy, who looks like .... Since their lives are hitting each other, there seems to be a reason for him: "You have unfinished things to look after now!" <br /> <br /> Amy, the supporting young lady of The story is probably the best balance he saw in his life. She works with him, puts up with his 'ego' and yet she is beaten with Russell. So much. With Rusty, his past is 'self' now in the picture and speaks a mile a minute and sings too late at night, all that matters is becoming like jelly! <br /> <br /> Willis is fun, self-centered and at times out of his mind in this lovely Disney modern classic The Kid and adding his little heavy-duty sidecar. Spencer Breslin is a perfect addition to this sparkling story from childhood to adult and back to childhood adventure. Chi McBride is an inspirational support character, as he is the heavyweight camp, learning a little rusty how to protect him from the bulls on the playground. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a true winner of a movie with even Lillie Tomlin as Russell's secretary and secretary. I originally saw it in 2000, and then again years later, with equal enjoyment. It's a shining family comedy that has a super end that recommends the hearts of a Disney fan. Highly recommended (*****)
