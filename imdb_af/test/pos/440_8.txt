Although it doesn't look very promising for a long stretch, Renoir's French Cancan finishes an effortlessly sweet movie. The story is cliché: a laundry girl, Nini (Françoise Arnoul), is discovered by a nightclub owner, Danglard (Jean Gabin). Danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and falls to his current girlfriend, both coming back for their former lovers. Nini must choose whether she goes back to the baker after her humble life, goes with her employer with her employer, or becomes a princess, as a prince falls in love with one. I'm glad the movie didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a smaller movie would definitely have. The film ends with the opening of Danglard's new nightclub, the Moulin Rouge, and some beautiful songs and dance songs. The first of them, "Complainte de la Butte", which also forms the basis of the movie's musical score, is simply one of the most beautiful songs ever written, and Renoir himself wrote it. If you are a fan of Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film Moulin Rouge! Is, you will recognize the song, as it comes near the beginning of the movie, by Rufus Wainwright. Although not very prominent in that film, everyone I know knows who owns the soundtrack. In addition to one of the most beautiful songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the finest leading ladies ever approaching the screen. It's hard not to fall over the heels. 8/10.
