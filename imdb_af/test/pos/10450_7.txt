I've always liked this movie and I'm glad it is finally available on DVD, so more viewers can see what I've been telling them over the years. The story is about a high school virgin, Gary (Lawrence Monoson), who works as a delivery hunter at a pizza place and hangs with his friends David (Joe Rubbo) and Rick (Steve Antin). Gary meets Karen (Diane Franklin) who is the new girl at school and one morning he gives her a ride and by this time he is completely in love. That night at a festival he saw Rick with Karen and now he is jealous of his best friend, but does not tell any of his true feelings. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Rick asks Gary to borrow his Oumas' vacant home, but Gary makes an excuse so Rick Karen cannot get alone. But one night Rick called for Gary to stick to the soccer field and Gary was furious. A few days later in the school library, Gary saw Rick and Karen and he asked Karen what was wrong. She told him she was pregnant and that Rick had dumped her. Gary helps her by taking her to his grandmother's home and paying for her abortion. Lastly, Gary tells Karen how he really feels about her and she feels receptive to his feelings, but later at her birthday party he goes back to Karen and Rick. Gary drove off without the girl! This film ends with a much more realistic version of how life really is. No matter how nice you are, you don't necessarily get the girl. <br /> <br /> This movie was directed by Boaz Davidson, who would be a proper movie director and he did two things right. Movie. First, he made sure that there was a lot of unnecessary nudity so that it was marketable to the young men who usually go to these movies. Secondly, he ended the movie with young Gary without Karen and I think the men in the audience can be tied up, no matter how hard you try to win a girl's heart. Yes, this movie is stupid and exploitative, but it's funny and sexy. Actress Louisa Moritz almost steals the movie as the sexy Carmela. Moritz was always a popular B-level actress and you may remember her in 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'. Like 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' it has a very good soundtrack and the songs played reflect what is going on in the story. But at the heart of this movie are two very good performances by Monoson and Franklin. There is a nudity that Franklin needs, but she still carries the grief of a young girl who dumps at a critical time. She was always a good actress and her natural charm is very clear in this film. But it's still Monoson's story and you can't help feeling this man. When the movie ends, it's his performance that stays with you. It's a solid work of acting that makes it more than just a teen sex comedy. Even with the foolish scenarios of teenagers trying to have sex, this movie is still capable of achieving what it wants. Underlined comedy hits the Bullseye.
