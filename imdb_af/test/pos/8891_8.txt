Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) has a crazy life: his wife (Kate Mulgrew) stole his book and left him. He has a new emerging romance with a girl named Beth (Kim Greist). He doesn't know how to start his book. , and its students of its writing class are strange than most. One student (Danny DeVito), however, is strange. He lives with his evil mother (Anne Ramsey) and can't get the courage to kill her. So as he goes to Larry for help, make his life go from ordinary to extra crazy! <br /> <br /> Stu Silver had to do more! The dialogue, the characters, the entire script is almost perfect! And Danny DeVito proved to me that he is more than a good actor: he is a good director! His children's film Matilda is one of my favorite family flies and now it is one of my favorite comedies. <br /> <br /> It's a black comedy, most jokes are about murder, but it's joke funny! All the actors do their full potential, whether they are Billy Crystal or just one-off characters (Olivia Brown). <br /> <br /> If you like comedy (Who?) than you will have! 8/10 stars.
