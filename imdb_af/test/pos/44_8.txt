Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy raised by some unusual people in a home. <br /> <br /> It's edited and soundtrack really pulls you into the story and lets you experience the movie as the author really intended. <br /> <br /> The music is really tied up in the story, which made the characters alive. The editing made the story more progressive and engaging. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by some of the performances of the role, especially S. Epatha Merkerson's. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see the one-man show with these movies. author, Ruben Santiago-Hudson.
