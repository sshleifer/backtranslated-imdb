This film tells of the real story of Ramon Sampedro, lying in bed for 27 years after breaking his neck and fighting for legal permission for someone who can help with his death. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem is one of the best actors of his generation. Consider it: he must wear this movie with his face only! Unbelievable that he didn't even get an Oscar nomination. Now we can all see that the Academy is a joke! The supporting role was great! The optimistic Rosa, his lawyer Julia, the rest of the family ... Everyone has his own opinion on the fact that Ramon wants to die. <br /> <br /> Whether or not you are put to death is your opinion as this movie deserves to be seen by people around the world! Halfway through the movie I started crying and it didn't stop until the credits rolled. This movie is so heartbreaking but also great to watch and I can't wait to see it again. I give it a 9/10, and in my opinion this is by far the Best Film of the year so far.
