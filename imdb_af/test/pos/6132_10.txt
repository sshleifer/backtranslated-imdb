I watched this movie "Miniseries" on television in 1989 and it was an amazing movie. I'd like to find a copy of it just to watch it again and again. It's been 15 years since I watched it and it still remains in my mind. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it pulls you. The characters and plot line hold you. The end was wonderful. The feeling and anger the boy showed when he found out the truth about his father is unforgettable. The tension about how it will come out and how he will confront his father is very intense. <br /> <br /> If you get a copy of this movie, you will thoroughly enjoy viewing it. <br /> <br /> Then email me and tell me where to get a copy.
