I broadcast Teen Devian on a Friday night in Dordarshan, and hardly believed that such a remarkable film was ever made in Bollywood. It was thought blowing ?? a movie with a "modern" story, great music, three beautiful ladies and my faw superstar Dev Anand. In this unusual storyline, Dev is in love with three women? the simple Nanda, the surprising Kalpana and the sophisticated Simi. They are also busy with him and want to marry him. This puts Dev in a dilemma (which is at the heart of the storyline) - who to marry? He consulted a hypnotist who asked Dev to look at a crystal ball. Dev finds the answer and marries Nanda. Beautifully targeted (probably by Dev himself and not by Amarjeet the official director) does the B&W classic evergreen music? some of SD Burman's (with great support from RD Burman) best compositions. "Uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth" is probably the most sexiest song ever in Hindi movies. Credit must also be given to Majrooh Sultanpuri to pay the memorable lyrics. Teen Devian is a broad musical that perfectly fits the style of Dev Anand and he has maintained the role. Unfortunately, Teen Devian has never received the recognition and popularity it deserves. <br /> <br /> A must see for any Hindi movie buff, I'll judge the eternal favorite 9.5 out of 10.
