It kept me on the edge of my seat. True, the story has some plot holes, but its tension, the way the director just keeps the prospect, is simply fascinating. <br /> <br /> Jos√© Coronado and Adriana Ozores are two of Spain's best actors (see La Vida Mancha and Hector) and here they appear as a happy upper middle class couple. Under all, the truth is that all the life of Coronado is a lie. He is not an economist, never went to college or does not work in Spain's Central Bank reserve, as everyone else believes. We get some insights on how he has acted or succeeded in doing so, and although it is not very plausible, it is somehow credible. <br /> <br /> The inner workings of the scam are shown at intervals, but this is credible because Coronado is a source of self-assurance and self-esteem. He not only believes in the scam, he also believes in the film performance, and therefore he bears it. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it tests belief that a woman will hardly know the inner workings of a marriage's finances. 10 years, but again, as he is presumably a brilliant economist. <br /> <br /> It was said in a nationalist show that the movie is not "unique Spanish", as if it were a litmus test film. True, no castles or strange cabbies in this one, just a naughty thriller. You will want to know how this story ends when you start watching.
