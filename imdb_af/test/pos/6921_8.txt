tell you what it was excellent. Dylan Moran is simply the funniest actor on the screen (and on stage) and with Micheal Caine, since your spouse is also not bad, both are good at watching a very funny movie. Certainly not all the gags come off, but it's worth holding on to those who do, but come up with Micheal Caine in a dress in it. Every time Dylan Moran appears on the screen, it's more like Bernard black film. The story is two actors (Moran and Caine) who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters by tracing other personas to deceive them all, but to get away is another matter. basically "the actors" is a great British comedy that somehow is missed by many if your Moran fan (or Micheal Caine wants to see in a dress) definitely see it
