I love this show! It's incredible ... I can never miss an episode, even though I've seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts ...... i love Gilmore girls! I got all my friends to see it. even their parents are watching it now. I watch it daily and I usually look more than once a day. I wish my mother was like Lorelei. my friends say I'm talking like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. It's a good teenage show because they actually learn to watch it. my vocabulary has expanded to look at Gilmore Girls. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bled El are ideal for parts of Lorelei and Rory. I think Luke and Lorelai have to get married because Chris Lorelei and Rory have left too many times. and broke too much Lorelei's heart.
