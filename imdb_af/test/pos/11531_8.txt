I let it down, let Mexican cable catch and I have to rant over it. The title is translated as "Secretos" (Secrets). Well, there's a secret that plays an important role in the movie, but come on! We're not stupid. We know there is a novel behind this. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is pretty interesting and worn by its solid ramming performances. The always beautiful and beautiful Jordana Brewster and Christopher Eccleston deliver good performances and have such good chemistry between them. Cameron Diaz is also good, although she has minimal screen time. Blythe Danner is perfect and his last appearance in the movie is touching. Great performances. <br /> <br /> Jordana's character and her sister's ex-boyfriend travel to Europe so they can deal with his demons and understand why her sister is dead. Through flashbacks we learn the sad truth and we can't help but sorry for the whole family. The end is really moving. <br /> <br /> So there's nudity, but it's minimal. In fact, the sex scene is artificial and does not intend to be steamy or sexy. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I watched it for Joranda Brewster's screen, charm and beauty. And I finally kept the story and the dramatic presentations. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a try if you like solid dramatic features. Great movie. The last, last scene was very sad. The two little sisters through flashbacks.
