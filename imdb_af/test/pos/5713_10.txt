John Leguizamo's one-man player is both funnier and more involved than most movies you will see. A number of devices, such as slideshows, are used to enhance the story, but these are essentially good old-fashioned performance art. Pay special attention to his hilarious version of "I Will Survive". * Highly recommended.
