It is a little-sighted anti-war film that has been ignored for too long. The time is Thanksgiving in 1972. The place is a typical suburban home somewhere in Texas. The eldest son just came back from Vietnam and he has a hell of a time to relive the life he left behind. And the family doesn't know how to handle the problem. I honestly don't think I'm exaggerating when I say it's one of the most heartbreaking war movies I've seen. The funny thing is that there is only a handful of battle order in the whole movie. Most of the story takes place in a house in a few days. But the kind of war taking place in this house is as intense as any real battlefield action. The movie does something difficult to achieve; Estevez and his team somehow created a film that embodies the entire Vietnam experience. And considering the similarities between Vietnam and the current invasion of Iraq, the film is surprisingly relevant. Estevez does a wonderful job with material. He gets a lot of help from a hand-picked role. Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates in particular are wonderful as parents. A real moving movie. Highly recommended
