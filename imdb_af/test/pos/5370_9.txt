One of the best-known occult-oriented horror films of the seventies. It is eager, exciting, frightening, surrealistic here and there and in the moment even very clever, which cannot be said of many of the movies of this kind. I can't help seeing a few stitches of symbolic and metaphorical points in the seventies society and generation things of the time this movie was done. The screenwriter, of course, cooked while also delivering good guys "from the crib" kind of scenes. With a job well done by a creative director, the result is entertaining and thoughtful. The simple but effective end shows how these things are treated properly by those who can. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast was especially unknown to me, except LQ Jones as the moody but funny sheriff and Strother Martin as the city doctor. Martin, not surprisingly, always ends up stealing the movie. With that voice and skill, he is one of the biggest wages in movies anyway. What an actor! <br /> <br /> So, it's a little secret to me why this movie didn't get much recognition. I think it will earn almost equal place in the occult horror cannon alongside Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. A helluva movie!
