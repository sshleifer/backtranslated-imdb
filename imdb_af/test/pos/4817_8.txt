The world is going to miss John Frankenheimer. It was his first feature film and it was four years before he managed his second movie, but don't let that keep you from trying it out. Frankenheimer's direction is assured, and he gets some compelling actions out of his role. <br /> <br /> Someone else has pointed it out, but I also want to talk to James Gregory and Whit Bissell in two key supporting roles. Both will work for Frankenheimer again - Gregory especially as the common senator in "The Manchurian Candidate" - and they do good work for him here. <br /> <br /> In the end, if the whole thing looks too simple, it's just because Frankenheimer and author Robert Dozier prefer to tell a simple story, and they do it well. Look out for it - Turner Classic Movies can only show it again.
