The first murder scene is one of the best killings in film history (almost as good as the Psycho landfill) and Robert Walker's play is fantastic. A psychopath involved in tennis star in swords. This is the story and overall this movie is very good, but there is one problem: why does Guy Haines not even go to the policeman.4 / 5 <br /> <br />
