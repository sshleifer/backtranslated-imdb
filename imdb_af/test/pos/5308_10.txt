The United States of Leland was a wonderful movie. I kept it on the guide on my TV without knowing what it was and never having the chance to sit and go in there. One morning when I woke up early, I saw that it was about to begin. So I decided to see it. I had the time and interest to see it. When I saw Ryan Gosling in the movie and then he was the main character, I was immediately sucked in and I couldn't move from my couch. The struggle that Leland is going through is such an inspiring story. Everybody has to deal with the same thoughts in their lives one day, whether it's a small little detail or something as big as he goes. I have to sit back and watch the movie just catch all the things I missed for the first time. As a general comment ... I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Gosling fan or someone who just keeps a good movie with a good, good story. The fact that there are so many other great stars that all had good performances, is just an added BONUS! So doing what you can to take the time to watch this movie, I can almost be sure it won't be a waste of time.
