(There are Spoilers). A straight afternoon, Joanna Kndall, Margaret Colin, is distracted for a brief moment and a little girl drives along the road. To do what she can to keep the injured younger comfortable, Joanna will ask for help at a local service station. Before she can give her name, Joanna holds the phone to return to the girl and see if she's all right; It is now and then when the nightmare starts for Joanna. <br /> <br /> Heartbreaking drama that any one of us can bring when trying to do the right thing, but is influenced by the words and feelings of those around you. To come back to the accident station. Joanna sees it being isolated by the highway police. Before she could tell them what had happened, and her involvement in it, Joanna began to think about herself. <br /> <br /> What would initially be a tragic accident seems to be a hit and run off with Joanna staring at bars, if caught. Even much worse, with her life she's seen almost every day, the little girl's family, she's been walking, Kelly Corey, Dallas Deremer. She goes to the same school as her two daughters, Mindy & Holly, Gretchen Esau & Kira Posey. Joanna's life began to break apart while trying to keep the truth of her friends and family, not to mention the Eaton police, of what she was involved with Little Kelly's accident. <br /> <br /> You can easily see the words of her friends and neighbors as well as her husband Doug, Drew Phillbury, accomplishing the hit and run, Joanna. These were the words Joanna couldn't bring to admit what she had done not only for her own concerns, but also for her two daughters and her husband. Feel that they will be avoided by people who knew them for years as friends and neighbors. <br /> <br /> Joanna is about to lose her mind, trying to catch her friend Nancy Grayson, Sherry Hursey, in Kelly's accident by trying to transplant her, which she lost in Joanna's home , at the accident site. It's then that she realizes what she is doing and suddenly stops her from getting worse, and doesn't want Kelly's accident, but also innocent Nancy's freedom and reputation on her conscience. <br /> <br /> Margraet Colin gives a beautiful show as the guilty of Joanna Kendall and you can really feel her seeing how she is eaten inside and not knowing what to do. First, trying to get in touch with the police, caused a series of error reports that Joanna became a refugee from the law. When she finally became Joanna, she became the most hated and despised person in Eaton. <br /> <br /> Not itself, when it is still big, Joanna's husband begins to feel that she is either smoking or even having a relationship. Never in a million years would Doug have thought that Joanna was the person who drove Little Kelly down and killed her on the rain-soaked road! The look on his face, with the mouth trembling, when he found out the truth, said it all. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes of the movie went a long way from what Joanna went through, not to relieve the suffering of the injured Kelly Corey and her parents and how she should now watch the music for what she done for the rest of her life.
