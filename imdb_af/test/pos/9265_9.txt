I became a fan of the TV series `Homicide: Life on the Street 'late in the show career, but quickly became a fan. It was a police show, unlike any other: visually different in the use of handheld cameras, where the viewer was watched everywhere, with his multi-ethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities, and that all the good and bad of a police department, including the corruption and personality clashes calling to the surface. <br /> <br /> Murder: The film, the reunion sequel to the series, is as good as a television for television. Na Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, has been shot, the series's members are back to help find the killer. In addition, those who left the force and those who died also succeeded in having their place in the film. The intensity and fire that the series has marked is coming back, and the writing hair with the same fire that marked the series. All in all, a great TV movie. <br /> <br /> Vote: 9
