I have looked at two episodes so far, I really like it. Although I am no longer in college, it misses my wonderful college life. I wish I had spent a little more time. I identify myself with rust. When I rushed to a brotherhood, my big brother wasn't like Cappie, I wish I had a big brother like him. So if a show like this can actually make people identify with the characters, then it's a pretty good performance. <br /> <br /> It's more realistic than the American pie with less explicit sex jokes. Can we also call it a younger version of "desperate women"? Some of the authors themselves must be the Greeks. The story seems a bit out of the actual brotherhood and masterful life. It's shot in high definition. And they actually filmed outside instead of studios. So the picture quality is very good. They can easily make it a good movie. Unlike a movie that can last just a few hours, I can have about 45 minutes of fun watching it weekly on TV. <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, the actors are about the right age and they are new and fresh, so make them more real. This show is virtually everyone. There are also Asian and black freaks and girls in the show. It's almost a little shocking that they had a little story about two guys in the fraternity, having sex in the first episode, and trying to re-join the second episode. I don't think I've seen anything like that on TV before. This show somehow reminded of a Warner brochure of teenagers called "Young Americans", which was canceled early in 2001. In that show, a girl dressed as a man kissed a man and the man thought she was a male gay. <br /> <br /> Greek life can be fun, but at the same time students have to study for exams, etc. By the time people really have free time in their lives, there is no brotherhood of sadness for them to join. I don't know how long this show will last, sooner or later, those people will also have to go to college. Maybe they'll find some new actors for another 4 years of fun college life!
