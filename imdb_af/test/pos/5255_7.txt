My sisters and my cousin forced me to see this chick film. It's not the kind of movie I would like to see, but it wasn't really that bad. I don't want to see this movie, but after watching it, I couldn't say it's bad, just not my kind of movie. It was very accurate to find out which woman actually speaks and does in certain situations. As a man, I was not too joking about the jokes, but the man the women were sure of. They relate to the movie and yes it was funny to see themselves on the big screen. "OH EM GIVE I DO THIS TO HAHA" I have never seen the original, nor will I do it. If you're a girl, it's a must see, but maybe girls will say this movie sucks, probably. I don't see a 13-year-old man, "Did I remember throwing it when I was thirty." <br /> <br /> No one would have it in the collection, but I can't say it was terrible. , so meh.
