The Mascot is Ladislaw Starewicz's masterpiece. It tells the story of a stuffed toy dog ​​looking for an orange after hearing the mother tells her daughter she has no money. The dog is selected with other toys to be sold. In the truck, after the other starts while the vehicle is running, the dog stays waiting to be picked up from the shop before coming off separately. He can get orange after cutting the woman's leg while selling and selling fruit. As he ran, he met the devil and accepted his offer to stop at the nightclub. There he met the other toys that jumped off the truck. The cat next to him in the vehicle is particularly determined to get dogs' orange. I'll just stop here to mention that other wonderful bizarre things happen in nightclub that you have to see for yourself. That's enough to say, if you like Starewicz and are interested in all the animations from the past, I definitely recommend you to choose one!
