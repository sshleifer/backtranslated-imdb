This movie features some of the best ensemble work I've seen in film or on stage. The actors play one another with a skill and vitality that cannot be achieved by editing. <br /> <br /> "Love Jones" a good story, period. But it is also an excellent portrayal of the often-seen urban, middle-income, twenty-something African American set.
