I saw this movie in the theater when I was 14 and it changed my life. I immediately cut off my hair and started buying all the tape records in the movie. These were some of the chapters of L.A. punk rock captured at the height of their powers. Ties such as Black Flag (pre-rollins), Circle Jerks, Fear, X, and the Kieme have little equal in the history of punk music. I can't believe this movie has never been put on video or DVD. Great movie for fans of punk rock.
