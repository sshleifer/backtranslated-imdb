This movie and its subsequent TV series has become the iconic stand-in for what is great about America. <br /> <br /> Fame is known for its music and performances. There are several standouts including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara *, and the excellent Gene Anthony Ray. The latter, who plays a walk-on dancer with no academic or other as "street" evidence, is a wonderful personality and is worth looking for what is essentially a depiction of himself. A wonder to see, as one king had the opportunity to say. <br /> <br /> The plot follows an interesting format - chronologically at times, genre at other times, personalities in some cases ... but it really ends in some sort of rush. <br /> <br /> Where Parker succeeds, this movie is in a periodic exaggeration - with the extremely striking and sometimes beautiful and straightforward camping music score that the artists take step by step. <br /> <br /> The climax of the movie is a climax for all time. And this climatic complete movie of many talented musicians and dancers and music is fortunately repeated by the credits. It's a set of credits worth going through ... a performance for the ages. The music by Christopher Gore is a gift to watch.
