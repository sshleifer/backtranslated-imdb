I do not agree with the imdb.com summary that it is about a bisexual guy who is preparing to marry. It's all about all the crap we go through - self-induced and because of our parents - what we need to "stand over" when we grow up. As the Linda McCarriston poem says, "Childhood is the barrel they throw you over the fall." This movie is much more like a narrative poem. It is about life and the mistakes we make and hurt that we have seen and experienced over the years, and in the end it is about love (I try not to be hyper-sensitive or shameless) and find and is with one special person.
