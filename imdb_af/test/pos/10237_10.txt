Nightbreed is not only great, it is also unique, even with other Barker's movies, which never have originality. A wonderful adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. For the horror genre, it has quite a few subtle symbols and references. Surely fun to think about, if you care. And, not to forget, a nice music party. Well, the special effects are usually faster than anything, but this is probably the only downside. I saw it again just after ten years, and I still find it something to recommend.
