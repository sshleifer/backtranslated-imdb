This movie was incredible, it was very funny and moving. Damien O'Donnell and Jeffrey Caine have compiled a fantastic movie that will appeal to all ages. James McAvoy and Steven Robertson made this movie brilliant. Their performance was excellent, there was this true life-like feeling between them, which made them believe they were the characters they acted on. Romola Garai is incredibly beautiful and brilliant in her role. The story of these two physically-challenged people and their caregiver is well-conveyed, and you really start to grow to know and feel the characters as the movie goes on. It was especially disturbing in the end. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a warm movie, warning the more sensitive viewer that you have tissues you need. <br /> <br /> Again wonderful movie !!
