This film was definitely not very sophisticated. No, the humor was actually pretty stupid now I think about it. But while I was thinking about it, I laughed to prove that decent comedy didn't have to be very deep. <br /> <br /> Fatucker Arbuckle is the definite star of this short, despite Buster Keaton's appearance in the film as well. He is the butcher in a cute grocery store. There were a lot of stupid things in the store and I think I liked the coffee mill order most - just watch it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, later, Fatty's girlfriend is forced to go to a girls' school and because he can't participate, he pulls in and pulls in the school. Arbuckle is an ugly woman! So, for foolish and unsophisticated fun, see this movie. It won't change your life and is a very small picture, but it's also fun.
