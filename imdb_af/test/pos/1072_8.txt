Our Toronto judge has told you what you need to know about this movie (except it needs to be edited - the hand technique gets really old, really fast). I saw this movie last night in Menerbes, France. We are in the Luberon Valley, which is covered with vineyards and of course winemakers. They were all there in the Salle de Polyvalente for the show. Polite, patient, brilliant. Although my French is testy, I got the core of the film, but I noticed that the audience questioned the "old" terrorists. one of a communist village in Languedoc. He laughed a lot. It is unusual in France that laughs out loud. There is no doubt which side of the terror-globalization war they are on! SM
