A gem of a British caper comedy. Poor American club Pinky Green (Richard Jordan, who is still a bad guy, but this time a beautiful man) comes from a British prison and tries straight, but his maintenance man working in a bank is too attractive for her never reformed criminal friends. , led by a very nasty Ivan (David Niven in one of his last roles). Pinky resists, but the lure of all that money is just too much for him. Things unraveled and rerel and it is all joyful to watch. Jordan had to play 20 bad guys in his career, but he never played the same twice - this one just loves to hate. Niven never played a bad bad guy, oil everywhere. Two fine actors we lost, wish I had come back.
