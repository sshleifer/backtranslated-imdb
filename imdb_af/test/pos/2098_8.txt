This film was made by Daiei Studios, famous for its Gamera movies. It's about a samurai gentleman murdered by one of his own men. He claims his throne, forcing his former two children to flee in the forest, where they stand near a large rock statue for 10 years. In the past, the new samurai gentleman proved very brutal and relentless towards the townspeople and the valley. Therefore, it seems that the good people's only hope is the stone image, where a demon sleeps God; they want the god to help them. <br /> <br /> This samurai film brings us traditional Japanese aspects such as sword fighting, geisha and worshipers. It's a wonderful and powerful story of survival and hope, with the protagonists trying to overcome pure evil. It's full of excitement, especially the areas where the kids are struggling to stay hiding because the evil crisis comes out to get them. In addition, it has beautiful cinematography, with nice landscapes of the village and countryside - reminiscent of the ancient times in Japan. <br /> <br /> As with most samurai movies such as "The Seven Samuari" and "The Last Samuarai," this movie is no less than pure, sometimes graphic, action. There are several disturbing scenes in the movie. That's why it's not the informal sci-fi movie. Yet, it is strong and powerful and gives a message that a well-known man can overcome any opponent, as depicted in this film, even the young innocent girl can calm the anger of the devil god. The screens of the devil god, known as Daimajin, who trampled on his enemies and anything in his path, will immediately remind you of a Godzilla or Gamera movie. Overall, a powerful and serious but hopeful movie. <br /> <br /> So be careful with your samurai sword. You don't want to rattle Daimajin's cages. <br /> <br /> Grade A
