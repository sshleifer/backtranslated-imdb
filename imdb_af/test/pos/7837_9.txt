I found the episodes to be fascinating and well written. As a television program, it was entertaining that I expected from fictitious entertainment. I love the "relationship" between the professor and his female security guard ... although sometimes her Scottish accent makes it difficult to understand what she is saying. I was hoping there would be more than four episodes. I acknowledge that one commentator / reviewer of this series commented on his opinion as a physician. I understand this gentleman's comments; However, it is a fictitious television series intended to entertain ... not exact facts like a documentary present. Patrick Stewart performs well and makes his character credible. If you want to watch a documentary, it's not the series for you. But if you want to see unique scientific theories in an entertainment-based medium, you'll enjoy the four episodes.
