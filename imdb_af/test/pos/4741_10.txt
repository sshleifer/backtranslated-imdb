After looking at "Waco: The Rules of Commitment", I just put in disbelief over which I was testified. A huge FBI cover, a massacre by gung-ho / trigger happy government agents? I clearly remember the Waco departure, at that time I was 17 and watched it all on CNN. I remembered reflecting on all the children when I watched the Mount Camel burn in April 1993. I remember sorry for the children, but clearly felt that it was the mistake of their evil leader, David Koresh and the other Davids. Gazecki's film clearly and undoubtedly shows, though biased, that the FBI has lied over and over. I think this movie was a major contributor to the reopening of a new investigation into the incident in 1999. The outcome of this new investigation was in some sense predictable, the verdict was based on something just as gray as facts presented by the Davids. I was very disappointed with the verdict because, as far as I know, it did not take into account all the lies, misinformation and evidence covered by the FBI and other officials. Why has no one been persecuted to obstruct the work of the Texas Rangers investigators? Why were they allowed to pollute the crime scene and to stamp the composition shortly after the incident? These are questions I have not received from the government. Most importantly, how about the children? In this new investigation, I was not informed of who was responsible for spraying the CS flammable tear gas into a compound with many hazards to explode this gas and I found no response as to whether the children 's muscles were infected. of the effects of the gas while they were alive. If they did, I would surely think that Janet Reno or ever in charge of the attack should be charged for mass murder or manslaughter. The question raised by Gazecki, but not mentioned; Was a direct plan for the people in charge and their tanks to cut holes and intentionally burn the building? (a plan that would be 112% effective) or were the officials in control so incompetent that they were unaware of the consequences of their actions? Both are equally scary. Even if the Dawidians set fire to the composition, the officers in charge certainly gave them the opportunity to do the job. If the officials were in control, as they claimed, the Dawidians would burn the connection, why did the f? did the tanks cut all the holes in the building and made it into an oven and why didn't they have plans to handle the fire they knew? Dark Questions That Still Do Not Leave The final and most relevant issue of this film is the way in which the Davidians are demonstrated by the government through the media, which only feeds it to the public. I clearly remember the resentment I felt for the evil Davids I saw on CNN in 1993. Now I'm older, I can see a clear line of communication coming out of the government every time they're ready for a massacre of civilians. with the intended targets. Demonstrate people with words like; "they have different illegal values ​​then our" "they do not enjoy freedom" and "they are a threat to our freedoms and way of life" make them so much easier to kill ????
