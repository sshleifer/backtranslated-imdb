It is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'The Hollow'. It can be argued that the real mystery here is not one of Christie's best, but what makes The Hollow special is the characterization and I found that the actors here were, more or less without exception, perfect in their parts. In such a uniform throw it is difficult to choose election, but I have to say that Sarah Miles is just perfect like Lucy Angkatell. What is extraordinary is that she not only transmits Lucy's dottiness, tactlessness and her more sweet qualities, but she also succeeds in subtracting the underlying truth that Lucy is not so nice! Megan Dodds is also very good as Henrietta and Claire Price influence much as Gerda. John Christow is really an untouchable character, but Jonathan Cake still controls us to see what his wives see in him. <br /> <br /> As I said, the script follows the story fairly faithfully. The only disturbing thing I have found is that Midge and Edward's relationship really comes out of nowhere and I believe some of it should land on the cutter floor! They are a secondary story however, and the primary story is done very well. The whole thing also looks beautiful and really a perfect English autumn. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie in every respect and worth seeing.
