I love this movie so much. It always makes me cry. If you appreciate Drew Barrymore as much as I do, you'll love this movie. It has all the necessities I'm looking for in a movie. It has good actors, good characters, good humor ... also very heartwarming moments. The flashy moments when we see Josie in high school, however, make me cry. Every time. I'm sure you'll like this one, don't judge, based on the fact that it looks like a teen movie, even if it's a teen movie. Certainly, if you are an old man and all you look for, hardcore special effect movies are just in the top 250 movies of all time, so it's not for you. But if you like romantic comedies, you won't forget to see it, pick it up at a video store and enjoy: Drew Barrymore is great in this one!
