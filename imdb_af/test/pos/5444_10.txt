If it's taken as a whole for his ideas and dissection of the current 2-party system and political process, I think it's a good movie. Granted the movie wasn't the comedy I expected, but as soon as I was over, this movie really made me think. So much of what we see and hear about any election is such a joke. There is especially a debate scene in this movie that I felt was a masterful criticism of our political debates and how policies are discussed on them. I encourage anyone who thinks our process is good to watch this movie. However, if you want to laugh, Robin Williams and Christopher Walken are not their usual self. In this movie they show us that the truth hurts, not that the truth is funny.
