*** Spoilers submit *** My late childhood has two cinematographic icons: Star Wars and this movie by Czech genius Karel Zeman. A Jules Verne encyclopedia where XIX-century illustrations come to life in beautiful black and white photography, combined with stop motion and conventional animation. Verne's adventure spirit is completely present in the film, as well as a very modern question about the moral limits of power and advanced technology. In fact, it brings atomic energy into Verne's universe in a very elliptical and elegant way. Also elliptical and elegant is the downfall of the villain, with a (probably nuclear) explosion that makes his hat fly over the sea. The resolution of the movie is symbolic and very satisfying, something very rare today, when many movies do not seem to know how to end themselves. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to catch this gem in reruns. local TV in the late 70's: it improved my entertainment of Verne's fiction and cinema. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for Karel Zeman, undervalued master of imagination.
