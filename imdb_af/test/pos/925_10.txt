May we interfere with our fellow man's everyday life? Is it possible to urge their intimacy to penetrate the inner minds of their homes to violate the privacy of their own homes without blaming them? The director doubts these seemingly soluble questions, almost sympathetic to Judge Jean Luis's destabilizing decision to determine his own dedicated self-isolation through fragments of life obscured by him. <br /> <br /> "Trois couleurs: Rouge" is based on the concept of "UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION THAT HAS BEEN HUMAN WORLD OF AN OPEN WINDOW IN THE WORLD". The phone is regarded as the main character of the story: after the show in Decalogue 9, at the beginning it gives the coast of Kieslowski's spectators, step by step in its fast-paced race across the globe. The director looks deeply at the faculty of communication of people without accepting a definite stance on the ethical side of individual behavior. Once again he shows us the unpredictability of future events, and the cautious descriptions of foreign courses and life records are separated by a considerable number of years. Inexplicable combinations come together in a series of continuous and disturbing situations. - Some books fall on the pavement. - One of them openly on a fateful page, which determines the future of a future career, as in a past similar appearance. - Smiles of daily life encounter briefly, ideally linked by their love for the fictional musician Van den Budermayer. - Human fortunes characterized by the most fatal coincidence. <br /> <br /> In this piece of work earned to be seen with our heart's eyes, instead of our minds, we can play a dialectical play between Judge Jean Luis' Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Valentine Dussaut (Irene Jacob, perhaps the dearest actress of our time, along with the beautiful Winona Ryder) in a generation conflict between the experience of a world-old man and the self-confident immaturity of a beautiful girl at the point of the steepest path of her emerging way. Kieslowski talks about "dialogue tests" between a disappointed human life and a youth unaware of her future, between a spiritless misanthrope and a spontaneous girl with a good sense of selflessness. <br /> <br /> And the final parade when the damp smell of tragedy still in the air, with all the main characters of the entire trilogy in full evidence, saved by a random luck scene, thanks to the cleverly written prescription , we give the utmost greetings from this movie master who is completely used to his great passion for cinema. Only a feeling of bitter regret and emptiness is left to remind us of the existence of a void that is impossible to fill. GOOD BYE KRZYSZTOF. We miss you so much!
