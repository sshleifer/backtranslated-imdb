I first saw this movie in video form. Even on a television screen, the views were impressive. As it is seen on the big screen in its full glory, it must have blown away people. <br /> <br /> As one or two other comments pointed out, the story of the early pioneers and how they got around the problems of the terrain etc. on the road to Oregon is just as authentic as any movie can be. It therefore shows that it is totally unnecessary to take liberty into the truth - something that filmmakers today have to consider - the reality is enough. <br /> <br /> The plot relies on man's struggle against the elements and hostile natives. Subplots are small and simple. But the basic plot is enough. Elsewhere, I checked Paramount's competitor to the great route, Fighting Caravans. In spite of a more sophisticated plot, and with better actors, the fighters lacked the breathtaking scenes. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail must be compulsory.
