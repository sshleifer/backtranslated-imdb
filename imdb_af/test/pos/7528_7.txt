One day a red alley cat is full of people being kicked and attacked by dogs and muses, that life would be better if he were a skunk. He then painted himself black with a white stripe on his back and added a little Limburger cheese to him to stink. Initially, life can't be better for him, the dog flees and the butcher leaves his shop to run the cat with a pile of meat. Just as he thinks everything is perfect. He is noticed by a real skunk, not just a skunk, but the exuberantly sweet Pepé Le Pew. Pepé misses the poor cat for a female skunk and strives to think his protests are just ashamed. Our poor cat thinks he escaped when he threw a tray out of a long building so Pepé would think he was dead. In the first place it looks as if he is working, but when he sneaks, he sees him and immediately the dead skunk forgets. In the end, the cat realizes he is better off being kicked and attacked than having a rimmed skunk. There is also a nice ending for the skunk when his wife finds out what he has gained. <br /> <br /> It was a rather funny introduction to Pepé Le Pew, who was just excessively amorous at the time, but now looks like a rogue sexually harassing stalker, although he was eventually punished for his behavior.
