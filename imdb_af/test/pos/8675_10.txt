Quite differently, with lots of understatement and black comedy, it's a movie we see, but those who do, remember it. This movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way. What is it about? Extrusion, I believe. Probably up to the viewer, but I found this movie trying to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades. Don't know if I'm right. But this movie really got me. See it. I really hope that the team behind this movie will make more movies, and that they will do it in their own, a little weird style. And I forgot: The Casting here I am wonderful, with Trond Fausa Aurv√•g perfectly in the role of the Bothersome Man, who does not understand where he is, what he does and why. The recognition that we do not understand the purpose of life (in the city) makes it difficult. All the others do as they are told, and pretend (?) To be happy. This movie is a good and humorous commentary on life in 2006.
