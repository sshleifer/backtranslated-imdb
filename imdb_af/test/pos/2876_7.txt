A dangerous psychopathic killer, Jacob Goodnight, was filmed in the desolate and rotting Blackwell Hotel, alone with his nightmares until eight teenage criminals appeared in community service with the police spokesman, four years ago, who wounded Jacob. When one of them is kidnapped by the murderer and her fate uncertain, the remaining small criminals must fight for their lives ... "Sea No Evil" was directed by pornographic film maker Gregory Dark and it is star WWE superstar Kane as unrelenting psychopath. The supporting role is terrible and there are no surprises to find here, but there are plenty of extreme violence and gore for the treasure fans to enjoy. Generally, I like this movie, and you should also, if you are mindful of it. Sure, it's clich√©, but what cares. out of 10.
