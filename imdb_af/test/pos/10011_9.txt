I have to say, every time I see this movie, I get deeply touched not only by the painful four years of Hongsheng's life, but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction. It is also true that you become addicted to anything like drugs, alcohol or pornography, can not only hurt you, but also hurt your most important people in the world: your family. Since the family is the first priority in Asian culture, it is difficult for the circle to come together and show one person how much the family likes them. It's actually the first Chinese movie I actually enjoy, not for the pleasure of it, but the elements around it (wonderful acting, touching story, good direction) make this movie worth watching. What matters most is that Hongsheng and his family work out the story themselves instead of trying a B-movie actor to imitate the right person. It shows the authenticity of the movie.
