Even if you are a fan of Jean Rollin's idiosyncratic work, you will be captivated by this exceptional refuge in science fiction. For once there is not a single diaphragm-clad vampire girl in sight! Traditionally, the budget was far too tight to fully realize the director's vision. Yet it is largely compensated by its obvious love of genre theater, dedication to its craft and pure ingenuity. Jean-Claude Couty's atmospheric cinematography makes most of the outdated places and Philippe Bréjean (a / k / a "Gary Sandeur") contributes to an exciting soundtrack that doesn't look like any of the juicy things he has made for hardcore no. <Br /> <br /> In and around an office in Paris, before and after working hours, the movie was largely thrown into porn regulars. Rollin was already well known for his cash collection from Michel Gentil XXX, especially French * film director Brigitte Lahaie in the demanding role. If I play Elisabeth, one day, I can take a nearby highway through Robert (Vincent Gardère) to drive home after a long day of work. Elisabeth looks scarce with the series of events that get her there. Elisabeth lost her memories just moments after events took place, even forgot Robert's name and heroic role before their night flight at his apartment came to an end. Before she loves her, she describes herself as a virgin. (Further recognition of Brigitte's foolish skills that she can handle the line so convincingly is one of the more active adult actresses of the 70's) because she can't remember a single touch. previous side. Due to this nifty little context, the relatively long sex scene that follows follows the gratuity of other "commercial" interludes, Rollin, to be included in other works to secure funds. <br /> <br /> When Robert leaves for work, he is inevitably erased from Elisabeth's bad idea. A mysterious doctor (comedian Bernard Papineau is effectively thrown against the type) and his deceptive assistant Solange (striking porn star Rachel Mhas) pulls her into her protector's absence and brings her back to the place she seems to escape. Here we get one of the strongest scenes of the movie, as she once again becomes her roommate Catherine (the Cathérine Greiner a / k / a hardcore performer "Cathy Stewart" in a quiet devastating turn), both girls desperately provide fictitious shared "memories" for each other in the effort to outdo their inevitable fate. The weakening is not only limited to the mind becoming painful when serving lunch and Catherine cannot control her movements as they try to eat a spoonful of soup. It is also Catherine who agrees with the filmmaker's compromise with the demands of the trade because she urges Elisabeth to get her naked and hold on because sex is all they have left now, as well as the mind and physical faculties have left them. <br /> <br /> Certain, clear-cut sexual scenes are part of the movie's middle section. The French porn movies must recognize the likes of Alain Plumey, Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage, along with a bright and miss of future porn princess Marilyn Jess, whose rape at Plumey's hands, mouth and member only in the movie rarely selected XXX version FILLES TRAQUEES was present. The central part of Veronique, a girl Elisabeth, almost seems to remember and who she wants to escape again is beautifully handled by beautiful Dominique Journet - in her memorable debut - which will play a significant supporting role in Franco Zeffirelli's LA . Traviata. The six foot below the end indicates that the worsening condition is the result of a nuclear rinse, the quarantine "patients" who eventually leave a scarce breathing empty shell, uncertain in a fiery furnace. The final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of Chaplin's MODERN TIMES as Elisabeth, who is now approaching total collapse, and a wounded Robert stumbles along the railway bridge and clings to each other's vast hands.
