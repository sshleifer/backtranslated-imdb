Here we have an intelligent blend of typical hong kong movie shoots, world destructive themes and intelligent movies. Not that the writing doesn't have its big holes and some special effects are a bit cheap. But cinematography is an optical treat and the soundtrack is the first time. The blend of fast action and colorful slow, sometimes almost poetic parts, has no comparison in its kind of film, such a classification is quite difficult. The closest genre is a disaster or terrorist film with deeper human and political notes than usual. Well worth seeing in the theater worldwide. But I hope for so many other (mostly Asian) movies and no one seems to believe me. Unfortunately.
