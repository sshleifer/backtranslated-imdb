This is the story of a guy who emerged to see a comedy and it was a horror movie. The true story of a man who ended up in pictures and became frightened when he unexpectedly recognized one of them. The incredible story of a GUY that got scarce when the female hero both cheated on herself and the male villain. Gosh, is that what life made us? People who deceive themselves about the perfect face, imagine how the face should be perfect inside? "Toto, I think we're no longer in Kansas."
