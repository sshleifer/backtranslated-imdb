The rise of punk music is hardly documented on film and most people tend to focus on the events of other cities such as London or New York. Penelope Spheeris managed to preserve a snapshot of Los Angeles circa '79'81, proving that a vibrant and diverse arts / music community was emerging that competed with anyone else. For some, the ties read like a who is of now legendary American punk; Black Flag, X, Circle Jerks, Germs, Fear. Purists claim that important groups have been missed (Weirdos, Zeros, Bottle theaters) and that the film was the cause of an assault on suburban poses and macho violence. However, the issues addressed in the film remain relevant, the intensity of the music remains unmatched and the influence is still seen and heard in today's clients / fashion.
