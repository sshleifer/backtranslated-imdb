Just a good soundtrack. Really enjoyable music. Outstanding throw, good performance. Valuable look. <br /> <br /> Don't really explain what happened to the neighborhood. You feel that integration is to blame or that the environment has dissolved with the departure of the main character. <br /> <br /> This movie looks good and very well made. I especially enjoyed the little characters like Jeffrey Wright. <br /> <br /> The cut during the opening series helps to express what a lively, engaging and popular experience the nightclub would have been with the jumping music, food, drink, dance, gambling and sex.
