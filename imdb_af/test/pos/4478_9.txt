My opinions don't usually flow in most cases. I tend to lean on the art, imaginative and different. This movie is reminiscent of Frances Ford's "The Black Stallion" in which a fantasy situation is created to show the beauty of a wonderful being that is not readily available at its peak, except of course on this multitude of documentaries. Unlike the natural films, this presentation offers the best filmmaking techniques that make the industry fit for a diva that creates one of the sensational superstars (the cat) on the screen. <br /> <br /> This fantasy portrays the love affair that develops between a French soldier (he is also very nice) lost on the Egyptian desert and a female leopard meets him if he is chances on a deserted Egyptian temple, is fascinating. I bought it wholeheartedly. If you are least open to fantasy and appreciate the grace, beauty, strength and sensuality of the cat, you should enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The only mistake in my book was the end. It was a perfect set for a Romeo and Juliet final - it would have taken me over. <br /> <br />
