Babs Johnson (Divine) lives in a trailer with her son Crackers, her daughter Cotton and her mother Edie (Edie Massey). She is in competition with a couple named Connie and Raymond Marbles (Mink Stole, David Lochary) to get the dirtiest person alive. The film shows their efforts to overcome each other. <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT for everyone. It's a face in your face. Crackers have sex with a woman with a living chicken between them while his sister is watching; The Marbles pick up female hitchhikers, satisfy them, keep them chained in the basement and sell the babies to lesbian couples; Divine and family have a feast that cannibalism, etc. Include. It is disgusting but in some way not incompatible. It's so over and so unapologetic about being fascinating. As director John Waters could say, it did bad taste well. It's also nice to watch - the acting is so miserable (especially by Massey) that you only see it in disbelief. A friend laughed aloud about how bad Massey was (she later improved). <br /> <br /> It is NOT for people who are easily offended. Although it is more than 30 years old, it's still shocking. But if you have an open mind and can take on extreme behavior, it's a must see. The only part that was really too much is what God does at the end.
