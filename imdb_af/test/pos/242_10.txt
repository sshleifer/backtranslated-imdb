I really like this movie because of all the stars and the dance and the story that goes with it. Rita Hayworth was at her most glamorous in these musical and the costumes were beautiful. Although a musical, I thought Rita Hayworth also did a good performance of dramatic acting in this movie. As for her dance, I think she was excellent. Even Betty Grable endorsed Rita's dance in this role, as she commented that Rita danced to dance her own dance and let us see it, Betty Grable was an excellent dancer. The cinematography and live colors are also noticed. Rita wants to be a cover for a magazine, but she is also in love with her mentor played by Gene Kelly. Leaving her Kelly to fulfill her dream and bypassing love and Broadway galaxy, or does she stumble to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever? You'll have to watch the movie to find out!
