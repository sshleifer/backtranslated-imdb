The first music video I ever saw, Thriller, told my mom that she had taken me home and when we arrived my sister MTV had a TV and Thriller was playing. My mother said I smiled. Silly I know, but I loved Michael Jackson that day. The music video Thriller inspired me to dance, but today I memorized the dance. I even performed it 3 times for an audience! Words cannot describe the power of this song that makes you sing and dance, but of course Michael had to inform the MTV bar at the moment by signing the American Werewolf in London director John Landis and the one, the only, Thriller . <br /> <br /> Michael and his date, Ola Ray, run out of gas in a dark, wooded area. They walk in the woods, and Michael asks her if she wants to go. She accepts and he gives her a ring. However, he warns that he is not like other guys, no really like the other guys. A full moon appeared, and Michael started bumping into the pain? Turn into a terrible werewolf! His date screams and runs away, but the werewolf catches her, knocks her down and starts clutching her lungs. The scene cuts to a cinema where Michael and his date actually look at this scene unfolding in a movie called Thriller. Michael smiles, but his day is scared and tells him she's gone. Michael picks her up and says it's just a movie, but she doesn't like her jokes and she starts to run away. Michael and his date walk down a foggy street, and he bothered her with the opening style of Thriller. They pass a cemetery, where bodies suddenly start to emerge from their graves, as Vincent Price does his rap. Michael and his date are surrounded by zombies, and suddenly Michael becomes a zombie himself. Michael and the dead do an extensive song and dance number, followed by Thriller's choir. <br /> <br /> Thriller is probably the best music video of all time, funny thing is people who want to argue what's with others. Michael Jackson videos, but what makes Thriller so special is the dance, the story, the effects, it was the most expensive music video of the day. Of course, Michael has that bar with his famous music video Scream and then again with Ghosts. But say what you want, Michael was the star of the 1980s, there was no celebrity like him, he loved life, he lived it, breathed and embraced. Thriller is proof that he was willing to work to make the best and that is what we have with Thriller's legend. <br /> <br /> 10/10
