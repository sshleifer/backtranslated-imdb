Some say the tempo of this movie is a bit slow, but how does it differ from any other Hitchcock movie? They all move deliberately and, as a point, have syringes of tension and brilliant fittings injected through it. This movie gives us just the right amount of comic relief that the tension context looks, more and more exciting. The Albert Hall scene is one of the best examples of Pure Cinema that exists in Hitchcock's collection (the best is probably almost all the "back windows"). Pure Cinema for Hitchcock means a series of usually small pieces of film that are fitting to tell the story visually. This is, of course, the basic definition of the Albert Hall row, as well as the shorter staircase at the end of the picture. <br /> <br /> Not many Hitchcock slip-ups here, and the play is wonderful, especially by Doris Day, in a relatively surprisingly serious role.
