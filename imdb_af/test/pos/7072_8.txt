This movie has the courage to suggest that it would be best to just accept your life as it is, and stay smiled anyway. As one who is more excited about the idea of ​​moving his life and moving forward, I clapped my face, but it is good: I don't have to agree with a movie to love it and to do it. do not respect. Great action by Streep and Hurt, and everyone else really, and some wonderful scenes. A serious movie. And take a hanky.
