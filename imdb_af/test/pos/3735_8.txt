Being a middle-aged mother myself, I greatly appreciated seeing an adult romance that weighs in the many problems that affect us. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane depicts Adrienne beautifully and wants to do the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through for her children, but still has a happy life herself. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big Richard Gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who's kind of jerky, but learns about himself. <br /> <br /> Criticism of their Romanticism as unrealistic is barely justified compared to most other romantic movies. When Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman fall in love with Australia, barely having a conversation between them, they see high romance. We get so much more here at Rodanthe. She saved him. He releases her. It is pretty. <br /> <br /> The intimacy they create by sharing their deepest insecurity, fans in a flame of passion. How long it lasts is irrelevant. Perhaps the movie was a bit too subtle in that it was the letters they shared over the next year that deepened their relationship - yet another way to get to know one. <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoyed the plot and themes, the dialogue was not consistent in quality. Some lines sound so true, and other lines were embarrassingly trite and flat. <br /> <br /> I also enjoy the relationships with Adrienne's teenage daughter and her best friend, reminding us that there are many kinds of love, not just romantic love. <br /> <br /> It's not a sad, romantic comedy, more a romantic drama. It has a very relaxed pace that might consider too slow. <br /> <br /> The beach house is a work of art. Look out for the roof top bench on the veranda in the first pan over the house - very nice. I also enjoyed the music and landscape, which combined to create the effect of the place as the third main character. It was this place away from their regular lives that allowed them to see themselves and each other in a different light. <br /> <br /> If you're old enough to appreciate these themes and be in the mood for a good cry, come out of the Kleenex and enjoy this movie.
