Walking with Dinosaurs is an amazing documentary, educational for both the ignorance of Dinosaurs and Dinosaur Lovers (like me). I admit, I was very young when I saw it on Discovery, but I was immediately busy. (Spoliers !!!!!) The series contains 6 episodes, from the late trias, when dinosaurs first developed to the late chalk, at the end of the reign of the dinosaurs. When I first saw it, it was as if I really pulled back. The majesty of the Diplodocus, the adventures of Opthalmosaurus, and the caring mother version of T-Rex have amazed my family and me. It's an amazing movie, and I believe the BBC has managed to do just what they want to do. Awesome work!
