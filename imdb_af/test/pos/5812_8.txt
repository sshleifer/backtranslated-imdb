This was my first glance at this brief British TV horror series, but I watched some Hammer horror movies (Horror of Dracula, Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter) and thought it was high enough to give it a glimpse . br /> <br /> This first episode was a shocker - not for the horror, but for all the nudity. Was this "regular" TV in England in 1980? If so, it has far more skin than we see in North America. There were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, one scene where a man put his hand on one farm and another scene with the man a bit of a woman slaughtered. Hey, I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> The story is a simple one: A witch who disappeared in the 17th century comes back to her old home and makes life difficult for the married man. The latter, Jon Finch as "David Winter," wasn't much of an actor, but his wife wasn't bad and was a lot of beauty. She was Prunella Gee as "Mary." The man had fair suspicion of a relationship and it played a role in this story. <br /> <br /> Patricia Quinn was entertaining as the laughing witch "Lucinda Jessup," coming back with a mean line in her and having a good time to torment the couple until things go wrong. As a man I want to say it was especially fun to see the two women! It starts slowly but once Lucinda begins to stir things up, it becomes very entertaining.
