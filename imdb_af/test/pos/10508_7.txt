It would be so easy to dismiss an alien kidnapping movie before you even see it - as I did - but it's worth it. If you think about it, it's not an easy subject to handle, but this film succeeds in suspending unbelief which in itself is an achievement for such a way out. Throwing the main character as a doctor was a sensible move that acknowledged his willingness to believe in the possibility of alien abduction. Vosloo plays it very sensitively with us in his pain and confusion at the strange events that hit himself and his wife. Special effects are used sparingly, but shocking effect and sometimes the film is quite poignant, but unfortunately there are some points where the plot wanders and leaves some confusion. Also, after building a tense climax, the end is something of a deviation. The supporting characters were unnecessarily poor (the alien hunter) or threatening (the psychiatrist) who also served. <br /> <br /> But all in all, it had interesting things that were a storyline. "How do you think animals feel when we experiment on them?" <br /> <br /> The concept of "lost time" was also thoughtful.
