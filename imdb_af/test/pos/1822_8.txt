This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time and made me a lifelong Nicolas Cage fan. Back in the mid-80's I taped this movie (when the videos were impossible to do!) And watched it over and over. Nicolas Cage is just brilliant here. And, he looks great and has no influence on acting isms (see "Peggy Sue Get Married" to know what I mean by that!). I measure all his actions against this one. He was so perfectly thrown as the cool punk man with the edgy friends. The music was BIG. The Plimsouls! The psychodelic furs! Modern English! Men at work! When I hear "Melt With You", I'm taken back to the final of this movie. <br /> <br /> What ever happened to his cute costume, Deborah Foreman? And his hysterical friend, Cameron Dye? Surely another turn has taken Nicolas! Interestingly, the malicious friend (Elizabeth Daily) eventually became Tommy's voice from the Rugrats (she is charged daily with E.G for that horrible show)! Bizarre! <br /> <br /> If you want to take a good trip back to the 80s, watch this movie. It's definitely a classic. Like completely!
