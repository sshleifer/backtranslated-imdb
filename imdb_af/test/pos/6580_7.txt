The problem I have as a Finn is that most of the actors in this movie are in every Finnish movie. I have a feeling that Finland likes five actors. I think if you are not from Finland, you really like this movie as a refreshing novelty. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a terrible chain of events that make some people get pretty hard. Alcoholism, cold climate and darkness can all be clich√©s, but they are still very real in today's Finnish society. Many people in Finland have depression, especially during winter. <br /> <br /> The tone of the movie is very melancholy. I enjoyed it and Louhimes's direction was again very solid. I like this movie very much, just negative thing is that you see the same faces you have seen over and over again.
