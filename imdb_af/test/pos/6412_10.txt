This movie, one of the best I've ever seen, is talking about connectivity. It does it ourselves in a vibrant Taipei, dyed in cold colors, where the rain falls incessantly; A DAMP world. It shows us the story of two people living in this world, a man and a woman. A coincidence, or fate, connects their existence, but they cannot open one with the other with words. Characters are the mirror of the problems of our society regarding interpersonal relationships. An connectivity that is taken to the extreme. all the characters just swap a few words during the movie, dialogues are almost absent, and when some words are spoken, they are often weak and empty, far from describing people's true feelings. So, the course of the story, the revelation of character's feelings, is evolving (brilliant idea!) Through the musical deviations, just seemingly meaningless, speckling the movie. The course of the sentimental event, and the drama of female protagonist, lead us to a wonderful end, heavy symbolic. A movie that is totally different from the ordinary, a smart realization by a talented director. PS. Forgive me for my bad grammar !!
