The screenplay has credibility, backed by a wonderful direction by Jules Dassin, stunning performances of the film and great filmmaking. Jean Servais has performed excellently in the role of a criminal with principles guided by the underworld rules. The well-known long silent order of the heist is wonderful and extremely tense and certainly among the best of theater history. I call this great movie in my list of favorite movies ever. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Reef"
