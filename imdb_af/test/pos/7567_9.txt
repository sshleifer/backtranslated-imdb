First, despite the low rating on this site, I saw something worthy of this movie and would like to be defended. And no, I'm not linked to the crew in any way ... <br /> <br /> I accidentally came to the DVD of The Wind and had this strong feeling that it wouldn't be right like describes the video packaging. So I had a chance, and was pleasantly surprised by this strange, very different drama. I assume the DVD marketing and summary is the work of MTI Home Video to hook up a rent or sell (the tagline "Love comes in many forms" has changed to "Terror comes in many forms"). Sure, smaller films' rent and sales depend strongly on a person's attention, especially if they have never heard of the movie (a similar case happened to the movie THE ITEM). This is probably what works against this release, as horror fans read the description of an "ancient wind" that accompanies it, "ears of the apocalypse". It's easy to think that what this movie is about, and some college students in the story will turn into crazy wild animals going on a deadly spree. So, when the review was submitted, it's probably the reason for the lower rating on IMDb. I can understand that people get upset and think they're deceived by the summary, seeing the apocalyptic intro, but experiencing a dark drama. I can forgive the marketing choice as I enjoyed the wind and thought it was a refreshing change in the pace of great Hollywood offers. It's just that if the intended audience gets attention, a higher rating may be more appropriate. <br /> <br /> The "wind" in this movie is basically a metaphor for society, and is the story of four friends who make bad choices and how their lives change rapidly in those with desperate self-preservation. Having gone too far to teach a lesson, a death occurs and each person tries to save his own status. Manipulation between them becomes the norm, and at the end we see how self-preservation becomes their main motivation for good judgment. Civilized to cruel, basic. It is clear that the use of a knife, branches such as clubs, fists and kicking instruments of violence instead of guns. These characters in a way make all the wrong things the right reason to just stay at the top of the situation as they have gone too far. Although there are many implicit violent images, it is interesting to see that there is an absence of cussing and nudity. <br /> <br /> What works in favor of The Wind is the "unknown" actors. Bigger stars were originally meant, but I think it works better if you have lesser-known, skilled actors. In this way, you can enter the story without thinking, "Oh, it's Tom Cruise," for example, instead of a really plagued person who handles an extraordinary situation. Even unusual conversations (such as Mic and Billy in a field, and Mic, confronting Claire in her bedroom), keep well and feel very natural in the strange universe of Fairview. It has cozy houses, a forest and wide open field. I thought of the calm landscapes hiding darker mysteries in The Reflecting Skin, which director Michael Mongillo mentions in his comment. <br /> <br /> The Wind manages to retrieve messages without transmitting heavily. <br /> <br /> Certainly, if you look carefully, you'll see lots of symbols and dialogue that other directors just shoot you over. I even understood the infamous "kiss scene" between Claire, John and Billy in the context of the story without being surprised that it happened. I'm still amazed at how some people (guys, mainly) complaining about two men kissing in a scene will have no problem if the scene of two gals kisses was instead. Everybody is treated nicely here, and additional views will make things clearer without groaning and saying, "Oh man, how I missed it." Things sink slowly and I appreciate it. Or you can also listen to the DVD comment for more things to be revealed! <br /> <br /> For those of us who have the intentions of this movie, the wind is a fresh air (no pun intended) at a time when most movies are made to just make money and to be beaten to beat other movies from their box office competition that is mentioned when it is mentioned on Entertainment Tonight or CNN. <br /> <br /> Years later, it's always the big little discoveries like the wind that stays in my mind, not processed star-driven blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Stay away from the MTI Home Video marketing effort and you may just find it an interesting story. I highly recommend it to friends looking for exceptional movies like this one.
