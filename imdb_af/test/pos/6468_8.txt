A respected film by Martin Ritt, where a brave and anti-hero, John Cassevetes in NY country, escapes a tragic incident in his life, killing his brother in a car accident, as well as AWOL of the army to go. <Br /> <br /> Cassavetes, always an intense actor, shows grief in his portrayal of a movie. I'm surprised Montgomery Clift didn't get this part. <br /> <br /> Ruth White is his mother and does remarkably well in two scenes on the phone. <br /> <br /> Once in New York he befriended Sidney Poitier as the two work on the harbor. Immediately, Jack Warden, a bully and a villain in this movie, has an aversion to him and tragedy occurs when Poitier defends his friend. <br /> <br /> Ruby Dee plays Poitier's wife in this movie and is brilliant in a scene where she urges Cassavetes to reveal her husband's murderer. <br /> <br /> It's definitely an interesting movie of moral values ​​and loneliness in society. With the background of the plays, the right mood in the film is portrayed.
