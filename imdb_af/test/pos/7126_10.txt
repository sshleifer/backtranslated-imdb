I laughed so hard most of the time that I slapped people for not being able to hear about me. I literally fell from my seat at a specific point. <br /> <br /> I'm a bartender and builder for a real world life (note my use of the term Real World, unfortunately it always comes first), and when I tell someone I'm playing RPGs are usually followed by one of two questions: 1. What, like D&D? I played it in Junior High. <br /> <br /> 2. Really? I have always been looking for a group! Do you have room for someone else? Very rarely do people know what D & D and Gaming are. <br /> <br /> It is said that almost every person watching this movie can get something out of it. Even if you are not a gamer, there are chances that something in your life is what you "geek out" about which can be lightly pleasing and that means you can talk in the flash. It's just light luck in an hour and a half.
