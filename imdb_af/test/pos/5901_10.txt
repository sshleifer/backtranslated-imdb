Everyone agrees on the technical excellence of this film by Jutra (whose life ended so tragically). In terms of content, it makes a difference, of course, if you are a Quebecker, and that explains some of the divergent opinions. To me it is to sing a movie that is Vignault's "Mon pays, ce n'est pas un pays". In addition, Jean Duceppe himself was part of legendary Quebec. <br /> <br /> This film can be confronted with "CRAZY", a current Quebec edition that is successful enough to show here in Spain and is also about the 1960s. Urban Quebec (Crazy) vs Rural Quebec (Antoine). But also a film that has to be something else for foreigners and for people who know from inside Quebec.
