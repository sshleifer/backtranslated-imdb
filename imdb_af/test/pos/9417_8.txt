Sherlock Holmes movies from the classic Universal era tend to vary in quality. This range goes from very good to top average, with none of their output unnecessarily or surprisingly brilliant. Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon fit carefully into the middle ground quality, and as ever, it's a pleasant outing that fans of the series, like me, will enjoy a lot. This film sees Holmes in the middle of a Second World War plot by the evil Nazis to steal a Swiss scientist's invention, which could be a key element in the battlefield. World War 2 Sherlock Holmes films tend not to be as good as those of The Scarlet Claw where Holmes conducts private investigations, as they are usually too much propaganda or a plot that has more to do with war than the mystery . However, this one stays pretty much away from both and by focusing on Holmes and its investigation, the film works much better. Perhaps Universal saw what the earlier Voice of Terror had cast down and changed its focus. <br /> <br /> Once again, Basil Rathbone puts an excellent maverick performance as the bait detective and while Nigel Bruce is not very normal, it's nice to see him when he does. The two don't spend much time together, which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best things about Holmes movies; but it leaves more time for Holmes to show up in various disguise, which is always fun. Dennis Hoey's Lestrade is definitely my favorite of the secondary characters, and while not as funny as usual; his facial expressions are great, and his presence helps to emphasize how good Holmes is. His play with Watson in a car following paint drops on the road is my favorite moment of the movie. It is good to return Holmes's nemesis, Professor Moriarty, even if he seems to have just been thrown into hell. Lionel Atwill's performance is not as good as George Zucco's in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, because he never really convinces that he is indeed a brilliant mind; but to see him close horns with the lead actor is fun and it is nice to see him in the film to set off World War II themes, which is never as interesting as Holmes himself. The movie starts out as more of a thrill than a mysterious movie; But as soon as it goes, it's hard to put down and it's a more than solid entry into Universal's oeuvre.
