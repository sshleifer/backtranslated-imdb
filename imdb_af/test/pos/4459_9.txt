As a popular fan of Italian thrillers and directors Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado, I thought Lucio Fulci was an overstated hack. I saw The Beyond I think was completely overestimated, I found The New York Ripper was just awful and I didn't like The House at the Cemetery. These three movies left me to find out that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian filmmakers. But my stubbornness overcame and I had to watch more of his films. City of living death was a film I found very interesting, but don't torture a duck. It is very close to a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In a small village in the Italian countryside in a repressive religious community where young boys are murdered. The authorities are unclear about who is behind these crimes, especially after their first suspect was cleared. An avid young reporter, exploring with a rather erratic girl (who seduces young boys) and eventually comes down. <br /> <br /> Brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good role (not always the case with 70's Italian straps) Don't torture a duck a creaking good thriller. The plot is well constructed, not easily figured out and the end closure is very satisfactory. Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of oppression and guilt in a very unforgivable and ignorant community and creates some very strong visuals, especially in a scene where a woman is killed by some local people. Fulci's social commentary on religion and innocence is quite edgy and every aspect is handled well. Thinking of his zombie movie and his ultra-violent Giallo New York Ripper, it's amazing how well he balances his criticism with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point. So far, I haven't seen a Fulci movie made professionally like this one. <br /> <br /> While not a traditional giallo movie, Duckling has many of the genre's brands. Fulci has full control over the format, once overboard with an unconvincing gore moment, but in general it seems to be even better to make mystery than full blown gore epics. The extreme scenes here are much more powerful and take a punch. <br /> <br /> So far Do not torture a duck, Fulci's best movie is by far my opinion. Edgy social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a creaking good puzzle to start.
