Before reviewing this movie, I have to make a confession that is rather a brave statement to make as a movie reviewer. Anyone who has already read my previous reviews may know that I am always controversial in a low key sentence, giving high points for flops like "Captain America" ​​and 1985's "Creature" and such movie classics like Alistar Sim's "Carol's Christmas" and "Shakespeare in Love." With this in mind, this confession cannot come as a surprise: <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that Christopher Lambert is probably one of my favorite actors. Oh, now, don't just get started on me. Let me explain myself: I never think he's the greatest actor in the world. Clearly, I confess that he is not. He's definitely not Morgan Freeman or Anthony Hopkins, but I will say his acting ability is probably somewhere, with at least Bruce Willis. However, what I admire about him is the human traits he brings in his action heroes. He is just an average man who laughs and cries and bleeds, who is a hero because he must be, not necessarily because he wants to be. It takes a lot, in my opinion, to carry those features in a character (especially in the movies in which he worked), and Lambert's heroes are far from Schwartzennegger's or Stallone's. Frankly, Lambert's characters are easier for me to relate to. He is therefore not the greatest actor in the world. He's just a personal favorite. <br /> <br /> I can't say the same for his films. How much I attributed to his acting, it would be foolish not to admit that his choice of films gives something to be desired. Most of them are frankly saying terribly, and any mockery he received from me over the years is not due to his acting, but rather his bad choice in scripts. <br /> <br /> With that in mind, I can say that his debut film, Tarzan, is one of his best movies and probably his greatest show. As I mentioned, it is effective because of the humanity he is bringing in, and for the seriousness of the director, writers and actors. It is a huge leap of the B-movie action adventures with Johnny Weismeller from the 1940s. In fact, I would hesitate to call it an action movie. Instead, it's a serious drama that all the E.R. Burrough's material takes seriously, and shows Tarzan's quest to discover his true family in Scotland after realizing he doesn't fit in as a "white monkey." He is torn between his old family and his new one, which includes a wonderful Sir Ralph Richardson in his final role. In an attempt to adapt to people, his monkey instincts also kick in and he cannot decide what he loves more: his true family, or the one he is always known to. All in all, it's a wonderful commentary on society, and a wonderful character study. <br /> <br /> As nothing else, it launched Lambert in the international star, continuing in the 1980s with films like Highlander and "he Sicilian." Unfortunately, it didn't last. But wait for a while .... His latest career movements such as "Gideon" and "Resurrection" have proved that although he is still a long way to go, he is a competent enough actor to perhaps a ... ahem .... come back if he just picks his roles. <br /> <br /> But now the verdict on his first movie: <br /> <br /> *** from ****
