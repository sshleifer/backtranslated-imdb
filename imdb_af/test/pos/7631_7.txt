I have read some reviews of this movie recently released on DVD by Eclectic. Apparently the opening titles are letterboxed, but the rest (most) are full screen. The first issue, in 1982 by Planet Video, is completely letterboxed. Although it was a primitive release, it got the compositions right. Later editions had sharper and better picture quality, but they were full screen like the DVD. Any release of this movie should be letterboxed, as it contributes significantly to the visual experience of the old planet band.
