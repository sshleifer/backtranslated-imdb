This was my second experience of the Monkey Island series, the full seven years after I showed the first match. What was my answer? "Oh, great, we're playing a cartoon." I'm glad my brother closed and played me, because the jokes caught my attention again, as well as Armato's wonderful voice player from Guybrush - not to mention that everyone did well (I still think CMI's Elaine sounds better than EMI se). The cuts are good to make something happen, and the art of both the game and the cuts is excellent. When we got the CD with the original, Secret and LeChuck's Revenge, we were both ecstatic and spent hours working through Revenge. One of those moments was where we just sat down and blew half a day. However, CMI must be the Monkey Island game I played the most, especially for the return of sword fighting and high seas combat. At that moment when you meet Kenny and he tells you he went straight and then, "I run guns!" had my brother and I in the tears of laughter. And that's not the best part of the game, not far.
