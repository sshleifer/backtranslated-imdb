I think my husband and I are a little slow. We usually do not cook until they are almost at the end of their production. In this case, we didn't start looking at KoQs until nearly the sixth season. I'm not sure how it has escaped for our radar for so long. Unlike the fact that we're not watching big fans of "appointment" TV. We schedule such a way that we do not like to watch series every time they come (and we haven't had a DVR yet). So I think it wasn't until TBS started running on the daily arrangements for our daily arrangements. <br /> <br /> By the time we were addicted, there were only a few seasons ahead. series canceled. But we still look at TBS daily. I almost prefer this series because you can see several episodes daily and help build continuity and engage with the characters without waiting a whole week. <br /> <br /> But the episodes stand alone in since the stories are not transmitted from week to week. But it's good with me, because you can watch an episode, then miss weeks - and still get back. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that writing was not always consistent. Some episodes would be overly scary, and then some would be light-hearted. So I'm not sure it has the quality of writers that Seinfeld or Raymond had. But I loved the decisive and the characters are all reasonably credible and realistic. Kevin James is just funny to look at! So even if the plot isn't that good, James's body language and expressions make the show worth watching. Leah Remini is wonderful as the "play it straight" woman. I think it's harder to play the straight character for laughter than the comic character, and she does a good job. She has a boy on sarcasm and insults like no other. She's a hard cookie! And who can forget Arthur as Carrie's father, who lives with them in their basement. <br /> <br /> It's a huge series and I was sorry when it was canceled. But a big thank you to TBS for keeping the king alive!
