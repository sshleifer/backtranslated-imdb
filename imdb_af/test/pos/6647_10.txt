I do not remember a film that shows the emotional destruction of the war so finely, as reflected in a single marriage relationship. The focus of the film is the union between Ullman and Von Sydow - the two are in every scene. Throughout the film, they are experiencing a role of reversal - one has the strength of survival and the other is reduced by dreams to emotional escape. Both will lose some of mankind, but one to a greater extent than others. The characters and the viewer go through times of fluctuation regarding proximity. The camera goes out and away, the sound disappears, words are lost, just to return the camera to the paintings of his facial expressing stars. The confusion and fluctuation can make this movie difficult for some viewers, but it is all purposefully under Bergman's masterpiece. I think the use of a "fake" war makes the movie timeless, as relevant today as ever before, and by focusing the human relationship through the war, makes the film relevant to everyone. The couple can be anyone. The film is not based on place or time, but rather on emotion. A unique and effective war movie, unlike any other. Bergman's films are virtuoso to present human relationships - that he would bring it to a war film is masterful.
