Only this movie saw the other day at the Santa Fe movie festival. I was delighted by his honesty and humor. It was the most thought-provoking movie I've seen in many years. I just can't get it out of my mind for some reason. It may not be for everyone, because it makes you think. I don't know if people are thinking more about movies, it's a pity. The actors playing the Franklins are quite an inventor. I couldn't predict playing these intricate people with such openness. Although I thought some supporting characters weren't as good as the Franklins, I can completely forgive them - because I think it's a major movie. I didn't expect to keep it that much, but if I thought about it in a matter of days, it turned out to be a very relevant entertainment.
