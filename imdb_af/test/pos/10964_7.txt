In many ways, the cinematic career of independent filming legend John Cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like Alfred Hitchcock, the perfect studio director. Where Hitchcock dealt with his actors as cattle, Cassavetes tried to work improvisationally with them. Where every element in a Hitchcock shot is impeccably compiled, Cassavetes has less cared for the way a scene is figuratively composed than in what it felt, or what it conveyed emotionally. Hitchcock's stories were always plot-first stories, with the human element in the background. Cassavetes puts the human experience first in each of its films. If some things don't make much sense, it can be. <br /> <br /> One can even see it from his first film, 1959's Shadows, filmed with a 16mm hand camera, on a shoe string budget of about $ 40,000, in Manhattan, with Cassavetes acting acting repertory company , and touted as an improvising film. The story is pretty simple, because it follows the lives of three black brothers and sisters Manhattanites-Benny (Ben Carruthers) - a trumpeter and no account. Hugh (Hugh Hurd) - an excited singer and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) from both. The film's three arcs are about Hugh's failures as a nightclub crown, and his friendship with Rupert (Rupert Crosse); Benny's perambulations in an approximately Manhattan with his two no account holders; and Lelia's love life - first with a white son Tony (Anthony Ray), who didn't realize the light Lelia race, even after she covered her; then with sturdy and proper Davey (Davey Jones), who might be a misogynist. <br /> <br /> In the first bow nothing happens, except with dark-haired Hugh, he gets pontificate about how broken he feels to sing. in low class nightclubs, and opening programs for girly acts. He dreams of raising it in New York, or even Paris, but one can say he is the kind of man who will continue to deceive him of his meager skill, because once we hear him actually sing, he Show that he is a marginal talent, at best. That Rupert still gives him encouragement gives us an overview of how destructive friendships work. But, this is the least important of the three bows. While this movie is better than overall than Martin Scorsese's first film, a decade later, who's beating me? - Another story of failed romance and frustrated New Yorkers, it has none of the brilliant moments-acting or cinematographic - that movie has. It's not naturalistic either, because naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve, especially in film, though the Manhattan exteriors of the 1950s are a gem to revive at ground level. While Shadows may indeed be an important film in the history of the independent film track, it's definitely nowhere near a good movie. Parts are preachy, poorly acted, scenes ending willy-nilly, almost like blackout sketches, and sometimes seemingly cut off in the middle. All in all, this is a very messy job - especially the horrific jazz score, which often doesn't catch the eye of the rest of the movie. Cassavetes proved that he was a good actor as a director, at least in his first film. The only reason everyone sees shadows is because Cassavetes eventually got better with later movies, and this gives an indication of his later working style. <br /> <br /> The National Film Registry has rightly preserved the film as "culturally significant". This is all in line with the art of Cassavetes, which has long jumped, as typified by this quote: 'I've never seen an explosive helicopter. I've never seen anyone blow off someone's head. So why should I make movies about them? But I've seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way. I've seen people withdraw. I've seen people behind political ideas behind the back of the sexual revolution behind fascism sit behind hypocrisy and I've done all these things. So I can understand them. What we say is so soft. It is gentleness. We have problems, terrible problems, but our problems are human problems. "That this film is" culturally meaningful "is true, but that truth is not synonymous with the fact that it is" artistically meaningful ". This is in the difference between these two definitions where great art really flourishes.
