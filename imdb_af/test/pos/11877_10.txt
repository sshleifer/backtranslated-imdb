I'm a big fan of Larkin's works, I believe he was in the midst of the greatest 20th century poets. The film itself makes a great justice on the board of Hull. Wonderfully depicted by all the players in their roles. Bonneville is serving the sexually repressed Larkin, avoiding an impression and preventing him from becoming a caricature. The use of his poems was the highlight of the piece itself. Rather than portray the massive intensity with which Larkin feels, the use of his words gives himself a better insight into plot and adds a much more bleak but more fascinating atmosphere. Most enjoyable.
