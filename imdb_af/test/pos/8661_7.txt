This Norwegian movie starts with a man jumping over the subway and apparently commits suicide. But the next scene shows him in a lonely bus in a desert. He meets a man and is sent to a mysterious city where he starts working as an accountant in an aseptic modern office. The colleagues look nice, if they are guarded, he soon meets a girl, but the city looks quite strange, as food does not taste, alcohol does not make you drunk and there is no children anywhere. Is it a dream, or is it in paradise, or in hell? While the movies sometimes look like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone (even ninety minutes, the movie looks a bit long), it's pretty thought. The best scenes are those that exaggerate, such as when people engage in banal talks on interior decoration, and repeat to discuss deeper issues. I always thought there was something inhumane in advanced capitalist societies, in the way they tried to suppress the basic urgency of human nature. And this movie is best when it critically criticizes this lifestyle. Unfortunately, the movie ends very long, and the director doesn't seem to end it, but most of the running time is worth seeing.
