Drive was a pleasant episode with a dark end. In fact, a man and his wife in their inner ear are infected by a loud sound wave emitted by certain military equipment. Some favorite parts of me from this episode are Mulder's car dialogue and the scene where Scully goes into the Hazmat team and the old deaf lady is completely untouched by what they thought a virus was. The ending is, of course, tragic in its realism, as it leads the viewer to believe that they will actually be able to pull out this comprehensive plan to save the victim, but when Mulder arrives, he is already dead. 8/10
