This version of "The Lost Horizon" is not at all a bad movie. I think the problem is choosing people on music, especially those made in the 70's. I saw the original version of the movie in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, especially the music. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's great. Sure, there are one or two, rather stupid dance numbers, but hey, you can't win everyone. I have this movie on video and watch it so often ... and I enjoy it every time!
