I am a film director nightmare ... especially from the mega buck, plywood variety. While I am not a student of the arts, I still have a high threshold of disbelief and I buy into the filmmaker's vision, if I can find it. That's why a jewel like 'You Are Alone' is such an exciting find. The intimacy and pacing pulled me in and never let me go. Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage give thoughtful performances and director Gorman Bechard shows a handy hand that is a mentally disturbing day in the lives of two terribly damaged people. <br /> <br /> Spoiler below <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD version and shared it with several people. The reactions are varied, from disbelief in Daphne's ability to complete the mission for which Buddy paid her for an inability to see the whole movie because it was just too real and emotionally devastating. As a compulsive skeptic filmmaker, I have to be grabbed by the collar and hung for the ride or seduced by the filmmaker. This film took the later route for me and eventually I was so concerned that I felt Daphne's horror and pain in her role in Buddy's downfall. My reaction to this movie reminded me of the fact that he looked at Peter The Greenaway for many years, "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover." By the end I was fascinated and repelled and I could not tear my eyes off the film either. I've watched this movie several times and appreciate the eye and about what the director has demonstrated. I am familiar with other works he has done, including a few furious movies, Galactic Gigolo and Attack of the Killer Bimbos, and a mixed bag 'The Kiss' I recently learned is by the producer. killing the cradle and not really representing the director's vision. Too bad because I loved the previous two movies and even found 'The Kiss' interesting, but wish 'The Kiss' was available in a director's track with all the original vision and music intact. I look forward to future work by this interesting director and leaders Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage.
