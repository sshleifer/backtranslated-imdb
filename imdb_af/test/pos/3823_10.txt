Once the new Outer Limits started, the episodes were rather optimistic and challenging. As the series started to run, most of the episodes just got ugly and without any entertainment value. The six episodes reflect the very best and worst of the series here. <br /> <br /> Since the Outer Limites always preach a moral. I would like to offer my own. Start with the most entertaining of the flops. <br /> <br /> 1. Post-life: As an institution, the United Nations military-industrial complex is both angry and paranoid, and it is not that simple either. However, individuals with great integrity serve our country, and they will obey their conscience, even at a fascinating cost! Eventually, the strangers do not have to say a word. Those without a conscience are foolish who must be kept in all sorts of contempt! <br /> <br /> A true subversive episode! One to be shown to a first-rate television for everyone to watch! It may be a revelation to some, but people without a conscience should not be allowed to serve in our army! The ends also do not justify the means! <br /> <br /> 2. Relativity: A good person can be forced to make a split second between good or evil to save the lives of vulnerable intelligent creatures, and at great expense to the self. What makes the decision harder is the difficult choice: Be surprised with exotic alien strangers you can't even communicate, except through gestures, or with a group of people you think will keep you safe from unknown dangers, even if they are relentless and without compassion! <br /> <br /> This episode is brilliant! What fuel this depravity is good old fashioned greed. This episode has been raped one of the most astounding charges of capitalism, transnational corporations and the environment, which I have ever seen in my lifetime! Unlike real life, justice is served here - and fast! <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable lines is when the relentless corporate thug said: "We did the same thing in the Amazon rainforest war." Regarding the death of Amazonian Indians who tried to protect their rainforests as stripe mines, justification to literally kill again in the name of "the strongest survival". Something Darwin never meant to be taken literally! <br /> <br /> 3. Alien Store: Great power can be used well, even from an exotic alien. This force can be used to heal rather than destroy. Ant mortals can learn from their mistakes! Even a criminal can see the light if he has had enough opportunity to do so. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it takes strong medicine, but we can all wake up and change our self-destructive ways! <br /> <br /> 4. The Grell: An Alien Can Be a Christian Figure! In the distant future, slavery can be justified, again, in the name of opportunity! Basically good people can be damaged. Sometimes one has to be very experienced to see the evil he / she commits. Children are closer to the truth than adults. Those with political power have tremendous responsibility! Another work of genius! As a species, "do people learn from history?" <br /> <br /> Flop Number 1: Quality of Grace: Loose Lips, Sink Ships! In the war, keep your mouth shut over important military plans. Do I really need to watch an hour-long soap to find out? !! I wonder, did the creators of The Outer Limits go out of business, or did companies pick it? Dark and ugly, serving no purpose, but despair! <br /> <br /> Flop Number 2: Beyond The Veil: So bad there is no morale, but this: If you are locked up in a mental hospital, use some common sense, please! This episode is so bad, it's disgusting. What an X-Files rip-off! Don't waste your time on this one! You will thank me later! <br /> <br /> It is a sad comment that the Outer Limits went down to the end of its run. Subversive episodes, like the first four, cannot last forever! It was a miracle they made! Hopefully, other brave souls will one day follow the subversive Outer Limits tradition in new territory! <br /> <br /> If you are such a brave person, it's a good book to start with a unique book: "Anatomy Of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction," customized by Neil Barron! As far as I'm concerned, the most comprehensive book ever written on the subject is.
