Like most people, I'm tired of the numbers of clicks that Hollywood makes. There seems to be no creativity in Hollywood. Business listings just want to spend money on remakes. Followers built in an audience. <br /> <br /> This movie is a welcome change. It can be classified as a romantic comedy for its genre, but don't let it turn you off from this movie. It's a very original movie that's not like Hollywood. <br /> <br /> If you read it, you already know the basic plot, so I won't save it. The only movies to consider comparing are "Interstate 60" and "Art of Travel", which are little known jewels that take a different path from most Hollywood rubbish. <br /> <br /> It's good to see if you're tired of looking more of the same. <br /> <br /> Dean
