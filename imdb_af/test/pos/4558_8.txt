I saw this movie and I know absolutely nothing about it and its stars, Chris Farley and David Spade, and I have to say that this movie is a comic classic. It is sometimes so stupid that it can only be hilarious. Farley is brilliant as the clumsy idiot who is on the road with his father's right-hand man (the equally excellent Spade) to find the money to save the family's car parts. Relax, put your brain on the car pilot and enjoy the fun. A big supporting movie has movie favorites such as Brian Dennehy (Cocoon), Rob Lowe (Wayne's World) and Bo Derek ("10"). Highly recommended for a good laugh.
