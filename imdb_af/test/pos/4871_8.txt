I think I'm a kind of Road Runner fan. I don't care how predictable it is, I laugh anyway. 'Beep, Beep' is mostly predictable, although it is also inventive at the same time. Of course, the Road Runner is being chased by the Coyote and of course the Coyote avoids the Road Runner with every new attempt. The plans the Coyote comes up with are very funny. You see exactly where it goes wrong and you won't be disappointed. Well, once you're disappointed, but what you think is going to happen, but it makes the joke even harder. <br /> <br /> If you like the Road Runner shorts, you will love this one. The predictable gags work and the animation is sometimes big and pretty original.
