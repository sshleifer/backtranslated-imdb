The best years of our lives are often compared to This is a wonderful life. They should never be. Their only communion is the desire to make a serious comment on a war that has taken millions of lives. It is difficult to know the value of individual life. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? What statistics should we live on?) Our feelings about war also changed in 60 years. We have gradually moved to think that the war is only when the enemy is the right one to believe that there is no war at all, especially those who have been fighting recently. <br /> <br /> I was a lifelong pacifist. I fight all the war. Not long ago I tested that position. It happened while I was on the USS Lexington, anchored permanently in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship needs a crew 3 or 4 times the community in which I live. It is a powerful experience, moving on its decks. She saw a lot of action. Someone gave me the right to be a pacifier and it was not bought cheaply. <br /> <br /> Not everyone can look the best years of our lives without thinking of things like the Lexington. <br /> <br /> Each of the three veterans paid their contributions. And they also paid me. <br /> <br /> None of them walked easier than anyone else. The fleet, air force and army paid equally, though in different ways. Everyone had problems directly related to the war. And everyone had to work very hard to overcome those problems. It had more courage to face their civilian environment than it did to deal with war because everyone had to do it on their own. Everyone can understand and sympathize with the problem of the other: in the end nobody can help. <br /> <br /> The moving part of the movie (that could be the beginning of the spoiler) is what follows as one of the male leaders found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry the girl. Don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. It is hard for Harold to believe that someone could love him when he was a soccer hero and athletic star before the war. But after his judgment, Harold listens. <br /> <br /> The other is when Al says Derry stays away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Maintain your relationship with your wife? standard trade show for 30's / 40's. Derry did not discuss the point: he felt he was not suitable for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the movie comes out if we think the girl feels the same about Derry. True emotions of real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor. I think sometimes we believe these values ​​do not exist. That is perhaps why people watching this movie have problems. <br /> <br /> Though not free from advice he doesn't really want. Any time his boss talks to him, Al is bound in knots. And rightly so. There are a few things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation: they must be judged by great general intangibles and only someone who is tested by the seriousness of life will understand what those intangible assets are. <br /> <br /> All this leads to a scene near the end where all the aircraft that fought so bravely, stripped, stacked, stored, discarded and soon recovered: their function, value and pride as transparent as Derry self. He can overcome the transparency he does, and make him fit, in his mind, for the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> I've been giving the best years of our lives a 10 and there are few movies that I feel about. It's not a popcorn movie. It deserves our attention. We are very fortunate to fall upon something as private as the lives of these wonderful people. We must be careful not to abuse that privilege.
