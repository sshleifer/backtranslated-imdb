Jimmy Wang Yu, an authentic Asian superstar, directed this film and wrote what I just saw in a baptized videotape version. The widescreen (Shaw Scope!) Form is lost and the original actor's voices are absent, but it's still good to watch. The story is the usual martial arts school fighting villains from Japan plot with our young hero in the end to win out by collecting all sorts of battles. <br /> <br /> The battle is better than the movie unraveled. Early in the film it looks stiff and dull, but later there is a big scene where Wang Yu fights hordes in a gambling joint, and then runs into a snow scene and takes on more villains with knives, swords and fists . The part is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Very good then, but it would be interesting to see a non-baptized widescreen version if there is one.
