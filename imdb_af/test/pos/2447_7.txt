This movie was well done. It covers the problems a returning Vietnamese veteran has in dealing with the horrors of war. Unfortunately, the authors chose to focus on a Fat that was involved in an act of cruelty. I was in Vietnam and only once heard of such an act by one who saw it. The offender was prosecuted and sentenced to many years in Leavenworth. <br /> <br /> The idea that only veterinarians involved in atrocities had emotional problems is a disorder to all who served. All the soldiers I personally knew or knew from mouth to mouth were honorable soldiers who even respected the enemy and believed they were there to stop the spread of communism. The biggest problem was coming home to learn that many Americans were opposed to the war. This caused many veterans to feel that they participated in something less than honorable. Not the way they served. <br /> <br /> The end portrayed the father as acting more than a warlike bully as a loving, loving father. For that I gave it a 7 out of 10. If the end was allowed for some acceptance, I could have valued it a 9. <br /> <br /> Most decent men will come to war with guilt and emotional scars. They need acceptance and understanding to overcome it. I pray that the public will have more understanding for our modern-day veterans than in the Vietnam era.
