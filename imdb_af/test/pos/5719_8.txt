I have never seen John Leguizamo's stand before I watched Freak. And when I saw it again on HBO comedy, it was better, more entertaining and with things I couldn't understand for 14 years. Spike Lee has done a wonderful job, keeping the visual angle in comparison to Leguizamo's theatrical and personal storytelling style; It's dust and style together, but unobtrusive. We get Leguizamo's rants about race and sex (the bits about sex are classic), but many are about family, and what sticks are still fresh in my mind about his dad. Even when things get dark in some of the stories, there is something fresh or crazy or random that Leguizamo pulls out to get a laugh, and it works more often than not. If something goes flat (for me anyway), it might be his personality techniques here and there. But overall, it's the kind of fun stuff that's not bare, but is so true to itself that it stings. Find it if you can!
