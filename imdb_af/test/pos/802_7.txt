The movie was very good. I'm a zealous mystery fan and I usually find out who is going to be killed and who did the murder. While I found out who was going to be killed, I didn't find out who did it. I was not happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character, but given the year the movie was supposed to take place, the woman might have been "cloying". Please be aware that while these Poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamics for them because the series isn't Japp, Mrs. Lemon and especially Hastings didn't! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I saw every actor playing him. The worst was Peter Ustinov!
