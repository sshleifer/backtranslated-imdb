We really liked this movie. It didn't try to be shameful, controversial, smart or deep. It was just entertaining and was, as it was said on the box, a beautiful romantic comedy. Every other Brit movie maker wants to change the world, to see one who just focuses on telling a good yarn with elegant style.
