Although this film does not stand out from the movie crowd, it's still a great movie to sit down and watch your feet! There may be the strange one or two bugs you catch, and the movie is a bit of a shoddy, the movie itself is very enjoyable and has a wonderful atmosphere. The music contributes greatly to the sphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> The play is quite impressive (especially the dog he is!) with John Travolta leading the fun-loving Michael. Other characters feel very sincere and play well within the movie. <br /> <br /> After a long day at work, hold a 'Michael' dinner in the evening with some ice cream and enjoy a very good movie in its own right :)
