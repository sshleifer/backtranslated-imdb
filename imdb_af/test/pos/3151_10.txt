But none of the other shorts has taken all the elements of the great movie material into one movie like the Reader. The reader brought the attention of each festival goer into the room and for 10 minutes we took the emotional lives of the characters. <br /> <br /> Duncan Rogers has created a beautiful movie and I hope to see more of this. director, it is more shorts or perhaps a distinctive film.
