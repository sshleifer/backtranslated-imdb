In spite of his pedigree, the most interesting things about this series are not the animatronics or puppet shows, which, while charming, are little more than side-views, at least in the story I saw, A STORY SHORT. In fact, it's the greatest pleasure of the program, but it's the most ancient art, narrative. John Hurt, in Rowley Birken QC mode, grotesque, medieval makeup, relates to a story about storytelling, set by the fire, accompanied by a cynical dog. On a winter day, hungry and poor, he mocks a fellow beggar who is thrown out of the Royal Kitchen by the nasty cook. The Story Teller tricks these latter to give them an excellent soup. Strange, the Cook pleads with the King to give permission to cook the villain, but with the storyteller's white, the monarch offers him a delay. For 100 nights he has to tell the king a new story: if he doesn't, he will surrender to the cook. <br /> <br /> The story can be old, but it is told with great gusto. Anthony Minghella's screenplay is extremely dramatic (like a playwright), spectacular, and with some disturbing worries of fun, such as fear of self, or the culturally self-generating narrative, linked to the continuation of ideological power. For a program aimed at children, it is incredibly self-reflective (with little nonsense about film the new oral culture); In spite of the Americanized style, there is a wonderful feeling of medieval hustle and bustle, its great quarters and arbitrary terror, as well as its magic and power.
