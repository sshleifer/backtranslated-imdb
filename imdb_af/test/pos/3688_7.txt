I'm a big Rupert Everett fan. I adore Kathy Bates so when I see it available, I decided to check it out. The synopsis didn't tell you much. In parts it was silly, touching and in others some parts were right hysterical. <br /> <br /> Any person who is a big fan of a personality will find some small identifying features with the main character. (Of course there are many that they won't do, but that's the point) <br /> <br /> If you like any of the actors, give it a watch, but don't look for something too dramatic, it's fun. <br /> <br /> I can also mention that you can see how thick Rupert is. I mean I knew he was 6'4 ", but he looks even more like this movie. He even looked like he had some of the other characters in it. He's long! I mean long! for you Rupert fans there is a bare chest scene ... great!
