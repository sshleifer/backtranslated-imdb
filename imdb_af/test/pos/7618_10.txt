It's a really hilarious movie and one I've seen many times. Drew Barrymore is brilliant like Josie Geller, like David Arquette as her brother. You are terrified by the thought that she is returning to high school, as the film is a reminder of how high school really was! Her outfits are funny and strange, and they bring back memories of those who dressed a little differently! The beautiful Michael Vartan was spectacular as the teacher (wish there were such teachers when I was in high school!) And Josie's boss is fantastic. This is a movie you can see again with a fantastic soundtrack! One for everybody at school in the 90's to watch!
