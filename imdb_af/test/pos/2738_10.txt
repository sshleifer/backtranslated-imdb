During the short Golden Age of the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Home Movies, we purchased a $ 148.00 GAF projector, near a Downtown Chicago camera store. It appears that GAF comes from the Camera and Projector business; Although they will continue with their other businesses, such as former Sawyer's Vue-Master 3 Dimensional Color Slide viewers. <br /> <br /> Little did we know or expect the fast approach of the Camcorder, the Betamax, the VHS and the ultimate DVD revolution. With the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Camera we also bought, we took some sound movie records as our daughter, Jenn's first Holy Communion and her younger sister, Michelle's preschool graduation. It was all around 1979-82. <br /> <br /> During this time we also bought some Pappa Toys to go with it; like some Super 8 Magnetic Sound LAUREL & HARDY Movies and W.C. FIELDS 'Shorts by Blackhawk Films, Davenport, Iowa. We also picked up a Columbia Pictures Home Movies soundtrack of some sort of forgotten Classic Cartoon, UPA's GERALD McBOING BOING (United States of America / Columbia, 1951). It was the hit of our Home Movies Time! <br /> <br /> As a member of the Baby Boomer Generation, the wife (Deanna) and meself have reminded the character of Gerald McBoing-Boing; Gerald has a network TV show at CBS, early Sunday evenings, approx. 1955. Bill Goodwin was the presenter / host. But we never saw this original UPA Theatrical Cartoon; We also did not know that young master McBoing-Boing was a creation of dr. Seuss of "Grinch", "Horton" and "Mulberry Street" fame. <br /> <br /> The staff gathered was very talented. and deep. The outstanding production values ​​are clear. Director Robert Cannon and supervisor director John Hubley were veterans at the top of their vessel. Authors were Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss, Himself), Phil Eastman and Bill Scott. <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott is not so much remembered to write his contributions to UPA, but to be partners with Jay Ward in such Television features as ROCKY & BULLWINKLE, MR. Lovers, Frustrated Kites, George of the Jungle, Obedience and Frustrated Kites. With the Jay Ward Productions he was a writer, voter and Kibitzer general of the entire company. <br /> <br /> The cartoon receives its only "voice" from the narrator, Radio / Film / TV actor Marvin Miller. Remember him? He was Michael Anthony on TV Ssries THE MILLIONAIRE (Don Fedderson Productions / CBS Television Network, 1955-60). <br /> <br /> Fat color schematic and imaginative design has gone into giving the UPA animations a special sense of loneliness, fear of fear and ultimate victory. And we can add, the animation is definitely the "Limited" Variety. <br /> <br /> As with so many good stories, we start with a simple starting point. One is born differently. In this case, it is young boy Gerald McCloy, who was born to make sound effects in communication rather than talking. Children can be cruel and soon he will be confronted by a group of youthful tickers with his not so flattering nickname: "New, new, your name is not McCloy, it's Gerald McBoing-Boing, the Noise Making Boy!" At this point, the animation team is doing an excellent job shifting the emotional gears in the young publishers from happy and carefree to isolated and lonely and ultimately to depression and despair not to turn anyone into help and understanding. not even for his mother and father. <br /> <br /> A frighteningly dark scene involving a highly UPA styled off-road with a train and an equally stylized snowfall brings Gerald right on the edge of absolute despair. But then he is interrupted by a gentleman announcing that young Gerald is required by the radio program maker to provide the sound for the show at the studio. <br /> <br /> THE premiere performance is done with Gerald. starring in the sound department, he drove off into a huge limousine (which predicted the Stretch Limos of our day) to the spectacle and admiration of his classmates and the world. <br /> <br /> It is said that there are just as many stands and in this case this story is probably a variation on The Ugly Duckling; because almost a sad and solitary boy finds his place in the world and true happiness. <br /> <br /> NOTE: United Productions of America, or UPA for short, was an excellent center of creativity in the field of the Animated Cartoon. Not only were they responsible for GERALD McBOING-BOING and several persecutors and a TV series, but also the highly popular MR. MAGOO Theatrical Cartoons and the subsequent TV Show (with Jim Backus voice talent), the Classic Original TV Cartoon by FROSTY THE SNOWMAN and the bitter DICK TRACY Cartoon Show (with Tracy's voice made by Everett Sloane!).
