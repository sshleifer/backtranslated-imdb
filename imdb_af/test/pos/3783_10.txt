I described Woody Allen's Manhattan as perfect for someone the other day, and she thought it was a strange way to describe a movie ... <br /> <br /> I just saw a handful of movies what I would call perfect. Manhattan is one, McCabe & Ms. Miller by Robert Altman is another and Once upon a Time in the West by Sergio Leone is another movie I think reaches perfection. There are a few others, but apart from the fact that I find no mistakes in the three I mentioned, I also have to admit that all three directors are getting tastes. <br /> <br /> If there's one movie I could stand behind the house and testify to the house that anyone I'd show it would find faultless, it's Shoulder Arms. <br /> <br /> City Lights, The Great Dictator, The Gold Rush and even the Pawnshop are 10's, but not only did Chaplin do everything right in this movie, everything he did was hilarious and hit a level further than explanation.
