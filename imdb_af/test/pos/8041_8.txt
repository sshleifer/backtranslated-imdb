The Stunts rows (as well as the special effects) are Brilliant, in this movie. Michael Scherer must be one of Canada's BEST Stunt Coordinators of all time. The blast in the cafe is a wonderful combination of stunts, special effects and visual effects. The director had an idea that the Crew managed to create on film. <br /> <br /> Except that; Donald Sutherland makes one of his best performances in this movie .......
