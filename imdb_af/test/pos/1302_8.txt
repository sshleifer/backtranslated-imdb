It is nice to see a romantic comedy that does not lead the spicy man. It is solid of both male and female heads and although the story is a bit long and a little clichÃ© you can't help. br /> <br /> I think the story was a bit rushed to the end, but the expansion would have made the story even longer. Better to other romantic comedies like 100 days with Mr. arrogant, and possibly tied to my tutor friend. <br /> <br /> It would make an interesting introduction to Korean cinema, not as good as My sassy girl, but still good.
