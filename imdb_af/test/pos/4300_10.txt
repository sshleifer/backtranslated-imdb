It's a beautiful movie. Calm and sublime moves. It feels like a very gripping, intelligent play (but without the excessive theatrical feeling one actually gets to watch people on a stage), playing on everyone's horror of a white lie, rising to striking consequences. All the main players are fascinating. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart in the end ... and everyone else judges the amount of stumbling blocks for men and women. Julian Fellowes swore again. He is a national treasure. Gosford Park, Vanity Fair, Mary Poppins ... and now this. Can't he do it wrong? Go and see it! It's a real adult movie.
