One of the last films DIRECTED by Lionel Barrymore, "Ten Cents a Dance", Barbara Stanwyck dies as the dance house girl "Barbara" in her sixth role. Stanwyck looks very "plain-jane" in this one, and opens with her to be cheated by the dance hall manager. Then comes the rich man Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez) who wants to wipe her off her feet. (Cortez and Stanwyck made three films in the 1930s.) Then she meets Eddie, who is very different from the Carlton. The author, Jo Swerling, worked on a couple of biggies (It's a wonderful life, guys and dolls, and gone with the wind), so I was surprised that the characters and the writing were so ordinary. The story starts more than halfway, and is very similar to "The Bride Walks Out" of 1936, also with Stanwyck. T.B.W.O. is very clever but also builder because of the hays code ...
