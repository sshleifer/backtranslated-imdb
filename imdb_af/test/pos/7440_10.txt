hey i think this movie was great and it had good graphics and i was very happy to use the final fantasy. 7 I think the game was the best I ever played. It's a good movie and I love it. They need to make another one, but maybe they should eat using final fantasy 7 weather or final fantasy 10 there both pretty awesome of: Tyler Sheena I hope you can email me back if you have any details if there is one more. people for anyone else read it I suggest you see this movie it is animated, but it looks pretty realistic and it has wonderful fighting scenes. I haven't seen it long to fight quickly in a movie. The spell-like fantasy 7 is also very good, not good graphics, but it's really fun and challenging
