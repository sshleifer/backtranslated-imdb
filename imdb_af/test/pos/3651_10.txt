Sit back and let director Bharatbala lead us to a visual and sensual journey of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say you're enjoying a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us moving towards directions that only occur in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie will make sure you want to visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase and the mafioso involved. But it has much more. Thank you, Bharatbala, for such an enthusiastic and wonderful story. I loved the end. Our women do not want to have illusions in life, we want reality. P.S. I was Carolyn's friend at the Sonoma Film Festival and met you briefly. Good luck with your distribution efforts and I'm talking the movie a storm.
