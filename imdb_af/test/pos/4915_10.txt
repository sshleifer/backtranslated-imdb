When it appeared at the Seattle Int'l Film Fest, I was the only person standing and complaining and cheering. The rest of the crowd was sighing or quiet. It's a well-played little film that comes deep into the reality of a young gay man's humanity. It's about a real man; and does not play the indifferent, hyper-secure, muscular "gay paositive" that plays Gay Gay cinema genre. That's why so many of today's Gay genre movies are so boring. This movie is Intense Passion and Great Tragedy. The acting and directing and cinematography are fantastic; All this keeps the movie scary and tense and passionate. Don't miss it if you can get it.
