OK. Who ever invented this movie hates humanity and wants to see them all slit their throat. This "movie" was absolute and total filth. What was the pain with the strange old bags of eyes? Seriously, was she on a kind of terrible drug and then she just thought she could control people? She ran around with her freaking evil eye and it was like that? Do I have a boiler hanging out of my nose? What are you staring at? Are you like the sea witch or something? All in all, I thought the graphics were top old hood. For that alone I would give it a ten. But just cover your ears when you see them. The pure and complete evil that comes out of the movie will bleed your ears and fall off your eyelids. Who knows? You can even get a knot in your small intestine. You look better at fools.
