Why did I choose 10/10 for this movie that is just down *? Very simple, because if you just find yourself, find it funny, you can just laugh until you choke. Some people may find that it goes too far, it is certainly not for everyone, but when I am down and just need something that is really stupid to laugh, Chuck on Bottom or GHP, and I can forget all my problems and transported in a magical dark and strange world. <br /> <br /> * "totally out of guts" is an Australian expression, it has no literal translation.
