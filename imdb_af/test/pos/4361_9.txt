I had the opportunity to see this last night at a local film festival. Herzog introduced the film and then conducted an Q&A for an hour. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant finished "documentary"; Herzog later explained that he did not consider his films to be true documentary, as facts sometimes camouflage the truth. Instead, he wrote a few scenes and ad-libs to suggest a new element that could be missed if he followed the original storyline. <br /> <br /> Unlike Timothy Treadwell, Little Dieter is a real person you fall in love with; You feel good about him, you feel the anxiety he feels. You admire the sense of humor and joy for life he exhibited for 30 years after being captured by the Viet Cong in exile. You are disappointed to hear what Dieter did not pass too long ago. <br /> <br /> As with most Herzog films, the imagery is breathtakingly beautiful with a great choice of background music. Especially a campaign taken from the archives of the Vietnam War, but the story of Dieter. <br /> <br /> The essence of the movie was Dieter returning to the clear jungle where he was a POW and he again set out his journey with some locals. To see how we look, I can't imagine what he felt when he was bound again. <br /> <br /> One of the better films to portray and discuss the nightmare of the Vietnam War. It should serve as a lesson for all of us.
