There is something that one of the characters (the obsolete movie director pretends to be dead) says what the whole movie can sum up: "In Italy it is death that governs". What! It's a country without a future, in the hands of old and old men. And Bellocchio's cryptic portrait of the country, turns on the seemingly senseless story of a director who has to film marriage parties to earn a living, much to say about what doesn't work here. But foreigners may miss the point because it is not clearly expressed. I understand that Australian or Canadian people who see it get bored and wonder if there is a meaning. Well, there's a meaning, but it's just clear to people who live here today, and keep their eyes wide open like Bellocchio. It's certainly not one of his best films, and it's not as powerful as Buongiorno, but it's worth seeing ... for Italians living in Italy.
