My favorite movie this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing were smooth, visually beautiful and interesting. <br /> <br /> In Barcelona, ​​the film follows a year in the life of six foreign graduate students and other people. Cultures and languages ​​clash, but hearts and lives vary. The lead would never be thrown into Hollywood, but he did the part perfectly. The characters were well developed and their interaction was honest and accurate. There were two notable scenes, the climax really inspired. The movie is sentimental, and the last ten minutes could have been cut, but it was wonderfully entertaining. <br /> <br /> I almost didn't watch it, but just saw Audrey Tautou. Her role, though second or third, was underage, and was challenged by several other characters. I wish more movies like this were made. This kept the Big Chill or The Breakfast Club in mind. Don't let this movie start if you plan to go 1½path.
