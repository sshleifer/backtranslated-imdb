It's a great old-fashioned Christmas favorite, which I try to catch on TV every year, if I can. It's about a Martha Stewart like the journalist Elizabeth Lane, portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck. However, unlike Martha, this woman is a fool with no household skills whatsoever. The other role players effectively complete the story and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan) and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley). <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food items. , depicting herself as a happy married country house maker with children. In fact, she is a single woman living in a flat in New York and can't cook an egg. Her recipes are borrowed from her Hungarian chef friend, Felix. Elizabeth disappears with her deception until the publisher of her magazine, Alexander Yardley, decides he wants a nice old-fashioned country Christmas, and invites him to visit her, with a return hero, Jefferson Jones, a sailor who " had a shipwreck. . Yardley demands total honesty from his employees. To get out of her trouble and save her misleading career, Elizabeth borrows the Connecticut mansion from her longtime architect representative, John Sloan, a dull, discerning guy who has been looking for long ago. She also lends a neighbor's baby (actually, several) to give Sloan's as her own and her "husband". <br /> <br /> Of course, this scenario means a lot of enjoyment. It is a screw-ball comedy and a beautiful romance, with the added appeal of a Christmas atmosphere. When I think of this movie, I see the snowflakes falling, the tree is beautifully decorated, the fire roaring in the hearth, the turkey roast, and Christmas cookies. Why did Hollywood force a remake? I understand there is a 1992 version, led by Arnold Schwarzenegger and lead roles Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson, and Tony Curtis. I didn't see this modern adaptation, and I didn't want to. This old favorite is perfect just as it is and a holiday with It's a wonderful life, white Christmas, wondering on the 34th street and of course all the versions of a Christmas Carol.
