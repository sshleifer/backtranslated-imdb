I totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me who founded the film. After reading the book, I was impressed, although it is a kind of literature you can't really like (like Hubert Selby's writing), I expected to be shocked, but the effect was more subtle than that . Isabelle Hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi-faceted character. There are many scenes that focus entirely on her and her subtle changes and I can imagine little actors who will do so well, with so much contempt for their own reputation or image. There is this cold, distance, cruelty and at the same time there is this helplessness, pain and pain. There is a person controlling and controlling at the same time. Perhaps it is not realistic - although when you read the newspaper, you read much worse than that - but there is a truth that is very difficult to bear. I think it's a great movie, but I didn't enjoy it. It's not boring, but there are times when I wanted it to end. VAT, her male counterpart is also well behaved (and I think well chosen too).
