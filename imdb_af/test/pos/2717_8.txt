Our family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was handled well by the director, with good performances by Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances of the other role. The climax was well built but for the end that was far from the fact that it was good. We are still understanding what the Director was trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or were the end of understanding common film lovers? A better end would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewing vessel. However, it shouldn't take credit that is due to Konkana and Shabana Azmi, because it's so good with the characters!
