I'm 13 years old and I'm writing this review in my mother's sign. She will later write her own review. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite movie of my time. It was filmed in England in 1944. I watched it so many times when I was small that I carried the videotape. I love this movie and it has changed my life! The beautiful landscapes. The mighty, bold-printed, thoroughbred horse. The simple Irish village with the young girl who wanted to do what no other girl ever did compete in The Grand National Steeplechase in London with her most beloved horse, The Pirate. It made me all drive to ride horses (which I have done for 7 years now) and everything I could learn about their races, I could also draw and paint. It's a groundbreaking movie to win over every chance, to overcome your fears, to believe in yourself and to achieve tough goals by working very hard. Also, the horse racing was one of the best ever made and I have seen many movies with horse racing. I never get tired of watching this movie. Everything about it is perfect. Especially if you are a young girl and passionate about horses!
