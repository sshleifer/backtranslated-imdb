I only saw this movie in 1994 or '95 during my first year in high school when it was at Lifetime. After I first saw it, I thought it was wonderful. Certainly, it may not be longer, but it is as accurate as it may seem to me (no matter what anyone else might think). Cynthia Gibb was wonderful to portray Karen, and Mitchell Anderson was okay as Richard. Louise Fletcher (yes, who played in 1975's "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest") was also good, but I found her version of Agnes (Karen and Richard's mother) to be a bit of a control freak. I am an extraordinary fan of the carpenter, and I believe Karen's voice was and still is so wonderful. It makes me very sorry about the fact that she's gone and left the earth soon, but thanks to the never-ending popularity of her music and her angelic voice, the music will continue. Anyway, back on the right path to this movie, it might be a mystery to me and probably other people (fans and non-fans of the Carpenters) that caused Karen to get this problem with her health. Was it the media that was responsible or was it just Karen's decision? I wouldn't believe it was her decision. It could have been the media of an article that was published on her somewhere in 1970, when their hit "Close to You" came out (of what was shown in the movie). There are also other moments in the movie. Richard's battle with drugs, and Karen's short marriage. I didn't hear of her loss in February 1983, as I hadn't watched the news yet; I noticed years later. I don't know if there will be another movie about the Carpenters or Karen in the future, but until then this movie will go well. I would say: If Karen did not mention the fake details of that article or any future articles published with similar content, called her "chubby" (which had to be quite an insult), she would still have be here. earth today. I know she is in heaven and probably entertain everyone with her beautiful voice. God bless you, Karen !!
