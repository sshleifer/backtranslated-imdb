Last year was the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species". So it is fitting that Jon Amiel's "Creation" was released. The film focuses on Darwin's (Paul Bettany's) life as he writes his famous work and the light tension it puts on his family life. <br /> <br /> I suspect that the movie has survived Darwin's tension with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly) and his guilt over his late daughter Annie, but I still love the idea of ​​Darwin's theory that works like a karateh on religious dogma. As it was, the US was one of the last countries in which "Creation" found a distributor due to the creation-evolution debate (yes, it's still going on). <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not a masterpiece, but I recommend it the same way I recommend it to the wind. I hope one day the creation-evolution debate will not be a problem. If this movie helps to rest the debate, get more power for everyone in the movie! Also with Martha West, Jeremy Northam, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch.
