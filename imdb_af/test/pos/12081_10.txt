I watched this movie when it was broadcast on television in February 1983. I was in hospital and had just given birth to my first and only child. I will remember to tell the extent to which I was moved. That's enough to say that the memory of the movie stayed with me for almost 23 years. I hope I can get a copy of this movie, if something like that ever was made. This movie must be remembered by everyone who has ever seen it. However, I must admit that the fact that it remains a bit unclear is just good for me. In this way, it will always be a little secret to me and those who have moved there. I never saw me. Margaret plays a better role. I never saw her in a more convincing role. I will respect her forever just because I have accepted such a beautiful part.
