It is one of those movies that has never been published and was missed when it was originally played in theaters. <br /> <br /> I got it over the TV channels and was immediately in the story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I wanted to see the movie again, but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental shops. <br /> <br /> James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first class. While it is an action movie and has a western setting and theme, it can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of their taste in movies.
