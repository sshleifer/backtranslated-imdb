King of Queens is comic genius. Kevin James, who plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan, is extremely funny, Leah Remini playing Doug's wife. Carrie is incredibly hot (# 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 women's list), and very funny. The true magic of the show. But the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, who lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold cellar. I must admit I have never seen this show until 2006. When I had tossed it out before, it was never funny, but with the cancellation of friends, stationary and yes, I needed some new comedies. To give the King of Queens a chance, I discovered that it was absolutely fantastic. So funny that I downloaded the first 7 seasons and watched 8-hour blocks every season. I strongly urge anyone who has not seen this treasure to check it out. You won't be disappointed.
