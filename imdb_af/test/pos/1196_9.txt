I watched it because my friend said we could try it when my dad asked if we would see it. I didn't want to, because it was such an old movie, how could it be good? I finally looked at that friend and dad. my friend and I loved the movie. The songs are great, the actors were cool and we loved it. I think these shows, even if it's from dad's time that doesn't mean it's not a good movie. I didn't buy the movie for so long after I saw it on TV, I placed it a lot and sang it with the songs. I even looked at my classmates at my birthday party. It's a nice, good and sometimes funny movie. <br /> <br /> If you don't try, you can't say it's bad. even if you think no, I'm not going to see a movie of dad's time. try the first part of the movie, you can always stop watching if you don't like it. I really recommend it, it's great !!
