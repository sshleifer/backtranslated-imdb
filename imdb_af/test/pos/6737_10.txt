I love this movie. The movie was all great in portraying their different characters. Judith Ivey portrayed so well that a weak, terrible, dependent, passively aggressive in her complaint and self-involvement, was a relief to see the character's metamorphosis. Blythe Danner was equally attractive in her role as a somewhat judgmental Jewish mother, devoted wife and loving sister. Jonathon Silmerman, Bob Dishy, ​​Stacey Glick and Lisa Walz did their roles equally well. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies related to challenging times, without losing your sense of humor and hope, you'll love it. Movie.
