Apart from the fact that the women in the film are beautifully beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too thick, this film is true to the chaos of the post-war. <br /> <br /> Beautiful photography, and a powerful national expression of the Polish national character. <br /> <br /> It's very slow on points, but the whole pacing is so different from American and Western European films that it's pretty refreshing. <br /> <br /> Both major players do a very good job. On the DVD version, you will see interviews with the main actors and the crew, and main actress Stanislawa Celinska has gained around Â£ 50 and lost all her beauty. But in 1970 she was a stunner.
