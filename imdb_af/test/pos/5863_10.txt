This movie is probably one of the most creative works of horror ever. It has everything you want ... stress, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, indigenous Americans, brain eat ... If you're looking for the best, endlessly all brain-watching movies, look no further. The story of a man, bent on revenge. And the better to get it? "I know, I will bulge their brains!" With great sound effects and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie.
