An injured Tonto alone stands to protect three innocent lives. A devious woman who killed a deadly plot. Racial tension. Slim Indians. <br /> <br /> It's never seldom seen in the TV series, but this movie puts them all together. Although it is definitely a Lone Ranger movie, it just mixes the formula just enough for those who got tired of the series to still enjoy it. Definitely recommended for any fan.
