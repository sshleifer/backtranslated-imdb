I never saw a movie like this; didn't plan to see it, but it was worth the turn of the TV channel. I'm mostly a scifi movie watcher, but I'll be more than happy to add this one to my collection. It starts out as a one-sided movie with a simple love triangle, and then becomes something else (can't tell, but it involves two guys and one girl. That's not what you'd expect). This movie also played Hugo Weaving of the "MATRIX" and "THE LORD OF THE RINGS" in a role I would not have expected ... very funny man. This movie plays on HERE TV, but if you don't have satellite, it's worth a rental. So give it a try; You won't be disappointed.
