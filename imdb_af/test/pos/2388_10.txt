I watched the movie for the second time on September 30, 2006 and thought it was even better than the first time I saw it. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, especially "Uncle Benny". I thought Fred Carpenter did an excellent job of writing and directing this movie. The story line definitely kept your interest and I hope this movie makes it all the way to the top. I felt it moved very smoothly between screens and the surprise turn at the end, though, can only say I didn't see it. I also thought Craig, the actor who played Eddie Monroe, did an excellent job and I hope this movie will help him move further into his scene. From start to finish I really enjoyed it.
