See the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids. A little predictable. The book was better, had more plot details, ore over the environment and how the children had uncovered the conspiracy. I think Hiassen's crazy humor comes better in the book than the movie, but there were also very funny moments in the movie. This is probably a little too slow for children under 6 years of age. Love the farewell of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher. And those baby owls were treasure-rich. I wonder how they managed to film them. The movie showed a lot of Florida at its best, it made it very attractive. Imagine it, or did the writer Carl Hiassen make a short look?
