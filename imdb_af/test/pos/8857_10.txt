The fool says, "You can't touch this" surely applies here. With all the clones horror and sci-fi movies come with all the inferior remakes, it's hard to find something worth 2 hours of your time. That's why I always trust the classics that challenged the weave from me when I was a pre-teenager. <br /> <br /> The THING is without a doubt in my mind the prettiest, worst, scantest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter or any other director (sorry, even Mr Spielberg) ever made. However, what really gives it is not the gore (it speaks of slender and blood and God knows what other liquids), but rather the sense of fear, isolation and distrust promotes it in the characters and the viewer. <Br /> <br /> No more remote than Antarctica, and in this cry, the freezing white environment is where the story takes place. Several Americans, researchers and military men are stationed there. One day, they testify to a Siberian Husky dog ​​running for the dear life of gunwire Norwe. Before they know it, the American outpost fights a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature. It can dip into obscene, cunning bloody forms before it's done, but once it's done, if you don't see it, you can't tell it to humans or other ordinary Earth animals. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just some of the finest casts. This movie is why horror can be a great genre. It really scares me. The alien blood jumping out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches it, still turns ME on! <br /> <br /> Still the most frightening of them all.
