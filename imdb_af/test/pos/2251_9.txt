Excellence looks scarce in Hollwood today. Many consider only two of the year's best photo nominees to give meaning to the film industry. And in 'Everything is lightened', the mark is hit directly. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with its glow with the beautiful setting of the scene. From the beginning you get a sense of warmth and true family relationships and relationships between one and the other. And also, the cast is perfectly set up. For Elijah Wood's character, Jonathon, his sensitivity is expressed by the hand of his dying grandmother. And for the character titled Alex, it's easy to see his life in his perspective - the true Ukrainian rock star. With the enlightened initial, the story slowly eases in our minds, as Jonathon decides to risk Ukraine to meet the woman who believed to save his grandfather, the whole family. And from there, the story goes slow, but it is quickly held against the contrast of tears-dripping drama, and the exuberant humor is included in scene-by-scene, every scene. <br /> <br /> Although the movie itself is rather awards, there are several complaints from other sources commenting on Liev Schrieber's inaccurate adaptation of the Jonathon Safron Foer novel. Personally, I have never read the novel. But any movie, especially this film in particular, should not be graded or the storyboard of the movie matched to the storyline of the book, but rather how the main concepts of the novel are expressed and exploited by the film. Just because it can be expelled from the novel does not mean that this film is no longer a must-see. It's still. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film, the public's thoughts are flooded very slowly. Some of these thoughts are never answered; And in the second half of the movie, the whole subject and the reason for traveling through Ukraine focus on something else, but rather similar to the original intent of this movie. However, the film leaves you on a happy note - but for the faint-hearted souls a tear can drop. And throughout the film. to the healthy people with the sense of humor may only play from Alex and John's fun and ongoing conversations. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to a variety of people: to those who enjoy movies that share the drama comedy, to those interested in family connections, and to those interested in Holocaust subjects. And for the foolish people who find slapstick as hilarious comedy, this movie is not for you. And for you who think it's a seriously funny and absolutely funny funny movie, you're wrong. This movie shares comic moments and dramatic sequences. And for those who rate a movie based on their likelihood with the corresponding novel, you may or may not enjoy this movie, but this movie has to be taken much more than if it's near the book. <br /> Everything is everything "Relieve" is an ingenious piece of work that will ease one's heart.
