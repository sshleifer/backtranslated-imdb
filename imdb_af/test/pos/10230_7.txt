I enjoyed this movie. The way these mutants looked, along with the tone of the movie, is very good. Plus, David Cronenberg as Philip K. Decker was wonderful! It makes me wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life (except the murder of course). <br /> <br /> I was impressed with the creatures for this movie, although this movie probably had a bit of a low budget, the mutants / creatures / monsters look good, especially from 1990. This is definitely a unique movie and not crap. It will let me go, read the novella on which it is based. It's an interesting movie because it shows how people can be monsters and the "monsters" are the one with humanity.
