I loved this movie. It was a good portrayal of a family that had it up and down, but eventually they knew that special love had them together. I saw a lot of movies with Jaclyn Smith, but my god was one of her best, even though it came out 12 years ago. This movie played an all-cast role, and what I loved most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors I haven't seen before. This movie has been a long time, but I enjoyed it every minute. It's a movie that you can sit and watch with your family, although we will have to cover the children's eyes a few times because of the discretionary love stories. Overall, I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale. Lifetime doesn't make it enough, so if anyone knows what the store sells, let me know because it's a must-have.
