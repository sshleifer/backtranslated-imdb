As the amazing Prime Suspect series reaches four, there is no momentum loss at all, it is a great achievement in itself. "Prime Suspect IV: The Lost Child" has the solid support role we take for granted in these British dramas, but of course the beautiful Helen Mirren dominates easily; our eyes never leave her while on the screen. <br /> <br /> The quest for the lost child of the title leads the superintendent Jane Tennison's CID team to a first suspect who is apparently a convicted pedophile now with a single mother and her two young daughters. In the minds of his mind, one of the emotional highlights of this mini-series is that it can be too much for many stomachs. <br /> <br /> The action series are handled brilliantly with the hand A camera keeps us right in the middle of excitement and there is exciting excitement during the climb. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's another beautiful police drama.
