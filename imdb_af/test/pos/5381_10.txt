"Brotherhood of Satan" is one of the most underrated horror films of all time. Why not, is a cult status outside of me. This is a different story of terror and witchcraft which horror horror one of the most powerful and disturbing climaxes in the annals. In the small American town some children disappeared and their parents were murdered violently. What is the cause of hysteria? The movie is really ominous, some scenes are really unpleasant and certainly not easy to forget. The tension never makes up, the acting is really good, and the climax is bizarre and disturbing. Look out of this forgotten gem of satanic horror. Absolutely recommended.
