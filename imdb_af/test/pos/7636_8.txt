It is true that this is not a realistic story, but romantic comedy is not a genre I look at in realism. What matters is that the characters are active and, if necessary, sexy. Shalom is beautiful and relaxed, and Jake Weber is sincere. They have enough chemistry to make the story credible in the area that counts, sexual attraction. I'd like to see one of them in another movie. And yes, the clown is also cute.
