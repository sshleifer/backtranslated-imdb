I loved this movie !!! It was so easy to be a part of the characters and really lived the emotion they had. <br /> <br /> A movie full of laughter, sarcasm, shocks and just a fantastic romantic drama! /> <br /> The only part I didn't enjoy was in the special features. The back of the screen comment was a bit off putting. Having seen the movie before the extras, I prefer to think of the actors as the characters (silly I know), but the actors' personality is very different from the characters they play. But is it a fantastic, spectacular, brilliant movie I recommend to anyone watching this movie and thinking hmmmmmmm should I buy it? answer must be a definite yes!
