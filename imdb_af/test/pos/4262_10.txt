Definitely one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, smart, happy ... it's hard to articulate about something good. There isn't one character you don't like to watch right away. Myronex "Putney, there are problems in the black room!" "My name is Rufus." The left and right lines are classic ones, reminiscent of Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialogue is not the formal set-up punch line. "Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!" "My organization is pro-integration ..." "Where is Lopez?" He's in my head "" They don't sound brilliant until you hear them in the context of the scene. ... This movie will eat your brain, it's too good. I read reviews that call this film racist, which could not be further from the truth. Every scene is gold, from the Etherial Cereal commercial to the Brothers In the Black Room encounter with that hasty trumpet in the final stage. A word - genius.
