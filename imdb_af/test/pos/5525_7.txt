The title does not refer to a dubious poker hand, but to six comic players. They come in two: Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland as a couple going to California for a second honeymoon, George Burns and Gracie Allen, as another couple going to share expenses, and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth as sheriff and a hotel owner in a small Nevada town. No attempt is made to form a coherent narrative. It's a collection of comic bits that are put together. All that the first couple wants to do is time together, but Burns and Allen's characters are not married, so the men stack together, just like the women. There is a plot: a bad man planting $ 50k in the suitcase Pinky (Ruggles) takes out of town, but because the expedition is led by Gracie, the booty cannot be found. The bad man appears in Nevada and Fields accidentally catches him. A lot of nice bits, Ruggles' confused expression, Gracie's struggle, break talk and Fields playing billiards with a corkscrew. He does a fluttering, craving, reverse-step double-take when threatened, and his wonderful distinctive way of survival. words. And trying to remember the name "Gracie", he tells Skipworth, "Hmm. Start with a K ... McGonigle." She replies, "Oh no, no, no, no ..." "Mmmm. Wangahanky!" "No, no, no, no no. Oh, Gracie." "Yes, that's right."
