I didn't expect much from this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be the most significant. This is especially known for the talent and appeal of his star, John Garfield. <br /> <br /> Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star. He has to get going, and ends in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is a chance for salvation, but will the past still get hold of him? Garfield was an actor in front of his peers. Before the term "Method" was even created and before Brando ever "Stella!" Shouted. He brings 'of course' to the screen. His earthly quality and wonderful acting talent dominate this production. Also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of the 'Golden Boy' role he wanted so desperately to desire on the screen. Garfield looks at the kind and goes the distance as a boxer, proving his acting dignity. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Ann Sheridan is a small role as Jack's tragic girl Goldie. I never thought of Sheridan much, but I kept her here. She plays well from Garfield. Dickson's performance is a bit tired and she doesn't share good chemistry with Garfield. The Dead End Kids are here, and Garfield looks like their natural idol (even more than Cagney). Claude Rains is overlooked, and he seems uncomfortable in many places. Strange, as he was always such a trusted actor. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is the director Busby Berkeley, best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images, leading another genre here with remarkably relieved. He maintains a tranquil atmosphere really wonderful. <br /> <br /> A very good movie that deserves more attention 8/10.
