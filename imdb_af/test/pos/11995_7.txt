Seriously. If it were the first Shack movie, it would have been funny, stupid and goofy. Light satire comments on the class system will make it a pleasant late night rental. <br /> <br /> But everyone wants to compare it to the first movie, and maybe it's not fair. The first film is a cult classic; what can it possibly follow? Nothing. So take this second movie as a single, and it certainly has its moments. Jackie Mason is amusing and does his best Rodney wannabe impersonation. Is he as good as Rodney? No. Are their lines so good? No. But he's funny. The rest of the cast falls into line as well, but not outstanding. You will recognize faces under the film and wonder how they have reached themselves where they are today. <br /> <br /> The movie is predictable but isn't the most in this genre? Again, this is not the best comedy you will see, but if you like Cannonball Run-type fun, you will enjoy this one.
