Radio was a very good movie, and honestly, I never cry in movies. But it had me very close to tears. It really got me when Radio's mother died and he just didn't want to get out of his room. I felt very sad about how, if you mentally disabled, you wouldn't really understand death. I really loved the movie and it is a must see.
