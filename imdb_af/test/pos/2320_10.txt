Look, we rated it a 10 on entertainment value. It's a comedy sure, not an epic like Lord of the Rings, or Gone with the Wind. Still for comedy, especially those days, it's a 10. <br /> <br /> Not a long movie, move fast and easy. Kelsey Grammar at home is this role as a loose but brilliant captain of a diesel sub, exploding against the US nuclear fleet in a war game, designed to see if terrorists can get a nuclear bomb through means of our defense. (Ironically this plot ... before 911) Don't take this subject seriously, as it usually laughs from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is 2nd in command (like "Frank Burns") and laughs a lot. All the others are also perfect for their parts. Rip Torn and Bruce Dern. <br /> <br /> Look simple and simple, you have 90 minutes and need a laugh or pick me up and you're not a prude (they're a language and innuendo), then rent it, or buy it (we have) and enjoy! I wish they would make part 2!
