Anthony Quinn is a master of capturing our heart and sympathy. He portrays a Romanian farmer with an below average IQ, plagued by his wife to do more. This is World War II and the Nazis took over their country. Soon he finds himself digging what he hopes to benefit himself in his wife's eyes. The Nazis have different ideas. The following year we look at events that unfold through his naive eyes, but all he wants to do is go home. His manipulations and accidents only get him into further hot water. Eventually we see his picture on the cover of Der Spiegel as the perfect Aryan. The war ended and the allies executed him for war crimes. But all our farmers want to do is back to his wife.
