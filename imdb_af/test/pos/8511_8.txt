Although Never Say Never Again (NSNA) has a poor soundtrack, it's much better than the competition at that time, "Octopussy." Never say again is an updated and improved version of Thunderball (Connery's least popular band). NSNA is rich in smart dialogue, white, smarts, sex appeal, and one of the best and most compelling bad guys in the entire Bond series. In addition, NSNA has a very talented young and beautiful Kim Basinger. British comedians will also recognize the actor (Attwood), known as "Mr. Bean". I won't trade any of the Moore photos for this one. However, the previous Connery / Bond efforts (with the exception of "Thunderball") are better. <br /> <br />
