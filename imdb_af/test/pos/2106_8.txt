I recently reminded you of these early days, and should encourage you to steal or borrow. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a duel between a righteous Shaolin priest and our villain Abbot White, unnecessarily saying, Abbot White kicks Buddhist ass and lastly his campaign against Shaolin, unhindered with the help of his new ninja allies (a gold-clad one who fights with a gold ring, a black javelin dressed, and my favorite: one who fights with a pair of knives that can disappear and reappear as a pilot mat). The rest of the story is about training the disciples of the Shaolin monks murdered by Abbot White, one of whom is Alexander Lo Rei. While we are being treated for the criminal offenses, the two young avengers are going to learn the Shaolin Finger Jab technique needed to defeat Abbot White's invincible weapon technique. We see some of the ways our villain stays in shape ... mostly using Taoist magic To extract the blood of naked ladies. We all know how it will end, but it's the psychedelic journey between what we are here. Finally, this is a good example of what Taiwan did when Hong Kong fell ill from martial arts films, making it increasingly outrageous martial arts films. This movie is very well choreographed, has a little nudity, a few gore and enough balls on the wall to ensure even the most calved viewer is entertained.
