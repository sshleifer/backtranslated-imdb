I'm a big horror fan and I really enjoyed this remake. With all these horror remakes floating over I think this is one of the better efforts. <br /> <br /> I watched it with my two little sisters and I think it made it even better because they were pretty scared. Also with the scream on the screen "Don't do it!", "Not so!" I thought there were some good, quirky moments and it built the strain box. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle is absolutely stunning in the lead and a very good actress - so she keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> Generally a decent movie.
