It is one that you can look over and over again and laugh every time. We went to a Keaton festival here after buying some of his films. In this one, Buster is wrong for an escaped killer and there are many chasing scenes and maltonels, but also what is best about Buster - his creativity. The opening scene is really funny and it just keeps going from there.
