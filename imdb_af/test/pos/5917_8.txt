This is a very successful example of a biopic 1950s. It has the sturdy and attractive young hero - well, not so young on the screen; wonderful, if unlikely, direction of Billy Wilder; a fully orchestrated musical score of upliftment scales and, if necessary, heavenly strings by Franz Waxman; strong support players; a poignant story; beautiful photography by Hitchcock favorite Robert Burks; and a story about a single historical event. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Jimmy Stewart as Charles Lindbergh trying to sleep in a Long Island hotel before his epic solo flight across the Atlantic, from New York to Paris. And he can't sleep. <br /> <br /> The flight itself is filled with flashbacks to Lindbergh's personal history and the purchase and construction of its unique high-wing monoplan, The Spirit of St Louis. St. Louis, Missouri, is home to the flight sponsored partnership. (Even in 1927 money spoke.) Anyway, the movie, HAD had several flashes and Stewart's narrative. What's the alternative. Observing the units? Thirty-three hours to watch Jimmy Stewart as he sits quietly at the control of his noisy plane while the days and nights come and go? I found the writing and the direction impressive for their time. Of course, unpleasant things are left out, not to introduce ambiguity beyond what today's audience can manage. <br /> <br /> My commitment is that the crying crowd that surrounds Lindbergh at Le Bourget has broken the plane for souvenirs. And of course nothing about the pilot's relief tube, though it would have more opportunities for humor. Some of today's viewers may find some incidents if they think too much about them. Aloft, Stewart talks with a friendly trekking fly that wakes up in his own tranquil way by landing at his critical moment. Later, the St. Christopher's medal that Father Hussman received from taps against one of the instruments, just as Stewart was desperately trying to land. Atheist Stewart is saved twice - once by plane and once by God. <br /> <br /> But don't mind. It's an impressive movie. This country at Le Bourget, with an exhausted Stewart behind the reins, confused by searchlights, sweaty of fear and collapse of fatigue, is really convincing. "I'm going to go up this plane," he tells himself and we can believe him. <br /> <br /> A light plane doesn't fly like driving a car. There is no smooth winding highway to tell you where to go, no roads to guide. You're busy every second. You have to look at the instruments, look at each wing tip to see that they are touching the horizon, the plane's nose, and constantly looking up, down and sideways for others, although the latter would not be a problem for Lindbergh. He was alone over the sea. <br /> <br /> Why? In one of the movie's trendy moments, Stewart and Murray Hamilton, two 1920's gypsy abrasives, lie near their planes in a Midwestern field. "What is it? What makes us love to fly so much?", Asked Hamilton. (No answer.) Later his financial supporters try to talk him out of flight. Five other pilots have already died to try it. "But don't you understand? It must be done," says a passionate Stewart. <br /> <br /> Well, that's not much of an answer either. Why should this be done, and why by Lindbergh? Why not wait for ten years to stop wasting lives in the meantime? The answer, dear Socrates, lies partly in our glands. Pilots are a quiet and confident, sometimes alternating one. Their main problem can be an addiction to an internal rush of adrenaline. I'm just kidding. Some of my best friends are pilots. Still, Lindbergh must have been quite a guy. He deserved to be treated as a hero. Not only because of the flight itself, but because of its later attitude - quiet, modest, a family member. We can easily forget his admiration for Hitler, as he has been more successful in testing Corsair fighters in the Pacific and advising the fleet on how to adapt the aircraft and getting the best performance from them. <br /> <br /> See it if you have the chance. If nothing else, it's a history lesson that is told with visual glory.
