If you haven't heard from this movie, follow two Sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in Africa to America, convincing themselves that they will find success and wealth. Life is more difficult than is expected in the states, and this film takes the frustration you feel good when things don't go right. The lives are so well caught, many moments seem written because they are so perfect. Whether at work, at school or in between, the two boys, Peter and Santino, are very honest with the filmmakers, and make some very remarkable comments on life in the states. This is one of the only documentary documents I can remember. When I ended it, I wanted to keep another two hours. It can be hard to find this movie because it didn't get good distribution, but look at your local art house or independent theater and give this one a turn (lace note, if you read it if it's already video worth a rent). Rating: 28/40
