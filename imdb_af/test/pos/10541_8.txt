I know what you say, "Oh man, Pinochio is not scary!" but this movie goes beyond a maniacal pinochio. Behind it tells the story of a mother and her daughter who are strangely linked to her doll, Pinnochio, talking to her. The only strange thing is that no one else can hear the doll except her. In the end, shocking revelation that, like me, will shock you. Beware. Give it a try.
