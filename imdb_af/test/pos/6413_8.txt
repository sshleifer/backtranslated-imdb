It's less visceral than the only other Tsai movie I've seen ("Vive L'amour"), but the idea of ​​doors (holes) in other people's emotions and existence is portrayed here clearly, as Tsai long shot after long shot essay. , usually with a long time, suggesting a sense of alienation in Taipei. The musical interludes, inspired by Grace Chang, are confusing but welcome mile markers that add new dimensions to the slow-growing relationship between the young man and the woman below. It's not necessarily an easy movie to watch (although it's not overbearing), so I'll warn any casual viewers looking for indie entertainment (like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie). But if you want to know something about isolation among city dwellers in Taiwan, and something more universal about the alienation and romantic desire of the city, then look at this film right away.
