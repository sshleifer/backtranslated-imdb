I'm sure the movie contains some gaps in logic, but I was so enthusiastic about not really caring. The film plays like a fun, light teenage skirt combined with a Schwarzenegger-type action movie. It is full of action, full of excitement and also has humorous moments. Sean Astin is nice to watch, and I haven't seen Louis Gossett, Jr. since I saw "Diggstown" in theaters. He is a fine, underrated actor and I like to watch him on the screen. I just wonder what he's doing now. Unfortunately, in many of these direct-to-video movie he may be leading roles. Hopefully my assumption is wrong. Anyway, it's a fun, prosperous thriller and I definitely suggest it before you go out. <br /> <br /> My Score: 7 (out of 10)
