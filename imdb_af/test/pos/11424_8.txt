Stan Laurel, it was noted, first made a real name for himself by appearing in short parodies of popular feature films in the 1920s. He proves himself as an excellent comic actor and exporter here in "Mud and Sand" (a parody of Rudolph Valntino's Blood and Sand), but I really don't think a movie like this is because Laurel was a great satirist , but because it allows the audience to come into the comedy already familiar with the situation and scenes. Laurel can then detach with his inspired gags without creating or without context. I watched it the day after looking at "Blood and Sand" itself; It certainly improved the experience to know what was parodied and true. <br /> <br /> The scene where Laurel's character (Rhubarb Vaseline if you believe the title cards, or Rhubarb Vaselino if you believe his name on the chalkboard) makes his mother out of money with a two-for-you, two-for-my-trick is funny on its own because it's a great gift, but it's extra funny if the viewer is aware of how it takes out the sky. of Valentino's excessive and melodramatic promises to give his mother any luxuries she desires. <br /> <br /> This is the best Stan Laurel solo work I've seen. It's just funny - even more when you get the source material.
