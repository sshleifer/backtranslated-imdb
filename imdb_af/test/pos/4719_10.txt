"Beyond Rangoon" is simply wonderful. From the traumatic opening to the lifting end, you'll be amazed at how well this movie is composed. Patricia Arquette marvelously depicts Laura Bowman, who meets us as a conclusion and stops despondent young doctor, unable to handle her sadness about the loss of her husband and son. During the film, as she was trapped in Burma, the Democratic surprise and massacre witnessed in the Yangon capital, fleeing for her life, and saving her life's life (Your Aung Ko) life, she regained her will . It can be seen, or it is heavily handed over. It's not. John Boorman, a master of spiritual and emotional conflict, paints the movie with broad strokes, often using symbolism to capture Laura's emotional state and physical trouble. Patricia Arquette, as usual, gives a wonderful convincing and credible performance to the emotionally wounded Laura. What Arquette miraculously, in any role she plays, gives us a window in her character's heart without words. Every time she gets a close-up in the movie, the audience is given insight into her character. She doesn't have to speak to convey emotions or be over the top. Some critics were hard on Arquette's performance in the film when it was opened on August 25, 1995, and thought she was "flat" or "dull" in the role. I shot her characterization, and stay away from the melodrama that is typically part of an actor's performance when a personal tragedy occurs. She is shocked and reassured by her feelings: it is just as normal as shouting at those around you. I hope Warner Brothers will release this title soon on the DVD. With Arquette's highly successful NBC drama "Medium" bringing her to the household name status, not to mention an Emmy victory and now 2007 nomination, it will be in the studio's best interest. Hopefully there will be extras, with the alternative end. Don't pass this movie. This is one that you will certainly not forget after you have seen.
