I can't say this movie deserves a ten because I will lie. I loved this movie when I saw it! It carries the unique bond of a friendship between a teenager and a dolphin. Although not the sweetness Jesse and Willy had in Free Willy, it offers an exciting movie that the whole family will enjoy! If you love marine animals, or just love a perfect family movie, this movie is right for you! Flipper certainly shows us how lovely dolphins are, and they are playful and can easily be pets if everyone has a large enough pool! I love whales and dolphins, so of course this movie works for me. I think the producers chose another shark instead of the hammerhead to improve the antagonistic part of the story. Maybe a big white one? FLIPPER IS MAGNIFICENT! So check this out!
