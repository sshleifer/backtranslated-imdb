Dr Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and Jo McKenna (Doris Day) travel to Morocco for a holiday where they meet a mysterious man named Louis Bernard (Daniel GÃ©lin) on a bus. The next day, this man is killed, but before he dies He tells Ben a secret; An assassination will take place in London. The villains kidnap the couple's son Hank (Christopher Olsen) to make sure Ben doesn't announce their plan to anyone. Freddie Hitchcock's man who knew too much (1956) is a very intense thriller. is great as it always is in Hitchcok's movies. James Stewart is wonderful. Doris Day is a beautiful man and actress and she also gets her singing talent. The song Que Sera, Sera plays an important role in the movie. This movie is a movie of many classic scenes. In the final scenes at the Albert Hall, without dialogue, you can barely blink your eyes. This movie is now fifty years old. Time has not diminished its power in any way.
