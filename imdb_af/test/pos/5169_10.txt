This movie is my family's favorite Christmas movie because it is a beautiful picture of what Christmas really is. These days I live in a big city I hate, I like watching movies about the life I always dreamed of. The town where this movie is set is my dream come true for the life I have always wanted, and the true sense of community that has been lost in today's society. I no longer feel the true spirit of Christmas, but looking at this movie helps to find that feeling again. My family started this movie long ago from TV and now our copy is exhausted. So I would like some copies on DVD for my family and I buy if anyone can tell me where I can buy copies, please just write the information here and I will look. Thank you.
