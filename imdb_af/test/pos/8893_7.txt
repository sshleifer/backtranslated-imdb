Billy Crystal is Larry, a writer who has not written and is suspected of murder in "Gooi Momma of the Train," costumes Danny Devito and Anne Ramsey. The phrase "black comedy" was invented for this insanity, which began on Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train." In fact, Owen (Devito) gets the idea that Larry has murdered his mother in exchange for Owen who looks at Larry's former president of the famous movie. "I saw the movie. Criss-cross," said Owen to Larry. Not that Larry knows what he's talking about, until it looks too late - just like "strangers." Larry, a writing teacher, claims that his ex-wife, played by Kate Mulgrew, stole his book and put her name on it. She became a great celebrity, which appeared on "Oprah", where she referred to Larry as "an animal". Owen is in Larry's class. He lives with an abusive Neanderthal mother (Ramsey) and has visions to poison her and put a pair of scissors in her head - you call it. It's not long after he saw 'strangers on a train' that he is in Honolulu, and stomping Larry's wife. As she leaned over a timetable, trying to get an earring, Owen stood behind her and crept ... The police were soon looking for Larry to question him, but he was at Owen where he was encouraged to End of a He had no idea what he did. You know, "cross-cross." There are several scenes copied from "strangers," which are hilarious. I especially loved Larry's confession with Mrs. Lift, Owen's mother, similar to when Guy thinks he's talking to Bruno's stepfather. <br /> <br /> Crystal and DeVito are complete masters of comic dialogue and timing and will make you laugh, often out loud. Ramsey is repulsively funny - a completely "out-of-the-way" performance. Kim Griest and Rob Reiner also have roles - Griest is Crystal's girlfriend, and Reiner has what a camel is. <br /> <br /> The end is very clever and the whole movie will make you laugh.
