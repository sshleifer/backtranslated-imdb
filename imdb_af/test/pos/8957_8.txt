I bought this 99pk movie for me and it has been in my video book for at least a year. When I decided to see it tonight, the movie was very different from what I expected and I didn't find any humor in it. All I saw was that it was a dark view of people who had love affairs and sexual orientation and I didn't. I really see a point about psycho-murderer, except to end the movie. add. I felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a good job. I followed her emotions and what happened to her. Some people would probably have seen the things she was doing so funny, but I really could sit in her place, love someone, but they'll reject you every turn, no matter how hard you try. I thought it was a very moving movie and did well with all the different sexualities. I expected something like Bound & Gagged: a love story, but it's a completely different movie. Not for bigots.
