A few times ago we read about the results of a poll published by some newspaper writers. The questions asked were only two, and were short and straight to the point. <br /> <br /> Question 1 asked the respondent to tell who his most beloved college soccer team was. Question number 2 asked the fan to name his most hated college soccer team. The answer to both questions was simple, Notre Dame! ND is tops on both lists! Yes, love or hate them, but you certainly don't ignore it. The roots of this unique position of this Outstanding * College Football Powerhouse are in the life and career of one, big, small Immigrant Norweigen boy from Chicago, Knute Rockne. <br /> <br /> As a biopic product, the production of KNUTE ROCKNE, ALL-American (1940), relatively close to the death of Coach Rockne in a 1930 aircraft crash. It was about 10 years since the movie released. That would mean preliminary work on the project about 8 years after our nation's great loss of Mr. Rockne started. <br /> <br /> His parable and voice were known from Newspapers, Radio and Motion Picture News Rules. Both Knute's widow, Bonnie Skiles Rockne, and Notre Dame University have permission rights in choosing the actor to play the lead and overcome the writing. We think they couldn't do the job better. Pat O'Brien really sees the part and was himself a soccer player in college. Ronald Reagan was cast in the key role of George Gipp **, a generous student going to Notre Dame at a Baseball scholarship! He was a walk-on soccer player. <br /> <br /> The film is full of talented players. We have Griffith Veteran, Donald Crisp as Vr. Callaghan, C.S.C., Notre Dame President. Albert Basserman is Fr. Newland, the Chemistry Prof and Rockne mentor. Gail Page appears as the Mrs. Bonnie Skiles Rockne. Owen Davis, Jr. is Rockne Cohort, Gus Dorais (The Match in the Historic ND vs ARMY Game at West Point.) <br /> <br /> The film is rounded off by Kane Richmond, Nick Lukats, William Marshall and William Byrne as the Four Horsemen. . Real Time Big Time College Coaches Howard Jones, 'Pop' Warner, Bill Spaulding and Amos Alonzo Stagg appear in scenes of Congressional Probe in College Sports and add an authentic touch. <br /> <br /> As for biopsy, KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-American !, everyone can only say it runs the ground, and has not slowed down from start to finish. There is also no wasted time. All screen time is used to move the story together. <br /> <br /> The use of the Notre Dame choir, the campus itself and all the Brass Band rahrah music markets everyone the feeling of being there. <br /> <br /> * Although Today's Basketball team and other sports teams compete in the East-East Conference, Notre Dame remains an independent NCAA Football. What this means is that the Fighting Irish actually plays a national schedule. <br /> <br /> ** There was no agreement with the George Gipp family. There was a lawsuit a few years ago about the scene that young Mr. Gipp depicts what the famous "Win Onr For The Gipper Speech" gives. Television prints of this ROCKNE ALL AMEICAN were minus the speech in the deathbed. <br /> <br /> *** Other Notre Dame theme films have been made over the years. The Spirit of Notre Dame (Universal 1931) suggested J. Farrell McDonald as a Rockne watch coach. It also has Lew Ayers, Andy Devine Nat Pendleton, as well as members of the real Notre Dame Championship teams with the right Four Riders. Then of course we have RUDY (Driester 1993) including Sean Astin, Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty and Charles Dutton. There was also talk of an unauthorized film criticizing Notre Dame called GOLDEN GLORY, but nothing happened. (Let me know, Dear Reader, THANX !!) <br /> <br /> **** Warner Brothers always had good music in them, both in opening themes and in casual music. In this Rockne Movie, they recorded the NOTRE DAME FIGHT SONG in the score. In addition, STEP NOTRE DAME and THE NOTRE DAME ALMA MATER, who performed at the Rockne Funeral in the Notre Dame Basilica in 1930.
