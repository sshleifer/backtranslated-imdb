Well, how can I categorize Farscape without using accidental superlatives? Okay, go here! The scripts are fantastic, with every episode offering so much entertainment, drama, humor and mere visibility. The casting is perfect, especially that of Zhaan (the blue lady) played by Virginia. Each character has a depth that is just not there on the Star Trek series. <br /> <br /> I think I have an Australian spin. the show makes it for me, Australia has for many years excelled quality movies and Farscape is no exception. <br /> <br /> I first saw the first four episodes in the UK order and they have a quality every 45 The exhibition that really means me is "I, ET" that converts the foreign concept where Moya ( a slideshow in the UK looks more than a movie as a weekly TV show. <br /> A living ship, even the spacecraft has a great character, has been forced to land on a planet that still has to make First Contact and is surprisingly nice and Crichton meets a radio telescope operator and * he * is the 'little green man' to them. In short, the effects are good, the scripts are of the best quality and the main characters (none of them are really more important than any other) are interesting, not always "good" and good just excellent. <br /> <br /> Role on the second season!
