OK. Is Barney the best children's show of all time? Of course not. But in some of the comments left by other IMDb members, you'd think it was a multi-million dollar production with high-class actors and a ridiculous budget for special effects. Well guess what? This is Barney for God's sake. He shows children good behavior, good men and that it is good to be who you are. For those of you who find themselves annoying, it's because you're not five years old and the show wasn't for you. To the IMDb member who wrote the review on the first page, I think you may have gone too far. Did you actually describe a Sesame street character as "down to earth"? Grow everyone, it's a good pre-school performance and help kids learn in a fun and creative way.
