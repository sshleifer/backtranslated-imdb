First, let it be known that in this movie I didn't come for the music; actually I find it disgusting. Really, I was interested in the psychology of the punk subculture. At this point the documentary did pretty well. One unpleasant aspect was the numerous scenes in which songs are played, and the hip-band and war-torn crowd are displayed. If you saw the first such scene, you saw them all. This superfluity is a party made by printing lyrics for some of the songs. This allows the audience to pair with the tape. The lyrics are much more important than the sound of sounds protruding from the speakers. I don't know why all the lyrics were not printed. Scenes without lyrics slow (ironically and ?, given the many references to the speed of the music) the flow of the movie. Also informative were the interviews with fans and groups, although there is a dilapidation when the latter group's interviews are not nearly as surprising or humorous as the first two. Overall, a good movie I was happy to see, I saw. I'll check the successes if I ever get a chance. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote: He tried to hide the fact that he couldn't play by rubbing peanut butter over himself and breaking glass. <br /> <br /> Broad punk generalization: Although their shame, lack of vocabulary and hygiene, and drug-induced unconsciousness are often hilarious, it is ultimately understood that punches are just pathetic youths just for the sake of rebellion as seen by sophomorical lyrics and naive attempts to philosophize and politicize. (Ignore black flag, which is slightly less misleading than their peers).
