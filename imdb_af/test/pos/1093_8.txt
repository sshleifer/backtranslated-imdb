This is by far the most definite film about the police force I saw. Although not targeted by Ram Gopal Varma, it has all the elements of an RGV film. Dead straight dialogs, blunt treatment of the subject, brilliant direction, and excellent performances (even by those with little work to do in the movie). The chemistry between Nana and the Don, even though they are professional competitors, is incredible. And so are the small events like an insider who doesn't give information to Imtiaz, even while being locked in the safe, but only for Nana when he's out. The change in working conditions with the change of senior is treated wonderfully. The first half is completely over, and moves like a documentary with Nana acting like a Jatin mentor. He explains the complexities and philosophy of the work. <br /> <br /> Overall one of the most brilliant films in India theater theater. Certainly not to be missed.
