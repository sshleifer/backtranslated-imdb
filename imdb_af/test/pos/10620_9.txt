I saw this movie just once, and I'm looking forward to seeing it again and again. Dear David (from Beligium) Why did you bother to write a comment on this movie? I just think we can think of you (after reading your comment), it's probably a non-sexual person (like Erika in the movie) and you're not ready for the new theater that pops up. I think you're a little bit old, and sexual expression is not part of your "visage". The Cannes Film Festival is by far the best movie festival, and it is my pleasure to say that this film was awarded with: Best Actress, Best Actor and Grand Prix. Isabelle Huppert is wonderful, as always, who will do this movie like her? One of her best shows ever. The music is fantastic, and yet again, Michael Haneke puts the big screen into reality. It's like a Dogma95 type movie, because of the subject. Try to see it. <br /> <br />
