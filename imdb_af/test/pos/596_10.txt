I haven't seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with the Sesame Street Muppets and later realized how much effort and time it took to bring these characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and master muppeteer. When I watched this movie, it brought me back when I was younger and things looked so much easier. For this little time travel I fall this movie as a 10. <br /> <br /> The plot line explores how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. The laughter and gags are classical muppetism. I'm glad these movies are still for the next generation. I hope I never grow the magic of the muppets.
