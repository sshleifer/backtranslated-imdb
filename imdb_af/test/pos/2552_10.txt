Ramin Bahrani starts early in a Chop Shop scene that immediately identifies me with the character of Ale (Alejandro Polanco) and his friend. The two of them arrive on a subway, and as soon as the doors are close, they ask if they can get everyone's attention for a moment, and that they sell candy bars or M&Ms or something, and then they burst . If you (like me) ever were on a subway in New York City, it is always the kind of situation that so often happens that you hardly see it. Often people on a subway see children like this or minorities selling or announcing something and talking about something on a subway and they don't pay a thought. Bahrani's focus is not necessarily just on kids for subway rides, but on survival and the condition of one in when in the lower class in America. It is later in his hands, thoroughly and heartbreaking, usually at the same time. <br /> <br /> Comparing this with Pixote or the Bicycle Thief is not too far from a jump (in the latter, at least, the father and son have each other), although Bahrani is specifically in his documentary style intentions is. We care about this character Ali, not older than eleven, and work in a car shop that cleans cars and helps divorce others, and his sister who comes out of town to stay with him. But it's not just because we have any clich√©s, except you know, a brother and sister (more so the brother) are trying to care for each other. Bahrani makes the story accessible through the simple aspiration Ali has, the kind of goal that could possibly be achieved in his situation: save enough to buy a used food truck that Ali and Isamar can run themselves. <br /> <br /> It's All Ali Works, but what Bahrani shows us in brutal detail is what Ali has to do to make it happen even if his insatiable stuff breaks down hubcaps of tire cars in Shea Stadium or, at one stage, steal a purse in a desperate moment. This makes it increasingly a problem when Ale sees what his sister does for money at night, with sexual favors for men in a deserted truck on the side of the road. He doesn't call it and pushes it aside, but it's always something that adds tension, something that Ale wants to protect his sister. This adds to the tragedy when Ale is the real cost of what it will take to make the food truck into a profit maker, a cost that just adds to the anxiety he only interns. <br /> <br /> One can immediately look at the fact that Ale is an orphan in such a neighborhood as the one in Queens, the film is of course shot, as with a work by neo-neo realism (let's call it realism). virtually all non-professional actors in the parts of the mechanics and workers and people on the street - but Bahrani is more focused - now and now, and so makes Chop Shop so immediate and upright. Not a track of melodrama in the movie, barely even music accompaniment apart from the lively Latino music coming from the cars and radios. Sometimes Bahrani will focus on a very subtle moment in which it speaks in further scenes, such as the way Ale wakes up, but as if he were sleeping the first night after witnessing Isamar's last night. And we see when she goes to bed, she probably knows he's awake, but can't say a word either. Or in many other scenes, poetic touches seem to be seamless, as when the man Ale shows how the pigeons work. <br /> <br /> It is rough and eager, as you can expect, and does not give much hope to its main characters despite the few moments of happiness sprinkling. It's also a great handy movie, where the technique, like many films made in the urban scene and approach, complements the subjects on the screen and complements what they do, but it's also never recklessly shot or flashed. . The movie maker has an excellent 'real' cast (Ale has been picked without any experience from a public school in NYC) and knows how not to waste a shot while at the same time achieving brutal artworks with just what he says . It is not the City of God or Pixote; It's his own little masterpiece on a character or characters that we usually not only look at (or a first one scarcely) in a city like New York. If you aren't going through Ale and his daily struggle, I don't know what to do for you.
