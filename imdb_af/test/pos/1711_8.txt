If Keaton follows the comic strip tradition, they find themselves in violation of the law. This Langdon short (the last one released before doing TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) was based on another cartoon - married to a messy spouse, and trying to get away for some secret two-time dating . Laurel & Hardy did it in several films, such as Fields and Chaplin. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with that - why do these characters always marry so nasty women? And there's an interesting sociological side problem - why don't you find female comics married to male peers with these shrews? I can't remember, except in a Carol Burnett skit where the two nastier members of two couples discover that they prefer someone to give it as well as they get (a kind of mutual sado-masochism, but also reassured that they not married to a name-by-pamby type). As to the fact that the comics marry shrews, I can assume they get what they deserve. Or do they? Ollie really deserves a woman throwing pots and dishes with him? Yes, he went to the convention in SONS OF THE DESERT which destroyed her plans, but he wanted a private time. There is nothing to suggest that he and Stan were cheating on their wives. Actually, he is rumored by Mae Busch because he lied to her while Stan collapsed and told the truth to his wife. <br /> <br /> Here's Harry's wife (Alice Ward) at the beginning showing how she speaks to her. keep him under strict control. We see Harry at his work (it is Saturday morning, and the work ends the afternoon for the rest of the weekend - it was before the idea of ​​a five-day week, 40 hours a week working in industry). He works in a foundry where he becomes red hot metal (a jolly joke about Langdon - he is a small, light man, not the muscle type to swing a sledge hammer). He just missed his car trying to give a man a light. He calls home to explain things and gets an overflow of the missus because he's two minutes late. <br /> <br /> On the way home, Harry meets his doll Steve (Vernon Dent), who met two beautiful, lovely girls who would like an appointment. Harry is hesitant, but agrees after talking to the girl (he agrees to pay for the dogs for the four - he has a 1926 silver half dollar in his pocket). But his plans seem due to the fact that his wife discovers his hidden "closet" of coins. He hides it under the cloak of the lounge and finds it along the edge of the mat. But his wife spies on him and confiscates it all. Later, she heard how he talked and talked to himself. In disdain, she gave him a dime and said he could treat his date for a soft drink. <br /> <br /> But Harry has a second coin of coins, and dress for the date - and go out. He and Dent are apparently late, and Dent blames Harry, but Harry tries to make it happen to him: he produces two prostitutes. They get into a quarrel when Dent (wise) says they are not the kind of girls he would call "pretty". Eventually the girls show up and the date begins. But soon Harry stumbles into the rocking chair, while his wife drives past her, and the girls 'boys' friends are excited. They are angry at their two rivals. <br /> <br /> The short work is good and amusing, and gives one a better idea of ​​the persona that Harry Langdon developed in his short stars as a comic master. He is constantly being used by others. He misses his car because some stranger is still asking for a smoke and a light, and eventually the stranger gets his own. The beautiful girl who has Harry's date has a puppy chasing him away. He rests between two cars that both start to drive away and are eventually wrapped around a pole. It certainly proves that Langdon had his screen persona down pat by the time he made his features. If he could hold the complex whole together as the first three features.
