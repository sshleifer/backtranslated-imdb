Four holy young men from the Mormon land go to L.A. to preach the gospel to urban heathen. But one of the young Mormons is a suppressed gay that "happens" to cross paths with a very young "LA" (What would be movies without coincidences?). These two, very different, young men become friends and become in the process, each other's prospects, which in turn create an inevitable clash between gay and mormon cultures. <br /> <br /> This is the premise of "Last Days", a 2003 movie, written and directed by C. Jay Cox, himself a former Mormon missionary, of course, the film's story is extremely relevant, especially in contemporary America, variations of this story must be told and recalled, and hopefully in future movies ... because the underlying theme is hatefully superior to the Christian fundamentalists, often revealing to gay, and, of course, "Last Days" is challenging, and I doubt that the film was well received in Provo or Pocatello, although the writing is intelligent, sensitive and insightful is.
