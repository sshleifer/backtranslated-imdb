"Hey, I didn't order a taxi!" "Yes, well, you have one ..." What can I say about Hack ... what a man among men. He was a sad ex-cop turned taxi driver with a heart of gold. If you (and fortunately for America's TV viewers ... one person a week) could penetrate the cold, hard surface of Hack's outside, you had to see a caring man devoted to vigilant justice. The show was great, I laughed, I cried, I smiled ... all in the same episode. My arms would fall apart if our dearest friend Hack would leave his taxi in another dark ... with nothing more than his fists ... ready to avenge a wrong citizen. A smile would break out on my face as the screen showed me a criminal in a dark lane's facial expressions when the Taxi of Justice illuminated headlights on his face. Week after week, I canceled my duties as president of the Klingon Association to keep the warmth of Hack's glamor. I have never seen a better performance, and I lost the loss of one of America's biggest treasure troubles when the show was canceled. In other Hack-related news, I would like to announce to the world that my wife and I expect Hack Koen to come into the world within three weeks.
