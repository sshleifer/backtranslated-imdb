I was very impressed with what Eddie Monroe could do about his overall impact on me. I say this because I know that this independent film had a limited budget / resources, but it does come across as a convincing and well-crafted piece of work. <br /> <br /> Enjoying from start to finish with several fairly unfamiliar actors I can't help but cause a major noise in the industry over the years, Eddie Monroe has failed to keep my interest and dance my emotional meter. It's a well-written story with a spectacular end, despite my attempt not to be taken away. <br /> <br /> Many of the cast names for this movie are names to look out for in the future. Someone told me that Paul Regina recently passed, and if that's true, it's a real tragedy, as his stoic performance in Eddie Monroe is remarkable. <br /> <br /> Kudos at Fred Carpenter who really made a winner with this one!
