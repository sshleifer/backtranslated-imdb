These comments discuss "North and South Book I" dealing with the 1842-1861 period. <br /> <br /> The 19th-century history of the USA is mainly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion, because it was the Civil War that put the Union under the strict test; it was the Civil War that made the Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; Finally, it was this period that eventually brought the end of the shameful system of slavery. <br /> <br /> From the birth of movies, people were adjusting to that screen. D. Griffith, in the early 1900s, made his memorable BIRTH OF A NATION. Still, the most famous film about the north-south clash is still, I think, WAY WITH THE WIND (1938). Unfortunately, fewer people know the wonderful TV series based on John Jakes' novel, "North and South." It's the very best TV series ever made and the time to study is really precious. I pasted it to my Polish TV video many years ago and have come back with great pleasure ever since. Why? <br /> <br /> First, the whole story is deeply rooted in historical reality. The two families, the Maines from South Carolina and the Dangers from Pennsylvania, represent two completely different ways of life. Nevertheless, friendship unites them. Yet, what they are experiencing is the battle everyone is doing: friendship attacked by "truth" of "political correctness", love attacked by hatred of "legitimate spouse", meekness by the power of "social heroes". Orry Maine (Patrick Swayze) is my beloved character - someone who finds love and who is quickly deprived of her; someone who cares for friends, but political fanatics get in the way and ruin a lot. Finally, he is someone who can see the tragic future for his country, but there is nothing he can do about the south's inescapable fate. His friend, George Hazard, is similar in most respects, but sometimes he seems to have a stronger character. It is he who shows Orry that although there are tragedies, he has to get up and live because life is the most precious thing we have. Although they represent two different lifestyles, their friendship is stronger than any prejudice, politics or conflict. <br /> <br /> Other characters are also very well developed. There are villains, such as Justin LaMotte or Salem Jones who are really angry, but most people are ambiguous, as the nature of humanity has always been. Charles Maine is initially full of rebellion, prone to fight, but later he learns to be a true southern gentleman whose southern pride is not bold words, but brave deeds. Virgilia Hazard represents the most fanatical side of the destruction movement that condemns slavery and punishes the owners of "black breeding ground". Her marriage to Grady seems to be a symbol of equality, but also a symbol of saying "NO" to southern politics. Two interesting characters are Orry's sisters, Brett and Ashton's sisters, whose veins are completely contradictory. Brett, in her gentleness, but also naive, believes in absolute fidelity. She marries Billy, even though he is a northern, because she really loves him. Brett represents everything precious in any young woman. However, Ashton is a vampire, a tiger, a woman who doesn't hesitate to do the most wicked things. The clear picture of their worldview clash is their talk about men and family ... unforgettable moment and how universal! Most characters seek their values ​​... but war breaks out and they will have to tilt a lot ... <br /> <br /> Secondly, the actions ... someone said that not all people are acting naturally. I wouldn't say it. I'd rather say that everybody is doing great work in their parts of the main characters portrayed by younger staff to the guests of celebrity stars, including Liz Taylor, Robert Mitchum and others. Patrick Swayze as Orry does a good job. I consider this role to be one of its best. Lesley Anne Down as Madeleine is also very memorable. Her part may have too much suffering, but she manages all sorts of feelings very well. Kirstie Alley is very attractive and truly unforgettable as the apostate woman Virgilia Hazard. Phillip Casnoff is worth considering as terribly ambitious Elkanah Bent as well as David Carradine as a monster man, disgusting Justin LaMotte. And unlike him, mention should be made of Jean Simmons who is truly excellent as Orry's mother whose heart is struck for the glory of family life and the conspiracy of the union. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, memorable moments of "North and South" leave an indifferent trace in your mind. Who can forget the first meeting of Orry and Madeleine - what charm, what kindness is there in this scene! Or is it possible to hit the moment when Madeleine's father dies? I found it really powerful, there is a real drama in this moment, a drama of a woman left by someone who really loved her. I also liked Churubusco's order and George Hazard was so worried about the life of his dearest friend, Orry. Then his encounters with Constance are amazing. Virgilia's speech in Philadelphia is a masterpiece of achievement. And the last moment of the first part: although North and South may divorce, their friendship will never die. Orry and George symbolically gather when the train moves. Simply, there are so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it is impossible to name even half of them here. And these beautiful songs by Bill Conti and shot in brilliant landscapes. The music in "North and South" is very touching and memorable. <br /> <br /> What should you say eventually? "North and South" is a real must on DVD, just a wonderful TV series about winning all that is precious in us: love, friendship, loyalty, honor, truth, absolute faith. 9/10
