Marco Poloni (Costas Mandylor) was born in a bakery family in the Bronx. Although the Polonis has been known for their garments for decades, the business has fallen at difficult times. Meanwhile, Grace Carpenter (Lauren Holly) is a talented Manhattan dessert but she doesn't seem to want a nice candy position due to the glass ceiling. A coincidental meeting between Marco and Grace leads to a discussion on a possible solution for both of them. There is a high-profile bakkie, The Golden Whisk, which will take place in the near future and Marco wants Grace to be with him. There is a solid amount of dough, haha, at stake for the winners, enough to put Grace in her own business and also save the Polonis dining room. Grace agrees. But there are complications. Some of the judges and fellow contestants may have problems with both Grace and Marco. Then, although Marco and Grace both feel some attraction to the other, Grace has a long, very rich boyfriend. Can Marco and Grace win the game? It's a beautiful movie for the romantic heart. First there is the nice throw. Holly has always been a lovely actress with a notable voice that promotes her attractions. In this movie she was perfectly cast as the determined but beautiful Grace. Mandylor, a newcomer, delicacies, also as the pretty competitive baker. The rest of the actors, including the wonderful Brenda Vaccaro and Marco's mother, are pretty pretty. As a Hallmark movie, the costumes, sets and production facilities are out of bounds and the writing remains fresh and funny, despite some well-known themes. Treat yourself, Romcom lovers, to a sweet steak by viewing this movie. It's definitely the movie equivalent of a big box of quality chocolate.
