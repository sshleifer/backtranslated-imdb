The premise is rather original and well thought out, but unfortunately a good story is a very low budget, which doesn't even allow decent special effects. Jeff Fahey does his best under a bad role, just like the always beautiful Linda Hoffman. They have to make more movies. The movie, while not very praised, guarantees at least one performance.
