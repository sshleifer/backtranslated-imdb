Contrary to what many people might believe, as this movie is an "anti-system" type of film and attitude. This is an excellent portrayal of the particular system and how ridiculous it really is. The funny parts in the movie are actually funny because they are telling the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie unrealistic denies the observable truths about life. And it's learning what you enjoy. That's what the college is about. <br /> <br /> I would like a comment to have at least 10 lines. I think I have expressed my opinion on this. So now I write a few more lines just like stuffing. I hope you are entertained during this time. I encourage you to watch the movie. It's worth your time as long as you follow it and immerse yourself in the movie.
