Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond. Although I was just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient' (?) Wherever Hurley was there, trying to reduce his weight (as seen from previous episodes). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this last episode was really suspended. The end is not so understandable. I think the author expected the audience to be a season 3. <br /> <br /> I just hope the next season will give light to more unclear / pending events. <br /> <br /> Can't wait any longer for season 3.
