There are only a handful of movies made on such a large scale and made such a difference in the art of movies. <br /> <br /> "Bronenosets Potyomkin" is one of these movies, and it should be anyone's list looking for more to learn about the history of the theater. <br /> <br /> Grigori Aleksandrov and Sergei M. Eisenstein directed this groundbreaking film documenting the horrors of a Russian warship. When the sailors finally fall back on their chiefs, the locals are embraced and supported. Things get ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to look after things. The following is one of the most imitating scenes in the history of the theater. Anyone who has seen "The Untouchables" and "Bronenosets Potyomkin" knows exactly what I mean. <br /> Overall, I think this movie has made the movie bar just like "Intolerance" a few years earlier. If you don't have quiet movies, do yourself a favor and see "Bronenosets Potyomkin". <br /> <br /> If you don't like silent movies, look at "Bronenosets Potyomkin" anyway. <br /> <br />
