Try to find another movie that's such a journey without having a story or plot, and you'll be hard pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentation. In less than 90 minutes, it not only controls a time capsule of an era, but also an experimental feature of full-length disregarding time, space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties can. HEAD is a reflection of those movies. No matter how you feel about the Monkeys, it's a movie that every filmmaker has to see because it opens up the endless possibilities of film as art medium. It was not for the film's unorthodox advertising campaign (and the fact that the Monkeys came out so much that the public got tired of them and every critic was ready to hit them) much more. To study how the film is worked out is much more important and exciting than actually in the movie - yet there are some great things in it (big songs, great cinematography, etc.). Must be seen after midnight for maximum effect due to its overall dreamlike feel. 1968 was a time of social unrest and a call to change (so the movie's work title "Changes") and HEAD reflected that time perfectly.
