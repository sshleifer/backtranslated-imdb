It's a mystery to me why I haven't caught this masterful 50's hijacking movie? So far, I've become a broken noir, but I'm definitely happy to report that it hasn't disappointed. I haven't seen Jules Dassin's American movies for years, but on that basis I will most likely go back and watch "Brute Force" and "Night and the City" again. <br /> <br /> Jean Servais, a name unknown to me, but a face that is quite familiar with its global power and cold, has recently completed a long-term stay in prison and as in the movies (hey , if there is no story different) do not beat the straight life well. An opportunity presents itself: an easy multi-million dollar jewel cage that can be done at night, without a few men's fear of discovery. The harsh filming of the robbery, half an hour of total silence, is what most people remember most of the film of course and that is indeed quite remarkable; but I love the half-finished place of the final shootings, as soon as the robbery became acidic, thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves; the excellent picturesque sides of Paris in sharp black and white; and Servais's channeling of Eddie Constantine and Humphrey Bogart into his free but brutal show. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's a bit too sentimental in the end, but it's one of those classics that really does entertain its reputation just like pure, even if it's about the human condition , not exactly deep or thoughtful; George Auric's turn to modernist, romantic and jazzy score is another highlight.
