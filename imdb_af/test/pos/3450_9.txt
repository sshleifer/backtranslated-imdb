Sorry the poor reviewer who doesn't understand this wonderful movie. What a sad life he must lead! <br /> <br /> This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, but it's not dark or pastor like the ordinary people's movie type. It's mostly humorous, but not technically a comedy. <br /> <br /> The whole thing feels a bit like a fantasy, maybe Shakespeare's "Midsummer Nights Dream." Beautiful, intelligent women are abundant, with wonderful cinematography and a non-abusive script that doesn't miss a rhythm. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch this movie on the cable, I look forward to seeing it. It's like reading a favorite, valuable book.
