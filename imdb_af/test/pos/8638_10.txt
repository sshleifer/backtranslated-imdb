With an opening segment imitating the music and cinematography of Todd Haynes's Safe (1995), David Lynch uses dream, myth and distorted imaginations of reality to leave the broken story of a failed little Hollywood actress / waitress, Diane Selwyn fall. with fame and her own demons and obsessed with Camilla Rhodes, who is busy with headquarters Adam Kesher. <br /> <br /> The film takes place effectively in Diane's drug-driven head; we are witness to her crazy distortions, her desire fulfillment, regret, obsessions and fears. Lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy, but uses the dream story as a way to present two ideas of reality in conflict. The last 45 minutes have been as dreamy as before; and the difficult air of detached, global ambiguity still permeates, and the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream we expect in nightmarish and dream movies. <br /> <br /> Lynch's movie borrows from many movies, old and new. but ultimately a movie, unlike any other, except the director's own Lost Highway and Blue Velvet. It constantly challenges the viewer to interpret what is being seen, not only intuitively but intellectually. Yet it is not as pretentious as one might think, because Lynch symbolizes the protagonist despite her murderous acts - an element missing in all his other films except the Direct Story. He does this by presenting Diane's dream alter ego, Betty, as a healthy Canadian farm girl known for fame. Lynch also offers us an intriguing story that confirms and denies equal measure. Are Camilla and Diane really love or just friends? Who is the blue lady? What does she mean? Who's the bum behind Winkies? What is the meaning of the decaying body of Sierra Bonita? Does Ruth actually exist? Is silencio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self-referring assumption of the film's fiction status? Lynch is not prepared to answer any question he poses. Rather, he chooses to represent his "love story in the city of dreams" as a set of interconnected abstracts and motives. <br /> <br /> The acting is the highest rate, especially Naomi Watts and Diane Selwyn / Betty, who still obscure this show. Laura Harring has the required Hayworthesque allure as Camilla / Rita, while Adam Theroux as Adam brings a generous arrogance and paranoid aggression to his role. It was staggering and a serious injustice that none of them even nominated for an academy award. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that requires it to be seen and analyzed now. The mystery in the heart of the movie remains in Lynch's hands, but half the fun finds consistent ideas from the maze of apparent irregularities he presents. On closer inspection there is a definite meaning for a puzzle, perhaps an unfinished jigsaw we tear, but denies the imaginary scope of narrative coherence. Ultimately, it's Lynch's key movie.
