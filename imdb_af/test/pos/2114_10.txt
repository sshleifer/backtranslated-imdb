It was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light humor of this year's best family movie ... Grand Champion. The story of a 12-year-old boy (Buddy), who is determined to raise a Grand Champion driver with his sister, mother and best friend. It's a great trip to the big competition. After crowned Hokey Pokey, Grand Champion, he is auctioned for $ 775,000. to pay for children's college education. Buddy finds out next time he'll see Hokey .... it'll be on a sphere! The children conspire to steal the prize winner, to save him from the BBQ. That's where the fun begins ... Julia Roberts, Larry Mahan, George Strait, Natalie Maines, Steven Bland, Tommy Guy, Tuff Hedeman, and so many more stars create the backdrop for all the antics. You won't believe who the manager actually won at auction !!! (he looks good in a mustache) The soundtrack is rich in songs from George Street, Natalie Maines, Willie Nelson and more. Where else can you experience Movie Stars, Country & Western stars and Rodeo stars .... just in Texas ... just in Grand Champion. <br /> <br /> It is masterfully crafted "simple" little movie that may be the best movie you see this year. The film opens in certain cities on Friday 27 August. 2004 <br /> <br /> Another good movie by Rope the Moon and Michaelson Productions is IN A WASTE. Keep an eye on the cable networks for this one!
