In September 2000, I saw a betty nurse on the international film festival 'movies by the sea' in Flissingen, the Netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept smiling all day long after watching it for the first time and almost the night when I took the film as the final taste of the festival. What I knew of a nurse betty was briefly that Renée Zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap opera star. But what I saw was much more than that! Beautiful roles for morgan freeman, chris rock and renée zellweger. A strange mix of romance, violence and roadmovie. And for all the stories that take different directions every moment, you think you're on track. Many soap opera lovers will love a betty nurse - both the movie and the character !!! - But they can all bring non-soap friends to it, as they will enjoy the story even more for the hard and humorous lines - freeman and rock - for the cruel scene, the thriller and the beautiful photos. And I am absolutely sure everyone at the end will be a nurse betty lover for her captivating and innocent charm !!!
