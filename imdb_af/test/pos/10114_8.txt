Call it manipulative drives if you want, but I fell for that. Certainly, there could have been more character development. Yes, there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant film of the week score, but Ed Harris was impeccable, Cuba Gooding is rich and touching. Let's look at people in real life, how many of us really come to know Ken's motivation. Not much. We got some insight into the coach's motivation (a very challenging dialogue in my opinion, not soon forgotten). It was, in my opinion, a wonderful tribute to one person who broke his "comfort zone" to reach out to another person, and meanwhile, the lives have touched hundreds more. A lesson that we all need to be reminded of. Why is it the right thing to do is so often the most difficult thing to do? I recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart. You won't be disappointed. And bring your Kleenex. 8/10
