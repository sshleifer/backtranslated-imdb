Never mind if 'National Velvet (1944)' is a little hacker and sometimes unconvincing, Clarence Brown's equestrian festival is an engaging and very good story with good morals. After achieving a modest success through her appearance in 'Lassie Come Home (1943)', young Elizabeth Taylor, 12, launched her first starring role as Velvet Brown, a passionate horse obsessed schoolgirl. Though filmed in California, the story - adapted from a novel by Enid Bagnold - is established in a small village in English countryside. Full use is made of the Technicolor photography to present the vibrant and attractive landscapes of blue sky and green shrubs. Mickey Rooney takes the best bill as Mi Taylor, a deceived ex-jockey with reluctant intentions, whose relationship with young Velvet revives his values ​​of dignity and opens a new, optimistic chapter in his life. Although struggling in one succession, he must confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses. Rooney is pleasant as a bad but passionate young man who has to prove his worth. <br /> <br /> It's perhaps a good thing that Elizabeth Taylor had those winding eyes, because her acting abilities at this young age were quite limited. Her more emotional rows showing his courage and integrity in the face of adversity cease as hollow and the appealing naïve idea that simply "believing" will achieve everything is one that has been virtually repeated. every memorable inspirational sports film ever made. Nevertheless, Taylor is bright and enthusiastic, and she works well with Mickey Rooney, who was no stranger to being a child star. Anne Revere plays a very important role as Velvet's mother, once a well-known athlete, who not only swam the English Channel but was lovingly trained by none other than Mi Taylor's own father. I liked that Mi was not told of this until the last seconds of the movie, and Mrs. Brown definitely decided that the young man should first develop his own sense of decency rather than exploit the memory of his late father for financial gain. he would undoubtedly have done at the start of the film. <br /> <br /> The film reached its peak at the Grand National Sweepstakes, where Velvet at the last moment decided to ride her own horse, the Pi, in the world-famous competition. Under the prospect of a Latvian male, as expected, she is going over, but is later disqualified - either because she is a girl or because she has tumbled out of the horse before being allowed to dissolve (what a stupid rule!). This elaborate sequence of events has been particularly well done to capture the nervous tension of the nerve teams before the racing seconds and the confusion of the event we place in the same position as Rooney's character, stomping behind long spectators and waiting anxiously for someone to ' provide an accurate update. It doesn't matter, we know it's a stunt double that does most of the tricky ride. In various scenes we can see a spectacular man in a wig, but the positive message remains the same. I dare say 'National Velvet' has cherished the imagination of millions of young girls over the last sixty years, and it has the power to inspire, has become little over time.
