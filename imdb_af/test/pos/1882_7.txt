I didn't see so many people packaged outside a theater outside Star Wars Episode III. Both shows are sold out, and for good reason. The man with the screaming brain was the best movie to watch with a crowd of geeks. (Hey, I'm also a thirst.) <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell was present and stabbed the whole crowd! The movie was cheesy in the best possible way. It could be the funniest movie Bruce did. Ted Raimi steals the show with his Bulgarian hip hop itude and zany facial expressions, he is a laugh-riot! Who knew Ted could rap? <br /> <br /> I changed my mind, the person who stole the show was actually a robot. There's nothing funny like a robot ... the robot does. <br /> <br /> As for Bruce's performance, "I take the 5th." Thanks Bruce. Thank you for being cool, thank you for taking the time, thank you for all the fun.
