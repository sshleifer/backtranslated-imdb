toplines this good comedy about an aging father (C. Aubrey Smith) who decides to gather his grown up children from all over the world. Davies works as a chorus girl in New York when she gets the news "Daddy" wants her. Hmmmm, sounds familiar. Davies' considerable talents as a comedian save this otherwise so-so comedy if she upsets the turbulent British countryside with her brazen American personality. Not as sharp as other Davies comedies, but still worth a look. Ray Milland plays her long-lost "brother". Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray and Halliwell Hobbes are also nice.
