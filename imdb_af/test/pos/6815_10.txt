I absolutely loved this movie ... So much emotion in such a small amount of time. I loved the beginning and how it throws you completely. I love the story and the deer is brought in. I know when I think of deer I think of innocence and prosperity. Also in Psalm 42: 2 in the Bible it says: "Like the deer pants for the streams of water, so shall my soul for thee, O God." That could even connect the last moment when the woman says it'll be fine. As if she knew she was going with God. Maybe I think so much about it. But sometimes it's interesting to see what happens to people's minds. Thank you for sharing this masterpiece with viewers everywhere. I live in Texas and I played it on cable ... I immediately got on the computer to find out more about this movie and this wonderful director! I really enjoyed the music used in the background. Music can sometimes make or break a movie. It definitely set the mood perfectly. Very good choice! <br /> <br /> Again. <br /> <br /> Laetitia
