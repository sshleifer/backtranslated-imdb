Well-known filmmaker Werner Herzog's "Fata Morgana" is amazingly unorthodox. Although characters appear in the movie from time to time, there is no real story. The film is also not an educational or historical documentary. This is a movie without an accompanying script. <br /> <br /> The film consists of curious background music and a somewhat illogical story VO, the combination of which exceeds a long series of images, mostly but not exclusively the Sahara Desert. . Some of the images are wonderfully strange, and extraordinary. The camera captures ghostly images, or mirages, that tantalize and hypnotize optical illusions. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, this general film is watched on serendipitous topics. For example, in a row, a man wearing glasses gives a mini-lizard guide. And in what was the most fascinating and bizarre sequence for me, a small in-room contains a man with dark glasses singing in a voice that is completely twisted by the microphone he uses, accompanied by an old lady who beautiful song playing on an old piano. Not the man or the old lady seems to enjoy what they do. How baroque. <br /> <br /> "Fata Morgana" has an underlying concept, one that unites the wide variety of strange images and eclectic sounds. But the concept is so subtle, so impenetrable that you will never find it without help. From this subtle theme, the film makes sense. However, without that point of reference, the movie may look annoying and infinite, a useless parade of random earthly images and esoteric narrative gibberish. <br /> <br /> Unapologetically, redundant, thematic confusion and kinetic heretics, "Fata Morgana" will probably also let you swim or throw you. You will either capture the movie's Zen-like features or be tempted to defeat the DVD in a thousand pieces. One thing most viewers will agree on: "Fata Morgana" is ... different.
