Just like in "Columbo" we see the fatality at the beginning. What follows is a rising web of lies, sex, extortion and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even a fumbler, unlike "Columbo". This is William H. Macy, as the film critic suspects who wears the film. Turning and turning continuously, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the mercury sand of his "perfect crime". William H. Macy's fans will enjoy a light murder case "as well as those who want crime crews with all sorts of great opportunities. Highly recommended - NOTE
