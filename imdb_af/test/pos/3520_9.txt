Just before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher movie. The backwoods slasher almost started with films like Friday 13th, The Burning, and Madman. Just before Dawn is a step forward from the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is beautiful. In addition, the acting is. The heroine of the movie is not your typical 'final girl'. <br /> <br /> Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes to survival, she's a step behind. Not until it saves her and her boyfriend's life, kicks off the primary idea of ​​survival. There is a subtle transition that gradually focuses on the final girls' hidden sexuality - which with her will to survive. <br /> Just before Dawn is not for everyone, but for the slasher fan, it's as close to perfect as you can get. The killer (s) are very threatening. Almost like it's a game to kill and kill someone crossing their territory. The final scene is a bit over. For the first time viewer, it can be a bit shocking. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the backwoods skater. Even non-slasher fans will find something to keep from it. The environment is weird and uncomfortable. The death row is not particularly stingy, but I'm not sure if the movie is needed. See it!
