Hammer House of Horror: Witching Time is in England on Woodstock, where the acclaimed musician David Winter (Jon Finch) lives with his actress wife Mary (Prunella Gee) and currently compiles the music for a horror movie. One night while looking for his dog, Billy David finds a mysterious woman in his barn. She calls herself Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn). She claims she is a witch who has been transporting 300 years in the past. Clearly, the bad David is very hard to believe her, so he closes her in a room in his peasant house. He invites his doctor Charles (Ian McCulloch) to investigate her, but as soon as he arrives, they come into the room. Lucinda disappeared. Charles puts it down to David too much, but the next few days start strange and disturbing things with David and Mary. <br /> <br /> Witching Time was episode 1 of the short-lived British anthology horror series Produced by Hammer Studios for TV and originally broadcast here in the United Kingdom during September 1980, the first of two Hammer House or Horror episodes published by Don Leader directed (episode 13 The Mark of Satan the other). I actually liked it. As a series, Hammer House of Horror has dealt with several different themes and has not been linked, except in name and indifference. Watching Time is a sinister and effective little story about a witch, the writing by Anthony. Read benefits from the light 50 odd minute expensive & move along with a good fit. The character is pretty good like the dialogue, there are some nice scenes here and I like the way it never completely reveals whether David and Maria go crazy or not. I think this is a well-structured, entertaining and fairly creepy horror-themed TV show that I enjoyed more than I thought I would. <br /> <br /> Since it was made for British TV, Hammer's boys had a lower budget than usual, If it was even possible, there is not a beautiful time here, as in their best-known Frankenstein & Dracula movies, although the contemporary English environment gives it a certain atmosphere that you can share. Another TV-based limitation is that the exploitation levels are lower than you can hope for, there are a few nudity & gore but not much, though I didn't think too much, as the story is pretty good here. It's good for what it is. & Hammer's experience on their feature films has probably helped make this look pretty good, the acting is also good with genre favorite Ian McCulloch, which makes a bit-part look. <br /> <br /> Witching Time is a great start to the Hammer House of Horror series, like a 50-minute piece of British TV, it's pretty damn now, now they no longer make the show here like here not?
