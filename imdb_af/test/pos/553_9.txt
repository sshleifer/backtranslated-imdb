The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was very interesting, and I was really sold at the mother-daughter relationship. It is a family story that is not immersed in drops and special effects; a story of how it really is. I can't help but give a sigh at the end of this movie because it's a good bittersweet story to grow up and talk to family and friends. The acting was pretty beautiful and I hope we will see both Portman and Sarandon in familiar roles.
