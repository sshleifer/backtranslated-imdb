Sarah Plain and Tall's Winters End was the best movie I've ever seen. The person in the story I liked best had played Cassie by Emily Osment. Just because of her energy and how she speaks her mind. For example, when Anna arrives out of town, Cassie wants to answer and she says, "Hello? Anna thinks what. Great dad is lost, but he's now and he's not a good man!" I love all the Sarah Plain and long films my rating. I think Sarah Plain and tall was # 3. Skylark was # 2. Winter end was # 1! If I could live in any family of the past, it would be the Witting family. I think there are so many good parts in this movie, I can't call them all. I think they have chosen the best and perfect actors to play all these people in the movie, so if you ever want to see a movie of the past, I strongly recommend Sarah Plain and Tall's Winters end.
