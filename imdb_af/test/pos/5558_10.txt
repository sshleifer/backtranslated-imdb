Farscape completely rules! In my opinion, it is very close to Babylon five, although there are only 7 main characters in the series (including spaceship). The humor is excellent and the writers manage to keep the show interesting, although everything happens on the ship. <br /> <br /> What I really appreciate and appreciate in Farscpae is that they don't use CGI for the stranger. characters or if they do, it is impossible. They use the lovely, crappy rubber animatronic puppets, much like those used in the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> If you don't already have it, you definitely want to watch it.
