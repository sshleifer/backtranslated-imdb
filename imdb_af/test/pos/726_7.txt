What can I say? Not as bad as many here made it out. The only reason I even saw this movie I had never heard before was strictly for IAN McSHANE. <br /> <br /> I was not at least disappointed. IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brought a wonderful subtlety to his role. He is always great to watch and for my money ... an extremely underutilized actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the movie .... Every other actor in the movie delivered strong, solid performances. These people certainly did not pay large amounts of cash for their participation (as this was a fairly low budget film), but that did not mean that any of them "posted" their appearance. Everyone was convincing and compelling with the given parts <br /> <br /> I was even pleasantly surprised at ADRIAN PAUL's performance, although I have to admit that I first saw him in the Highlander Television series before this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was well-played and the story intriguing and much like real-life, everything doesn't end in a nice neat package for you at the end of the movie. Anyone who expects a clear, by-the-numbers link the points "conclusion" or "answer" at the end of the movie ... KLEARLY didn't see the movie enough now! This movie won't tell you what the "meaning of life" is! The idea is that you can go to the movie and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends about a coffee. I definitely did. <br /> <br /> No motor hunters ... No explosions ... No bunkers .... (Sounds pretty boring, how?) But the reality is that I'm totally absorbed by the movie and it's just " a well-written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performance by all concerned. <br /> <br /> ****** WARNING ... ****** If you like the kind of person who doesn't like movies that is a huge "question" as the central engine of the story then end the movie without answering that particular question directly. <br /> <br /> DO NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE.
