'The Merchant of Venice' is one of Shakespeare's best-known plays and is still regularly featured in the theater. Incredibly, this movie is the first English version for the film rather than television. There were a number of versions made in the early days of the cinema in Britain or America, but it was all quiet. <br /> <br /> The reason for this neglect of the plays may be related to sensitivity to the play's alleged anti-Semitism, a topic that has been more sensitive since the rise of the Nazis in 1933. explain why all previous versions were made during the silent era, in 1908 or 1922 Shylock would have been easier to portray Shylock as a simple villain than it would be today. But in my opinion, the film is not anti-Semitic at all. It should be remembered that during Shakespeare's lifetime no established Jewish community was in England; The Jews were expelled by Edward I in the late 13th century and may not return to Cromwell's time, forty years after Shakespeare's death. As far as we know, Shakespeare never traveled abroad. It therefore seems quite possible that he himself never knew any Jews personally or experienced the effects of anti-Semitism at first. The play is not merely about the Jewish question, but is, among other things, an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudice. It can indeed be a coded investigation into the mutual antipathy between Catholics and Protestants in Tudor England (something that Shakespeare certainly had first-hand experience) and calling for greater tolerance between them. <br /> <br /> Then, as always, traditional anti-Semitic stereotypes portrayed the Jews as harmful, but Shylock's main sin was not deceived; If it were, he would definitely have accepted Bassanio's offer to pay him six thousand ducats, twice the amount that Antonio gave him. Certainly, Shylock's possessive sin is anger, and the root of his anger is the way he and his fellow Jews are treated by the Christians of Venice. Not only are Jews generally regarded as second-class citizens, but Jewish lenders such as Shylock are specific targets for abuse, although the services they provide are needed for the Venetian economy. The play shows the corrupt effects of prejudice. Not only can such views corrupt the Christians they love, they can also damage the Jews who are abusing. Shylock's vengeance is disproportionate to the injustice he suffered. Spitting on him and calling him a dog, Antonio acts like a drill bigot, but boringishness and bigotry are not widely regarded as crimes that deserve the death penalty. In addition, Shylock tried not only to revenge Antonio on the undoubted injustice that Antonio had done to him, but also for all the injustices, real and imaginary he suffered in the hands of the Christian community, such as his daughter's marriage to Lorenzo . <br /> <br /> It is in honor of film director Michael Radford and his star, Al Pacino, that they understand all these issues. Pacino's Shylock initially has some kind of malicious dignity over him that gradually gives way to revenging anger and ultimately after his humiliation in Portia's reasoning for pathos. We clearly see that he was the instrument of his own destruction, but we can still sympathize with him. In my opinion, none of Pacino's performances I have seen ever matched those he gave in the first two 'Godfather' films (not 'Scent of a Woman', for which he won an Oscar and definitely not 'Godfather III'). but the Venice dealer is the one closest to these benchmarks. The other acting show that stood out was Lynn Collins' bodies Portia, speaks her lines with clarity and simplicity and elaborates the intelligence and ingenuity that makes her character more than just a romantic heroine. I was less impressed with Jeremy Irons's Antonio, who was too passive. Antonio is a complex character; share loyal friend, share melancholy contemplative, share religious bigot and share enterprising capitalist. Although Irons caught the first two of these aspects, it was difficult to see that she spit Antonio either on someone of another faith or on his dangerous business ventures. <br /> <br /> Radford's interpretation of the play was attacked by the film critic of the Daily Telegraph, who, while admiring Pacino's performance, did not keep the timing and argued that Shakespeare was in a contemporary environment must be placed if it is 'relevance' to a modern audience, referring to a recent stage production that takes place in Weimar Germany. I will totally disagree with this approach. The theater and theater are quite different media, and although there are some striking modernist approaches to Shakespeare in theater, Trevor Nunn's Twelfth Night is in mind. A traditional approach is often the best. (For example, I prefer Zeffirelli's "Romeo and Juliet" to Baz Luhrmann's). The idea that we can only appreciate Shakespeare in a modern cover is pure intellectual laziness; we are not prepared to attempt to see our greatest writer in the context of Elizabethan society that produced him, but rather try him as a twentieth-century man of the Republican. <br /> <br /> Radford's traditional approach not only enables us to appreciate that story and revenge, are centuries-old, universal problems, but also create a visually striking movie. In the play, the plays in Venice itself are characterized by turbulent action; Those who are in Portia's country house at Belmont are happier and more peaceful. In the film, the Venetian outdoor scene was shot in place against a backdrop of foggy, winter-like airspace, similar to the appearance in 'Do not Look Now'. The candlelight interiors, with faces that brightened brightly against a dark background, were reminiscent of the chiaroscuro effects of a Caravaggio painting; I suspect it was quite deliberate, because Caravaggio was a contemporary of Shakespeare. Unlike the dark or foggy Venice, the Belmont scenes (shot in an enchanting Palladian villa on an island in a lake) are characterized by sunshine or peaceful moonlight. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Shakespeare adjustments of recent years; An intelligent and visually appealing look at a complex game. 8/10. <br /> <br /> A few mistakes. We see a black swan on the water in front of Portia's house. These birds are native to Australia and were only introduced to Europe after 1596, the date on which the film was established. The portrait of Portia in the lead box was also painted in the style of Florentine Botticelli, which was active about a century before that date. Lynn Collins recalls a Botticelli beauty, but it seems unlikely that a late 16th-century Venetian woman would paint Florence in the late 15th century.
