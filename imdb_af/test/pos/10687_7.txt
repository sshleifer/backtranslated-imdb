This is the question that astronauts Roy Thinnes and Ian Hendry ask themselves when they discover a parallel world of the earth that has always been hidden in the 1969 cult fiction melodrama, which is released here in America as a journey to the far side of the SON. The plot of the film was invented by British writers Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, the creators of such television programs as "UFO", "The Thunderbirds" and "Space 1999". It is sometimes weird, betraying the influence of "The Twilight Zone" and even Stanley Kubrick's classic 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The visual effects work of Derek Meddings, who later also works at SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, holds surprisingly well over the last three decades of special effects progress; and while they aren't really on the same elevated level of the Kubrick movie, they're great. If you don't expect a STAR WARS type of movie and DOPPELGANGER can overcome a good movie, sometimes it's a good dialogue. it was good enough for me to arrange it a '7' and consider it an undiscovered sci-fi jewel.
