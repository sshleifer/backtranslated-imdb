I'm an addict of the TV show, the live shows and everything they do. And that was the last piece of work they did on TV / film as 'The League of Gentlemen'. <br /> <br /> If you like the series, you'll love the movie absolutely. It's a nice ending to their TV show. <br /> <br /> It's smart and funny. <br /> <br /> While not focusing on some of the most popular characters, it's still fun to see all the characters with the authors. A must see for a League of Lord fans. <br /> <br /> See it!
