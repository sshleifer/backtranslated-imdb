I was not surprised to read a comment by the director, so she made this film an antidote for all the "making" DVD featurettes, as it definitely struck me. I confess that I have a love for "meta", but I found this movie to be very accessible and entertaining, and not even in a difficult, self-conscious way. It's definitely a bit of what you expect in a movie about movie-making. It is very "French" because there are many exorbitant but occasional compelling theories on how movies (and even sexuality) work, but since the director does not play himself (rather use an avatar), we have many choices left over (since I'm pretty sure she constantly contradicts herself.) Apparently, Catherine Breillat specializes in hard-to-watch movies, but I'll definitely say this one doesn't qualify. I really enjoyed the dialogue, the balance between the film and the natural, the relationships between the director character and her assistant and actor, and so on. Highly recommended.
