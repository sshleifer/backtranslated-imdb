My only problem with The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is that the movie doesn't take the time to introduce Wallace and Gromit to those who aren't familiar with Park's short films. Oddly enough, "A Close Shave" manages to do so with far less time to save. Yet I loved to see the boys again in action and loved all the new characters, human and different. I especially loved Ralph Fiennes's voice than the Scheming Victor Quartermaine. It's also interesting to see the series on the big screen. The craftsmanship with the clay characters really stands out. It is a hut and ideal for the whole family! I buy very few DVDs, but I have every Wallace and Gromit and would like to add one.
