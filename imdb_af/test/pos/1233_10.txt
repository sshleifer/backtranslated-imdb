hello all Denver fans! <br /> <br /> I couldn't agree with you anymore! This show was so cool and cute, I saw it as a child in the late 80's. Among Denver is another favorite, such as Care Bears and Rainbow Brite. I'm now 24, but it's still one of my favorite shows, and my favorite cartoon of the 80's. It brings back all the memories. The theme song was also good, I get chicks when I hear it. It is sad that it took a short while, but it remained a strong favorite. It's great that I'm not alone and there are people who love it. This is one of the cartoon programs I will hold for future generations. <br /> <br /> Viva Denver! :)
