Genius or completely madness? It depends on your interpretation of this movie. I responded to the level of self-conscious "cop-movie parody", and I sincerely hope it was the intention because I didn't see anyone taking it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd for the one looks to chew the landscape and really get into the spirit of things! Is this film supposed to mark a departure for Rudd from his core background in the comedy genre? Some sort of insane attempt to rediscover him as a hard-boiled action star? I do not think so! <br /> <br /> With the cheesy, almost uncomfortable acting low budget FX, and so on over-the-top action pieces, it has been the old TV show "Sledge Hammer" for me a few times made known! HILARIOUS !!! :-) <br /> <br /> Of course I misinterpreted the movie. If it was actually a "straightforward" action movie, it was definitely a wonderful failure! <br /> <br /> Look with lots of alcohol and a few friends !!! ;-)
