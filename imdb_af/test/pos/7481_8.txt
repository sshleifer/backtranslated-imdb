I like the premise, but the replay of the game is only for certain parts (the opening scene of course). Some characters are a little outrageous, but they are rather entertaining. I think the Ballping Sh-t printed it. I know it was to show that Nick and Casey were angry in LA and to show why Casey ended the lifestyle. I just think the story's story could have been better. Also, the Jamaican man who falls on the phone is smart and entertaining, but again I think the story is messy. It really looks amazing. I actually believe Swordfish (the other movie Woods wrote) more than some of the parts in Thursday because the government keeps secret all the time and has organizations that the public will never know. <br /> <br /> Thursday is the best Quentinesque movie I've seen. I think Woods is imaginative, smart and has whites; But his work needs more aging to get even the Natural Born Killer script (not Stone's movie) level. How old is he anyway?
