First of all, I would like to say that before I watched this movie, I considered myself an acceptable individual. Someone who cares for others, appreciates others, has found no / hardly any judgment against other people, and this film has (according to me) dramatically changed my life or position. When I looked at it, I didn't know what it was about. I knew it was about a kind of forbidden relationship, but otherwise I was unclear and when I started to see what happened between these two wonderfully portrayed characters, I was in shock, disbelief, confusion and surprise. The first time I looked at it, I was blind. Blind to their love, to their intimacy, to their commitment, to their purity as humans, to their relationship. I watched it a second time, because I finally figured out how hypocritical I was and to say to myself and others, "Oh, I accept all kinds of people and try not to judge them" while still this wonderful and incredibly insightful story judgment, Because of my fear I think. The second time I watched this movie, I opened the eyes of mines that were closed for the first time and really looked at, not the type of taboo relationship I have heard throughout my life, but only in love with two people . And I loved it, I loved the storyline, I loved the slightly broken but strong individual in the movie, I shared the feelings and I bought the strong links. It's a real eye-opening, beautifully filmed movie that sometimes makes me cry, and I hope people who read it and the movie will finally watch, remember that everyone deserves love, no matter what shape or form it is presented. ....
