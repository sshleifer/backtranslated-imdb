It reaches the thoughts and feelings of everyone who drives them deep into the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world explored by memories and edgy low sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, which unfolds the inner geography of all three characters parallel to their stories. The bare emptiness of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then the transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desert. Three deceived souls fight to find something absolute and positive in all the negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars deliver exquisite performances. Naive schoolboy, suicide blonde, bitter car thief - all with unexpected twists. Together they create an explosive portrait of broken love - one that unknowingly co-operates amidst the most difficult forms of adversity and illusion - the blindness of human emotion.
