Text From 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide. <br /> <br /> Fokland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas's deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle focus on the secret agenda of its protagonist. <br /> <br /> Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur wizard who leaves him as a tourist, visiting the Falklands shortly after re-opening his people. His master plan is to win the ultimate battle by seducing and fertilizing local women, starting with the glorious Camilla, who souls a whole half of Argentina's soul. Fuckland creates the illusion of a documentary and holds a fishing eye perspective that gives the film a voyeuristic flair and intimacy. (Argentina)
