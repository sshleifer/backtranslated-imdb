I do not understand where this bad comment comes from. The movie had you on the side of your seat and made you scared to go to your car at the end of the night. <br /> <br /> The part you get is that it can all happen. Not to the extent observed in the movie, but the whole idea is reality. This movie took that reality and turned it into a Dee Snider nightmare. <br /> <br /> Three thumbs (the third is from the dead body in my freezer).
