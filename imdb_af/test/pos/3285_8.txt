It was a good episode. Although there was no "caught in the closet" or "cartoon wars", it did a lot of things. The character of Al Gore and the bizarre-as-hell "super grain" thing was pretty funny. But the scene that made me love this episode was one I sure everyone would agree was one of the greatest Cartman / Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious from Kyle, he will steal his gold (which of course falls!), And he comes in thumb of his face. Suddenly, Kyle wakes up, and they have that crazy conversation where Cartman tries to act as everything is all right. Cartman ended the treasure, although predictable, was pretty funny.
