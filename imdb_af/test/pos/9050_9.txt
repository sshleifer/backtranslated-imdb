Despite the aging, "Inki and the Minah Bird" my opinion is a pleasant and charming cartoon. The artwork is not unusual but good enough. This cartoon has no dialogue, just sounds and music, but this combination works pretty well. The cartoon itself is good, funny, old-fashioned, creative, entertaining and amusing. <br /> <br /> This cartoon also makes a difference because it focuses in just 3 characters: Inki (the little black girl), the Minah bird (a very strange bird) and a hungry lion who both have Inki and Minah wants breakfast - so he chases them both during most of the cartoon. <br /> <br /> I really find that lion very attractive, hilarious and cool. I really like that lion. The poor lion is so stupid and losing that you have to feel sorry for him. For me, the real enemy is the Minah bird, not the lion. At one point the lion almost eats it - too badly it can't soften it, because it deserves to be eaten. <br /> <br /> Back to this animated brief there is no single boring or boring moment. At least for me. The only bit I find stupid is the end, because the bird has a great battle with the lion, steals its teeth and puts it in itself. Other than that, I have nothing to criticize about this, except that the steak definitely went for the lion and not the bird. <br /> <br /> I think it's a very forgotten and underestimated little gem that definitely needs more credit.
