This is the ultimate, and I mean the ULTIMATE, ADVENTURE CLASSIC! The plot is good to evil. There has always been an abundance of films depicting gray areas and not enough on the basics of evil to justify the true instances of good against evil in the real world. Just recently, filmmakers tried to get the chance. In real life, more than half of the situations are black and white, but only a fraction of movies make it so. This movie is the best example of a back and white look. It is best seen in black and white. The hero is in the worst situation. He is in the area of ​​a man who wants to kill him and under different enemies. The movie gives the feeling that he is out of reach and can't count on help. His enemy (The Score) has many resources. The count's wife was married to him, and she knew from his past history that he would kill her sooner or later as he did all his wives. She and the hero become allies and fall in love with hidden ones that can win over anyone who looks (unless that person just wants to be). Anyone who helps them is murdered. They have no escape. The situation is hopeless. So will they eventually survive? You won't guess unless you've read the spoilers. The movie also has a very good atmosphere, adventure and plot, along with Lon Chaney as a bad man, and Boris Karloff in his best role ever, as a decent man. Usually cast as a bad man, Karloff was at best when presented with more complex roles like this one. Chaney is rarely given a complex role, though he does well in some movies like "Of Mice and Men. It's a little more than a comedy for him. Yet the tension never stops. There is tension and danger throughout. Perfect Written, perfectly thrown, and perfectly targeted, that's what a movie should be - pure escape, pure adventure.
