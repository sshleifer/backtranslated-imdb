Like almost everyone, I'm familiar with Ray Charles's music. Who hasn't heard "Georgia ON My Mind" and "The Mess-Around" and some of the other great songs appear in this movie. But over the life of Ray Charles, I was unfortunately ignorant until I looked at it. I have to say that Jamie Foxx brought brilliant Ray Charles to life. His performance was powerful, right in the ways and voices. The film also has an unlimited version of some of the trials and tribulations that Charles had during his life, and with some demons from the past who haunted him well in adult life. Perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie is the heroin withdrawal scene, which was painfully realistic. The film portrays Charles's growing awareness of and involvement in the civil rights movement, which culminates in his refusal to appear before a segregated audience in Georgia, which has led to a ban on the state acting. His drug addiction and extra-marital affairs are also well documented. The film turns to a plea from his mother when he was a child: don't change anyone or anything. "The point is that drugs have done the same, and to honor his mother's memory, he had to defeat them. There isn't much here about his later life and career after breaking his heroin habit, but until then It is very powerful stuff
