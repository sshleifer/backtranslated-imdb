Blood wonderful. Recommended by a friend who knew I liked Thomas Kretschmann of The Pianist and Downfall. I loved the flow of the story - how the characters of hope and ideals of valor moved through shock, fear, disintegration, despair and total destruction. A first-class anti-war movie that created quite a stir in Germany. Not a proud moment for anyone and the study of a lost generation. This movie was excellent to transport the removal of the ground troops and control the total futility of untamed nature and the Russian psyche. If I didn't know, I would have thought it was a Russian movie, it was so fatal. What an uncompromising end. A Pieta.
