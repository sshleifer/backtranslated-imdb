An assassin in the form of Day Of The Jackal, The Line Of Fire has the extra doubt that Eastwood's old-time bodyguard Frank Horrigan is upset by the failure of the past at work. The pursuit is personally viewed as a neurosis by John Malkovich's reptile killer Leary. With the rather undecided exception of the love of a good woman (Russo's Lilly Raines), nothing will put Frank's mind at rest if Leary does not personally. <Br /> <br /> Malkovich is a fast-paced presence - not only on the screen but also a variable actor. It's one of his good films, focused and playing director Petersen's game. Eastwood is too old, but a) the audience doesn't care because it's him and b) his age is written in the script, not just in the narrative, but also as a repetitive joke. Pretty much as you would expect but well-wrist. 10/07
