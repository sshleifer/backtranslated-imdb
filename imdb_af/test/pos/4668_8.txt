Especially after watching the MATRIX ENTERPRISE !! * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> After seeing the Matrix with everyone, it's ridiculous fantasy-robust characters with their superpowers. It was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in real-life situations! I care for these people, and even though some of the stunts looked a bit much, it still made me feel like "it is possible" verses "that are a stupid video game" (such as the Matrix). /> <br /> This film is not a brain operation, it is very straight forward. Some things are predictable - such as knowing that someone will be a backstab and someone is dying early. Fairly obvious, but so? The first 15 minutes set our reason, our motive, our main objective. <br /> <br /> I like that Theron and Walhberg had no make-up scenes. I'm glad they didn't go there. They kept it on the funny dialogue, specifically SETH GREENE. The guy is fine! <br /> <br /> This is a movie I would buy if it comes to DVD. It's fun, fast and entertaining. The only thing (and I think it's a big thing) is that we're really angry with the bad guys. This group of protagonists is already on the wrong side of the law. Not a good message for the kids - parents, please explain to them. <br /> <br />
