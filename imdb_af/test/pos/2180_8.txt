FIVE STAR FINAL was one of the best films of the early 1930s. It played Edward G. Robinson and was a very nasty story about a critical newspaper and their willingness to do something ... ANY to sell newspapers. In particular, an old story of an innocent woman is plastered over the pages and now helps to destroy her happy life - many years after she was accidentally involved in a scandal. The reason I loved the movie was that it was unshakable and had no bumps. It just shows how low the publishers can be to sell papers. <br /> <br /> Here in TWO AGAINST THE WORLD, this is a remake of FIVE STILL FINAL - with some changes. Instead of Robinson, this movie is stars Humphrey Bogart and he is the head of programming at a radio station, not a newspaper. Otherwise, the story is essentially the same - except that it's a little less edgy and not missing the grit and sensation of the original. That's not to say the movie is bad - it just doesn't fit as well as a punch as the first movie. In other words, if you have to watch one of these movies, see the first - although this film is powerful and enjoyable. As for me, I loved the story so much, I both watched movies and enjoyed both of them. <br /> <br /> TWO TO THE WORLD begins with the UBC radio owner who complains his program head (Bogart) that all the "high look" shows he is being tackled, gets low ratings. The owner claims mug - lots of candy to get more listeners. One way they talk is to do a dramatization of a famous murder that occurred two decades ago - although the killer was acquitted and killed only in self-defense. However, they decide to play the story as if they were guilty and they even went so far that they both sent a writer to the woman's home, pretending to be a minister (!), As well as her current name and residence. to broadcast. Needless to say, it ruins the woman and leads to a terrible tragedy. Then, and only then, does Bogart feel any real remorse for producing such garbage - leading to a dandy final on journalistic integrity and decency. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, a good story idea and a message as important today as it was in the 1930s, this is one story you should see. Pay special attention to the wonderful and very emotional confrontation scene where the daughter attacks the owner and Bogart. This is one of the best examples of acting and writing.
