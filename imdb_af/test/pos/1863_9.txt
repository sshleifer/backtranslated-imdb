It's definitely a touch movie, and a good expression of Charles Darwin's personal battle. The movie is not just about his struggle to publish his book "The Origin of Species", but also about his relationship with his eldest daughter. His daughter was initially the only person in his family to approve of his views, something she also had to pay for. One more than he at times. <br /> <br /> Now, it's not an evolutionary propaganda movie. I think it seems to be very neutral. A difficult thing to do in my opinion. Of course, it does not condemn the way the characters are treated by the church, rather the opposite. If you need me to use the big words to shed light on this movie; It will be equal by deism and atheists, but will go away from theism. The film talks about evolution, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was incredible. Of course, we can all think of Darwin as the old man with the funny beard, but this movie centers around the man in his late 20's, early 30's. Jennifer Connelly (Emma Darwin) is great as always, but the actor who impressed me was Martha West as Annie Darwin, Darwin's daughter. Definitely on the best children's actors of the decade. The story is about Darwin and his daughter, and it is beautifully performed. <br /> <br /> Apart from a few jumps that were confusing in time, the production of this movie is pretty flawless. Some scenes where Darwin observes are that nature is just wonderful, and is almost like a high-production National Geographic documentary. <br /> <br /> I must admit, though, that I'm not quite sure why they chose "Creation". as the title. I doubt it is an irony, the film is too respectful of it. Well, I'm sure there's also a meaning, don't let that scare you. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 9/10. It is truly a great tribute to Charles Darwin, and please give it a chance.
