What is there to say about this movie? This movie is just beautiful. A real feast for the eyes. Just as the game played the standard for 3D games 7 years ago, this movie sets the standard for future CG movies. Many of you have seen the trailers and the incredible details in each frame, and let me tell you that this movie is not disappointing. You can actually see the fibers in Cloud's sweater vest. <br /> <br /> The music is also very good. The movie features several rearranged tracks of the video game that fans will definitely recognize and appreciate. <br /> <br /> The main weakness of the movie is its story. It's not really a bad story, but this story is only aimed at people who played the video game. First time viewers can sometimes be lost at times, or they may not affect the meaning of certain events. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone, even if you've never played the game, because what we have here is a special movie. Watch it and enjoy the beautiful display.
