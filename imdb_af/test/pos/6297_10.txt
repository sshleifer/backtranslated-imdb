You can tell from the opening shot of the conveyor in the bank that it will be a good movie. <br /> <br /> A touch of minimalism in feeling with a twist of retro, this movie overcoming style - the brilliant camera work, acting and the way the secret life of the protagonist unfolds, complement each other to make it possible the best Italian movie I've ever seen (up there with La Stanza Del Figlio - even if it's different). <br /> <br /> Shame on the people sitting behind me, who made it clear they could not see the relevance of the slow but painfully beautiful scenes made by the camera. Don't miss out.
