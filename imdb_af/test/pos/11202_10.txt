Like all good art, this movie can mean different things to different people. For me it means that failure to open your heart to others can rob you of happiness and leave you with an empty life. The convenience of selfishness is like junk food: it feels good, but eventually you can get sick. <br /> <br /> Almost everything I see in the US is a commercial mass production of action wastes, shallow dramas and stupid comedies, and this sensitive, deep and poetic movie really touched me. Thanks, Nuri Bilge Ceylan (and everyone else in the cast)! <br /> <br /> Ivan Yanachkov
