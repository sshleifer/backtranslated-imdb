WHEN an idea was successful during the "Golden Days" of Silent Movies, you can bet your bottom dollar that it will be repeated; although "Reworking" is the term used. Of course one can argue that this reworking business never left us, because success in the movies or TV always leads to a trend; with all the competitive parties they strive to set up their own version of the mentioned movie or TV program. <br /> <br /> At this last point of view we do not agree completely; because it is copycat or plagiarism, simple and simple. <br /> <br /> THIS, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, had to be well received; For ANGORA LOVE (Hal Roach / MGM, 1929), the Roach Lot has not been repeated, but twice over the next three years. We were treated at LAUGHING GRAVY (Roach / MGM, 1931), which replaced the goat with a cute puppy. The weather is also changing in the death of Winter, in the middle of a snow bath. They also made other arrangements to replace Mr Edgar Kennedy with the landlord Charlie Hall. <br /> <br /> The second rework of the hidden animal premium is the 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP (Roach / MGM, 1932), which replaces a female monkey from a dissolved and unfinished circus, to which Stan and Babe former employees was. The circus paid off its employees with their assets and the boys received the Chimpanzee as their final payday. <br /> <br /> BACK TO OUR original 'victim', today's subject, ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? The short start is simple enough. The boys met the goat on the street and the Nanny came back to their room behind them; after Stan donates a donut to her. The comic moments that follow are generated by the interaction between L & H and their long-term exponent Edgar Kennedy, their Tenant. The impact of the incident is enhanced by the interaction occurring at night. And as luck would have it; their room is right above the landlord's quarter. <br /> <br /> In addition to the noise, the buck of the buck, the smell and Mr Edgar's suspicions about Laurel & Hardy had another person illegally in the room; We were most amused by a little throw-away, which the Censors might have missed too. As they admonish the boys for the noise they made and remind them of the house, an unauthorized person ruled there overnight, regardless of their gender. <br /> <br /> His camera touch is made from inside. room, over their shoulder. With Edgar in the hall and looking at them, he warned; "Remember, this is a respected business!" Just as he says, a lady in evening clothes walks over and behind the landlord; followed by a uniform sailor pulling his hat forward as they pass! POODLE SCHNITZ !!
