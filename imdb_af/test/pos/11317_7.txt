The film is partly a thriller and partly a public service announcement when the events are seen through the perspectives of politicians, terrorists and, of course, victims. In this clever drama lessons are given about pollution and surviving chaos. Meanwhile, the background looks at the way the crisis is managed, and asks viewers to trust and fear guardians. The film, originally broadcast on the BBC, has effective doubts about official preparations. Performances are proper, underestimated, but never great. The movie is just a start, a challenging start that leads to a bigger conversation, but it does work according to me, gives the right excitement and lets the audience reason and ask questions themselves.
