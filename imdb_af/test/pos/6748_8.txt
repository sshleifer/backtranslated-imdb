In the 40's there had to be a sale on this story. An epidemic threatens New York (it's always New York) and nobody takes it seriously. Some may say that Richard Widmark and Jack Palance did it better in Panic in the Streets, but I disagree. <br /> <br /> There is always something about these Poverty Row productions that really touch a nerve. The production values ​​have never been polished and the acting is a bit rough on the sides, but that's why I think this movie and those who love it are effective. Raw, granular, edgy. And the throw. All 2nd stringers or list actors pass their first. No egos here. These people were happy to get the job done. Whit Bissell, Carl Benton Reid, Jim Backus, Arthur Space, Charles Korvin, and the melodious voice of Reed Hadley flowing in the background like crude oil. Incidentally, I was hospitalized several times; how did my nurses never look like Dorothy Malone? In this kind of movie they don't bother much with makeup and hair, but they really managed to turn Evelyn Keyes into a grip. Or maybe they just skipped the makeup and hair. Anyway, this was pretty effective. She plays a loving juggler who picks up a case of smallpox in Cuba, while hiding jewels back for the ultra villain Charles Korvin (who is now serving her sister). You have the Customs agents looking for her because of the jewels, and the health department is looking for her because she wants to depopulate New York. No 4th Amendment Rights here. Everyone gets trouble. <br /> <br /> You should have the right attitude to enjoy such a movie. I have a brother who watches movies after death. If they do not meet his Orson Wellian standards, he bombs them unmercifully. They must have the direct excellence of a David Lean movie, Wolfgang von Korngold's score, the Sound and Art of Douglas Shearer and Cedric Gibbons respectively. It is not so. <br /> <br /> But I have the right attitude, and if you do so well, you'll love this movie.
