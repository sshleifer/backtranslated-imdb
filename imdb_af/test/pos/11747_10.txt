I consider this loving and sensitive written story to be one of the true masterpieces of the screen. After I made this movie, originally on the silver screen with my mother, in Los Angeles, California, when it first came out, many years passed before I had the opportunity to experience it again. The beauty, silence simplified elegance and calmness of the film for me, set it apart from many, many others of its kind. Yes, tears still come into my eyes when I see them, and hear them again in a lifetime song. Maybe still, today is my number one most beloved movie. I hope this classic love story will be enjoyed and appreciated by our future generations.
