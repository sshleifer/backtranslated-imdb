Although possibly the stupidest, most tasteless and violent slapstick comedy ever made, Guest House is also a very funny one. Don't listen to the critics, they have no sense of humor. While the climax runs out of steam (but doesn't vomit), it's still a funny party movie. Seven candles in the eye out of ten.
