As soon as the slow start is in progress, the movie begins and becomes very unexpected. Throwing the ensemble is really good, with Heather Graham perhaps the worst of them. Casey Affleck as her brother is really good and extremely enjoyable if you catch my drift. <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie if you just want good hours. Teenagers should enjoy this movie very much - it says a lot about relationships.
