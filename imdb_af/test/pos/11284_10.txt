A warning for potential viewers of this experimental movie: the nature of the images and effects is such that it is one of those types of movies that really should be seen on film. The digital image-created pixelation sucks a lot of depth and adds a lot of sound to all abstract and grainy film. However, since this movie is not available in any format, make sure you can do it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this outstanding artistic pursuit comes with grace from the guy who eventually gives us the shadow of the vampire. It is a dark and dirty film of the origin of the elements (as far as I can derive from the character names) by a process that is horrible and surreal. Budget is a very good example of what is known as abject art, a stylistic approach that seeks out the visceral beyond the thematic meaning. <br /> <br /> Visceral describes it. Not many things happen technically in the movie, but the levels of emotion you break through are countless. The repetition of some of the images creates an enchanting capture over the senses. The sound editing and counting in particular is impeccable and serves the imagery incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Fans of this movie will do well for the collections of short films produced by Other Cinema DVD, Experiments in Terror I, II and III. Movies like this make me more and more confident that the realm of real horror in the abstract, abject and non-narrative lives, rather than in ghostly stories of ghosts and ax killers. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
