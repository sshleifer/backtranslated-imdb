This movie is a hard to find gem! This is the story of Juliette, a complete cleaning lady working in the big corporate office of a yoghurt company, and Romuald, the president of the same. He does not take notice of her, he does not take any notice of anyone until several concurrently turn his company away from him, all of whom are hit simultaneously. He is lost, no one to turn around and no one to trust when he discovers Juliette. As a cleaning lady, no one pays her attention, so they say and do incriminating things to her that she is smart enough to catch and use to help her helpless and careless boss. The complications are wild, she is not that ordinary, as she looks with five children from five different ex-men who are all still in love with her, and he is not as smart as he thinks he is. This movie does not follow a predictable path and that is what you keep watching. The acting is great and there are also many moving moments along the way. The working class appears to be more skilled than those above them, almost in the same way, "Gosford Park" has shown that the upper crust is not everything, it is mentally obstructed. I highly recommend this movie. See it! 9/10
