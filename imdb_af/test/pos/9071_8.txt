Very exciting, surprisingly intelligent movie about five medical students who find themselves and are revived to share their experiences of death and what goes on. Joel Schumacher leads with some skills - creating some very terrifying scenes as well as extraordinarily beautiful. The visions of death are not what viewers can expect, and that is not what we all expect when we go - thanks to the writer, Peter Filardi, who has done an excellent job doing this story. While the creativity of the story is impressive, the story also has many holes, especially in the logic section and credibility factors. Despite all the Flatliners, a good movie is due to the screenplay, the direction sometimes sometimes very surrealistic and the play that brings together four talented actors and William Baldwin. This core of actors acts and responds to each other very nicely. Keifer Sutherland does a very impressive job as the head of the group - the one who gets the idea of ​​dying and being born again. He also manages a man - a young man - with a harmful, destructive secret from his past. Kevin Bacon is fine as the group's most pragmatic and skeptical. Oliver Platt is really good like the voice of reason and human fears. Platt has some very good lines and plays the paranoia pit. Yes, Julia Roberts is also here and very good. The actors do the best by playing each other and we believe they are such good friends. I was quite impressed with many Flatliners, but more than anything else, the story affected me the most. The scene with that dog wandering around the street is just one of the powerful images that have been named as many of the flashback scenes.
