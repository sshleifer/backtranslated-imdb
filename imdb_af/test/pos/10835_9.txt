I do a thesis on embezzlement of the boundaries: the female cross-tester and use the book as my main text, the remarks on gender and sexual identity, gender and sexual confusion, gender as a performance, gender as fiction, gender imagery, cross-decoration as an erotic fantasy and as a revolution, the effect of the male costume, and so on, much will be appreciated! But a bit of the point did anyone see Sergio Toledo's 1987 film Vera? It's about a young lesbian possible transsexual crosscoat .. I'm dead to see it because I think it will be very useful ... Does anyone know where to get a copy of it? I tried Amazon and some other sites, but no luck.
