The mountainous bushes, young happy campers, a park keeper's warning and a lurking figure. The ingredients are there for an abomination of joy, and director / co-author Jeff Lieberman does enough work to accomplish this. This is a formal forest world scare, but for the most part the performance at the top of the game and the story (which is pretty basic in a cut sense) is effectively told in some realism. Perhaps a little more detail is not lost, but Lieberman's craftsmanship caters for the material's flaws and typical details with rising tensions, naughty footage, and a grinding atmosphere created by Brad Fiedel's very ominous score. Every time that very creepy whistle is thrown in, it has painted a really budding sentence that has entered into the beautiful backdrop. Combatographers Dean M. and Joel King also do a striking job. There is plenty of style in abundance, even with its minimal size and build-up is slow. Sometimes the pacing can be a stop-and-go relationship. It is not particularly violent, but there is still a common streak, even if it does happen from the screen. The latter hunting screens and escalating fear are well done, as the dark has become alive with it a brave killer / s and you get actor George Kennedy riding on his white horse in a slight but wonderful turn. There is a nice set of performances; Deborah Benson makes a strong, brave heroine. Gregg Henry, Chris Lemmon, Ralph Seymour, Jamie Rose, Mike Kellin and Katie Powell make a modest role in credible deliveries. The final climax is quite twisted, but the end is one of those types that make you think? "Is this already?" <br /> <br /> A well-etched backwoods slasher item, which is probably a bit too safe to really abandon it.
