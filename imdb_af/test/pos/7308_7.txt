Norma spent most of the 20's playing beautiful graces, but her first talkie cast her as a scary showgirl in "The Trial of Mary Dugan" and she came with flying colors. Since then, her sweet and delicious engineers have been set aside and she has separated into parts that emit her as sophisticated women of the world or society. "Let Us Be Gay" was previously made but released after "The Divorcee" and was an unusual twist on the upper crust drama Shearer made her own. <br /> <br /> Norma only appears without make-up Kitty Brown, whose main purpose is in life, is to pander her very unpleasant husband, Bob (Rod La Rocque). She hurries to release him to his golf game - but in reality he will see his mistress. When Helen, the mistress, comes to the house for a revelation, Kitty sees the face with politeness, but behind closed doors she is a mass of emotions, and Bob leaves well. <br /> <br /> Three years later, Mrs. Courtland Brown (Kitty) remains as a guest of the eccentric Mrs. Bouccicoult ("Bouccy") (Marie Dressler). Kitty is now a knockout and "Bouccy" has a job for her. She wants Kitty for romance home guests, which in turn romances her big daughter Diane (beautiful Sally Eilers). Shock !! Horror !! - The man is none other than Bob, her ex husband !!! Kitty meets with sophistication and spiritual repartee - "there is something weird about that man" !!! - and no one is wiser. <br /> <br /> The movie then sits in one of those early many "talkies", boring "drawing rooms" comedies. Kitty throws a game about all the men and Bob is desperate to start again. The women have all the strong roles in this movie - men are not dolls. Raymond Hackett seems to be in the movie as an extra butler - "I pass a pillow", "drink me", "move this chair" instead of Diane's ravaged fianc√©. Norma Shearer is of course the whole show, Marie Dressler adds "Bouccy" to her list of eccentric depictions and Sally Eilers is truly eye-catching as the beautiful Diane.
