This wonderful comedy drama cursed the crowd at the Philadelphia Festival in Philadelphia. Stressed by skillful performances by a nuanced film, sturdy performance by director Jeff Hare, a fast paced, and one of Peter Falk's best performances in years, the film appears as a loving tribute to the highlights and turmoil of family life. <br /> <br /> Falk performs as Jewish ninetysomething Morris Applebaum, a very eccentric Shakespeare joint who decides to end his life, but not round off his three grown children and a "big fat Jewish suicide party. don't throw ". The movie beats with indelible happiness. There is Morris's "spooky room"; Laura San Giacomo's passionate version of Morris's cynical daughter; quick-comedic comedic dialogue reminiscent of Neil Simon and Woody Allen's work; the furious timing of David Paymer, who plays Morris's rigid psychotherapist boy; and Morris's patented egg kernels (but be careful, drink them too fast, will cause a nasty brain freeze). It's all embraced in a feel-good, intimate atmosphere that takes place in New York City. <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare proves to be a master of art, playing unforgettable performances from his role and lending the film a joyous humanity. I was fortunate to see a previous Hare movie: the dark and powerful "Perfect Little Man" that spreads Neal McDonough ("Minority Report") as a Los Angeles man in madness. The visceral grit of "Perfect" and the nostalgic breeze of "Check Out" is evidence of Hare's eclecticism and wide talent. I look forward to reviewing his future work. <br /> <br /> I heard "Checking Out" doesn't have a distributor at this point. Some wise companies will do well to pick up this crowd-pleasing jewel, as this is a potential box office titan in the vein of My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Most nobles, this will give people all over the world a chance to experience the joys of this movie.
