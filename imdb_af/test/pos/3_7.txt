How many movies can you think of if you see a movie like this? I can't count them, but it seems the filmmakers are trying to give me a hint. I am so often reminded of other movies, it has become a great distraction. One of the borrowed memorable lines comes from a movie from 2003 - Day After Tomorrow. One rule in itself is not that bad, but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> See the movie! In spite of his falls, there is plenty to make it interesting and maybe it looks smart. While it borrows so much from other movies, it never goes overboard. In fact, you will probably keep yourself off the shutter and drive out the storm. Why? ... Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well. I have never been a fan of Kutcher's and I almost gave up in The Guardian, but he showed up in the good way. Costner wears the movie with the best of Costner's ability. I don't think Mrs. Robinson has something to do with his success. <br /> <br /> The supporting role-players played everywhere well. I eventually had no problem with any of them. But some of these characters are overused. <br /> <br /> From here, I can just pick it up, so I'll wear you. Enjoy the movie, the parts that work, work well enough to keep your head above water. Don't just expect a smooth ride. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, but almost a 6.
