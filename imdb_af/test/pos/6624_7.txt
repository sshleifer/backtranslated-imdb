After watching Ingmar Bergman's Shame, I had a lot of feelings, but I especially felt dissatisfied. I heard so much hype about this movie, but I found it missing. Don't get me wrong, I can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a movie, but as far as depth and emotion are concerned, I wasn't so impressed. I found that the characters are unpleasant and unrealistic, which detracts from the dramatic effect. In addition, the fact that the war was fake made me feel that the emotion wasn't real. Dramatic war movies, in my opinion, are much more effective if events (not necessarily the story itself) really happened. I find it from all the movies trying to show the brutality this one falls in the middle as far as efficiency.
