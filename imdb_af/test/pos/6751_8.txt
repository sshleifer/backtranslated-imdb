I found this jeweler as an extra feature on my Vampyr-Der Traum Des Allen Gray DVD, and didn't expect much from it. It may seem like an interesting short cut, so I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I did. It was really amazing! Despite more than 70 years ago, the animation was better than what is done today with all the computer effects and experience now available. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple - A newly assembled toy dog ​​hears its owners' complainant that he can't afford an orange and is looking for her one. In the process, it goes down in a toy's underworld with all kinds of devastating creatures and toys that nobody else but the devil himself strives for. Who also wants the dog's orange for themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie is ahead but reminds me of a lot of Mad Monster Party? (1969, Jules Bass) - a movie I've always really enjoyed - and to a lesser extent, Tim Burton's animated works-The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993, Henry Selick) and Corpse Bride (2005, Tim Burton). Fans of any of these movies will surely love The Mascot as well. <br /> <br /> Overall, an amazing piece of short animation worth watching.
