Against Deviyaan is a good movie. A very lazy entertainer and a very modern movie for his time in the 1960s. The music and songs are great, although Majrooh's lyrics are meaningless in places. Dev Anand is a terrific star and, as usual, he does justice to his role. Kalpana is sexy and Nanda is OK. Simi is just about OK. The film has a tremendous dialogue by Vrajendra Gaur, who wrote most of Dev Anand's films such as Mahal, Duniya, Warrant, Jaali Note, Manzil, etc.etc. <br /> <br /> This is a story of Dev attracted to three women - the Kalpana, Simi, and the domestic Nanda. He eventually chose Nanda. The story is about OK, but it is poignantly told and the dialogue and songs and the great Dev Anand are the highlight of the movie. A must have movie for all Dev Anand fans.
