Don't you just hate hooks that never look like it? It sometimes takes them a full hour of crimson herring before real action occurs. "Tourist Trap" is not so! If it's typically gruesome slip, you want ... if it's typically gruesome move, you'll get! Lots of it AND constantly from start to finish! This movie is probably the biggest opening series in the 80-year-old horror theater when a teenager, one step after the engine problem, is trapped in an abandoned house and assaulted by a creepy collection of images. Four other slamming lambs arrive at home and become a completely insane maniac that resembles a mix of Leatherface (from "Texas Chainsaw Massacre") and one of those crazy sculptors of old wash museum films. "Tourist Trap" is exciting horror entertainment, with some sincere tensions, creepy images, ultimate weirdness, morbid humor and awesome makeup effects. The plot turns are not always original and the acting is pretty mean but serious, who cares? The fast pacing and groovy killer icon caused this "Tourist Trap" to earn a place among my 5 favorite slashers. A little surprising is the total lack of nudity. Too bad, because all the girls seem advisable and after only 10 minutes, the compulsory line "Who needs a bathing suit?" is spoken.
