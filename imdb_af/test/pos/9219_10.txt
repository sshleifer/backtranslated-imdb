I watched this movie as a child and still enjoy it for a nostalgia factor. When I was younger, I loved the movie because of the entertaining storyline and interesting characters. Today I still love the characters. In addition, I think of the higher-standing plot because I now see morality and symbolism. Rainbow Brite is far from the worst movie ever, and though outdated, I'm sure I'll show it to my kids in the future when I have kids.
