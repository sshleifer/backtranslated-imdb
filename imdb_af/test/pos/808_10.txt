David Suchet, (Poirot), "FoolProof", '03, made almost everything he did or said, a great achievement as a perfectionist. If he had a cocktail, he always had a napkin to blow the excess on his mouth with incredible perfection! You can only see the expressions on the detective's face and see that he never missed an item of interest in the suspect's behavior. The beautiful Falls Colors through the English countryside were simply breathtaking. Megan Dodds, "Bait", 2000, made an excellent performance as a very sexy, wild woman, who was very important to Mr. Poirot could keep it. A very enjoyable movie if you really like David Suchet's acting as Mr Poirot!
