Walter Matthau can always improve a mediocre movie, and this movie proves it. He becomes a very realistic show as a small-horse trainer and single father, not sugar cover of any role. <br /> <br /> He can, by turn, be soft and dull, then with his iron hand to his sons, and we can see the same dichotomy in his horse training approach (we see that he doesn't want his young prospects to race overworked and injured in infancy, but he seems prepared to risk the horse's life when he comes in big time. <br /> <br /> It's just one of Matthau's wonderful performances, and one that I highly recommend.
