This excursion from Knotts includes one of his best sidekicks, Frank Welker. Which makes the movie. Knotts and Welker compete for the laugh and both get a lot. Knotts works for a small "not true" town where the city is run by some of the most ignorant officials. When things go wrong, the city fathers Knotts do the fall. Frank Welker's character has befriended Knotts, and together they stumble to clear the mess and Knott's good name. This film shows the ordinary Knott's deadly character, which has made him known for many years on television and film. It may have been Knotts last good outing. If you have an extra 90 minutes, get a good old-fashioned laugh a great icon, Don Knotts.
