I saw Fame when it first came out. It's about the high school class of 1980, which happened to be my year of graduation. I saw the movie in summer between high school and college and as an artist myself, it's a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The biggest criticism of Fame usually has to do with continuity and there are certainly some story lines that either do not complete or do not make sense. However, these problems are more than the passion and emotion of the characters and the incredible music. <br /> <br /> I saw it recently and was surprised that I still loved it as much as I did. first time. Celebrity is often compared to Flashdance, which I don't think is fair. Although Flashdance has good music and Jennifer Beals is beautiful, I think Fame is much better at developing his characters and the complexity of his stories. For anyone who loves the arts, it's a must-see movie.
