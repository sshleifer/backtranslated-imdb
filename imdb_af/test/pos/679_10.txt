When Ida Lupino appeared in the 30's, 40's and 50's, you guaranteed a great entertainment, even though the picture was black and white. Ida was able to catch audiences and pass them to the end of her photos. In this movie like Mrs. Helen Gordon, "High Sierra", 41 with Robert Ryan (Howard Wilton), Golden Gloves, 40, reminds you how the relationship will turn out and how poor Mrs. Gordon will have a normal and happy marriage with love and true love. If you like Ida Lupino, who can play the role of a criminal in a woman's jail and hated jailer, this is the movie you should enjoy. I really believe that Ida Lupino did not receive the true credit she earned for her great talent in the film industry !!!
