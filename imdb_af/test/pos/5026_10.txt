Honestly, I loved Michael. Although there was a pillow I needed to make a nap, it was cool. I think everyone has done a good job in this movie. and Nora Efron is in my "ok" list of directors. <br /> <br /> It's great to see John Travolta as a angry angel. It's not very often that I see one in a movie. some may call it a boring movie, but I loved it. angels and all.
