This is the fifth part of 'The Animatrix', a collection of animated short films that tells us a bit more about the world of 'The Matrix'. This time they put Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) in a story about a detective hired to get her. With great black and white animation and an interesting story, it is again a great animated short of 'The Animatrix'.
