I saw it when it first came out and saw it several times. I have the DVD. This is one of Drew Barrymore's best works and one that is worth more than once. <br /> <br /> Not popular in high school was one of the things I could talk about in the movie. I wasn't quite as tortured as Josie (during her real high school days) or as Aldys was, but I was never the go-to-the-major party type either. The promo scene was the three popular girls who have victims of their own prank. Josie pushes away Aldys (the intended victim) is my favorite scene and I slapped when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> Today I can still see this movie. this is excellent.
