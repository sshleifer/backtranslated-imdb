ccmovieman-1, as the adjudicator in the New York Times who chose Janis Joplin Big Brother and the Holding Company album for the just released Beatles album was called "White", called either mad or mad. National Velvet is a good movie. Elizabeth Taylor's performance is fantastic, and I don't even understand a trace of accent, much less of one. Her performance is very natural, authentic and incredibly charming. The rest of the role is excellent, especially Rooney and Revere. <br /> <br /> As far as the dialogue is hokey or sentimental, I suggest that cc ate ​​too long on a diet of irony and lost the ability to distinguish true straight emotion and human interaction. There was a time when people were actually thinking and talking. Not that this movie doesn't have a slight hint of its magical penetration. That's the reason to tell the story. One can also criticize the wizard of Oz, King Kong, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, The Black Hingst (the other great horse movie) or a thousand other films for action and dialogue that look richer than real life. No, my friend, National Velvet remains firmly in itself because of his faith, with the tongue not firmly in the cheek. Something that is today 's loaded filmmakers is almost impossible to recreate.
