Hooray for Korean cinema! Last year I saw "Chungyang" and "Nowhere to Hide" and now I get a chance at Hur Jin-ho's director's debut "Christmas in August". The variety of themes and level of achievement speaks highly of a national role-play for discovery. This movie's main themes are death and love. The graceful and thoughtful way in which Jung Won (Han Suk-kyu) deals with his imminent death, and the sublimation of his desires towards Darim (Shim Eun-Ha) from true love for her. I was deeply disturbed by his careful handling of behavior and emotions, which protect Darim from unnecessary pain without rejecting her. <br /> <br /> The success of this type of film is based on the skills of the actors. Han and Shim excel, both fairly expressive but naturalistic. A number of secondary characters, Jung Won's family, friends and clients, are quickly diverted to enrich the story without detracting from the main focus. To live is to love, but all things must succeed. Pain disappears. Life goes on.
