The second episode of the new "Lost" just gives you what its fans lack - a good amount of sounding action. From the very first scene you still see brand new features that you wouldn't want to meet. It is best proven that the series, which introduced its 4th season, is still alive and kicking. <br /> <br /> Although the producers don't surprise us with a few flash forward, returning to flashbacks is more than satisfactory, as it brings shocking facts. The flashbacks suggest a couple of fresh characters, and the familiar people look connected in a surprising way. <br /> <br /> The fresh characters dominate the entire episode and I can't say it does any harm. Their scenario parts and their actors both do very well, giving us an exciting feeling. Just after the episode, you'll realize that the show really needed people. And here they are. <br /> <br /> "Confirmed Death" is full of gripping action and strong written dialogues. I'm sure I'll quote the best scenes of the episode for the long haul - they are just as good that they stay on the spectator's mind. The episode is entertaining, smart and perky. You like "Lost", you have to watch it. My voice is ten.
