As the 70s came closer, rumors in the entertainment industry began to fly over the possible return of Sean Connery to the role he made in 1962. James Bond. <br /> <br /> Cubic Broccoli was asked on the spot in Brazil while making "Moonraker" by the BBC's Barry Norman how he considered the prospect. Understandably, the producer was reluctant to make himself an opinion. <br /> <br /> When 'Moonraker' opened, Bond fans were furious about what they saw as a cheaper character and jumping on the 'Star Wars' bandwagon much like 'Live & Let The' did a few years earlier with the blax exploitation fool. Many people expressed their hope that Connery would return if it only showed Eon what a real Bond movie should look like. <br /> <br /> Years of legal battles followed. The original script, James Bond or The Secret Service, later written by Kevin McClory, Len Deighton, and Connery, has never been filmed and remains one of the great unmade movie busters. <br /> <br /> A new script closer to the Thunderball storyline was commissioned. It was written by Lorenzo Semple Junior, known as the man who set the camp in 'Batman'. He also wrote The Parallax View, one of the leading conspiracy testers of the decade. Connery had a British touch with Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, writers of British sitcoms 'The Likely Lads' and 'Porridge'. The cheerful title was proposed by Connery's wife, Micheline. <br /> <br /> 'Never Say Never Again' opened just before Christmas 1983 to a shower of critical praise; Normal meaningful critics were so ecstatic at Connery's return, ignoring all other aspects of the film. Many used it to attack the Roger Moore series, especially the year's Octopussy. In fact, Octopussy is better in every way. "Never" lacks the excitement and excitement that someone associates with Bond, sometimes it looks like a made-for-T.V. Movie. The story was before and better done in 1965's 'Thunderball', so 'Never' will never be the second best. It was also hampered by not being part of the official series, which meant that Monty Norman's James Bond Theme and Maurice Binder's arms logo could not be used. <br /> <br /> As Bond, Connery is beautiful and effortless in his most famous role. Bond played as a parent, wiser agent worked. Barbara Carrera attracted her best movie as villainous 'Fatima Blush', a lady whose love of murder is such that she later killed (so she thought) Bond. Kim Basinger smolders as 'Domino'. As S.P.E.C.T.R.E. Agent 'Maximillian Largo', Klaus Maria Brandauer gives a cool performance. A big disappointment, however, is Max Von Sydow as 'Blofeld'. The posters made the impression that he would be a great character, and he just appeared in a few scenes. With a stronger writing he could have been one of the everyday great Bond villains. <br /> <br /> "Never" promised to return to the early Eon bonds like "From Russia With Love" but didn't deliver. The gadgets were there but were almost apologetic. Bond's rocket engine was a weary pennant in the '60s. The film tried to compete with Eon's Bonds in terms of humor. Commitment saving by throwing his own urine sample into an assassin's face is a passing moment like any you find in Moonraker. But the nadir comes with the launch of Rowan Atkinson as a bumbling Foreign Office official 'Nigel Small-Fawcett'. He gives a show so terribly terrible, you wonder if he thought he was in a Footlights review. <br /> <br /> Michel Legrand's music is terrible, the man has never seen a Bond movie in his life. <br /> <br /> Although the film was a financial success, it was seen years later, it stands as the worst of the 80's. Connery himself was disappointed about it and didn't react to a movie for a few years. 1983 was a good year for 007 maniacs, in addition to the Connery and Moore movie, George Lazenby came a glorious in the made-for-TV 'Return Of The Man From U.N.C.L.E: The Fifteen Years Later Affair'.
