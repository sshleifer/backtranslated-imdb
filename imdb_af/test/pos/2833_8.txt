... I saw this movie when it first came to my home town in France, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember every black and white frame, especially the blacks, because it was so tense , scary, those who attack the dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, forced prisoners to fight each other by their prisoners, the last battle with the uncovered wagon with the Gatling in it, which is the last battle between Peck and the head and the happy ending that takes my breath back. I didn't see it, and I don't know if it's a good idea to see it again today, it was such a fantastic moment for the kid I was.
