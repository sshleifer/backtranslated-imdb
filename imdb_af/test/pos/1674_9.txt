The minutiae of being involved in performing a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all movies. Then there is the robbery itself, a wordless, thirty minute nail bite that has never been surpassed, followed by what is probably the most outspoken example of dishonesty among thieves if things start to unravel spectacularly and we have undoubtedly the biggest of all hoarded movies. <br /> <br /> It was a tough and unimaginative movie when it first appeared in 1955 and it's just as tough and unimaginative. (It shows some of Dassin's earlier "Brute Force" filth). There isn't a flashy moment or duff show in the whole movie and Dassin captures the area of ​​lazy clubs and Parisian back streets like no other. The last ride through Paris by a dying man is one of the most iconic closing series of any movie. A classic.
