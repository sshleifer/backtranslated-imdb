I would like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movie: <br /> <br /> # 1 Angelina Jolie sex scene <br /> <br /> # 2 Foley artist conquered herself <br /> <br / > # 3 plot was pretty thick <br /> <br /> # 4 DVD includes trailers and chapter stop <br /> <br /> # 5 no animals were injured in making the movie <br /> <br /> # 6 homes on blade runner through the movie <br /> <br /> # 7 burning rubbish bins <br /> <br /> # 8 funny man with no legs <br /> <br /> # 9 Voice overs Jack Palance added a real dynamic element to the movie. <br /> <br /> # 10 Sage recommend, for example: "When you eat at the devil, bring a long spoon." <br /> <br /> # 11 Angelina Jolie was just 18! <br /> <br /> To sum it up: an evening of entertainment is provided.
