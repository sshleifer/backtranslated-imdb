This is the first American movie I've seen this year and I think it will be the biggest because of the feeling. As a teenage singer in America, Aaron was not as pop as before, most Americans I met said his song was fake and he didn't even know how to rap. But everyone, he is a child, how many people can understand him. Being a pop fan is difficult, and being a pop star is harder. I think this time Aaron (JD) showed us something. And I think people should learn to understand each other. At another hand, I like a lot of music in the movie. I remember the first song that appeared in the movie was "Saturday night" and that included Aaron's real live show. And the second one is "One Better", so I think if you enjoy this movie, you might also be a pop fan. Eventually I hope you will have a good time. ^ A voice of a Chinese boy.
