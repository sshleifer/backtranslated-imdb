I watched this movie at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This is the first Indian movie I saw in the Tamil language, and while sharing similarities with other Indian films (great music and choreography, storyline), the director tries more than just to to entertain. The film tells the story of Amudha, a provisional nine-year-old whose parents announce to her that she has been adopted, and thus begins an odyssey that they all tear from India to Sri Lanka with war tear. Beautiful works of art, with terrible scenes of violence, explicitly blend into a point, though it is a simplistic one. Amudha is played by P.S. Keerthana, and she is one of the few child actors I have seen that is premature and yet not annoying. Her charm and beauty keep the film together.
