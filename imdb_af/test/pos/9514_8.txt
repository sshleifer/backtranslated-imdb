Last year I caught an advertisement for JAPAN SINKS in a Japanese magazine, wondering how good it was until I saw the trailer for the movie. It was then that I remembered the English translation of Sakyo Komatsu's novel a few years ago. I did, and it was pretty good, as well as chilling realistically. It's enough to make the reader's fear of news about earthquakes in Japan. <br /> <br /> Now I read the book and see this 2006 movie version (the first movie came out in 1973). And you know what? I thought the movie was pretty good, even though there are big changes from novel to movie (but that's understandable). The story is simple - a large tectonic shift will cause Japan to sink within a year. Massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis rock the country, as fierce efforts are being made to evacuate as many people as possible. One scientist has a plan that can stop and save the land from the landmass, but can it be implemented in time? I saw JAPAN SINKS at Otakon 2007, and while there were some issues I had with it, it took a little too long, and some of the character moments were a bit too juicy. But I was blown away. The mere concept of a whole nation sinking into the sea has been made really real and the effects were the best I've ever seen, anything Hollywood did. The movie also doesn't play favorites with the main characters, and some don't make it to the closing credits. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I'm surprised at some of the negative comments made about this movie. Different opinions, I think. Personally, I enjoyed it. And I read the original book.
