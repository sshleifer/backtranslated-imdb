Good, so I'm struggling for a good documentary, especially when it tells a modern Don Quixote story. A Retention: I met Mark Borchardt in the winter of 1995/96 while still working on Coven. But I'll save that story for later. American film, which didn't start long afterwards, accurately portrays the person I knew, although it existed in greater depth than I expected or believed. At the same time, it is a very funny and very sad movie, and is performed brilliantly. Markus comes across as his own worse enemy: his childlike ambition and optimism - which I admire - is undermined by his apparent artistic inefficiency as well as his bizarre fiscal expectations. But he is also a charismatic man. His loyal Sancho Panza sidekick is equally equal: loyal, as unloaded, to the core. Like Don Quixote, American film offers an often-ignored ineffective aspect of freedom - that people will be drawn to occupations they are not particularly suited to, regardless of repeated failure. It's a good movie.
