Okay, sure, this movie is a bit on the hokey side. It's hard to take characters from comic books and put them in movies with some credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, someone?), But it is trying very hard. I never read the real cartoon, but it doesn't matter, I think. I judge a movie mainly on its merits, not whether it is a faithful version of someone else's idea. (Unless it's a real story-based movie, it at least requires truth and accuracy.) So why do I give this movie a fairly high rating? Because it's trying. It is trying very hard. In my book, this makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> Many films have been made with the main focus of the vampire topic. Everyone seems to be doing their vampire lore, whether it's the cross, the silver, the garlic, the sunlight, or whatever. Some of these ideas are included here. The storyline is known ... A group of vampires conspire to take over the world, with one person (mainly) in their path. Leaves (Wesley Snipes) live for the sole purpose of destroying the vampire masses, which have slowly but surely moved into the world and share it with humanity. For the most part, humanity is blind to the fact that vampires are everywhere around them. The vampires even took families, people who strive to be vampires, and the vampires' dirty work for them to show how dignified they were eventually "turned". <br /> <br /> Now that I think about it, there are many elements of this movie similar to the story of the Roddy Piper film, They Live. A hidden enemy, hidden group of people plotting against them, the battle to save human goods ... whatever is present in Blade. <br /> <br /> The acting is not the best here. Snipes are at best only slightly better than some of its other roles; N'Bushe Wright, a relative, is not bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgotten as Blade's sidekick (he's Blade who is Chip's the Punisher). Stephen Dorff does the best job of the whole role here, as the "main" vampire you just love to hate. <br /> <br /> I don't know, but I just loved the special effects in this movie. From the blood-soaked vampire style rave, to the inevitable battle against the final of the movie, the special effects are not bad. There is probably plenty of blood and gore to go around, but it's a vampire movie, right? The various shapes and forms of weapons Blade use is quite unique, and is not commonly used in contemporary action films. Snipes have more flair with an outstretched sword than he does, says a machine gun. In addition, there are so many more thoughts going to fight with a knife than just blowing someone away. (Unless you're of course Indiana Jones.) <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not the best action movie ever made, but it's not bad either. As a bonus, the musical score and soundtrack are also pretty cool. Tell me, in what other movies can you super drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek? <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
