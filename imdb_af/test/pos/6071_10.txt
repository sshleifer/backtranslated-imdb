I heard a scary about 'The English Patient' and I finally decided to get the CD and find out what the ballyhoo is about. What I found out was a cinematic joy and I have to repeat 'must' always be open-minded. If you are a religious, moral diligence, I'm afraid it's not a movie for you, because you won't see the beauty of this movie masterpiece, as you will continue the moral dilemmas that this movie creates. As I remember right before I watched this movie, I read the review in this site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of that person I quoted saying that the protagonists deservedly earned what they got. Regarding morality, I agree with him, but it's not the way to comment on a movie of this wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I rarely saw such a wonderfully crafted movie. I hear the background soundtrack in my subconscious mind. First, it is a love story and yes it is an extra-marital relationship (moralists beware), but let's not focus on it. Let's focus on how the story is told. It's a mix of flashbacks and the present. She sets off in World War II and tells us the story of a survivor of a plane crash (Count Almazhy played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes) who was ripped apart by a military nurse (Juliet Binoche) in the war just before the end of the war (defeat the ashes forces). The burned patient had a lot of pain in the pain he remembered from the dry relationship he had with an English woman, Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas), who had returned to pre-war Africa. The past and present are so dedicated in the story that you are transported in the story and feel the feel of a first-hand viewer. The places in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and so are the characters. I'm a romantic and not ashamed to say I had tears after it ended. See it with someone you really love. The movie starts and ends with the same shot of the desert where the sand dunes turn and turn like a woman's body and it was breathtaking. The sense of loss and sadness is so overwhelmingly conveyed by the actors that it makes me wonder why God! Why have our wars that destroyed beauty and the most unforgivable of all, the destruction of innocence. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it deserves a lot of Oscars and I will be looking for other works by director Anthony Minghella. It brings back the romance in the David Lean genre of movies. It almost reminds me of 'Lawrence of Arabia' which was also based in the desert. Thank you for seeing people.
