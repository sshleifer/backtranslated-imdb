A bizarre that takes place on the screen of William Shakespeare's tragic love story. <br /> <br /> The Que family and the Capulet family have a long hate of each other, often leading to violence. The hate has something to do with a movie company and the fact that everyone is almost crazy. In the midst of all this insanity, Tromeo and Juliet, the best-known "star-crossed" lovers who face each other for the first time and experience problems when they realize their family's other. <br /> <br /> The movie follows the basic plot of the original play, remarkable, and key zones even use original or near original lines. But the infamous Troma bizarre breaks the film from beginning to end. It makes for a movie that is definitely not for all tastes, but it is still quite inventive. Tyrone (Tybalt in Shakespeare) has a particularly funny death screen. 7/10 <br /> Many different edits and graded versions exist. Each contains violence, curse, drug use and sex, all with a large dose of bizarre.
