Oldboy director comes with this smooth vampire movie. Kang-ho Song stars as a priest accidentally turning into a vampire while being healed of a deadly, mysterious virus. His vampirism and priesthood are in great conflict, but he can survive by robbing the hospital's blood bank and unconscious patients, who may not keep in mind blood. Because of his so-called miraculous survival, he comes into the lives of Ha-kyun Shin's family. Shin has cancer, and his mother believes Song can cure it. Unfortunately, Song's vampirism raises his levels of lust to a height where he can't help, but falls to Shin's young wife, OK-vin Kim. Kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism, and the two become lovers. The movie from there comes in strange directions that I think they should experience for themselves. What really needs to be mentioned is Chan-wook Park's mastery of the theater's medium. My God, I rarely saw such a masterful visual artist at the height of his powers. The big mistake of the movie is that it is a bit incoherent, especially near the beginning. Park is interested in telling his stories mostly in the visual, which can sometimes be difficult. But when it works, man, fly it. The film is also perverse hilarious. The final row, one of the best of the decade, is at the same time heartbreaking and wonderfully ridiculous. OK-vin Kim must become a global star after this movie. She gives one of the best performances of the year.
