It's a classic war movie. One of the best, a sharp feast of flickering lights, harrowing dark backgrounds and helicopter blades that morphing into the ceiling fans. Martin Sheen is a mercenary who has risen to deceive the general, a sadistic dictator out of faith by the great Marlon Brando. Also for the ride is Robert Duvall as a top on top with a love for "napalm in the morning" or at least the smell of it. Dennis Hopper is an edgy photo journalist with a view of the war and his leader. Also in this amazing movie you will see stars like Laurence Fishburne, R. Lee Ermey, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall and also keep an eye on Harrison Ford. <br /> <br /> Behind the lens is Francis Ford Coppolla, which is a film with perhaps more intensity and drama than the well-known Godfather movies. He emphasizes war in its most basic form, which is mostly something you cannot see, you can only feel it if the boat on the river feels the sense of war reinforcement is quite unbearable. The feeling of this is a rather claustrophobic feeling and makes the viewers truly unusual. Honestly no movies ever made me feel that way. <br /> <br /> Criticism is hard to find. The biggest problem for some is that Brando earned tons of money for a ten minute roll, but it is unfair in all fairness. It was well earned money, a physically limited role, a sick man at the time and a role he really made his own. I can't suggest someone better for the role. And if you get the Apocalypse Now Redux version, there are a few extra bits from the big man and I think the Redux makes the movie mile better. <br /> <br /> Final impressions are that if you're lucky enough to have the Redux version, you'll be blessed with a perfect movie with a cool 49 minute extra footage. If not, then you will not be disappointed, this film is the best and deserves a great recognition and a solid place as one of the top 50 films ever made.
