I think it was a good movie. It shows how someone grew up in an environment that created a rich and powerful man, but unfortunately he, because of his ambition and the people around him, led to his destruction. It shows that you cannot trust anyone, especially in a world that is dealing with a lot of money and envy. The character I usually liked was Sebeva. She was another ambitious, powerful and relentless woman in a man's world who loved and respected Kilo. She also knew that the business was business and dangerous. Everything she did was risky, but did the job. She helped Kilo get rich with her connections. Overall, I loved this movie very much and had it in my collection and waited for El Padrino 2.
