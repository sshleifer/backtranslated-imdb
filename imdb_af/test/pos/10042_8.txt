The saving grace of this movie is his humor. Warner Brothers plays their version of General Custer as a cricket, drunk, relentless prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected tribe of idealism; It was Robin Hood again and Flynn grew in the role. All his best actresses used his talent for calamity and comic timing, and that was no exception. <br /> <br /> This is also the benefit of the return of former co-star Olivia de Havilland, despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership; The part of strong Libby Custer is a better role than the sweet love types she has grown tired of playing for the studio in Flynn's later movies. And after seeing the script, he specifically requested that De Havilland be thrown so she could do the right thing. In this final collaboration, she walks into all her significant acting skills that are at heart, basically a romance adventure movie, and reviving screen chemistry. For once, she and Flynn get the chance to develop their characters over the initial romance in an old married couple, to equal winning. <br /> <br /> The Flynn / de Havilland pairing and streak of comedy is what made this film's durability, then most of Flynn's other Westerners - in such a love by the contemporary American public, though allegedly not by their star, has long been forgotten. The action scenes are pretty fluent (despite ironically, killing an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges) and the villains of the play are out of schoolboy, to be the same people who were terrible to us hero on his very first day at West Point, and therefore remains satisfied throughout his career. It cuts off on the roll list, but it's also too morally comfortable. <br /> <br /> It is, however, very irrelevant for a movie that is never more than an exciting piece of entertainment. Sufficiently supported and supported by a strong group of supporting players (memorably Anthony Quinn in an all-but-becomeless role as the Sioux leader), Errol Flynn compares his way through the plot with his usual arsenal: beautiful sheep-like appearance. unexpected sweetness, turbulent twists, flash point indignation, cheerful community and sheer high octane cash. He is a reckless braggart, but you can't help him. And it's hard to get away without the song of "Garryowen" that goes through the ears many days afterwards. <br /> <br /> This is one of Flynn's lasting hits; It also features a surprising amount of good acting under fun, and is a movie worth remembering.
