This movie packs a punch. There are some who occasionally make me think and disturb me. I could see myself in the same trouble - passive so that things could happen around me, not getting up for the right and decent thing, but just trying to avoid the trouble. How often do we avoid making waves or sticking out our necks? How often our inactivity condemns the evil actions of others. We will never join them, we tell us, we admit that what they do is bad, but do we do something about it? <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macey) is a low key, nerdy office worker who paid off his home in Brooklyn, NY in the deviating days of World War II. He rarely gets involved in what is going on around him, never married, socializes rarely, just goes to work and cares for his invalid mother. Then a series of events in his very "white" neighborhood draws him from his peaceful shell in a stream of events. It started as if he was witnessing from his bedroom window the rape of a Puerto Rican girl by his neighbor's son. Shortly afterwards he gets glasses because of poor vision. As he can now see better, he becomes less able to handle the circumstances of his life. The one brightest place is a new love in his life, and he marries and hopes to continue in his normal. Then the virulent anti-Semitism on that street gets him, despite his credibility as a Presbyterian WASP. As things are out of control, he discovers that he has to make an important decision - he takes a stand or just goes away. <br /> <br /> I can't see how anyone can see this movie without being touched and thinking about themselves and what they really stand for. Post-war anti-Semitism is the institution here, but there is injustice at all times and in all places. It is up to the individual to decide where he or she stands.
