I saw part of this movie on the Sci-Fi channel, but the end missed. I bought the DVD to watch the whole movie, and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> A young mother and her two daughters move into a home in a backwoods area that they have inherited from the man, who is killing an illness. It's a lot of running, but the three women make the most of it. The teenage daughter (Scout Taylor-Compton) is warned by a local boy about the zombies coming out at night. She ignores him, but since he has a cute friend, she joins his group. Meanwhile, the younger daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) makes a friend in a zombie girl, her age named Mary. It seems that Maria and several other children died in a mine in 1913 while working as child labor. Now that they are zombies, they attack and kill anyone who is not a relative. <br /> <br /> This movie is directed by J.S. Cardone, of which the previous films include The Slayer (1981) and Shadowzone (1990), two movies I didn't like in the slightest. That is why I was surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. The film was deliberately submitted, which I liked. It allows you to get to know the main characters, most of which are equivalent. Child zombies have been used since George Romero's classic Night Of The Living Dead in 1968. Still, I found the tool-using child zombies in this movie interesting. Cardone seems to have finally found the right font and cast. Only the stereotypical scenes of the teenagers who smoke, drink and make up in a parked car were boring to me. <br /> <br /> Taylor-Compton also appears in the Halloween remake. Moretz appears in The Amityville Horror (2005) and the horror movie Chamber 6 (2006).
