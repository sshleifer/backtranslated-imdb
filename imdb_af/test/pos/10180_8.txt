If one looks at the animated Superman shorts of the 1940s, the parable of the plots can become a bit boring. The adversary is mostly a crazy scientist in a hidden headquarters, threatening the Metropolis with an evil invention. Dead rays, mechanical samples, electric earthquake, magnetic telescope, what you got. <br /> <br /> This one is refreshingly different. The bad people drive around in a car, shoot and bomb, but the centerpiece of the action is the golden train (on which Lois Lane travels, as the only press reporter, it seems). Train movies have their own typical ingredients, from the 1903 Great Train Robbery, and there are plenty of benefits: disconnecting motors in motion, running on the roofs, taking the steam locomotive off the back, fighting with the engineer, a switch turned off the train on a pavement, the fall (of people or the entire train) of a high bridge ... it's all in the few minutes of this beautiful piece. <br /> <br /> But it wouldn't be a Superman movie if it didn't do an incredible performance (in terms of balancing and high-speed placement) to finally win the day. If you're a fan of train movies, don't miss it. It's in the public domain and can be legally downloaded from archive.org.
