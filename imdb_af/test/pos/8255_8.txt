I recently bought this movie on DVD at a discount store for $ 5. picture and sound quality excellent. The film is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank robberies in history. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan, who I admit he didn't hear, plays the lead - Pinky Green. A beautiful young man who spent too much of his few years in jail and now wanted to go straight, but it may not! He depicts an American in England. David Niven plays the main bad man, also with the great charm he is known for. Bad, but with shame if he refuses to deny Pinky, he is a "whack" for the job. Whack, in England, is apparently the fair share of the tasks and not a bullet in the head like American gangster movies! All the supporting role players do an excellent job making a very credible film. <br /> <br /> What may be best for me is that the whole movie is pretty fun and understandable (I often find myself in plot confusion and different characters) without any special effects. NO blood. No violence. Not even a single car hunt! Just a well written story, well done, well directed and well photographed! If I had any complaints about the movie, I would question the music. What is bluegrass music that happens in a banking war story taking place in England?
