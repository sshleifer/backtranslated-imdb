This movie is for enterting comment. It's the funniest movie I've ever seen. The lines, the acting. And the clothes, wow, are talking about 70's. If you ever see this jeweler, buy it. This is worth every penny. By the way, the opening song is cute. If anyone knows where I can find it. Plese, send me an email.
