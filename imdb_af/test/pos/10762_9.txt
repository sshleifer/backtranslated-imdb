A brilliant and sensitive film with intertwined plot lines. As a general warning, the movie turns quite dark halfway through. Suddenly, this is a change that suits the themes of the movie, especially the Ishkanani to the dirty, and (as Fin already said) how each person makes the tribe. , and how the whole tribe is reflected in each person. <br /> <br /> Anton Yelchin (Finn Earl) is spectacular in this movie. He is probably known as Chekov of Star Trek or Kyle Reese in Terminator Salvation, but he's in a lot of movies you probably never heard of (Alpha Dog, which is another brilliant performance on Yelchin's part, House of D, Hearts in Atlantis, to name a few ...) The point is that this kid really takes this movie and makes it his own. Other great performances by Diane Lane and Donald Sutherland are what this film does in a notch, from great to excellent.
