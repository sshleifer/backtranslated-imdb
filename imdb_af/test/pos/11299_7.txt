(The review of the original version of the 1950s is not the restored 1980s). In a country where no one likes the king and no one likes the king, a shepherdess and a chimney sweep from two nearby paintings to life and walk away. A portrait of the king who loves the shepherdess kills the real king and takes his place. A great bird, the wonder bird of the title, acts as a hero of all sorts and helps us two lovers. <br /> <br /> It's a strange foreign movie ... not surreal, very very surreal. /> <br /> The style of the background is very European while the characters Fliescher Warner meet, but early arty Warner of the non-main characters. They move in both realistic and cartoon-like ways. <br /> <br /> It's a strange movie and it takes a little while to get it, but Peter Ustinov, as the bird is a riot, his kids and the puppy are wonderful. There are policemen in rubber ducks and a bear design that makes you smile. <br /> <br /> And there is deep philosophy in the film, about the existence of a world out there ... outside the Metropolis underground city. <br /> <br /> It's a very neat movie. There is something just as strange and unique about it as rewarding you for the whole trip. It's not perfect, but what hell. <br /> <br /> It's a movie to look for. If your local bargain DVD bin buys the Capcom version (along with Alice in Paris), buy it. It should get you under ten dollars, probably about five and the price is absolutely worth it, especially if you realize it comes with two full-length cartoons, two short cartoons and various neat ads and other fun stuff.
