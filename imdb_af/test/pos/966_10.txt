After seeing Big Fat Liar, I think Jason learned a lot more. When he told the truth that Marty was stealing his story, it was like the boy who called wolf. People heard him, but they didn't believe him. No one did anything to help him. Besides, not only Marty's movies stink, but also his advice. The truth is not overestimated. I'm so glad he was exposed to what he really was. Everyone noticed that he had stolen that boy, including his parents. He did not just steal from that boy and lied about it, he gave them someone's job and tried to call it himself, which is plagiarism. Doesn't he know that plagiarizing someone's idea is illegal? Another reason why he was dismissed. He is not trustworthy. He is a liar, a cheat, a thief, a crook and a plagiarism. Do you have that Marty? You're a plagiarism. Plus, you have everything you deserve.
