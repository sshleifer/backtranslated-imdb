I thought this movie was great if you didn't take it too seriously. Just sit back and enjoy Hilary Swank in all her greatness and laugh as the monks go to Boston, MA. I also think this movie has a good message about restraint and inner power. Plus Mr Myagi was so sweet, I wish he would teach my karate!
