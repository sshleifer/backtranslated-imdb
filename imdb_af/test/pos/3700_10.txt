This is one of the best TV movies you can ever see. What's more, the acting, writing and production values ​​are. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo beautiful as the older woman with teenage daughter and Rob Estes, just perfect as the young stud guy. However, the best part of this movie was how it showed the effects of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. It has shown that abuse in good families can occur; involves good people; and wreck life. It's thoughtful and entertaining. Congratulations to everyone involved in this exceptional movie. <br /> <br />
