I dig this movie on a curve, in other words, it's not the biggest movie ever made, but it does exactly what it explains. This is an excellent T & A movie. I didn't have an idea of ​​how many T's or A's were seen in this movie, but I saw one shot that had 16 bare T's at one time, just to give you an idea. There are topless girls throughout the world. There is a wet T-shirt match scene. And the climax involves a football match between two girl teams and each time a touchdown is reached, the entire opposing team loses a piece of clothing. I don't know why it gets so low. Perhaps the people who gave it low scores thought they were going to see Citizen Kane. I love this movie and hope to find more similar. If you are looking for a good camping T & A movie, I would recommend this one.
