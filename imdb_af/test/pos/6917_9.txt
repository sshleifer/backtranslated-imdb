The original story and funny compelling characters went well for a teenage girl, sleeping party movie (2 times now). I loved it, it was fun and moving fast, no boring drawn scenes. It is violent and has a small language (although most of it is covered). It's a good movie. David Strickland was a great actor. Ron Eldard delivered a wonderful show. I look at the girls every time.
