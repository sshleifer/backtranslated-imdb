As a European, the movie is a good blow to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences I have lived abroad and interacted with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982 to 1985, so one would think he was using this experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting how the film balances the message that "doesn't generalize" with the idea that "for every stereotype there is an underlying truth". For example, the Italian character is more based on the pothead aspect than any known Italian stereotype. The German character has some more proven stereotypes. But the most stereotypical aspect of the movie is not a character, but the central theme of infidelity. As a critic observed, infidelity is so important to the French film, as the class is for the British film. <br /> <br /> Both the main character and his girlfriend are not played quite pleasantly, and I think it's deliberate and good. <br /> It may be unintentional, but some of the subjects have elements that can be considered a metaphor for the perceived role of their countries in the EU. The British woman has a finger with an American (who is an entertainer - like an American president of the 1980s) while the Frenchman shows himself as a natural leader (when the landlord acts). <br /> <br /> Although Europe is not as diverse as New York, it is striking that we see only two non-white characters. One is a Chilean woman with indigenous traits, which, despite the age of our main character, is not portrayed as a potential object of interest. Another is a Gambian-Spanish or rather Gambian-Catalan man who invented a little. <br /> <br /> One could ask why Klapisch chose protagonists who were all of the long-established EU member states in Western Europe. While these nationalities reflect what he and I would meet as students in the 1980s, I believe that exchange programs in contemporary Europe are much more diverse. The Erasmus program includes some 30 countries from Iceland to Eastern Europe, many of which are not EU members. However, I understand that the choice of nationalities that are more familiar with the majority of the viewer is considered necessary not to derive from the contrast that Klapisch wants to create between the Europe of the Peoples and the Bureaucratic Europe. <br /> <br /> In spite of a small grip, a big movie that has taken me back to Europe has come to life. A French friend of mine, also a stranger in the US, has caught our shared feelings in this contradiction. "If Europe were more like the US, I would leave a heartbeat."
