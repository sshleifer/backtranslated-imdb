Ladies and gentlemen: The show starts with this documentary film. It is structured in three chapters, each chronologically arranged. The first offers the classic physics and links to Einstein. The second examines the quantum physics in depth and enters String theory. The latter reveals the all-theory ... The difficult concepts used here are introduced in a very simple way with daily objects; although you have to believe it without looking at yourself - if you're not a scientist - (and even if you're a scientist!). The film is not a masterpiece by its fabulous technique or the way it is manufactured; which is really importing is the story, and what a story !!!
