From the set-off I knew it would be a great movie, the pace, cinematography, personalities native to the Dallas area, character diversification, not the director Oliver Stone and of course Eric Bogasian. The film starts on a Friday (suggestive occult in the first place) and starts with a radio station in Dallas offering their number one talk show, The Barry Champlain Show (based on the Talk Radio Host Alan Berg), ... Barry ( Eric Bogasiese) is the villain radio talk show host and his work is such that it is compulsory to feed all the sensational nuances of the radio heard in his performance ... He tries to communicate with a bunch of social disorders lonely, vulnerable, obscure callers who are outraged by the masochistic urge to be publicly publicized, Barry Champlain is effectively dealing with this indifferent soul, by debating them socially rather than simply subjecting them to mere admonition ... New techno logically serves a stigma purpose for the Dallas radio audience, and the main concepts take a backdrop to perversion, talk about "Baseball Scores, Orgasms and People's Pets !!" <br /> <br /> The whole thing is a cacophony of drug-induced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia !! This high profile cannon feeder is something that Barry Champlain thrives on! The fierce patos, the distorted proclivities that deviate from the injustices and puveyors of pornography and the common pop culture problems, serve as fleeting ammunition for Barry Champlain's battered battlefield! <br /> <br /> The setting for this movie is perfect because it has a two thousand foot drop in terms of ideology. In the middle of Dallas, there is an overwhelming sense of cosmopolitan awareness, with 20 miles away being a major chapter of the Ku Klux Clan !! ... The play is based in Denver, which is where the real story takes place, other small plays portray the cities of Louisville, Atlanta and Cleveland. Dallas is the city where the film takes place. I thought it was an excellent choice !! ... This movie illustrates how people have a terrible and flawed and deadly misconceptions of the Jewish people in America, through which they control the banks, their agenda is different from anyone else and their intellectual literature leads to perversion! These preconceived ideas compiled Barry Champlain's overall dilemma !!! Barry Champlain's personal impatience is that he is insatiable and does not respond to his alcoholism, and his oblique and politically controversial character is his ultimate withdrawal. This makes the movie so believable! <br /> <br /> The characters in the movie are well portrayed, Dan, the companion for the middle management hat man (played by Alec Baldwin) who constantly monitors Barry Champlain's movements! Laura, his girlfriend, also his producer, will constantly feel Barry is someone who is always misunderstood !! Ellen, his ex-wife, is a recipient of Barry's anxiety and selfishness, but cannot completely abandon her feelings for Barry, regardless of the path of personal destruction he comes up with! The Dallas Radio is a melting pot of socially-deprived retro assets that are amused by their own real shortcomings! ... In the middle, everyone's hangings, including Barry Champlain's own hang-ups, are what Barry Champlain does! ! His audience generates depravity, looks for relief and eventually becomes Barry Champlain's pet prescribed for sinners! Social culture conflicts are ruining Barry Champlain! <br /> <br /> This movie is great !! In my opinion, Oliver Stone's best picture, including Platoon and Natural Born Killers. This statement in itself tells you how beautiful a movie is Talk Radio. The story of advice and acting and co-producers of Eric Bogosian is simply compelling! The camera angles, the dialogue, the ghostly character depictions, all the best. The cinematography of the Dallas skyline at the end of the movie is great! Dallas has the dubious distinction of being considered a mega-metropolis. So now, like Los Angeles and New York, baby cases are cracking too much to count, low-cost housing districts cut and budget cuts will mean there will be a significant number of people who will be killed next year. .. Dallas claims it is the status of a large metropolitan area, in the unconditional way of the human crisis! The city has its line-up radio listeners who have given an exciting turn to the wonder of nationwide air wave communication !! These are the culprits in the movie !! The ghoulish tabloid derelicts who want to meet the big bad wolf, and their decadent curiosity have wiped out morally "The Last Neighborhood in America"
