This movie launched my book on books based on books: Instead of following the click: "You read the book, now watch the movie." If you are looking for a good book to read, try one on which a movie you want based, as it will be 10 times better. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie at its initial release at the National Theater in Eugene, and loved it so much that I stayed again to see it again. It's a perfect blend of the inspirational talents of one of my favorite actors, Jon Voight, with what became my favorite book, "The Water Is Wide," by Pat Conroy. <br /> <br /> I can no longer think of film about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life. Two small examples: <br /> <br /> (1) The video suffers from pan-and-scan and deserves a mailbox version. (2) The title should be restored to the name of the book, a reference to one of the most beautiful puzzles ever written.
