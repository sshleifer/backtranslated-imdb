It's definitely one of the better documentaries I've seen in family relationships and marriage. For a short while I caught the "friedmans" and have to admit that I thought it was better. <br /> <br /> The story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a good investigation into captured personalities and relationships cold war. Thoroughly save viewer through diaries, family image and post-fact interviews; his maintenance style is sensitive and investigative and his insights are clear and measured. <br /> <br /> 51 Birch Street is a good exploration of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, social decline and potential. for redemption.
