Well, maybe it was because I was in Yangchun China when I saw this movie. Maybe it was because I finally had something on TV, I could understand or at least read the captions, or maybe it was just funny. Whatever it was, the movie was worth the time. <br /> <br /> I just arrived for my foot and head massage when they turned me off so I could watch TV. I would usually turn off the darn thing, but I stumbled upon this crazy movie and cracked. <br /> <br /> The plot if you could call it a plot, revolves around a cooking competition and kind is a love story. and the food in this movie is the right star. If you want an iron chef and many of the other cooking programs currently in reality TV mode, you'll keep the scenes with food in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's fast and the captions are so fast you are better at speed reading for this one. However, the action is mostly slapstick, so you don't always have to read the whole subtitle to get the idea. <br /> <br /> The main actress is beautiful eyecatcher and the main actor is not bad either to watch. They are both worth watching. Finally, if you have time to kill and have a good laugh, it is not a bad choice for both. <br /> <br /> I'm not speaking a word of Chinese, but I was quite able to understand the cultural humor. of this movie. For those who speak Chinese, it might be better. Overall I give it an 8 out of 10 and at the moment I'm even looking for a copy to get while staying in China and stay for when I return home, it will be a good reminder to me of my time in Yangchun and a stupid afternoon at the massage salon watching a silly movie.
