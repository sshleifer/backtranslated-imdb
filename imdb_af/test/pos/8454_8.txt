Bridges' report on a reporter who discovers errors in the safety precautions taken at a nuclear plant is well-targeted and a beautifully interesting late-70s movie. It's not surprising, but she's solid, the acting is pretty good, especially Jack lemmon, but Douglas and Fonda were also good. It was a very good script and Bridges's direction was solid and appropriate. It's certainly not one of the best movies of the 70's, but it's one of the better ones. A good early Michael Douglas movie and Lemmon in his first .--- IMDb Rating: 7.2, my rating: so in simple words, solid but not great ... that's what this movie is, solid but not great. 8/10
