It's an amazing movie that starts slowly. This will lead you to think of it as a typical maudlin family drama. Then, in the second half, there is a plot turn that completely transforms it into a profound story of global scale. <br /> <br /> If you're not used to movies from India, songs and dance routines are apparently vaccinated for No reason, stick to this movie. Starting with the second half, you'll find this movie a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> *********** Minor Spoiler Here ************ * I only have one complaint with the movie. The dialogue at the end (between Amudha and MDS) was very poor and missed the opportunity to bring the war as a force that changed people's lives. It was all implied, but there had to be something about the importance of the fight for MDS.
