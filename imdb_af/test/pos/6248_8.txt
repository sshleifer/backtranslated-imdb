Slausen's lost oasis. . . a place for food, fun. . . and MURDER! After a man disappears on the way to a petrol station, a group of her friends go on a journey to look for him. They come across a laundry museum where they think their friend might have landed. Unfortunately, however, the owner of the road plant has the ability to control his washing mannequins and use it for evil. One by one, the tourists are tied and slaughtered by Slausen and his legion wash mummies. Can the friends escape or will they fall to the same fate as their lost friend? In the footsteps (and upheaval) of the great classic wash films (House of Wax, Mystery of the Wax Museum), Tourist Trap takes the slasher genre to a whole new level of strange and fascinating with its bizarre story and style. As for technological development, action, dialogue, flow, etc. Regarding this, it just seems to be a basic slasher movie. But it goes far beyond it as the director controls the plot and moves it to the supernatural thriller it is. The actor ranges from acceptable (from the lead) to very good (from backwoods showman Slausen (played by Western legend Chuck Connors)). The writing moves well and the dialogue is well structured, but there are some errors in logic, as the film moves deeper into the story. Also, some scenes are a bit silly, like the moaning-mannequin attack on Becky. However, this is nothing that will detract from the effect of the film. As one would expect from a movie about washing mummies, it is full of endless creepiness provided by the mannequins. It's strange that a (mostly) lifeless object can just sit still and be so disturbing in some way. . . Maybe it's the human likeness, or the empty stare, or the fact that you know it's about attacking an attack. . . Either way, the dolls are extremely ghostly and the effect is very well used throughout the film. As far as slashers go, it's one of the best, and it is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Mandatory Slasher Elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: The movie is full of some cool deaths. The gore is not excessive, but it is well done and makes it realistic. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There is an extended skinny-dip scene with the very attractive main females (although 'very attractive' scarcely starts to describe the overwhelming future angel, Tanya Roberts), but It's all a pest because the girls mostly stay under water. However, they stay slim in the film. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): Creepy is just the beginning of Slausen and his mannequins. One of the best killers in the slasher subgenre. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: From the opening scene, the film holds a great blend of the sickness of the mannequins, the fright of the attacks and the strong tension in the stranded situation. . . It's all very well done to make for a truly scary movie. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: Well, mystery wasn't really the point of the movie. . . just the meaning behind everything that matters. <br /> <br /> - Indifferent Dance scene: All these cute girls and not a single dance. Shy. <br /> <br /> Final ruling: 8/10. See this creepy slasher! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
