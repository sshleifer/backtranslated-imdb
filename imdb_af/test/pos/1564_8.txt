A great show by Emily Grace! I stumbled across this movie while watching my satellite list and was curious by the summary of the plot given by my satellite service provider. I was very entertained and much appreciated for the character "Alice" played by Emily Grace. The story told me what would happen to Alice and was not predictable. The overall story was refreshing and has some big dots to the supporting characters. The end of the story ended in a fairly fair manner. I'll buy this DVD to add to my library. I'm a new fan of Emily Grace and I expect a lot to see more of her performances.
