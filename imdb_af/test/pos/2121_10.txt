Went to the Preview Engagement or "Grand Champion" today (Dallas / Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and some other Texas cities). There are so few movies suitable for young children ... but this one is, and it is wonderful. Although the plot is a small "Hokey" (also the name of the driver in the movie), it is a wonderful story for children. And I also enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The movie represents the West Texas rural family pretty well, though it is a little overstated. Director / Author Barry Tubb should get it right, as he grew up in that environment. He called the film his "love letter to Texas". <br /> <br /> Joey Lauren Adams plays Buddy's only mom (Jacob Fisher) and Sister 'Blow' (Emma Roberts). Look at Emma Roberts (Julia Roberts's niece); She is very good and I think she will be in more movies. There are also comic performances by Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, musicians George Strait, Charlie Robison, Robert Earl Keen, Joe Ely and the rodeo legend Larry Mahan and Tuff Hedeman. <br /> <br /> If you have young children or just want to watch a good movie, look at "Grand Champion" when it comes to your city (presumably later this month). You will enjoy it and it will make you feel good. <br /> <br /> I think, since I'm West Texas, I might be a little bias ... no, I'm impartial. That movie is excellent!
