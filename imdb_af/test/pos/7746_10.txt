I absolutely fell in love with "Living in a Big Way" when I first saw it! Reason # 1 is because I LOVE, ADORE, and is a GREAT fan of GENE KELLY. He was such a wonderful dancer, actor and choreographer. Not to mention its extremely beautiful looks and its sensual personality. I love his role in this movie. He was such a gentleman. This movie showed his wonderful talent for acting. I also enjoyed Marie MacDonald. It was my first time ever to see or know anything about her, and this excellent movie also made me a fan of her. Actually, the whole role in this movie was pleasant and wonderful. The humor between the butler, Everette Hanover Smythe, and the father, Mr. Morgan; Mrs. Morgan's courtroom humor, and especially Granny Morgan's immediate attachment, and concern over "LEO GOGARTY." And GENE's number "FIDO AND ME" is rich. The opening dance number with GENE and MARIE is also very nice. I would recommend someone watch this movie. It will last forever to your heart. Or at least it must be mine. And you will fall in love with GENE again. I rate it my # 2 favorite GENE KELLY MOVIE, and I've seen and owned a whole bunch of his movies. They are part of my daily routine! So trust me when I tell you, you will love this movie! Watch it and enjoy!
