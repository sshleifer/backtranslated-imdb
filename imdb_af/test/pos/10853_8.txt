Tipping the Velvet (2002) (TV) was directed by Geoffrey Sax for BBC television. The basic plot is an outdated story for starring, Nan Astley, Rachael Stirling played well. As a teenager, Nan works in her family oysterhouse. Everyone expects her to stay home, then marry a fit man and go to family life. Nan expects it too. <br /> <br /> Everything changes when Nan Kitty Butler (Keeley Hawes) meets, a beautiful and talented artist dressing in men's clothes and capturing the hearts of her audience. The audience included Nan, who is sexually attracted to Kitty, in a way she did not lure her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie follows Nan to London and through her ups (kind of) and her downs (horrible) as a lesbian and sometimes masculine mimic. <br /> <br /> As the BBC is characteristic, every role, no matter how small, is performed by an excellent actor. The BBC has a depth and breadth of performing artists that are truly amazing. None of the supporting actors stand out in my mind - they were uniformly good. Both Stirling and Hawes are wonderful, and their acting carries the film together. <br /> <br /> It is always sad to be reminded of how difficult life can be for someone who does not fit society's shape for what is normal. I know it's not easy for lesbians, even in the US, even today. Imagine the obstacles to love and happiness for lesbians in Victorian England. We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.
