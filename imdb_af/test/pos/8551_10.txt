I was wrapped up to see that many other people also enjoyed this movie. I first looked at it when I was in my early teens and then a few times late at night several times afterwards. Then unfortunately, no more. I'm now almost 49 and wish it can be made available on DVD. Why not? The best Anthony Quinn role, no one could be more suited to the part or parts he plays. I mentioned it to other movie buffs of the same age and unfortunately, no one I know reminds it. As the daughter of a generation who went through World War II and its aftermath (and I am very fascinated by what that generation endured), I think this film gave a wonderful cinematic insight in some of the heartbreaking issues of the day. For classic final scenes, this movie is a lookout.
