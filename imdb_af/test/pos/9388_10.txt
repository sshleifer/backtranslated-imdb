I watch a lot of movies. A lot of movies. To get a graduate degree in film forces one has to look 2-3 dots a day. It becomes very exhausting. Mostly because I feel I have seen it all. So scarce is it when I'm surprised by something, mostly I hope to see something as good as I expect. <br /> <br /> Deathbed is so different from anything I've ever experienced, I actually had to riddle the DVD about his genius. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the play is psychotic. It is structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay outside the frame. It's not like something like Halloween with all its snappy editing and POV shots; Deathbed is actually over dreamy. The most pretentious way I can say this is: it is Samuel Beckett who makes a haunted movie. I mean it's a manic depressive bed that people eat! And fried chicken! Out in the middle of nowhere! And there are leg hands! I can barely express my feelings about this movie. And yes, to keep it will open you to mock. But things actually become the same-y after a while. It is hard to be a cinefile and remains consistently engaged. I can honestly say this is a completely unique movie on and off. From what this is how it is composed. We need movies like these, movies that shake us out of our complacency. Consider it as an existential camp. It's fun and it's stupid, but also brilliant in its strange little way. The worst horror villain of all time? Maybe, but anyway, it's not a man in a mask.
