The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a man of middle age who hopes for a more fertile life, persuades his family to leave their homeland in Sicily, take the difficult journey across the wild sea and live a land whose rivers are thought to flow with milk . In short, they believe that by daring everything for the New World, their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The images of the New World are optimistic, smart and highly imaginative. Silver coins rain from heaven on Salvatore as he expected how prosperous he would be in the New World; Roots and Onions Twice the size of people is seen to be harvested to represent wealth and health, and rivers of milk are swallowed and flowing through the minds of those who are expecting the New World. All these images are surrealistically interwoven with the characters and help the complex realism unfolding for the audience well. The contrast between these images and the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps hope while aboard the ship to the New World. <br /> <br /> The journey to the New World is almost shot in the dark, especially when the sea is storming and people are soon killed. The dark reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey itself to the New World. The Old World is depicted as somewhat needy and primitive. It is shown as Salvatore rudder to sell so little possessions (donkeys, goats and rabbits) to get the necessary clothes he needs to enter the New World. I thought it was quite interesting that these people believed they had to adhere to a certain dress code to be accepted into the New World; It was almost to indicate that people had to fit a specific stereotype or form to be recognized as morally fit. The most powerful image in the film was when the ship left their homeland and sat for the New World sail. This shot shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who are slowly separating, depicting the separation between the Old and New Worlds. This shot also suggested that people be torn away from everything that was previously known, wanted to separate their previous dark living conditions and wanted to enter a world that had more promise. <br /> <br /> As later contrasts how the New World looks visually, the Old World looks dark and dark compared to the shiny but foggy New World. I thought it was especially interesting that the Statue of Liberty was never shown by the mist on Ellis Island, but remained hidden. I think it was a deliberate ruling choice that questioned the purpose of the statue of liberty: "Give me your poor, your tired, your hunger" looks like a joke to what these people should go through when arriving at the new world. Once they arrived in the Americas, they had to do rather humiliating tests (ie delousing, math, puzzles, etc.) to prove themselves to be suitable for the New World. These tests completely changed the perspectives of the Sicilian people. In particular, Salvatore's mother had the hardest time to subject herself to the rules and laws of the New World, which were more violent than those treated with respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would offer, the reality of what the New World needed was devious and rude. Salvatore does not change much different from his attitude to what he feels will be the New World as opposed to what the New World was actually disappointing for him. This attitude is shared by mostly everyone traveling with him. Their character bows are more related to a cherished dream that is very upset and a dark reality to be accepted. <br /> <br /> The film looks a strong comment on the preparation of a heavenly and civilized society. Beauty, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. Adherence to these rules is to prevent diseases, immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. Perhaps it is a comment on how America has learned from the failures of other nations and so purposefully set to ensure that these plagues have not been contaminated and destroyed. Although the rules looked tight, they were there to protect and help the people.
