This is what confuses me about critics and their opinion. I usually record what the critics of a movie say, on most occasions before I see a movie. <br /> <br /> But I saw this one without knowing about it. mainly because of the cast. Kevin Spacey and Don Cheadle are two of the most famous and I think the best actors are alive. and Ryan Gosling is also on a fast ascending journey up there. His reality and humanity that he sticks out in most of his portrayals make the audience truly in character and what happens to him. He is really my favorite actor of my generation. I've always found jena malone pretty cute, since donnie darko, and if she chooses to do similar roles, then I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> Back to my point. this movie really moved me. I believed it. the acting was top class. as one would expect. the actual movie left the audience with the ultimate goal of a good movie; reflection and consideration following the final credit roll. I think I should look at it again to decipher how this film was critically grounded. I know their reviews have to be taken with a pinch of salt. at least I know now.
