Great comedy by Charlie Chaplin. I saw Chaplin's 4 main films (Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times and The Great Dictator), and I think it's easily the funniest of the four. This movie laughed at me more than almost any other I've ever seen. From the opening discretion ("Any agreement between the Great Dictator and the hairdresser shop owner is purely coincidental"). The movie is a nice minute with a mix of wonderful slapstick and verbal humor. And at the same time, Chaplin manages the ills of totalitarian persecution. Maybe a little short on the end and the lasting timeliness of the subject, but easily a 9 out of 10 for me.
