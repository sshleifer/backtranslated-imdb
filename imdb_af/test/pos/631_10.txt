One of my all-time favorite movies. Nothing can watch this movie for the first time. If I could go back in time and delete my memory or suffer from instantaneous memory, I could enjoy so much of this movie as I did the first time. It is still nice second and third time, but I found myself appreciating the humor because the shocks and excitement were not unexpected. If you want to see a movie that you can't really predict the end of the prediction, I recommend this movie. It's cool, shocking, full of stress and there's also a lot of humor to help you out. If you watch this movie and don't love it, I ask your common sense!
