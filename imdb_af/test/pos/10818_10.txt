I saw Bon travel 2 days ago and it was an excellent production. The movie is supposed to entertain, and do it! It emulates the style of the American screwball comedies of the 30's, but Von voyage is more refined. Adjani and Depardieu are simply excellent in their roles. The plot is simple. The movie starts with people who are involved in many situations, who seem to have nothing to do with them. It's very funny how these situations are linked to the movie. It is good to see a French film with this kind of sense of humor. I find it mainly a movie in which love is the main theme. Peter Coyote as the German spy in France once again shows an excellent actor.
