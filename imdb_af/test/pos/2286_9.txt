* Minor spoilers * I just wanted to tell anyone who loves baseball movies, it's definitely in my top three. Only Little Big League and Major League can compete with this one in my mind. I also want to address the authors of this film for creating such a pleasant dialogue !! Without being too specific, I would say that the lines are very suitable for every character. Tom Selleck had no problem creating a realistic character as a ballplayer. His hostility to play overseas in Japan sets the tone for comic but meaningful interactions with his new team, the Dragons. He has to adapt to life in Japan ("First you were, then you pray!") He finally sees his coach and sets his goals to have that one final season of greatness, though in a much different environment than ever imagined! So for any baseball fan, or someone who wants to see a good baseball movie, Mr. Baseball Don't Drop You!
