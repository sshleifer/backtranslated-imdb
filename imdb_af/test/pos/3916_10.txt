OK, Paris Hilton sucks in (typical Malibu Barbie), but the rest of the actors are just fantastic! I watched the movie last night and it completely ran me through the whole movie. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he is just a bait actor. Total hero man. The head girl the sister is nicking (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different from the movies they are out of today, most of them go with psychopath, possessions, ghosts, but here's a theme left over! I got the laundry models in the house completely, though they look so real. I still don't have the twins at the moment, I'm just waiting to get the DVD and then watch it again. Thumbs up to such a great movie! 11/10. All the people who don't like it, don't be bothered 2 criticize my opinion, because most people think it's cool to do so. I also think the Paris scene when she puts on her underwear is totally uncomfortable. Why not just get a dog that loves a cat .. be more entertaining than that. When Paris's death scene came up, I thought it was poor because she was still running, although a knife just got her foot up. Hmm .. interesting. <br /> <br />! CHAD ALL THE WAY!
