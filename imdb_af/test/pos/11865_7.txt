If you have nothing to do, go ahead and hire this movie, it's intelligent, funny, it'll keep your attention for a while. <br /> <br /> I discovered it through channels in a boring Sunday, it was on the cable, and for the faces I saw, I thought it might be worth it, it made me laugh and For a Sunday movie with nothing else on TV, it was OK. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler looks incredible in the movie, even though her acting is not what I expected, it is a kind of bad play and for the rest of the crew I have Reba in her role as a Dr. held. I found interesting that the guy from the sitcom "What I Love You" is playing an almost gay lawyer. <br /> <br /> Like J. Goodman, I found it, as always a very good performance, Michael Douglas plays a small role, but his characterization was difficult for me to identify him. <br /> <br /> It's also a good movie to watch with the company.
