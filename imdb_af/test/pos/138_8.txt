Although I was the only one in the theater who laughed, it was the great pleasure I had of the beautiful shot "Thirst". Although it sometimes seems like the film has an identity crisis and did not know if it was a tragedy or comedy, the blackest of black humor shone at regular intervals. <br /> <br /> Of course, this helped make it the standard of acting actors, was wonderful, and I was slightly obsessed with the sometimes good leading lady, who was elegant, no matter how blood was soaked and malicious. <br /> <br /> I read reviews that suggested this movie was long. I didn't think so. In fact, the last scenes, moving and hilarious (I mean, the brown shoes ....). In turn, one of the best was in the film.
