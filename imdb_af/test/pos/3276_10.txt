I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites, however, are in vain, and Tombstone. This movie though I loved it! It was wonderful! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everyone who played a role in this movie did excellently! I even think it hit both movies somewhere. Well, not really unforgiving, because it was a wonderful movie that these two cannot compare in the long run. I think it knocks out all the tombstone. Both had their strengths. For example, they both have excellent familiar roles, very good sites and very good filming. But in my opinion Posse knocks gravestone in four ways. First, the characters were more unique in Posse. The music was better in Posse. The idea was originally in Posse, unlike Wyatt Earp. And the biggest difference, the action sequences! Oh my earth! Poses were western with very good action sequences. I mean really good! The action was fast. Like contemporary-based shoot-up movies. The action also had huge budget explosions! The fist fights were also pretty good. Mario Van Pebbles was wonderful in this movie! I suggest buying this great movie!
