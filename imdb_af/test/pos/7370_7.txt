This movie has dr. Giggles is upset as the best horror movie I've ever seen. The plot was great, the plot twists were even better and the roll was great. It's hard to believe that they made the most unknown people 8 years ago and they would be big names today! <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. 4 teenagers wreck their car in the middle of nowhere. They stumble upon this campsite and do what everyone who is in an accident should do. Build a fire and tell scary stories. <br /> <br /> 1. "The Hook." Big opener. Anyone who is in High School heard variations of this story on Prom night. But they do it really well in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. "The Honeymoon." OK, it wasn't the best of the 4. It was pretty good and you get a little boob. Emphisis on the word "some." It's just your basic creatures in the forest story. <br /> <br /> 3. "People can also leak." This is a warning story of what is happening in internet chat rooms across the country. This segment alone should be required to look for parents whose children have internet access. <br /> <br /> 4. "The Locket." Now it's the best story in the whole movie. A man on a motorcycle breaks down and goes to this dumb girl's house. Very good plot turn. <br /> <br /> The main plot, "The Campfire" has the biggest and best twist in the whole movie. I will not tell you what it is because I do not want to destroy it. <br /> <br /> Plot: A + <br /> <br /> Acting: A + <br /> <br /> Writing: A + <br /> Directing: A + <br /> <br /> Music: A + <br /> <br /> Overall: A + <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone older than 13 with the exception of "People Can Lick Too." Older whose child has access to the internet, should see this one with their child.
