Is Thursday an original movie? Heck no, but it's great fun! I just buried it on film channels once and it was a nice movie. I did expect a lot, but what I got was some interesting scenes (I really saw the first thing at the convenience store), some amazing stories told by the characters and a bit of the action in the mix. thrown. A few good performances by young actors, Paulina Porizkova, were good and I was particularly impressed with Aaron Eckhart (who further impressed me in your friends and neighbors and Erin Brokovich). So if you want 90 minutes of easy fun, go ahead and check out Thursday.
