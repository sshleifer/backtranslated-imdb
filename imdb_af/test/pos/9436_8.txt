Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) disguises this story and helps smuggle the famous physicist "Dr. Franz Tobel" (William Post) from Switzerland and under the watchful eye of the Nazis. Of course the Allies want it too, and Sherlock is there to help. Dr Tobel invented an instrument that largely helps with the accuracy of airborne bombings. <br /> <br /> Holmes and Dr Tobel return safely to Baker Street, but the scientist would rather be alone, for some mysterious reasons, although he promised the English not to help the Germans. He remains true to that promise, but there are a few desperate moments for Holmes and English on the way. <br /> <br /> It's an entertaining movie and one in which our well-known detective uses none but three different disguise. He needs all the help he can get when he goes against his bow rival, "Professor Moriarity." One complaint: if Moriarity were so angry, he would have done away with Holmes without batting a lash, instead of giving him the chance to escape. It's pretty sad too, if the usual dull dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) rescues his death boss several times! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some credibility issues in this story. but if you can get hold of your brain a few times, it's a fun movie to watch .... and it looks nice, thanks to the great repairs done on this DVD. It makes the old print alive with wonderful visuals, especially the night shots. <br /> <br /> Another note: who did the English captions in this, misunderstood or misinterpreted at least half a dozen words. This is very messy work, and not the first time I got it, I watched the whole series on the restored DVD series.
