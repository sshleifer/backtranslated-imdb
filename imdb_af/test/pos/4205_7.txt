The early films of the Dead End Kids (before being baptized "The Bowery Boys") were all very entertaining and well-produced films by Warner Brothers. Despite the fact that they were quite formal, they still had good writing, which performed well over time. Don't confuse it with the cheap Bowery Boys movies from Monogram Pictures. Despite the presence of Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey, these films were several churches among the previous quality films. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with hard man John Garfield wins the lightweight boxing championship. Unfortunately, shortly afterwards, he was on a drunken binge and was found guilty of a murder he had not really committed. The problem is that he is so loaded that he is not sure he did not kill the man, so he walks away and lives the life of an oboe. Eventually he met feisty May Robson and the Dead End Kids - as well as a lady you just know, his girlfriend will be given. <br /> <br /> Wherever the rest of the movie goes, it wasn't all surprising, but because of the quality of the movie, it doesn't matter. Garfield and the Kids are at their best and this is a movie that is sure to please everyone, but the pickiest viewers.
