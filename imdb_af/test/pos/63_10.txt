It's really a good movie (after he can ignore Blake Edwards Pink Panther references, which he seems to be and is very indecent). July is as usual wonderful - singing and playing brilliantly. I remember it at the Odeon Cinema in the Haymarket, London, with its release. But Julie's non-appearance at the British premiere of STAR! was unlucky and (apparently!) due to the filming of the aerial photographs for Darling Lili over Ireland. A reasonable excuse if she appeared in any of these aerial photographs, but she didn't. Two cashouts in a row ruined her film career for several years. But Darling Lili, just like STAR !, earns much more public appreciation.
