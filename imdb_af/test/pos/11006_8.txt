A documentary about a nomadic tribe in Tibet that goes out to a dry lake to get salt does not sound very appealing. But it's not a popcorn film, but a visual culture festival that takes you into a rapidly disappearing piece of humanity. The superstitions, the epic songs and poetry, the belief of a people who truly believe in their own unique life patterns, is something that the West had in the times of Homer, but unfortunately it is quite strange to most of us in the "developed" world. We have lost the spiritual calm that comes from the following well-established patterns of life, often with serious spiritual consequences in our increasingly helpless society. The filmmakers carefully woven us into the fabric of this substantially poor, but spiritually rich and sly man. And we've seen more than the mall and pop culture. So disconnect your landlines, switch off your cells, turn off the drive lights and sit back and relieve yourself in a timeless adventure.
