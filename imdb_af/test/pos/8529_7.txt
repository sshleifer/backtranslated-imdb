The year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon; two competing Bond films. Octopussy, starring Roger Moore, was part of the official Cubby Broccoli Bond franchise. "Never Say Never Again", made by a competitive manufacturer, is the only Bond movie not part of the franchise, apart from the terrible Casino Royale. His great attraction was that it brought back the original Bond, Sean Connery; his title is allegedly derived from Connery's comment on "Diamonds Are Forever" that he will never play the role again. Some have complained that Connery was 53 years old for the role, but he was actually three years younger than his successor, Moore, who not only made Octopussy in the same year, but made another Bond movie, A Review to a kill, two years later. <br /> <br /> The film is due to settle a lawsuit over Ian Fleming's film rights. It may be unfortunate that the terms of the settlement contain a clause that the new movie should be a repetition of "Thunderball", as it might not be the largest of the Connery Bonds. (A remake of "Dr No" or "Goldfinger" may have worked better). The plot is very similar to that of the previous movie; The terrorist organization SPERTER, working with a mechanic tycoon called Largo, stole two US chiefs and tried to redeem the world's governments by threatening to deploy them unless they received a large amount of money. It goes without saying to save Bond around the world by finding the missing missiles. <br /> <br /> The movie is happy because it's not just one, but two of the most beautiful Bond girls of all, Barbara Carrera as the seductive but deadly Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger as Largo's friend Domino who Bond's side noticed after learning about her lover's evil plans. A number of Bond films have a plot that depends on the hero's ability to win over the villain's mistress or female accomplice. There are similar developments, for example in Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and The Living Daylights. . In the official series, Bond's ally is usually regarded as the female chief, but here is Carrera, who plays the villain, complained about Basinger, who was a relatively unknown actress at the time. Of course, Basinger has become one of Hollywood's biggest stars, while Carrera is one of a number of Bond girls who have faded slightly. <br /> <br /> Of the villains, Max von Sydow makes an effective Blofeld, the head of SPECTER, but Klaus Maria Brandauer was too exhausting and non-breathing as Largo, except perhaps during the "Domination" game, " a more advanced variant of the violent computer games such as "Space Invaders" that were so popular in the early eighties. Brandauer can be an excellent actor in his native German, in films like "Mephisto" and "Oberst Redl", but he does not come so expressively in English. <br /> <br /> One of the film's features is that it follows both the normal Bond formula and occasional departure from it. There is the standard world-in-peril plot, pursuits, a series of exotic locations, glamorous women, sinister villains and a specially written theme song based on the movie's title. However, there is no extended pre-credit range, and we see some well-known characters in a new light. For example, Bond's boss M becomes an abandoned, opposing aristocrat, his American colleague Felix Leiter being shown for the only time as black for the only time, and scientific Q is portrayed by Alec McCowen as a disillusioned cynic (despite his characteristic top class Christian name of Algernon) a clear working class accent. There is also an amusing cameo from Rowan Atkinson as a clumsy British diplomat. Although Connery may not be quite good, as he was in some of his previous films, these changes on the well-known theme make this one of the more memorable Bonds. 7/10 <br /> <br /> A Goof. Rowan Atkinson's character states he is from the British Embassy in Nassau. However, as the Bahamas is a Commonwealth country, Britain would have a high commission in its capital, not an embassy.
