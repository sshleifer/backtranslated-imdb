Brilliant movie! It's a pity to say that it looks like Pulp F to me. But that's how it is with the post-pulp era. Many photos are automatically compared to those for just a gangster movie. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gang members who are family members, look like something from Tarantino, which is a good deal! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is about a guy who is touching Australia, with a hard-gang crime gang, and ending in guilt and depth. To his aid is his late brother (someone recalls Val Kilmer in Ware R.?) To pay off his debt and escape from the gangsters on his route. The gangsters are cold-blooded, but take the time to play chess and focus on educating their children! They also get tea from their grandmother while planning a bank robbery and having trouble with their children during the robbery. Such a humorous gangster flashes with Heath Ledger in good shape (though I'm not a fan), and Bryan Brown in good action as a gang leader.
