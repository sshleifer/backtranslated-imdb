Hello everyone! I went to this movie without any expectation, although I knew Maniratnam would have given an excellent movie! I was amazed !! The background is the struggle between the Tamils ​​established in Sri Lanka and the government. The story is about how a young girl, Amudha, who lives with her foster parents in Chennai, leaves India to Sri Lanka looking for her real mother. The highlights of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and nature, cinematography, editing and all other technical details. Full points for the cast and crew. I have to mention cinematography, as it makes the war feel like you are there. Excellent work! Although the war features remind me of the saving of Private Ryan, such a work was never attempted on Indian screen. Overall the movie is great! A hats off na Mr.Maniratnam. <br /> <br /> Once again, Mani Ratnam proves he is a director who can take the Indian cinema to great heights! I'd love to watch this movie again. An excellent movie and a must see.
