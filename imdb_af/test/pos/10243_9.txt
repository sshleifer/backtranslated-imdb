The storyline of The Milkwoman is a simple one of uninvolved love that remains strong despite decades. Now 50 years old, Minako Obha (Yuko Tanaka) lives alone and works two jobs ?? one as a cash clerk in a supermarket, the other as a milklady, does her daily round on the hills of Nagasaki. One of her strokes is at the home of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a government official who tends to be his terminal sick wife, Yoko (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita saw each other as schoolchildren, but after the death of Minako's mother and Kaita's father, who apparently had a relationship, their own relationship was destroyed. However, in her sick bed, Yoko says her husband's feelings for the milklady are not completely gone, and for Kaita's sake after she died, she tries to make a way to bring them back together. <br /> <br /> While the story may be simple, the emotions it handles and the way they express them are where the heart and beauty of the film lie. The movie takes its time to show the simple daily routine of each of the characters. They are recorded by an old lady writing their story for a book while watching her own husband showing signs of dementia. In the process, it outlines the social circumstances of people from different lifestyles, how they communicate with each other daily, how relationships form and how the past and present can clash. The director handles it wonderfully with a strong structure and visual style. It is only later in the film that the story follows a more conventional and inevitable melodramatic path, as if indeed it is built to adapt the narrative structure of the book being written. It is all validated by the emotional depths that touch the film, most effectively suggested in the exceptional performance of Yuko Tanaka.
