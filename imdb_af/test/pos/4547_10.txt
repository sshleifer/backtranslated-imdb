The primary plus for this movie is the combination of Chris Farley and David Spade. It was the first film in which this comedy duo showed their Laurel-and-Hardy-like sense of humor. Farley's obvious physical comedy skill is perfectly complemented by Spade's sarcastic attack on every situation they find themselves in. <br /> <br /> This movie is separate from other comedy films. Tommy Boy deals with Blues Brothers as a comic work whose individual plays from the plot stem, rather than breaking the storyline and giving the movie an unheard-of feeling like so many other comedic films do. Thanks to the excellent direction of Sagal, every scene is stiff and instantly shaded or immediately the story is told. He is so much to acknowledge for the movie's hilariousness as Farley and Spade. The actions of Dennehy, Lowe, Ackroyd, and many others (see the station-servant 22 miles from Davenport) reinforce the film. <br /> <br /> The movie guarantees multiple views because there are many fine novels on the movie that can be overshadowed by Farley / Spade. <br /> <br /> I believe this movie was made very well and is the funniest movie I've ever seen.
