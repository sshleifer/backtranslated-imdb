Jon Cryer replays his role as a neurotic man in two and a half men, which he has made perfect in this series. He would like to have a good relationship with a girl like his colleague's development, and the tet-a-tet between him and his friend's best friend is pretty funny. Then they realize that they are attracted to each other and start dating. In one of the funniest lines on TV, EVER - I think in the final episode - he and his partner discuss that he wants to introduce the girl. <br /> <br /> Right now, his partner prepares him by suggesting: "What is the worst thing that can happen? She says no." <br /> <br /> Armed with newfound optimism, he suggests keeping his date up. dinner. Then his answer, <br /> <br /> "GOD, NO!" <br /> <br /> I laughed so hard, I cried.
