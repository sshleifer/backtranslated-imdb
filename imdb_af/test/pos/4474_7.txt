The story begins with a soldier being transported to a desert city, and returns in time to tell the story of how he came to this place. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt, but was separated from his unit. After being almost hungry and / or thirsty, he came on a leopard that somehow became his bosom friend. It brought him food and long ago, the soldier had become almost completely wild, so acute was his bond with the animal. However, all things ended and the man decided that it was necessary to leave the butter. A very strange film, well written and portrayed. Beautiful scenery of Jordan and Utah that doesn't always blend perfectly, but cares.
