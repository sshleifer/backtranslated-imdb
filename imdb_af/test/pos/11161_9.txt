Contrary to the previous correspondent here, I thought Shoppen Munich (as announced with English subtitles here in London at the German Film Festival in November 2007) was very funny, very well-written and excellently written. <Br /> <br /> It is quite presumptuous to design a 100-minute movie consisting solely and reluctantly of talking heads. But I think Ralf Westhoff passed with white and Ã©lan. No standard movie devices, for example, a character's soul-leaping verdict with some meditative minor-seventh chord music and long-shot natural delicacies. But when someone said something that revealed their souls - well, we were chased by the man with the timer for another superficial introduction. This is, of course, the point: the quick tick box superficiality of thirty cities, where everything comes to a quick question and answer. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most movies have been split and stupid that our English is ready to laugh at any vague intelligent and unmanaged movie, but I can promise you that tonight (Curzon Cinema, Sun 25 Nov 2007) keep the whole audience with the most happiness. So I wasn't the only one who didn't! <br /> <br /> My girlfriend (speaking German and living in Munich) thought it was hilarious. I (who do not speak German and not to Munich, I think) thought it was hilarious. I would recommend Shoppen (Munich) to anyone (especially couples ...) looking for a clever, witty, original, wise film about the superficiality of modern relationships and the confusion of the generation who feel they have missed the happy Initially in English subtitles. <br /> <br /> NB In the English subtitles in London, the subtitles (which were very good) were completely under the slightly reduced picture, not inside. I thought it was a good thing.
