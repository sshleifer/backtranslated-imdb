After winning a championship fight, boxer John Garfield (as Johnnie Bradfield) celebrates with a drink cheek, leading to the manslaughter of a pushy reporter. Although his manager killed the man, Mr Garfield was found guilty. When the driver dies in a car accident, Garfield's stolen watch, authorities believe the boxer is dead. Another popular man, Garfield, changes his identity to "Jack Dorney" and moves to an Arizona ranch. There, Garfield meets "The Dead End Kids": Billy Halop (like Tommy), Bobby Jordan (as Angel), Leo Gorcey (as Spit), Huntz Hall (as Dippy), Gabriel Dell (as TB) and Bernard Punsly like Milt) . <br /> <br /> Garfield ties with the young "Dead End" boys, sent to stay with sweet "Grandma Rafferty" (May Robson) as an alternative to school reform, of her brother, deceased priest "Father Rafferty". Garfield falls in love with Halop's sister, "Peggy" (Gloria Dickson), who is there to keep the children in the eye. Of course, Garfield's past comes back to haunt him? <br /> <br /> "John Garfield and The Dead End Kids" create beautiful (Max Steiner) music, thanks to effective direction and photography, by Busby Berkeley and James Wong Howe. The story is predictably comfortable, with the Warner Brothers supporters team in good shape. Garfield and the Dead End children are a winning combination; Although Garfield made no further films with the East Side gang, the studio again made him with "Billy Halop" and "Bobby Jordan", almost immediately, for "Dust My Destiny". <br /> <br /> The boxing scenes are beautifully performed. But the most exciting series has garfield and four of New York's "Kids" (Halop, Jordan, Hall and Punsly) climbing into a huge water tank for swimming - which is endangering their lives. Other, more short, highlights include floozy Ann Sheridan (like Goldie), boozy Barbara Pepper (as Budgie), and young Ronald Sinclair (as Douglas) lost at strip poker. <br /> <br /> ****** ** They have me a criminal (1/21/39) Busby Berkeley ~ John Garfield, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan
