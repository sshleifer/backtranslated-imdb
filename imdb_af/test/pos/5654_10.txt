A terrifying masterpiece on the mere madness and despair of the war, Fire on the Plains (Nobi) will not be for everyone's taste: it is a war movie in the probable sense of the term, one that does not overlap patriotism or saccharine sentimentality. Nobi cuts deep, it is ugly, brown and pale as little will ever be done on celluloid. It is war behind the cannons, with no triumph or heroes, no moral victories or defeats to have, just a handful of sturdy and horrific men scattered over a war war land, such as the brothers who flee a great disaster. The characters condemn moral judgment because they are beings possessed by a great woe, a woe that does not allow moral questions. War and survival. To place one's will against the other in a battlefield. Japanese imperial army soldier Tamura is dismissed from his platoon and ordered to report to a nearby hospital because he coughs and doesn't like the rest. of the platoon. He is told never to come back and commits suicide with hand grenade if the hospital rejects him. What this does. The hospital is nothing but a loft made of wooden boards and the hospital surgeon just tells him that if he is able to walk, he is just right. It is in that horrible excuse of a hospital that one of the terrifying scenes of the film is taking place. As the area is carpeted with American aircraft, the doctors and those who can walk and support themselves can flee the hospital and the forest. Moments before the hospital is blown into pieces, the face and cripple of the sick and injured crawl in all manner of attitude, dressed in their sickly white clothes, as if the building is a kind of animal that is spraying viscera and garbage. on earth. <br /> <br /> This is Nobi's greatest success; the sharp and devastating depiction of the suffering of the war in simple but appealing images, without melodrama or pseudo-heroism. Soldiers cross a marsh, walk knee deep in mud, move across the opposite bank and just into a field to hide enemy tanks hiding in the forest. Their lights shine like malignant eyes as they shame the dark. A procession of injured soldiers, dirty and half crazy, cross a road and fall to the ground on the sound of enemy aircraft. Buzzards feast on a lot of corpses. An abandoned village. A mad soldier who believes Buddha is sitting under a tree, covered with flies and his own feces, causing his arm to eat Tamura when he is dead. These are the images that Kon Ichikawa makes for our eyes, ruthless and incomprehensible in their poignancy, but honest and raw. <br /> <br /> Nobi doesn't rush to get anywhere. It is pleased to follow Tamura's journey through the war-torn country while trying to reach the regeneration center of Palompa and to consider the insanity and ambiguities of the war. The movie blows through the sludge of the war grit, slowly and breeding, just like the characters that follow. The last thirty minutes with Tamura refuge with two desert eats eating on 'monkey' is the closest. Nobi comes up with conventional narratives and they are no less powerful. Strikingly photographed in black and white, with great performances from the film, and Ichikawa's assured direction, Nobi is not only among the best war films to be made, but also among the best Japanese theater.
