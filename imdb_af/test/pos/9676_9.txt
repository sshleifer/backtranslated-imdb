Family Guy is the best show on TV. Ever. It did great things, that no other animated sitcom or any show was even close. <br /> <br /> In terms of animated sitcoms, this era should be referred to as "The Era of Animated Sitcoms" because there are so many of them, and almost every one is imaginable on DVD released. There are a few things (ie South Park, Futurama, and The Simpsons). Each animated sitcom has its own style / technique to create humor. For example, Futurama is funny because it always comment or deal with what just happened with humor. The Simpsons is also a good show because it uses the same comic technique and style Futurama, but The Simpsons deserve the credit for it, as it was ahead of Futurama and still stays with the technique. South Park, in my mind, is the funniest show next to Family Guy, as it uses a clever mix of vulgarity and silliness, as it is a technique to create humor. <br /> <br /> Enough about other animated shows. Let me tell you what makes the Family Guy so funny. Family Guy uses a comic style that has never been used for any other show. It uses a technique to have flashbacks after each joke. It not only strengthens the joke but makes it more fun. It also moves very fast. These two criteria make it the funniest show on TV. You have to see the show to believe it, but once you see it, you'll probably agree. (FYI, the two funniest moments on Family Guy was: 1) The 5 minute chicken fight in Da Boom, and 2) The Dick van Dyke spoof in "Holy Crap.") In my mind, Family Guy is also a very modest show, Because while other shows create humor by becoming acquainted with their shticks / routines and characters, most of Family Guy's jokes are based on the simplicity of current events and pop culture. It also shows that Family Guy is intelligent, besides modest, because it shows that the show has insight. And this technique is extremely effective, as they refer to their pop culture references to the particular plot of the episode in which they are found. <br /> <br /> Family Guy can be enjoyed by all ages, because while younger children may not be the pop culture references, they will be amused by the hilarious, stupid antiques of the characters, especially Peter. However, the performance is a bit more vulgar than The Simpsons and Futurama, but it is less vulgar than South Park. So, in terms of vulgarity, Family Guy will arrange somewhere in the middle when associated with the above performances, but it will rank number 1 in terms of humor and intelligence! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was canceled year, not because it wasn't popular, but because FOX changed the time slot, so no one ever knew when it was going. Fortunately, we have the DVD sets (which are sold like crazy) and again available on Cartoon Network's Adult Swimming.
