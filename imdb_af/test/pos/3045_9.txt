I only saw this movie when I was in the 8th grade and I remember having a big influence on it. I saw again a year ago (now I'm 29) and it has moved me in similar ways. It is a great movie that embodies the struggle of "principle against pragmism". Voight's character is the idealistic teacher who does not rely on any psycho-racist handrails of the superintendent, Skeffington, will not participate. That story also embodies the struggle of how older people often change, and more specifically cultural change. Often at the expense of children. When these battles eventually boil, Pat Conroy loses and pragmatism rules triumphantly. Or do this? The children he has to leave are better to know him, more exposed to the "real" world and classical music. The other teacher at the school gained respect for him and he learned a lot from himself. A great movie with a heartbreaking ending. I recommend anyone reading the movie "The Water is Wide" by reading Pat Conroy. It will stay with you!
