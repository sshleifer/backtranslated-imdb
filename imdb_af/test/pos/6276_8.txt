The Jazz Singer is one of a number of films made in the late 1940s and 1950 on Jewish experience in the United States. Unlike Crossfire (1947) and Gentleman's Agreement (1947) who dealt with anti-Semitism, they usually had a musical theater background. These films include The Jolson Story (1946), Jolson Sings (1949), The Eddy Duchin Story (1951), The Eddie Cantor Story (1953), The Benny Goodman Story (1956) and Margorie Morningstar (1958). The leading actors in these "Jewish" films have always been played by non-Jews. For example, Larry Parks played a non-Jew Al Jolson and Gene Kelly played Noel Airman in Marjorie Morningstar. This decision was probably made to address the Jewish theme to a largely non-Jewish audience. The Jazz Sanger (1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a religious Catholic and Peggy Lee was certainly not Jewish, although she plays non-practicing Jews in the film. The clue for her background is when she attends the Golding's family dinner before entering. She says, "I wasn't going to a singer (Passover), because I went home." <br /> <br /> The movie is about an office boy who has just left the service after seeing in Korea. His dilemma is whether it be an office, a family tradition or a singer in the music theater. His choice of theater leads to an inevitable conflict with his father. <br /> <br /> There is much more to this movie than this. This film was made after the Rosenberg trial during the McCarthy whitchhunts and the Hollywood blacklist. That is why the Jews in this movie are shown as good faithful citizens and <br /> <br /> is actually American. The synagogue choir will rather play baseball than exercise. The office friends also talk about baseball in fact one of them is a Major League umpire. The synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and George Washington is reported to visit. That is why Jews are offered as part of American society. No one in this movie has an Eastern European accent. Peggy Lee appears in very few feature films. In this movie you will see her singing "Lover" and "Just One of Those Things" wonderful. Danny Thomas is reasonably credible and he does and sings the part very well. The comic routines could be left out. Yes, the film is slim and sentimental, but it's worth seeing. I enjoyed it a lot.
