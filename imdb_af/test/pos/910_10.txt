What some Hollywood movies try and hardly ever do, somehow create metaphysical connections between people (without being unrealistic), this beautiful movie manages very well (which looks a bit like the wonderful La Double Vie de Veronique 'of the same director and with the same beautiful actress). It's a real movie, which has changed a bit in the philosophy of life - intelligent and beautiful story, masterfully directed, excellent main actors, masterful cinematography. I saw the movie the 3rd or 4th time, and I still think it's one of the best I've ever seen. And if you have to be dissatisfied with the end of 'White' - 'Red' put a happy ending to the whole trilogy.
