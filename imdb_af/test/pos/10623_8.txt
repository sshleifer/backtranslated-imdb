By reading the comment, it seems very nonsense about the emotional banality of La Pianiste. I find it hard to understand given the excellent performance of Isabelle Huppert. Huppert is gripping - she manages the woman on the edge completely full of self-heating and error. <br /> <br /> The film is wonderful and judged. It would be so easy to portray the chapter as a ridiculous figure - for example, look at the scene in the porn shop. Somehow, Huppert can take it down, partly because of her brilliant performance, but also because the director makes her surreal life truly and identifiable. <br /> <br /> Don't ignore this movie. This is one of the most exciting and engaging movies (and performances) I have seen. <br /> <br /> Trust Boris!
