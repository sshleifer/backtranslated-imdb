Gerry Anderson's first live action in the way of a big movie that benefits from incredible model FX work and a good Barry Gray music score. The real-to-reel analog computers, in the distant year "2069" (I think Anderson really wanted a safe date of 100 years later!) Is a nice thing to see like the guru jacket fashions, but " one can easily accuse 2001 of the same offenses, but no one could have provided certain things as they came out. This movie was the springboard for the UFO series the following year and not only had the same FX people and producers, but many of the role players were in that show regularly. <br /> <br /> It's always like an "alternative history" future more than anything else - the "Apollo-like" rocket used in the elevator always seems to be another planet than the is earth. Given the "alternative earth" plot, one would assume it was the feeling they wanted. We end with an end that gives more questions than answers. That because the "other earth" exists, every movement, event and thing is said to be duplicated as it happens on both worlds. As a result, and the sun in between, the two versions of the same person (in this case Glenn Ross, astronaut) can never meet. A complete accident discovered the planet in the first place when it probably remained a secret forever. <br /> <br /> Filming mostly in Portugal with FX work in England, this is a must-have for any Gerry Anderson fan. I've printed the Image bare bones DVD a few years ago, but one hope Universal will release it, maybe extras and even a Gerry Anderson comment.
