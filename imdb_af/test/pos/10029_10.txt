I saw for the first time, "They are dead with shoes on it", about 1970 and although many years ago, this film remains its impression. The movie was good to be excellent and the chief was really heroic. When I first saw this movie I knew that the wisest as well as the only true position was to enjoy this movie as an exciting little entertainment and then some. I felt when I now felt that the Silver Screen did not provide such a true portrayal of Lots of anything. The life of George Armstrong Custer, but director Raoul Walsh was to contribute to the real value that represented in this movie when I watched a semi-documentary with other great directors such as Vincent Mennelli in which these central figures spoke about it. with valuable comments that take a look at the Hollywood mind. This is what I have considered important and it has become very interesting and very enjoyable. There is so much of all the prints with the silver screen and his story tells ability that some of the enjoyment is lost and maybe you would find it too here. Custer ranked 34 in a grade class of ... 34. Many were made from Custer's final class rankings, but of the 68 cadets entered at the Military Academy in 1857, half were already on graduation day, 24 June. 1861, eliminated or stopped. This is portrayed in the film, as the various instructors determine whether a soldier is fit for command and then they are named George Armstrong Custer and there must be an exchange between the two sides and here is where the Sargeant on Duty say in almost a low tone, even suggesting it comes from his accident. "His squadron would follow him to hell." Your attention, Sargeant, reprimands Tape. If I'm not wrong when Flynn appears on an initial battlefield, it admits that Custer didn't immediately see a trustworthy attach√© not just Sheridan, but Hancocks may also spend some time with The Potomac's army. under genl. George McClellan. There is a truth to the arrogance attributed to Custers battlefield heroism, as illustrated in a counter-attack, "Young Custer urged his horse to the forefront and boldly plunged between the stunned Confederates. Soldier, surrounded by rebels, stripped Custers, accepting the surrender of several hostile soldiers, including a rebel captain, the fact that in this action he personally took the first Confederate battle flag by the army of the Potomac was taken. This notable act of courage marked him as an officer of great battlefield promise. "Robert L. Batman-Armchair General. There is a problem here and this is the story and the truth about George Armstrong Custer, the story is good Hollywood entertainment, maybe even great entertainment, but for whatever reasons everything can be said to be change d for entertainment purposes. Although it may be the gun, it might be good to know that Tom Custer would lose his life at the "Little Big Horn", just a few meters from where George Custer had to die. They were brothers and Tom Custer to this day has an honorable distinction to be among a very small group, perhaps there are only 3 others who were twice received in the military career. The list of denials the film shows shows that Custers is indeed an active young officer. He was not at Union forces at Chancellorsville, or for the Fredericksburg case, but he was with them in the Battle of Antietam and at that stage he was actually promoted to Captain Genl. McClellan, but it would not be expensive McClellan soon had to be replaced because of the historical fact that The Army of The Potomac had the means, and the information (which was wrapped around a few cigars was Gen. Lee's intention to make his divisions) and yet it will be speculated that the war was from then on and there had been. But when McClellan failed to act, President Lincoln permanently replaced him and the promotion was lost as a result. Custers' biggest win can actually come at Gettysburg, Pa. His forces, which were an area called Cemetery Ridge at the field in Gettysburg in the summer of 1863, were able to defeat a Jeb Stuart-led cavalry of about 6,000 rebels, but a force of 2,300. I think heroism at Gettysburg by Custer is a few discussions. There is speculation in the movie that Custers' appointment was a blunder. Well, you guess again, because Custer not only had men in his corner, but he initiated a petition to be present at the governor of the state of Michigan which was casually relatively new to the Union. About the reason and where the preparation was to form Cavalry regiments. Although Custer was seriously admonished for the kind of Shenanigan when he appeared in all the Gold Braid, it was not accidentally as you would be led to believe. The truth is being told that Custers defense in Gettysburg forbade Jeb Stuart from keeping lunch at the Union's back stores and actively protecting the flank. This action was on the way and it was time to coincide with Picketts Charge to make the most of success. It was a critical victory and Custer was at his bravest and best. His men followed him to hell and lived to tell it.
