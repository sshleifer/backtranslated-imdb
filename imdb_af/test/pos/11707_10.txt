WHERE THIS: If not for Mick Molloy's work, then for Judith Lucy. She rolls her usual, classic style of unbridled dirt malting and steals the show in parts. <br /> <br /> IMHO: I'm not much of a signature hunter, but I've collected 3. The first is Samuel L. Jackson, the other 2 in this movie: Tony Martin and Mick Molloy. Although Martin only makes a cameo appearance, Molloy not only stars but co-authored and co-produced this movie. I've been a fan of them for many years (apparently I was the only one who laughed at the uncomfortable urination in the first episode of the short-lived The Mick Molloy show), so I came up with high expectations. I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed. With Mick doing a lot of work on this thing there are lots of his usual brands. Phrases like "blow it out of your ass" and "these bakkies are s *** house" are everywhere in the place, as well as enough Winnie Blues to be sucked. It's also the kind of stupid, original story you can expect from someone like him. It's like one of the cliqued, American, sports comedies where they make a baseball team out of prisoners or something. But rather than making a dull American sport like baseball or gridiron interesting, this movie focuses on a sport that is usually left to gray army: Lawn Bowls. But the most important difference between these and other sports-type comedies is that it is really, very funny. What's even better is that even the subject of this movie is a young lout at an old people game, it's never abusive to the elderly, and it never gets sickly or anything. It was just nice at real prizes in 1972. Mick is wonderful in the first real role I've ever seen him, such as Judith Lucy and the rest of the movie, but most of them had a lot of practice. It's the best Australian comedy I 've seen in a long time. Go see it and learn the joys of Lawn Bowls! <br /> <br /> It's a bit like: Major League? <br /> <br /> SCORE: 8/10
