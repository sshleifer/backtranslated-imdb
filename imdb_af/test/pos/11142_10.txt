Unfortunately, I felt that this movie was not popular in Hong Kong at all. For everyone, Chow's fan will die, however, it will be a masterpiece that doesn't eliminate b. It is "Mo Lei Tou" (a comedy style based on unrealistic and ridiculous plot pioneer by Chow) at its peak. The plot is totally 1000 times more ridiculous than any movie you can imagine. The dialogue is wonderful. No part of the movie cools you to stop laughing. <br /> <br /> The plot looks simple but crazy and for you to start laughing. It starts with Chow who has caught a junior magistrate (a damaged one of course) in jail when he helps an innocent married woman, whom he loves at first sight to free her from a murder charge caused by an evil minister whose son was actually the true offender. Chow escapes from prison and runs away as a refugee. He plans to go to the capital to see the emperor and report the conviction. On his way he can pick up 2 beautiful women, one from circus, another one prostitute, while in the meantime mastering the highest skill, and a bad mouth from the thin Mama-san (which is his future in the future). Eventually he could force the emperor to reopen the case by blackmail the emperor he met in the brothel. The emperor made him a supreme level judge to judge the case with the evil minister. He manages to set up brilliant but hilarious plots to force the perpetrator to commit the crime, to execute him while imprisoning the evil minister. <br /> <br /> The stands are really hilarious and ridiculously brilliant. Also, forgetting the tremendous dialogue that contains a brilliant bad-mouth struggle between Chow and the Mama-san, fights between the fat Mama-san and thin Mama-san to inspire Chow to later learn the dispute skills and also dispute Chow and the evil eunuch lee near the end. In addition, some of the screens are also brilliant. <br /> <br /> One thing to mention is to really understand the movie and get 100% of all the elements right, it will have to be a mastery. Cantonese very good. This may be the reason why the early age of Chow film only gets moderate response from the Asian world. However, when Chow movie began to spread its influence over the world, hardcore fans like me found that his movie was no longer as funny as old.
