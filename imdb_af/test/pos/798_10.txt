I really like Traci Lords. She may not be the greatest actress in the world, but she is pretty good at this. She plays the dowdy, conservative, reporter to a "T". It's a great thriller that guesses for a good time. Jeff Fahey is also good as Traci's boss. I think given a decent break. Traci can be a top actress. She is definitely not worse than some of today's top ladies.
