French theater has always been very strong when the time to host historical subjects comes. 95% of the time they never make mistakes. This film is one of the best of the genre, due to the very strong acting of Depardieu and Pszoniak. Wajda's work, as a director, is truly a miracle. Everyone should see this fantastic movie.
