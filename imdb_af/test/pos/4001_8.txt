Chi-hua (Painted Fire) tells the life of Korean painter Jang Seong-ub amid the changing political landscape of late 19th-century Korea. <br /> <br /> However, the themes of this film center are in the process of artistic creation by the fire of desire of the artist and the expectations and demands of their audience and society. <br /> <br /> Jang Seong-UB is played masterfully as a complex character that changes from the innocent excitement of youth to a hardened alcoholic tortured soul. This characterization reflects the young, eager artist who finds it harder to address the spirit of art creation within himself without leaving out creative fire through liquor, erections and desire. <br /> <br /> Although this character development continues, the film is still progressively playing the emotional complexity of Jang in a constantly oscillating way to play the final of the movies. Interestingly, the fitting of the film in parallel with this ever-changing and seemingly wild emotion or fire of the artist as screens is seamlessly transferred from one location to another without any conventional "cues" for the audience that such a scene change will take place . For example, many scenes will seem to change in the middle of the conversation that picks up at another point and place. <br /> <br /> The visual landscape of the film is beautifully presented and also oscillates from sharp (and perhaps dark) black and white scenery. to more colorful and vibrant environments that added Jang's paintings in parallel in plain black ink on white paper or color. Rainbows of color give the film points, as the artist observes nature and especially women who are then reflected in his paintings. <br /> <br /> The theme of an artist's individual desire to create towards the expectations and demands of society originates in the film through various points, including class disagreement, government dominance over the artist, the accepted norms of the artistic elite and the basic desires of the common masses. Instead of creating its own completely original works, Jang finds himself mostly masterpieces of other artists throughout East Asia. The question therefore arises if recreation itself earns artistic earnings. <br /> <br /> I wish I was more familiar with the political events of the period to see how they tied up in the story - but beyond the current role of the Korean government in artistic expression and / or censorship I can't comment. <br /> <br /> In general, an extremely well-activated film and cinematography are often breathtaking. A good movie to watch and then think about.
