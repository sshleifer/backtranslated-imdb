Peter Coyote was the only name I recognize from the list, so I wasn't too keen to watch this movie. The only comment on IMDb was positive, so I watched it late at night. I would recommend this movie as a good night view. It's better than many of this genre. The plot is excellent, the acting is not brilliant, but it is not bad. I don't usually like flashbacks, but in this movie they work. As I said, I didn't get the name of the name, but I recognized Michele Lee, who had a decent, hard-working performance. The woman wanted to stand by her, lying to her. (Was it Knots Landing?) Anyway, she's wearing really well. Note: You may enjoy it more if you miss the first few seconds of the credits. I did and it helped me. When you see the final credits, you get what I mean. The Wayne Kennedy character, which is very strange, takes it to a 7 rather than a 6.
