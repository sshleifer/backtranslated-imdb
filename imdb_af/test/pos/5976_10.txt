I watched this movie many years ago (along with another of Shepitko's films, Wings) as part of a Soviet film series at a local film archive. But none of Shepitko's movies, as far as I can tell, has ever made video or DVD in the United States. Ascent is a good movie by any standard, with beautiful black and white photography, hypnotic direction and actors so deep in their roles that you have no sense just to give a performance. Although the period tells details of Russian resistance to (and cooperation with) German occupation, the story is timeless. Two Russian party parties are captured by the Germans, and the interrogation tests their integrity as well as their courage. I suspect the reason why it was not released by the Russians on the DVD (here comes the spoiler) is that Jewish intellectuals (and not the difficult Russian farmer) are the biased who resist both threats and temptation, worries after his death go, and set a heroic example for the residents.
