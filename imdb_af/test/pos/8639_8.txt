Wow, what a strange movie. It's a David Lynch movie, so it's no wonder it's strange. <br /> <br /> I am telling anyone to explain everything in this movie completely. I can't be done. After some research into my second performance of this film, I know most of the story, but at first glance, and without the help of other reviewers or outside help, it's hard to figure things out. So, if you are in that boat and are confused, don't feel bad; this is normal. Let me just say the key to the movie is Naomi Watts' character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I find the movie fascinating. I love the wonderful visual and rich colors and find every character in this movie really different and fun to watch. The camera work is excellent and the music is creepy, a la Lynch's "Blue Velvet." There are also good sound effects to help with the dramatic scenes. Overall, it is very well recorded. <br /> <br /> Like Lynch's Twin Peaks television series, it was a movie in which the end was cut together. Lynch thought this movie would be long-out of the TV series. When that didn't happen, he cut it off at the last minute. It may be for the end of the confusion and the lack of explanations of characters we see earlier in the film, but mysteriously disappearing. <br /> <br /> The theme of the story is probably a negative comment about Hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are being wasted. <br /> <br /> Both Watts and the other leading lady, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their celebrated lesbian sex scene. Certainly, both women were chameleons, who usually look stunning at other times. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie more on the second show than the first. It's not just a curiosity piece; it's a very interesting movie ..... don't feel silly if you can't make sense of a few things.
