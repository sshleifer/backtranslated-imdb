In 1937, Darryl Zanuck, who recently moved from Warner Brothers production head, tried to get his newly-created company, 20th Century Fox out of the ground and on a level playing field with his old bosses at Warners and the glitter palace at MGM. "This is my affair" was an attempt to cash in on the current success of historic films around the turn of the century ("San Francisco" "In Old Chicago") and in retrospect he passed very powerfully. The plot is fascinating. A problem maker, but heroic naval officer (Robert Taylor), is given a secret commission by President McKinley to expose a ring of bank robberies that paralyze US finances. He finds the gang, but falls in love with their female mascot (Barbara Stanwyck) and has to decide between love and duty. <br /> <br /> Not everything about this vintage film works well, but overall it's a good piece of studio. film-making. The plotgimmick will be borrowed by Kurt Vonnegut for "Mother Night" (the lead role of the book has been brilliantly played by Nick Nolte) and seems reasonably credible, at least within the confidence of the studio. As a fan of old movies, I'm always excited when I stumble upon someone I've never seen before and "It's my Affair" was no exception.
