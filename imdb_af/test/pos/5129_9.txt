I thought it was a very good movie, especially since it was jute to me. I was bored, I got it from the library and I enjoyed myself! I watched it twice in the two days and the more I see it the more I like it. I thought the plot would really be corny, but in the end it could really be said to be true. I love the main characters and I thought they were well thrown and you can see true friendship. I thought they all did an excellent job. The end was good. And you really hate the bad guys and you really like the good guys. What is a movie supposed to be.
