"It's easy to kill a monster, but it's hard to kill one." <br /> <br /> In the St. Thomas housing project and Angola prison in New Orleans is Dead Man Walking the true story of Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), a Louisiana non-sister who was befriended by Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), a murderer and a rapist bound for a deadly injection system to kill a teenage couple? Sister Helen agrees to help the offender and stay with him to the end? An act never before tried by a woman? <br /> <br /> At their first meeting, Poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice is the one who shot both children and asked her for a new trial to convince the forgiveness to save his life. ?? <br /> <br /> The film challenges the audience to devise the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives voice to angry-deprived parents whose children are shot, stabbed, raped and left in the forest to die only ?? <br /> <br /> When approaching and approaching Poncelet's approach, his character is seen as deceptively complex, and he has doubts about the right of what they have done to him? At one moment we heard him sensitively asking a lie detector test to let his mother know he was innocent. In another, we see him outraged to play the victim, blame the government, drugs, blacks, the kids to be there? Poncelet never understood that he had robbed the Percys and Delacroixs so much, but gave nothing more than grief? They will never see their children again, they will never love, to love them, to laugh with them ?? <br /> <br /> In the scenes that lead to his death, the prisoners fall into their terrible facade and reveal their identity? Fortunately, both Sarandon and Penn are exceptional here? Successfully implement a beautiful, tangible harmony of souls? When Sarandon looked at Penn, did her compassionate eyes project with tears? She asks him to visualize her if he dies? "I want the last thing you see in this world as the face of love"? In that moment we really believed that she would be the face of love for him ??
