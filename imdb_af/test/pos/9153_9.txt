And nothing wrong with it! Warmly endorse the comments of boblipton and Snow Leopard. <br /> <br /> I'm excited to find this movie available on American DVD. I only saw it once. I convinced the Goethe Institute here in London. to show it a few years ago in their Conrad Veidt season - and long to see it again. <br /> <br /> Barrymore is denounced when he is busy, as in this movie, possibly because he has a well-known German actor as a foil. And Veidt is such a wonderful playwright (doesn't he hit the nose at one point?) It is one of the main films to link 'Dr Jekyll' with '20th century', 'Grand Hotel' or 'Midnight'. and 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 'or' The Student of Prague 'with' The Spy in Bladk ',' Contraband 'and' Casablanca '. <br /> <br /> See it!
