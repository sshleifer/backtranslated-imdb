The movie itself is absolutely brilliant, it is the mind, that rush that lets you go, just wants to go out, blow your wages and lose yourself. That's what the weekend is about, it's our sanitation where we can come together as one and be ourselves without care in the world. The film is deeply layered and the dialogue in places is just about to befall, especially with Jip. The characters themselves are instantly enjoyable, one is particularly clear in character and his views on what "Star Wars" really is about genius. <br /> <br /> If you ever have an hour to kill before you go out, stick to it, you will immediately feel confident growing, definitely recommending it.
