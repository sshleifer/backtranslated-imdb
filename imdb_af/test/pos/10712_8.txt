Although it was a low budget movie and clearly last minute, it has a certain charm that is difficult to determine. I tend to believe it's scriptwriter-Grant Morris (see Dead Dog), who, despite the twisted plot line, injected a fantastic piece of humor, missing in many of today's box office hits. Definitely a must for a Sunday afternoon laughter. Speaking like a real single girl, and very skeptical, this movie didn't really inspire me, but lit a little flame of hope for a love woman. Not my sweet life, as much as my slightly crazy neighbor's lovely life that makes her hamster sleep in her bed with her. She might find someone.
