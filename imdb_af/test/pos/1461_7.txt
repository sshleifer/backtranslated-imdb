It's a very strange series with Dean Learner. I really didn't understand the guests. I knew they were not serious, but whether they really were them was unclear because ... I think I'm just stupid. I don't know if these classes are a spoiler, but the guests aren't really like Ali g or anything they play by some man I believe. I like the serious appearance of his going. It's like the program that was on a Sunday morning, that I forgot the name of lol. I also love the pack and mustache thing he is doing. It's quite hot. He is insensitive, which is one of the funniest features. I also like the way he has subdivisions of the program. This makes it more authentic.
