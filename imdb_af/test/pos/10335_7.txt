The summer of my German soldier was one of the many TV movies that became a staple of the small screen in the 1970s. Others were Brian's Song, Sybil and Someone Watching Me. It portrays a Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol) who befriended a German POW (Bruce Davison) in World War II Georgia. One of the things the movie shows is that many of the German soldiers were not really Nazis, but just set up. When I watched the movie, I had a real sense of how things had to be in South Africa again; I mean, can you imagine being a Jewish person accused of supporting the enemy? <br /> <br /> So, I definitely recommend this movie. I believe that it is always important to show the things depicted here. Sometimes persuading the movie to be a full-scale masterpiece, but they usually do pretty well. I hope the movie finally comes on DVD. Also with Esther Rolle and Michael Constantine (the "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" patriarch).
