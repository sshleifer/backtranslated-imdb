This is the fourth full-length feature film by Marc Recha. At the third 'les men buides' -Empty hands- I promised myself no longer to cut my ears. But this time, the plot is completely different - a kind of tribute to Ramon Barnils (Sabadell 1940 - Reus 2001) a Catalan journalist. The footage in the trailer is amazing - a shining river bathed in sunlight - and the promise that Marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother - not one of both professional actors - finally convinced me six weeks after his release . Leave yourself in this very unusual road / river movie. Almost nothing teaches Ramon Barnils, but his most poignant legacy: his constant struggle against the memory of what we chose Catalan to forget. "La batalla de l'Ebre" view for the Battle of the Ebro at Wikipedia was not once, but twice lost because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of half-hearted democracy no one has done much to legalize the Spanish civil war and those who fought it. This film is about the lonely people moving around the same places with very little conscience of what happened 70 years ago. This movie is about the landscape.
