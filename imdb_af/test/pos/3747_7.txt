I recently watched this movie at a 3-D Hollywood film festival. It was in polarized 3-D (gray glasses not red and blue). It was so nice to watch this movie with an audience, the pressure was excellent and the 3-D perfect. The performances were on top and it came as a pleasure, the surprising end (which we didn't suppose to share with fellow filmmakers, at least according to the movie cart and poster), cried people with laughter. Today's standards are probably more comedy than horror, but with the additional dimension of 3-D (complete with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen), this movie was an entertaining skirt in the 50-year-old horror.
