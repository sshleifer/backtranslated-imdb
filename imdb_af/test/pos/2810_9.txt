Made surprisingly good for T.V. Thriller. I didn't expect too much from this one, but I'm happy to say it's one of the best of its kind. It's fast and offers solid acting and interesting events. <br /> <br /> The story is addressed from the beginning and with many hits you can't help finding the movie very interesting. <br /> <br /> The background story of Thiessen's character is difficult. but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is worse than her grandchild's stepfather. <br /> <br /> The "alien" concept and its actions are disturbing if you think it is a common disease in society. A serial killer does not respect the community or even his own family and this film shows the disease and crime in a perfect way. <br /> <br /> My beef with the movie was the non-sense situation when Thiessen's character returned home with her terrible husband after being released on bail. At that moment she knew what he had done to his young relative (played by the cute Allyson Hannigan). But it's just the typical Hollywood scene that causes more trouble. <br /> <br /> The climax scene shows Thiessen to her husband when he wants to commit another rape, then she calls the police who arrive in time to catch him. The end tells us that the man was sentenced to prison in real life for 99 years. <br /> <br /> The play is also pretty good, and Tiffany is wonderful and wonderful as always. The direction is also very good.
