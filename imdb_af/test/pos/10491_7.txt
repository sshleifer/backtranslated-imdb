In the post-civil war America, the President (Van Johnson) travels to Dallas and is murdered by corrupt officials and businessmen who are interested in installing the vice-president, who can squeeze them out because of incriminating documents. A Gunman (Guiliano Gemma) convinced that his black friend was wrongly accused of killing the truth. Tonino Valeri directs this fascinating, and erroneous, film which is of course an allegory for the Kennedy assassination. The film could wrongly offer blacks as slaves working on plantations in Texas, but the film is nice and offers an interesting interpretation - that Kennedy's death was the result of a coup that many Americans could not accept at the time. Oswald's murder is repeated here, as the black accused of murder is murdered by the responsible men on their way to Fort Worth Prison. This moment in the film is more melodramatic than Oswald's death, with his various escorts being shot dead over his death before his death. Nevertheless, this is certainly one of the more interesting and valuable spaghetti westerns. A look!
