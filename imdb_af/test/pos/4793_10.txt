The subject of religion in Buñuel films is a point that one should scarcely analyze as an eater of films, as an artist or as a human. One can see a satirical Buñuel in "La Voie Lactée", "Un Chien Andalou" or "L'Age d'Or". Is very difficult and effective in his critic, but if you have seen it then you see a movie like Nazarin. After you have seen this work, you are being questioned about the author. And many have questioned what a contradiction is for Buñuel, but it is better not so named. I think there is no contradiction in his work, just that Buñuel's religious point of view is very diverse than unique in movies. <br /> <br /> This beautiful film is based on the novel by Benito Perez Galdós, who told us the story of Father Nazario. He dedicated a humble, simple life to God and helped everyone. He lived in a simple and poor region. There is also Beatriz, who is an abused and abandoned woman. She finds no sense of her life without her violent, macho man. She has some sort of remorse for him. On the other hand, Andara is one of the cities prostitutes. Father Nazario was stolen again, blaming Andara's cousin. Andara hears it and tries to fight the priest without success, who doesn't believe in violence. That night, Andara finds her cousin actually a thief, she stole her bellboys. Andara fights with her cousin with terrible consequences. With this, Andara seeks grace from the priest. Nazario decides to help her, knowing it can be against his church, of course this thing will have consequences. Nazario has since become a pilgrim. Without anything, even without shoes, but with spirit and faith. But Andara and Beatriz want to be with him and be like him to serve God. <br /> <br /> As the sweetest Buñuel movie I've seen so far, it's also the most spiritual. It is clear here that the thing most people confuse is that there is no Buñuel against the power of the church, we see a Buñuel whose film is about the church, but not on the typical - and big - satirical way. The more it is, I don't think the right word is contradictory. I find it really enjoyable and well done and despite such religious issues (if she's "Voie Lactée") I found it more a spiritual movie, but don't try to touch the diversity of Catholic religion as he might touch, and laugh at other movies. "Nazarin" is from Father Nazario and his perspective before God and the same religion, but it is all at the end, analyzed in the spiritual life of this man. <br /> <br /> The other two women are not a contrast, but also very good two other perspectives of faith. First, we first beat Beatriz, the abused woman, who has lost all faith, with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family. This girl was very sick. To her was Andara, the prostitute who ran out of justice. In the family of the child, only religious women, there is great pain, but faith in Father Nazario when he comes to this town with nothing. He blesses the child, a saying later she is good. The priest wants to walk, but Beatriz and Andara have restored faith and want to dedicate their lives to God with Father Nazario. After a few complaints, Father Nazario decides to be with them, and in some way discovering how he feels about faith, God, religion and the essential person, the people who have to ask for charity to survive. This last issue should then end up as one possible explanation for the pineapple. It ends up listening to the drums (similar to those in L'Age d'Or) and a father Nazario, asking for these things, when he first refuses the fruit and eventually decides it as a symbol of necessity or perhaps in response to his spiritual path that priest is beginning. Meanwhile, the father's two wives should take Andara away for his crime. (Beautiful scene where she resigns a man who helps Father Nazario in jail and then condemns the man who strikes the priest in jail) and Beatriz because she prefers to be with her macho man, despite being badly treated, just because she did not accept that she fell in love with the priest. here is perhaps the unique place in the film to criticize church walking to contradict the church, the religion it serves. <br /> <br /> Father Nazario is a (soft for many, but not for me) critic of something in religion (Father Nazario helps a woman guilty of a crime, of a sin But above all, one of Buñuel's analysis of faith and life, and he really got it, with a beautiful, soft, sweet and memorable movie, is without a doubt one of his best. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the errors ... Well, if any.
