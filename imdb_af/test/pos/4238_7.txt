It's a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. It's a John Hughes movie that meets the devil's rejections. I really enjoyed this movie and it really looks like the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany very well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes really made this movie again. Actually, these are the only good parts of the movie. I was rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable's scenes. It's as if they were thrown there as a pavement and someone to save the day. But Chucky and Tiffany were great to watch and I really liked the black humor of it. I thought it showed the movie. If you want one hell of a good time, you should definitely check it out. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
