Made from the 600 or so Spaghetti Westerns, it must be in the top twenty somewhere. Can't believe it didn't receive reviews! Gemma is excellent in this. Johnson is also good, even though his shortened voice is a bit of a killer, but it is the charm of Italian style. Beautiful photography and some great action. All the supporting characters are played well. The seriousness of the racist streak in the bad guys is pretty tough, even according to today's standards, creating an emotional depth to Gemmas character in some of the situations that occur. Absolutely fantastic score by Luis Bacalov. See it in the wonderful Wide Screen DVD from Japan. Must have a spaghetti.
