Well, don't think anything deep. Most of the battle scenes are pretty decent. The two front ladies are very encouraging, but their lack of HK action background sometimes shows. The end might have something, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. The cheesy humor is not likely to appeal to anyone who hasn't watched a lot of HK movies, but if you look at that kind of thing and have a few hours to fill with something meaningless, you can do much worse than this. (OK so you can do better, but .......) <br /> <br /> Certainly on the same scale as most of the Hollywood solid action drives. <br /> <br /> 7/10
