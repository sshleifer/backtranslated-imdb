I'm surprised at the number of negative reviews on this movie. If you don't want this movie for what it is - a stupid, over-the-top, mob story - then you just read too much in it. This film is a classic story of a gangster trying to escape life and the problems that follow her. Michelle Pfeiffer is a great 80's jersey, which is an uncertain, uncomfortable gangster, while Matthew Modine is an anal, exciting gang policeman who falls for her. The plot is mostly predictable and cutesy and Mercedes Ruel steals the show as the Queen of Mob Wives. If you're not too dynamic and complex, this movie is absolutely entertaining and an 80-year-old cult class. You won't stop watching if you start.
