John Travolta was excellent as Michael in the movie with the same name. I don't think a better portrayal could have been done. The movie was funny but touched. Michael is a very "human angel" (if they are). Andie MacDowell is wonderful in her role as a reporter as she goes from unbelief to faith. Bill Hurt and Robert Pastorelli are great as fellow reporters, each one bent to prove the angel's hoax on earth. Every supportive role is wonderful, especially the older woman (I don't know her nickname), which Michael's mom plays! One of the cutest movies I've seen for years. I could see this movie dozens of times!
