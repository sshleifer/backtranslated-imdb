I saw it briefly when I bought a random DVD short film. this is the only short on the DVD i liked, but i don't just love it, i love it. If you spend any time with me, you will see it. It's beautiful, simple and passionate, no bells, no whistles - it can be done with a sharpie (but don't make me wrong, the animation is elegant and informative - this person spends a lot of time with cats - but it is just black and white) and then there is writing and the music ... it's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> I eat chocolate, drink wine and watch it over and over ... <br /> <br /> nothing else, I'm waiting for Pedro Serrazina to do something else.
