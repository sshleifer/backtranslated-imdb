Best of all, a high-gloss big-screen soap opera follows the careers of four career women, Hope Lange, Suzy Parker, Diane Baker and Martha Hyer at a New York publishing house. What is best for some women is not necessarily the best for everyone. <br /> <br /> The chairman of this group of young foals is sensible old mare Joan Crawford who was on screen and in real life a few times. She looks right at home, as the boss lady must be. <br /> <br /> Around the time she made the best of everything. Joan Crawford became a widow when her fourth husband, Alfred Steele, died. It was a particularly traumatic event for her, she woke up one morning and found him dead in bed next to her. She inherited all of his supplies in Pepsi Cola, where he was the chairman of the board, and in the same period as best of all, she left the queen's home at Pepsi Cola. Living afterwards sometimes art. So the authority as she dictates and really makes coffee orders to Hope Lange rings. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the women here except Lange are in for a while. It's also rough for Lange, but she literally makes the best of everything. <br /> <br /> What a collection of stinkers are the men in this movie. The best of them, Stephen Boyd, is a heavy drinker. The other Louis Jourdan, Robert Evans, and Brett Halsey, are so slim a collection of rodents as ever collected for one movie. <br /> <br /> I also can't forget Brian Aherne, who is the dressed head of this publishing firm. Half of the office will have sexual harassment packs today. <br /> <br /> Some nice New York place shots in the fifties make the movie a real surprise. Capture it in all respects.
