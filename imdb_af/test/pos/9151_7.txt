Most of the silent movies I saw were serious in nature, so it was nice to see one with a comic touch. The institution and some of the screens for "The Beloved Rogue" were reminiscent of 1923's "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" in relation to the Paris Street Scenes and the celebration of the "King of Fools". John Barrymore portrays France's greatest poet Francois Villon in a characterization that is fairly wide from virtual slapstick to romantic tender; It's a little amusing. It seems that those times never change, and it is interesting to see that the movie makes an acting observation, almost a century ago. Paris has it foolish to rule for one night, while everywhere else one has. How true. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Conrad Veidt in the movie was a bit surprising for this viewer. I saw him as Major Strasser in "Casablanca", strangely one of his very last movies. As King Louis XI, he is a monarch who is obsessed with astrology, clever, but suspicious, and it was a little stupid to see how he now saw the Brad Dourif's Wormtounge character from the last chapter of the "Lord Of The Rings' trilogy looked like. The trust that a King of France may expect will not be so. Therefore, the rise of Burgundy's duke (Lawson Butt) has become increasingly likely until Villon has the opportunity to leave one of the two rulers. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting that using inter-title cards was a great savings, only when absolutely necessary to promote the story. Without them, you would have missed a funny nugget. Villon seems to have left his exile from Paris in the Hostel of the Lame Flea! <br /> <br /> The print edition was of exceptional quality, the first film to be presented in a hundred Action and Suspense movie DVD set by Mill Creek Entertainment, says something for a movie now eighty years old. is. It's wonderful that movies from the silent era are now finding a wider distribution in this kind of commercial format, making them accessible to a whole new generation of movie lovers. <br /> <br /> One question looked like Conrad Veidt's King Louis purposely picked up his nose, or an unintentional gesture that simply stayed out of the cutting room?
