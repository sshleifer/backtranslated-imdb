I've been reading Jane Austen's novels once a year since I was 9 years old and I received the Modern Library edition of her collected works as a birthday gift. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie for his romance and for the music that stayed in my head. It was, of course, an interpretation, not an Emma or a Sense and Sensibility, but something other than Catherine's own love. And oh to love this passionate Henry! It was the Henry of Catherine's imagination, and she is the romantic heroine she has read in her novels and which we promised by practitioner Jane Austen, who told us in the beginning that the improbable Qatar is indeed one. I wonder if Jane was completely satirical in her novel. Maybe she could also suggest such a Henry. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the movie in many years, at least a decade. But I've longed for it.
