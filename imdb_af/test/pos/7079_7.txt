I loved this movie. To be very fair, the movie starts very slowly, with none of the characters terribly sympathetic. It remains so for a good half of the movie. <br /> <br /> But if you're patient, you'll be rewarded a lot. What the first half of the film does not have in character development and / or sympathy, is properly compensated in the second half. It's a bit like a roller coaster ride - a slow, uphill climb to climb, then speed, turn and turn, and a few surprises. <br /> <br /> As usual, Meryl Streep is great. She is the best actress of our time. William Hurt is good, as a little wood in patches. Ren√© Zellweger does a very good job and shows that her performance in Jerry McGuire was not a slap.
