Didn't the game play? Don't bother. This is for the Final Fantasy VII fans out there who beat the game, and no one else will appreciate this rare jewel of a movie. Do you want to see it and love it? Buy the game, beat it and then watch it. When is the last time you've seen an excellent movie based video game movie? Well, that's it. <br /> <br /> The story takes place two years after the game and no short summaries are given to refresh your memory (although I doubt many people will forget) and go right into the one and one and forty minute adventure. <br /> <br /> All your favorite characters are there, even Cait Sith. The vocalist is excellent in the Japanese version, each character being thrown perfectly. Cloud sounds tough and breeding, Tifa sounds good but strong ... Aeris is also perfect, she sounds exactly as I thought. Cait Sith sounds less cute than I thought, but worked very well. <br /> <br /> The character models are spectacular, good textures and lighting. The environments are breathtaking and the battles are choreographed to blush the Matrix. The incredible camera work comes through in the bike hunt, for example, where your eyes just shout in satisfaction and your lungs breathe heavily without permission. <br /> <br /> The music is typical Uematsu quality, which means it's top. Well-known tunes are adapted to accompany Advent Children's graphic jump, which is very well connected to the visual aspects. There's even an inside joke for the fans about music, it will surely make you smile. <br /> <br /> I didn't watch it with captions because I'm half-Japanese, so I can't say it. the captions are good. In Japanese, however, the dialogue is very good and every word sounds like it comes from true living creatures, not just actors. Impressive. I'll see it one day again with subtitles to see the differences, since I played both the Japanese and American versions of Final Fantasy VII. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Final Fantasy VII, buy this movie The day it comes out or pre-order it. If you haven't played the game but want to watch this movie very much, don't waste your time: buy the game, beat it and then come back for this DVD. I won't tell you not to look at it, but play the game. This will make the experience much better and will not scratch the dust. <br /> <br /> Come back, old friends - it's time to go back with your brave comrades!
