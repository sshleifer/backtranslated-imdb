In the desert that has become Hollywood Productions, this movie - and in itself - is truly 'MANNA FROM HEAVEN'! <br /> <br /> In what can best be described as a "cute" movie, about 350 years of movie viewing experience (overall - give or take 100 years!), apparently a story of fraud, remorse and redemption over A Catholic Family in Buffalo, NY. <br /> <br /> This quiet, self-contained film by Burton Sisters FIVE SISTERS PRODUCTIONS COMPANY will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart as you renew your faith. in humanity. <br /> <br /> From the spectacular opening scenes from Buffalo, NY to the final credits, the film can tell a story that could be told of any family anywhere. Yet, in one way or another, this particular family and 'family by association' event is more than a bill in a small, non-descriptive home in Buffalo. If you've never been to Buffalo, leave the theater with thoughts of shuffling for a visit! Shots of the city's landmarks and surroundings help bring a beautiful, downward scene to the movie - which fits well. The silence of the "Queen City of the Great Lakes" complements rather than detracts from the story being told. If only more movies are going to use the natural beauty of this country's "second cities", instead of running somewhere on a sound track, the end results will be so much more credible. <br /> <br /> Great performances by Shirley Jones, Frank Gorshin, Wendy Malick, Jill Eickenberry and the rest of the ensemble site, once again prove that true talent leaves Hollywood's "taste of the week" anytime! <br /> <br /> GO THIS MOVIE! <br /> <br /> You've been walking around in Hollywood's desert for too long!
