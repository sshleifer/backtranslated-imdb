It is very good at many levels. In fact, as it was a British British low-budget indie by a first-time director with a largely nephew, it is a wonderful achievement. I don't know how much it costs. The £ 8,000 figure was engaged in publicity, but you never know how reliable a figure it is. The point is that this movie looks like it costs a few million quid and it clearly costs a small fraction of those great special effects, fantastic production design, effective props and costumes, excellent photography, good acting and direction, an impressive Score and an absolutely stunning sound mix. Even though it said, much of the writing was wonderful. The characters were clearly identified and everyone had something to do. It is a movie of ten men all dressed in one place at the same time and it will be easy for them to be nameless, sightless spaces, but they were ten characters. It was mostly through dialogue and the way they responded to things. During the middle act, when the plot developed, the script told the story well and showed how it influenced the characters. If the whole movie was like the second act, it would be great. <br /> <br /> Before the ship inflates, it twelve people make it to individual escape or "e-pods" blowing away from the ship. They are not much more than automatic metal coffins, and the poor inside are trapped, pinched and have no real idea of ​​where they are going - but it makes sense. I like the e-pods - they are an excellent idea that has been done very well and makes more sense than a nice, spacious escape hairstyle. I also like the way we are specifically said to be later designed for escaping ships, but this can only happen in the case of the planet's emergency. Because we saw it, these guys were lucky that their ship was blown. so close to a planet. It says it doesn't seem to me that there are 116 unused e-pods on the truck and you have to wonder how the prisoner can get into an e-pod - but he gets it. (And it just happened to me: shouldn't the captain go with his ship, rather than be the first man there?) Anyway, the e-pods all land on a barren planet with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation. - or at least on a sandy, evergreen-grown part of the planet that can have vain waste and lush jungle somewhere. Nah, this is a planet in a science film - it will be exactly the same. We have to assume that all the pods come within a few miles so that the ten survivors are able to meet, light up flames in the air to find each other. <br /> <br /> The Captain, a muscular mountain of a man who can have a good career in action flash if he gets the right agent, decides to try to contact "Captain Behan" with whom they was planning to rendezvous. But they can't do it from the planet, they need to get a job. The engineer says that if they combine the power of two e-pods, they can probably give one of them enough juice to set themselves up on anti-digging dads that are high enough to blow the atmosphere. Everything can be done automatically, but it will need a "pilot" to send the signal. The captain gives brave volunteers for this but in a pleasant sensible move, the engineer points out that the heaviest man in the somewhat deadly recovered e-pod is ridiculous and must be the lightest member of the team. It's the kid. I really liked the way he now points out that his name is David and the captain uses it and deals with dignity and respect. It was good storytelling and good characterization.
