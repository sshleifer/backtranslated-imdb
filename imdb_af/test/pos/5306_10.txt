When Hayao Miyazaki makes the "tri-fecta" (writing, directing and animating of a movie) he makes a classic movie for centuries. He did it again with Gake now now Ponyo. <br /> <br /> The story is about a girl fish held on very tight ties with her younger sisters by her father, a bitter ex-human wizard named Fujimoto. The fish escaped from her father and drove a jellyfish to shore, where she was trapped in a dredging operation and jammed herself in a bottle. This underwater sequence should be one of the most intricate animated scenes ever undertaken and is a reason to look for theater release. Miyazaki, who is not afraid of a busy scene, left himself. There were literally hundreds of individually drawn sea creatures of every imaginable size at the same time. <br /> <br /> When the fish escapes the dredging operation while still caught in the bottle, a five-year-old boy named Sousuke puts her in the water and can break the bottle and save her. As she is the result of her father's magic, she is capable of being self-evident - and her father is trying to get her active. The boy calls the fish Ponyo. Just when Sousuke learns that Ponyo can speak, her father regains her in captivity. <br /> <br /> After a war conscious with her father, Ponyo can escape with the ability to change herself into one. She met Sousuke again in a storm and the story continues in very interesting ways. There is a gift factor in this film that is inconsistent and probably out of Tonari no Totoro. Joe Hisaishi once again provided excellent musical support. <br /> <br /> The story itself is simple - like Miyazaki's films in general - and needs a wide spectrum of viewers. While I didn't see it enough to be sure, the film didn't seem to hold academics in long conversations, as Sen did not do Kamikakushi to Chihiro. Yet it is the ultimate feel-good entertainment film. I gave the movie a ten out of ten rating.
