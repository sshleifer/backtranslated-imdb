Years before regular pre-marriage agreements, Ernest Lubitsch made a screen comedy on which they formed the basis. Bluebeard's eighth wife includes Gary Cooper as a multi-millionaire living on the French Riviera, who is married seven times and now marries Claudette Colbert for eighth man. But Cooper is a good sport about it, he always settles with his former wives for a $ 50,000 a year according to an agreement they sign before marrying him. Sounds like we are now calling a marriage agreement. <br /> <br /> Of course, Claudette wants a lot more than that and she feels that Cooper is taking an entire business like an approach to marriage. She likes the right deal and is willing to do it. <br /> <br /> Bluebeard's eighth wife has some very funny moments, the original meeting of Cooper and Colbert in a men's shop where Cooper is. insist he just wants pajama tops and Colbert just searches bottoms. And of course, my favorite is Colbert's anticipation and extortion of the detective, Cooper, to explore her. Herman Bing has the best supporting role in the film than that even blessed detective. <br /> <br /> I often wondered how back in the day Hollywood can get away with so many people who are non-French in a movie like this. Of course Cooper is an American and Colbert of the cast is the only one actually from the French background. Although David Niven is as charming as he is a Frenchman, it is ridiculous. He's sooooooo British. <br /> <br /> Still, Bluebeard's eighth wife is a pleasant movie and a good example of what the 'Lubitsch touch' is called. in the old days.
