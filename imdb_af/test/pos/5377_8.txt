I would probably say it was the same as movies like "Devil's Rain" and the kind of movie, although it's probably made a little better. I love 70's horror and it has most of the elements that make other movies so enjoyable, it was pretty easy to enjoy. A family on their vacation stumbles across a small town where people seem to be grabbing some sort of hysteria. Looks like the kids have disappeared. After a first attempt to flee this place, the family somehow stopped on the edge of the village and returned, but not without first finding a house where the children were away, and mum and daddy is dead. We seem to have a different kind of turn in a senior community center in this town, they are all Satan worshipers and they need the children to renew their lives so they can continue in their service, I think. Not that anyone is too eager to give up their children for this business. It's pretty elegant because it is frightening and scary without buckets of gore or the noisy events that are trying to make people jump into movies today, which has replaced the real scarecrows. We have Hank Kimball (Alvy Moore) of Green Acres as Tobey, a sheriff's deputy who reads UFO magazines, and LQ Jones as the sheriff and a well-known character actor as the father of the stranded family. A wife. Martin plays the doctor who apparently does not know double work for his fellow citizens. These are pretty good things, but a bit on the confusing side, but overall work is pretty good and is recommended for fans of 70's horror. 8 out of 10.
