What was the quote of Archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and that humanity is still so cruel. All these years I am ashamed. <br /> <br /> Everyone is human and everyone has the right to live. they live in peace and harmony <br /> <br /> live and let live <br /> <br /> If anyone knows the quote, please let me know Thanks <br /> <br /> This movie must be shown much more public than real events like horror as shown in the movie, everyone must be known in the hope that things will change rather than later.
