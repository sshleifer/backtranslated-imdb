Many horror fans complain that the horror has barely progressed in the past twenty years. I was inclined to agree to the influx of Asian horror films, a trend that has grown dull. However, it has produced some true classical versions, and a Languages ​​of Two Sisters, for me, stands out anyway as an exceptional piece of cinema, and perhaps the best horror movie in a very long time. <br /> <br /> Based vaguely on a Korean folk tale, it tells the sad story of two intellectual sisters living with their father and stepmother. Having experienced some problems on their first night at home, they decide to stay together and deny their stepmother access to their close relationship. The tension is rising and there is the inevitable snap. But what happens after it takes more than a few eyes, as the story takes several twists, and the frightens become more emotional and fairly real. Ultimately, you may need a few moments to absorb it all and put it together in your own mind, but this is precisely this disconnection of horror and mystery that pushes it beyond the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic . One to look at again, if it just works out everything.
