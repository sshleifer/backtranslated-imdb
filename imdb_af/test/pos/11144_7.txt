A special, nice movie for those who saw it when it was young, because it was for the youngster to watch. If it is considered adult again, it is better than shining glasses. It was the first of the 16 Jungle Jim movies and later TV series Johnny Weismuller went for Columbia (in the last 3 films he had to use his own name while losing the rights) after getting the bag on Tarzan to play Sol Lesser. Johnny Sheffield also played Boy to become Bomba the Jungle Boy in a series of 12 films. <br /> <br /> Jim and some go on dangerous safari to man the hidden temple of Zimbalu being manned by a dark tribe of devil. doctors who are the secret of a poison that can also be a cure for polio. Edgar Rice Burroughs is probably approved. After 16 years, Monosyllabically Weismuller struggled to have uncomfortable strings of mind together, not that it was important. On the fast march we meet many interesting but generally playful jungle denizens. The sinister crocodile is going to eat the front lady with her leg caught under a twig and the surreal elephant stock (clamped in a corner of the frame). Skipper the dog and Caw-Caw, the crow had many adventures. No one has become necessary for the plot if you concentrate! The biggest problem with the movie is the far-reaching climax, which can be exciting, but also reminds you at the end of a series? and the original excellent series was made 12 years earlier. Although I would not have remembered it personally, it will take a few more hours! <br /> <br /> The only thing about this was Weismuller; in so many ways a pleasant children's film from the old days - not recommended for serious adults, so I love it.
