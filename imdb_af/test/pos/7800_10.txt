This is my favorite Indian movie of all time. This is comic genius. Salman Khan is hilarious. But Amir Khan stole the show with his witty dialogue. Karisma Kapoor's outfits tell her own story - wondering if the stylist deliberately makes her wear clothes, just to make the movie funny (at one point she or she seems to wear a cloth). Andaz Apna Apna is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning to the end. There is not a dull moment, every scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance movements will have you in stings of laughter. I especially loved the scene in which Amar (Amir Khan) 'regains his memory'. I saw this movie so many times, I lost count. And I'm so happy to say that this time, Bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie as far as I know A.A.A it's not a replica of a Hollywood movie (THANK YOU GOD). Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who understands Hindu / Urdu and loves good comedy. <br /> <br /> Look, you will love it !!!!!
