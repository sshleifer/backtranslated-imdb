This card is one of the best of all time and is proof (like most of Charlie Chaplin's work) that sound and color are not quality work requirements. In fact, this cartoon uses (and may have started) some of the gags and devices that later became animated, such as caricatures of celebrities (including the aforementioned Chaplin). Although the characters are silent, they speak as in the comics. Since Felix started out as a comic book, this device is of course. The atmosphere and style of the card is completely harmonious with that of the cartoon while another is added. dimension (literally and figuratively) and make this short a pleasure to watch. Well worth the time and effort.
