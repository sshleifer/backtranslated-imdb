I went through the heights. I went through the valley ... crying, laughing, puked my love buds forever. But by all this I was filled. I became a better person because of this experience in self-educated decline. It's not every day that we can say we've lived through the worst, and come from the other side with something that looks very much like our common sense. Friends ... neighbors unite and be like one now. Go out and find this movie and wilt in its extravagance. Place it high on the mantle and kiss its polystyrene box. Take it in bed. Take it with you when shopping, or have blind dates with strangers. They will appreciate you much better for your sublime and unique schizophrenic slope at the theater. And then they'll throw their liquor in your face (but you'll have the last laugh). I ran for the governor with this little beauty under my belt (and you too!). It's great to enjoy again and again.
