"Journey to the Far Side of the Sun" ("Doppelganger") is an entertaining, Twilight Zone style sci-fi offering from Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (the team behind Space: 1999, UFO, Thunderbirds, Fireball XL-5 and others). In the film, Roy Thinnes (of the "Invaders" TV Exhibition) and Ian Hendry starred as astronauts on a flight to a planet sharing an exact Earth orbit, but on the opposite side of the sun; henceforth hidden from view. An intrusive European spaceflight director (handed over by late Patrick Wymark) gets the flight fast and after rigorous training, the astronauts are good to deal with. So start the best rows in the movie, the launch, flight and landing on the "other" earth. The brilliant rocket rocket (by Derek Meddings) and a dreamy, elegant spaceflight (reminiscent of the best moments of 2001: a Space Odyssey) are easy highlights of the movie. The landing on the Doppelganger Earth is exciting and exciting. After that, the Twilight Zone aspect of the movie kicks in; with a plot almost completely removed from the classic TZ episode, "The Parallel." In addition, the movie is still solid sci-fi, with some interesting "mirror world" things to chew (write backwards and left-handed handshake, for example). Less successful are the screens depicting a mid-21st century; where all the men wear a necklace and Nehru jackets and all the women wear a mini-skirt. Some of the relationships with women in the film are also a non-computer according to today's standards. And (in the most consistent lack of most of the 20th century sci-fi), the computers, phones and other hardware are all big, colorful and clunky (right from Patrick McGoohan's "The Prisoner"). No one has suggested the digital microprocessor age! If one can foresee these mistakes, the movie is very interesting, with Thinnes' solid lead as the upset astronaut. And with a nice, 1960s / early 70s style nihilistic ending! For fans of retro sci-fi (like me) it's a journey worth taking!
