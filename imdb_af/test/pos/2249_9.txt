Being an Israeli Jew of a sarcastic nature, as well as a lover of different and independent theaters, always gives me the pleasure to see a film that sees the holocaust being sensitive and respectful, while also original and is unusual. While I didn't read the book? Or, for the case, heard of his existence before the film was watched? and so can't comment on how they have stacked like other reviewers. Everything was relieved, gave me great pleasure, and I can certainly comment on it. <br /> <br /> To label, everything a holocaust movie would be relieved to do is great injustice even though it is undeniably over the holocaust. It will name it as a comedy or a travel movie, though it is about a journey and it is particularly funny as it moves. Everything is relieved about Jonathan Safran Foer ?? Elijah Wood played for minimalist perfection, in the most impressive dramatic performance I've ever seen him, with a poker face that doesn't show anything and reveals everything? a young American Jew and an obsessive collector of family heirlooms and historical artefacts traveling to Ukraine on a journey to find the woman who saved his Nazi's grandfather. It's also about Alex, his travel guide through Ukraine, and Alex's grandfather. What is fascinating about these characters is that at the beginning of the movie they look like comic relief to balance the melancholic nature of Wood's character; But both Alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the film, and seem to be at least as important as Jonathan. In fact, Boris Leskin, as the grumpy self-declared blind grandfather, seems to be the best dramatic performance in the film. <br /> <br /> Besides the surreality of the film and the characters, the beautiful mix of original acoustic music and Russian folk music, the sensitive cinematography and the cold contrast between the beauty of the landscapes and the horrors of history, made everything is a powerful and moving experience for me. This is the fact that we from Alex and his grandfather get a lot of different and original views on this painful topic; Several excellent films such as the Gray Zone and Downfall have already given us the position of lower-ranking Nazis as humans, which is not necessarily fully aware of the moral implications of their deeds, but they are trapped in reality of the war. Everything is relieved, offering a rarely discussed position: Alex's view is that of a young man born many years after the war, who regards it as little as cold historical fact. the horrors his own people ?? and maybe also his own family? was able to. The change in Alex's attitude ?? and his grandfather's ?? to Jonathan, after the Holocaust, and towards the Jewish people in general, the film makes a fascinating and original study of character development. <br /> <br /> Everything is lit, is a tremendous legal message for actor Liev Schreiber and one of the most original and unique films of 2005. It is a highly recommended viewing experience, especially if anyone interested in the Holocaust and World War II.
