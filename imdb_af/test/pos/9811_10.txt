I'm not sure to call this movie a children's drama or a fantasy movie. When I first looked at it, I couldn't really make the end and that was the only part of the film that uncovered the depth and left me a little depressed. Then I watched it a second time and realized how big the acting was and was unclear how it received the scarce attention it received. <br /> <br /> Unforgettable performances by the young Mazzello and Wood had to be made This film is a classic. <br /> <br /> Although probably the fantasy / drama of the original writer / director (Evans), Donner once took over and presumably made it more dramatic, especially the finite, did what really happened to Bobby - Was he killed? Did he escape and really did all those fantastic trips? Or was it just an imaginary story that Hanks wove to prove a point to children? <br /> <br /> But in all, it did not give the conclusion of a happy ending that we are so accustomed to a children's movie. Maybe it's because it's not just that. To see what a more classic end could be, look at the Official Elijah Wood Site where you'll find the first rough draft of the movie's conclusion (presumably by the original author) <br /> <br /> Also ' a note of the music by Hans Zimmer, one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, a mix of childish and dark feelings throughout the movie. A great CD to hold on to if you can. <br /> <br />
