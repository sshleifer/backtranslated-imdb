I don't think I'll include spoilers, but if I do, I can cover my butt. "The Last American Virgin" came at a time when such teens of age / high school were sex rubbers. Films such as "Prepies" (1984), "Hot Times" (1974) and the popular "Porky's" (1981) made a lot of money. Yet it is the "Last American Virgin" who actually has a more serious plot story in the midst of nakedness and sexual situations. This is the story of three high school friends who often want to lose their virginity. They go to the wrong places (prostitutes), the dangerous children (older woman with jealous boyfriend) and the comfortable children (attract their high school female counterparts). The movie has very funny moments, and although the film didn't make a single big movie star, it's worth remembering for a fantastic 80's soundtrack that includes: Devo, The Cars, Journey and others. By today standards are noisy and may have grabbed an NC-17 rating, but is a well-known story of how sometimes personal fixation can only hurt, while love can be right in front of us. It's a little bit of 80's Americana and worth having in your movie collection.
