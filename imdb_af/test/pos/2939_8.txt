America's next top model is a great reality show in every way. It has a good host, has good guests, an excellent production and some of the best specialists in the modeling world who have contributed to something they have not yet achieved: offering a true America's next top model. Of course, it's not easy to do, so the US and the world have all 10 top models in this cruel world fighting and fighting. <br /> <br /> But it's obvious it's not the intention to America's next top model, but yes, America's next pop model. The show gets a lot of models without any experience with different personalities and great personal, professional and financial problems, giving them the opportunity to bring a dream to life or make their lives worthwhile. It is clear that Tyra Banks uses everything for her, she gives the dream, but in return she gets hearing and more popularity. Anyway, she deserves it because she is intelligent and, if I can say that, is a pioneer of this kind of performance. Tyra is also a good observer and knows how to give sound opinions, unlike other models and host of strange versions of the NEXT TOP MODEL franchise. In Brazil, for example, Fernanda Motta is his hostess and a once-a-time top model. She doesn't even have 1/10 of Tyra's professional skills, which Tyra Banks holds up. Tyra has professional and personal knowledge about what she says and she is a good mentor because she not only criticizes, but she shows the mistake and teaches the right way with wisdom. <br /> <br /> The show doesn't suffer from major issues. , do and fulfill what it promises during the cycles. The models chosen to work on the show are actually not the best unknown models of the whole country, because Tyra Banks is the difference and she is right because she (and also a good part of her audience) believes that It's time for the modeling world to change some straightforward parameters. During the cycles she and her team make fair deliberations, where the worst goes away and the promising children have new chances to prove their abilities, but it must be fast, otherwise they will lose it. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting thing is that Tyra also knows who should or should win, even when she is against people's opinion. She knows that everyone who wins will be famous, but has very few possibilities to really be a world-renowned top model. Similarly, she knows that second place is sometimes more valuable than the first, because first place wins the title, but the second doesn't get the title stigma. Rarely does she make mistakes when deciding the future of any model during the show. <br /> <br /> After 9 cycles, the show gets a bit tired with old ideas. It's time for Tyra to change things and lines because it gets boring and compares to the first cycles. We can see that she also gets bored, so she should do it if she wants the show to be a little longer. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show explores the fashion and modeling world, but it is also entertaining for those living outside it all. It offers the opportunity for some girls and also the market, and also gives good tips for those of the audience who share the same dream.
