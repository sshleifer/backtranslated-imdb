I loved this thing. The most wonderful thing about Pink Flamingos is that it desperately strives to be in a terrible taste, but has really gained a cult worldwide. Say a lot about us (we are people) not that. Pink Flamingos succeeds because Waters made the film he wanted to make. A movie should not be disgusting to succeed, but it may be. If you see this movie, you see things that are disgusting, but are ultimately brilliant because they are freely displayed. What we have here is an honest piece of personal creative expression. Anyone who ever cares to succeed as an artist, whether in film or any other media, should see this movie.
