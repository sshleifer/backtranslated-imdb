There are moments when you don't want that deep drama series. If you don't want heavy story series or a must to watch each episode to stop. There are moments when you just want to see a simple series, with lots of action and cool characters. For those moments you have Cleopatra 2525. <br /> <br /> I was one of those who really enjoyed Charlie's Angels. Critics said it was superficial and stupid. But the thing is, that's the point! People who can't relax and expect a serious movie hated it. That's exactly the same with Cleopatra 2525. It's superficial. It has stupid and unrealistic characters. And that's why I like it. It's not like any other series. <br /> <br /> The first season wasn't very good. The character Cleo was annoying and a little too much. The story was a bit crippled, and you didn't get to know the characters much. But hey, they only have 20 minutes in each episode. <br /> <br /> In the last 5-6 episodes of Cleopatra 2525, they finally gave the series full of 40 minutes. And it was here, I started to love it. The series eventually began to grow into a very qualitative series. Actually, they had to cancel the series. Because the last episodes of Cleopatra 2525 were really good. I will never forget Hel, Sarge and Cleo. Unique characters who only created the creators of Xena!
