The Outer Limits is a brilliant show that leaves me mostly with very strong emotions. There are undoubtedly some stinker episodes, but it's actually an old pulp story that's turned on in a TV show, so it can be expected. For the most part, it is excellently done, well-produced and targeted, and often with a great name talent that seems to work in a solid translation of short fiction to hour-long television format. <br /> <br /> The Outer Limits tend to focus on rather big ethical / philosophical / moral questions and rarely end up without the voice of what serious thinking holds. <br /> <br /> From time to time, the themes become a bit hammering for everyone except the most fat-looking viewers. In addition, while a certain level of government distrust is conducive to effective democracy, unfortunately several divisions can deviate from the absurdity of the military / CIA distrust, etc. that any big group of power (the Roman Catholic Church, Evangelicals, People's Republic of China, etc.) is thrown into a bad light in frequency from time to time. <br /> <br /> Whilst the performance can beat a dead horse when viewed enough, the overall quality is amazing, and I'm grateful that Sci-Fi decided to continue it until they have a season up to season DVD set (and I can afford it.
