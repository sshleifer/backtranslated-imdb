I hate vampire movies. With that said, this one was very interesting to me. I want to point out one thing. "Bakjwi" literally means bat in Korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, you see Dracula or vampires change into a bat and fly away or wuheva. We also know that bats can fly so many mammals to categorize them as "exceptional". As I watched the movie, I realized that the bat's theme was deeply embedded in this movie, just to make the bat vampire connection. Duality of human nature = If you ever read the aesop fables, there is this one fable where mammals and birds fight and a bat just can't take a side and it tries to get both sides to its advantage. Mammals and birds find out what this bat has done and the bat disappears from their lands at the end of the story. <br /> <br /> The two opposing sides of human nature are constantly getting underway in the movie. sang-hyun's blind priest friend, song-hyun's attempt to quench his sexual desire, tae-ju play both sides, her usual boring life against her excitement seeking vampire adventure, etc. (it won't ruin too much, you have to look at the movie) and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with lovely sides of romance, sex, violence, religion, dark comedy, tragedy, revenge, call it! <br /> <br /> Like many people, I find this movie bored and too long, but this movie is very fresh and new, something I haven't seen before. I won't say it's CW Park's best work, but it is. def. the strangest thing to understand, but still quite intriguing!
