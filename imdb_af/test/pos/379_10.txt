It is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, and one of his most underrated. I believe it surely exceeds a "Psycho" or "The Birds" for technical art and brilliance. It is a macabre, tense, dark humorous product that will put you in awe for some time. <br /> </p> It's a disturbing, beautiful show that relieves the whole movie. His character is obsessive, apparently homosexual (look at the deliberate slight ties and hear how he is described as 'European'), strange, charming and dangerous to cross. Farley Granger certainly knows this, as he is entangled in Bruno's sordid web after the couple met on a train. Bruno, who knows inside information about Guy's business, suggests the two 'swap' murders for each other's benefit. Walker murdered Granger's messy wife who abandoned his marriage to beautiful Anne, while Granger killed Bruno's father, whom he so intensely hated. Everyone is happy, right? A winning win, as Bruno claims? Wrong. Granger forgets the indecent suggestion, but an obsession Walker. He commits his murder and is determined to cough Granger until he also completes his side of the bargain. 'Strangers' becomes a brand new, exciting game with a cat-and-mouse in Hitch's skilled hands. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock was absolutely wonderful to create intriguing minor characters and build scenes. We have pregnant whore Miriam, Granger's estranged wife, pregnant with another man. She swirls swallowing a phallic ice cream cone while Bruno openly eats with her eyes. Barbara Morton, Anne's sister, is a deceptive but clever, smart and smart young girl who comes out with the roughest comment you will hear from a particular girl in the 50's photos. Senator Morton is authoritative and self-absorbed. This is one of the boldest movies ever made by Hitchcock, which is typical of a Hitch movie, subtly sexually detailed. <br /> <br /> It fits into the film noir category with the focus on murder, lies and fraudulent and shadow cinematography. Walker's nut is one of the centuries, and Granger makes a convincingly upset protagonist. Roman may be weaker than the other two, and I never believed her relationship with Granger. Still, the overwhelmingly positive cancels out the slight negative and it can safely be said to be one of the BEST American movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Just look at what Hitch does here - the originality, the technical skill. We see the murder of Miriam reflected in her broken glasses. A game of tennis becomes one of the most exciting, intense scenes you'll ever see. An innocent feast turns into a place of murder and dirty events. A young boy's balloon is picked cold by Walker. (Hitch liked it, of course, as he saw in 'The Third Man!'). Children's excitement to drive the carousel turns into screaming, fast-paced terror. Hitch subscribes to normal, everyday events like no other. <br /> <br /> The camera work here is one of the best ever seen in a Hitchcock movie, and the premise is to die. This is smooth, cute sophistication and devilish charm. The cross-enlargement between Walker and Granger's characters is wonderful. Granger's DIY or tennis match is just as important as the villain Walker's salvation of an incriminating piece of evidence lost in a drain. Hitch rebuilds his villain in a nasty, repulsive but sympathetic and peculiar charm. Did anyone else find him very attractive, more than Granger? A piece of work. We are just as tense as Walker in our hope that he can get the lighter. out of the drain. We need him anyway. He holds the key to the story. <br /> <br /> You'll never see a stranger's approach again, just after you've seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Amazing. <br /> <br /> 10/10.
