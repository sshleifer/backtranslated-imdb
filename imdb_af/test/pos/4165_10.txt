I'll make this command. It was a joy to watch. It may or may not have been more effective if the characters looked like their peers, but apart from this slight observation, I found the fantasy animal characters to be the most pleasant. The footage was the best, except for the second-class CG scenes, which could be left out. However, I don't like computer-generated animation, but it defeats the purpose of a biopsy like this one. Look, you will appreciate it too!
