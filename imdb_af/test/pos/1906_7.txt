Of course, seeing some tree mikes means nothing, does it? Lord, Rudy Ray Moore and D'Urville Martin really put this one together, didn't they? I laughed a lot, as often in these types of movies, but I don't know what I was supposed to be laughing at, because I laughed at so many other things. I'm not saying the movie is bad, but I'll say a little more editing would have done wonders. I'm a big fan of Blaxploitation, so I don't think it was terrible, but I know that "The Human Tornado" was better than this several times. I think those who can make it through this movie might need a Colt 45 or two afterwards. I mean, it really helps you not see the tree points if you look again.
