Let me deviate from many comments I have read here and say that this film is one of the five best Bonds, along with the Secret Service of On Her Majesty, of Russia with Love, License to Kill and For Your Eyes Only ONLY time Roger Moore actually played the role of Bond, instead of futzing around). Of course, Sean Connery pulls the whole thing together - as a co-author, co-producer, and in his best performance since Van Russia With Love. He is fit, energetic and enjoys himself naturally. His acting is mature, confident and with the right amount of humor. This is in contrast to its mechanical performance in Thunderball, its sleeper by You Only Live Twice, and its jowly paunchy skirt by the cartoon known as Diamonds Are Forever! <br /> <br /> This is an imaginative rework of Thunderball, without the sets and machines overwhelming the characters and plot. This role is also much better. Klaus Maria Brandauer brings his unique style to the role of Largo, without relying on an eyebrow, SPECTER ring or a boring uniform. Kim Basinger is athletic and lovely, Barbara Carrera is dynamic, and once we have a great Felix Leiter in Bernie Casey. The images of M and Q are original, and the addition of the bumbling Small-Fawcett is fun without falling into the stick. <br /> <br /> Director Irvin Kershner makes good use of his places (the Bahamas and the French Riviera) without seeing his actors. Although careful inspection shows some mediocre special effects and declines in continuity, Kershner keeps the film at a good pace, unlike Thunderball (who didn't even keep his director, Terence Young). Of course, fans will miss the gun brand and the 007-themed music, but they are owned by Eon Productions. <br /> <br /> Michel LeGrand may not have made the most memorable score, but it takes the atmosphere of the places without being too intrusive. Not surprisingly, his best moments in southern France, with his French love song (at the spa), are particularly attractive. And tell me how many people remember the music for Moonraker? Personally, I want to forget the man with the golden gun and a view of a kill! <br /> <br /> The Eon people can cut this movie if they want. (Yeah, Octopussy made more money.) At least Connery's adult 007 couldn't swing through the jungle emitting a Tarzan scream. He did not leave with a Bengal tiger, nor did he fight an "Indian" snake rifle with a tennis racket. Despite Eon's desperate efforts to stop this production, Kevin McClory and the late Jack Schwartzman put together a fine film, which I think Ian Fleming would have appreciated. <br /> <br /> However, if you'd rather see James Bond be kicked by a dwarf by a dwarf, in another tiring battle with "Jaws" attacked, with Grace Jones in bed, or a lapstick firetruck hunt by San Francisco, this is NOT the movie for you!
