Compared to Britain's struggle, it's a real movie, with real characters and a real plot. Battle of Britain is actually a documentary with the occasional Lawrence Olivier and Michael Caine, but the real protagonists are the Spits, the Hurricanes, and so on. In addition, you have two good characters (actually three) and a real plot. I strongly recommend it to anyone, even to those who don't particularly love war movies. It is well filmed, and I wonder what the director can do if he had the big capitals behind him. And I don't think it's too sentimental. It's just that in the fighters you have real people, with real feelings and a real life - as real as any fiction in a good movie.
