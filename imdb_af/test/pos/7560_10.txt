I was so devastated by this movie in 1981, I returned to the theater four times to see it again! Something I've never done for another movie. No movie elicits the feelings of getting up in the 60's like Four Friends. The fact that it has now approached my own experiences in the 60's is probably something that many will share. Jodi Thelen is beautiful and unforgettable! Why didn't she become a star afterwards, I will never know. The play through the entire cast is flawless, like Steve Tisch's writing. I always wanted to know how much of the story was autobiographical. But unfortunately, Steve is no longer here to answer the question. I've all exhausted my VHS copy of this wonderful movie! Highly recommended!
