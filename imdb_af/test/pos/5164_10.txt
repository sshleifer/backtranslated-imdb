Swedish film maker Roy Andersson's latest movie You, the Living is not easy to revise. One of the reasons is that he broke his own words with the Anglo-Saxon tradition of storytelling, essentially the template of most Western film productions. Another reason could be that, although Roy Andersson is somewhat heavy on symbolism, unlike Andrei Tarkovsky, she is more elusive. It took him 3 years to complete this 86-minute movie and it wasn't because he was forced to have long breaks between shooting due to financial problems or problems with the actors. The film consists of 57 vignettes that were mostly shot by a silent camera, and it was the careful design of each of those scenes that took a lot of time. The images of this film, which are closely related to the directors' previous second-floor movie songs, are extremely important to the story. This story therefore largely depends on the environment and the environment in which the characters of Andersson's universe live and interact. Before every scene was finally shot, there would be no less than 10 different test shoots with different actors, colors, dialogue etc. Don't be. The result is a dreamy version of the surrounding world that will recognize most of us and if the environment is like a dream, why not dream of it? Just like in Bunuel's The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, when someone says, "Last night I had a dream," you see. But then what is perceived by reality is not very different from the dreams. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the movie lacks a plot in the traditional sense of the word and there are no main characters So, the different characters that appear in different scenes and reappear, still meet and their stories are inevitably intertwined. What most of these characters have in common is their apparent loneliness despite being surrounded by others. The trailer-chain chain that smokes and bends a drink, dreaming to have a motorcycle, so she gets away from "all this crap", her cute and mostly silent boyfriend and his frail and seemingly gentle but rather absent mother, members of a buyer group whose skill to improve at home does not receive a favorable reception, either from their families or their neighbors, the depressed Middle Eastern hairdresser and his arrogant client on the way to a very important business meeting, " an elderly man who has a nightmare about bombers in the air, a young girl who dreams to marry the young rock star she loves so much. It's all about dreams and nightmares to reality, but it works so much like a statement in support of the demands of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein that "all human communication is miscommunication". People talk to each other, but it is as if they are talking to each other. They try to reach out to the other, but exclude the others when they try to reach them. <br /> <br /> You, the Living is a poetic movie that is physically in Stockholm, but still universally applicable. The society that depicts it is Sweden, its artistic language and the people who are displayed are generally undeniably Nordic. Yet the subject matter of it is the misery of mankind in a selfish world, far beyond this hemisphere. Despite the seriousness of the theme, the movie itself looks much more cheerful and humorous than expected. But in the words of the director himself, life is so complicated for each of us that the only thing we save is our sense of humor. "Hence, this movie is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy, depending on your sensitivity, and not a depressing black reality test of human nature. It is unusual in its language and structure, but if you are out of the box Think about it and enjoy it, you'll definitely find this movie entertaining and meaningful at the same time. It was featured at the Cannes Festival as part of the Un Certain Regard program that offers "original and other works" out of competition. shown in the Salle Debussy, the 1000 strong audience has given a standing ovation for a few minutes.
