The story in this movie is pretty indescribable B-grades, but the writer has headed for a creepy man, and in 1940 it meant Peter Lorre. And Peter is at his creepiest in this island owner Stephen Danel, who gets prisoners who are traced to his custody to work on his island diamond mine. On arrival, the parole discovered that they were slave miners who could be beaten or killed. Thanks to two things, it seems to be worse than the slaves. Danel's wife and monkeys. Monke taps him so much that his violence against them is likely to lead to the only meat the slaves get. <br /> <br /> Lorre is perfect in its roll and crawls the screen for industrial strength. Although the script is not the Casablanca caliber, the editing is very strict and there are no wasteful scenes. This is a very viewable story, but I'm not sure which niche this movie is filled with. Too long for a short topic, and too short for a movie with a feature, I'm not sure how it was presented at the theater. <br /> <br /> I just showed it for the first time on a late night / early morning TCM. Lorre fans won't miss this one if they haven't seen it.
