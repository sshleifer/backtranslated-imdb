I didn't catch Gilmore Girls when it first came out and still caught the first season. I read most of the users' comments and for the negatives, I have to ask, what view are you watching? <br /> <br /> This show is a classic, good line, character and good acting. And best of all, NOT your standard formula always shows with an occasional turn to the story. There are probably more women who reflect themselves in the Lorelai / Emily relationship in the Lorelai / Rory relationship. The people and storylines are not a computer, but they really are! <br /> <br /> If you find the dialogue annoying, I suggest you paste the view so you can't see the parts, don't understand.
