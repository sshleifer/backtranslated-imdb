Again, the sacred house of Bugs Bunny is being violated by indifferent people. This time the traveling circus placed a lion cage across the rabbit's hole. So Bug's must get out of the hole and Nero (that's the name of the lion), which he does in his usual, hilarious style. After a slow and rocky start to the car, it is getting better and better and it becomes quite hilaries. Nero the lion seems to be a pretty good foil for Bugs and it briefly changes it into a highly memorable one, if it is still of a classic gift. This animated short can be found on Disk 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 3. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A-
