Dan Dailey gives a sincere and colorful performance to the great Dizzy Dean. His handling of the character is very true for life and gives the taste of Dean's background and limited education. The film of course around Dizzy Deans is known and its sudden trip to the sidelines with an injury he chose to ignore, much to his regret. His wife is beautifully portrayed by Joanna Dru, who gives a very good quality to the woman, who so quickly rose to a dizzying height to the woman who loved and supported the ball player. The portrayal of Dizzy's later career as a sports shooter is honest and infallible, reflecting his problems arising from his poor education and his colorful language, both on and off the air. Dizzy was quite a character and Daily caught up in his story with admirable skill. If you enjoy this movie, I recommend the comedy "Kid from Left Field" (1953) in which Daily is a ballplayer rejected by his young son (Billy Chapin). Everyday meat is again a ballplayer in a completely satisfactory manner. I highly recommend Pride of St. Louis baseball fans everywhere.
