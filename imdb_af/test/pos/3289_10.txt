I saw Chomps during about 2 days of theater release. This is a nice and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji', though much improved and more focused on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life problems in a humorous way, followed by the bulls and villains who get their net-deserts, is sympathetic and heart-warming. It's also thought challenging. With subtle subtlety, this movie touches awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Movies have different genera and different purposes. This movie, which is great for all ages, offers an interesting, humorous look at our own experiences. Everyone will recognize the personality and behavior of themselves and others. Everyone will see the humor. The humor makes the move enjoyable and brings understanding of life situations on a new level. <br /> <br /> For light laughter and a "good movie", Chomps is an excellent choice. Unforgettable.
