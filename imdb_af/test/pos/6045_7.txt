Jack Webb's film 'The D.I' came from real-life investigation into the death of several pupils in a swamp in Paris island in the 50's. As always, Webb, the patriot he is, just as the rest of his performances came to the defense. I actually found this movie at 1957 standards. I served in the army and can understand the intensity of training at Parris Island (Camp Death by some) so that this movie can never get close to Full Metal Jacket. I think it's a good movie that is more patriot than it really is. But again, think of the period it was made (1957) and what can be allowed and then said on film at that time. I always found Jack Webb to be clean and very loyal. I know many have criticized the film as one-sided and government propaganda. If you feel like that, watch Full Metal Jacket with R Lee Ermey. I am a Webb fan and enjoy the movie for its merits, not accuracy. As I said, Webb believed in this country and held high moral standards (LAPD Dragnet, Adam 12, Emergency, etc.). Just sit back and enjoy this from a very strict moral period in this country. Don't be too judgmental of Mr. Webb not. Mark Lockwood Lubbock Texas ..
