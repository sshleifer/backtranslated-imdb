I live here in crocodile and remember the real events that inspired this movie. Our bowels fall every time we hear of a hook attack. BLACK WATER is simply the best crocodile film I've ever seen. While I loved ROGUE last year for all its effects and splendid scenes, it was the local scenes that we heard. We laughed at ROGUE more than anything. BLACK WATER, however, is really with the honesty and fear you can experience when you are alone in the mangroves. (You call them marshes or bayous - but they are mangroves). Every tourist must see this movie before going to the Northern Territory. The end was a bit degraded to the rest of the movie, but I will add this one to my DVD collection when it becomes available.
