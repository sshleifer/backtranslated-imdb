"Black Nula" is the # 1 Box Office Portuguese movie of 2004. This ultra-low budget production (estimated $ 150,000) opened during Christmas to US Blockbusters such as National Treasure, Polar Express, The Incredibles and Alexander, but quickly has the adulation the Portuguese caught. moviegoers. Despite the fierce competition, the small film went surprisingly well and laid all the other Portuguese films of the past two years in the first weeks. The film is a mystery / murder with a humorous tone created and directed by Fernando Fragata. Did I say the movie? Oh yes!
