I never saw a doctor before (at least not in any focused way), so I was new to the concept. I must say that the new show works very well. It's funny (it should also say "Comedy" in the genre description: many plot twists are only acceptable due to their comic value), it's well written and it makes a scant budget a long way. The human dimension is very strong and attractive. It's very rare in current TV shows. <br /> <br /> I saw the first eight episodes, and # 6-8 were my favorites so far. Even types of stories that are too easy to screw up (with time travel, saving their dead parents and such things) work incredibly well here. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is a joy to watch as the spectacular and light-hearted but occasionally cheerful doctor - if they can find a good replacement for him, I'll be quite surprised. But I'm willing to give the new guy a chance. However, there is little doubt that the episodes of Eccleston in history will go as classic. <br /> <br /> The relationship between doctor and rose is especially refreshing. The Doc is much more of her father than a romantic interest, yet there are tips of romantic insinuation between them, which, however, are much more emotional and human than sexual. <br /> <br /> A good show. The biggest downside is the low budget - a performance like this should have better special effects. And why not just use cheaper effects, I don't know. At this day and age, SFX doesn't have to cost a bundle - just look at the Star Wars: Revelation fan movie. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
