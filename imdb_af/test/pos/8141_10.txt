My friend took me to a show of this movie in Hollywood and it was fantastic! It's a movie noir with great acting, good screenplay, cool music, the whole thing was done very well and entertaining. Don't know if it's a theatrical release, but it'll be a good date movie or a fun movie to rent if you see it at Blockbuster. It's the kind of movie I love, low on budget, but great on style and imagination. I hope Alexandra Holden gets more big parts as she has in this one, she is fantastic.
