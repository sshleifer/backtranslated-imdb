This movie was well done, but it also made me feel at times. For anyone considering doing business, this is a must see, as it shows the turbulent deal in what is going on for these struggling workers. The soundtrack was definitely cool and the acting and dance complemented it nicely. Some of the students' attitudes might have been a bit far-fetched, like Leroy's, especially since I was sure someone could be kicked off immediately because he refused to read and if it were the true High School of Performing Arts. The Coco screen test is hard to look for any people out there with poor stomach, please keep my warning in mind. While it is very eager, I know this is the truth about what is happening, in this respect the movie is right. Overall, it is entertaining and although some parts are moving on the majority, it's going very fast. <br /> <br /> Final Grouping: <br /> <br /> Movies: Probably this one would be skipped. <br /> <br /> DVD Purchase: Not something I need to see again. <br /> <br /> Rent: Worth hiring at least once in your life!
