For those outside who like to think of themselves as pretty intelligent people, who love film, have great attention to detail and enjoy movies with funny, smartly written dialogue, then this is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> For those with a poor attention span, high expectations and no brains .. well .. um .. you may get bored and find things that sometimes distract. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful, modest and healthy fit movie with the actors giving a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I almost completely stayed by myself. <br /> <br /> This movie is a gem.
