Beauty in Trouble (Kráska v nesnázích) is not a good title. All the descriptions of this movie fail to determine what it really is? an adult fairy tale. A poor girl is wooed by a prince. The "girl", Marcela, played by beautiful Anna Geislerová, has an Isabelle Huppert beauty, with a red hair, face and figure that is indignant, sexual and endlessly fascinating. She has a louse from a man, but they have good sex. The children listen to the love through the walls. It is rough and passionate, as the gender of the working class is often portrayed in films. But it is also for us to admit that this is the thing that connects them in an otherwise incompatible marriage. The man, a professional car thief, is eventually caught and thrown into jail. We don't know how she got into this marriage, but she's not a high class herself. But she is beautiful, intelligent (we accept) and loves her beautiful and resilient children. She deserves more. And she might get the life she deserves - eventually. (no spoiler!) She is forced to return with her mother after her husband has been sent to jail. Mom has a terrible second man (read ugly stepfather). He is a real horror show. He borders on a child abuse for the children. He is obsessive about the cleanliness but carelessly at the table, one day demanding ways and decorum from the children. He is really a low class socially distressed misery. Mom sits with him, like Marcella's husband, at least he is funny - sly but horn. The ambivalent, confusing, layered characteristics make the film so powerful and interesting. These characters have errors, some are driven by the class, some by innate character. These shortcomings and details of character are one minute special and contemptuous of the following. The audience should really negotiate the conflicting sense of class, sexuality, ambition, commitment and the role of a woman as a mother and wife through the rapidly changing field of the story. At the bottom, as with many films such as the wonderful Icelandic film, "Thicker Than Water (Bloodbands), the children can be the victims. What is right in the end can be what is best for the children? Who are we redemption and our future This is a theme that is currently being played in films ranging from Pan's Labyrinth to Children of Men, Foreign. Cinema recognizes in intricate morality talks that life is confusing, brutal, unfair and if adults need to act together To give our bases instincts, we can lose ourselves and the world in the process, and the extraordinary and complex and colorful characters in Kráska v nesnázích speak to the characteristics of what a man does, which drives a woman who embodies hope, what is the class - is it the economic status of the tissue of its character? The film is richly human as embodied by the last 2 shots that surprised me unbelievably and unexpectedly, so subtle and intelligent that it is comparable is with an American movie, looks unfair. Americans sometimes seem to have no desire to consider that paradoxical in human nature does not make firm decisions. But here, which is dangerous to the adult in the apparent fairy tale, are interesting moral questions. Don't be fooled by the simple story; this is a good movie.
