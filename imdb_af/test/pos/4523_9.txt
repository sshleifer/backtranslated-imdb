This is my fourth review of a Charlie Chan movie in a series of chronological sequences on these consecutive days. It's also my first comment from one I've seen before, even though it's been around 24 years ago, so I didn't remember much about it. In this one, the Honolulu detective is investigating a spy ring that was initially detected by a former Scotland workman who arrived in the Big Apple ... These are the best of the Chan entries I have seen so far the current memory with every idea connected (though, of course, if I look at them closely, there may be holes, though I can't think right now). And "No. 2 Son" Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) is a bit helpful when he first identifies the poison that prematurely leads in some murders, but of course he loses a little later. Under the returning supporting film of the last Chan movie Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum, blonde Joan Valerie such as June Preston and Stanley Blystone, whose brother John G. helmed called a lost Chan one Charlie Chan's Chance, as a fingerprint expert. Beautiful plot especially with an exciting climax aboard a bomber. Oh, and look for a certain Stooge at a police line ...
