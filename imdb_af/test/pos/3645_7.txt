As I have already said, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. He is just as aggravating. I wish Sylvester would just eat him and survive it. <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, Sly is again homeless and is back to rubbish from rubbish bins. He sees a ship leaving the harbor nearby and decides to board aboard if he is eating Tweety is one of the passengers. <br /> <br /> The ship offers an adequate stage for the next hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid sea sickness. If only for once, he manages to chew and swallow, so that the annoying Canary Islands will be completed forever. But, like cartoons that go to Tweety, it's okay, but that's ALL thanks to the brilliant cat.
