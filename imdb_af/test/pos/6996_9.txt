As a sci-fi movie fan, I also love Alien. But Pitch Black is definitely better than Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. It works well in Alien series. But it's not alien, it's something else. OK, enough comparisons. This movie, but I think: Why are people afraid of the dark. You can't run away from dark. This is impossible. You must be confronted with the darkness and with it in the dark. In this movie I also liked that the Vin Diesel character Richard B. Riddick was not a typical good boy. He had a secret and has done bad things in the past. For the other people, he is a hero who tries to save them all. First, he wants to get out of that planet himself. There are also other metaphors in this story. Every big sci-fi fan should see this photo.
