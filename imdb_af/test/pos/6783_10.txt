This game is one of the best horror / shooter games I've ever played. The plot is a bit bumpy, but the game never fails to send you enough chills and excitement. Many people left the game when they found that there were no cake codes and there were very few drinks and ammunition. But actually, once you've gone through the game, you're more familiar with the monsters and different rooms, so you can easily find the second time. The puzzles are wonderful, not too difficult, not too easy. There are tons of different samples, so you never get bored. And there are many play areas. You really feel like you're in a good Stephen King novel while you're playing. It's nice and creepy. Choose this game cheap and enjoy it.
