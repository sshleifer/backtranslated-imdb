The man I was fired I can give feedback for this 10 minute skirt. I love it. <br /> <br /> After I didn't see it, I touched it the other day and watched it over and over. <br /> <br /> "Stop shaking your eyes" and "shake a rock and roll band" and "stop the saw from the table" is freaking classic lines. <br /> <br /> The art is wonderfully raw. The dialogue is sparse and wonderful. Just find it and love it. Can't recommend it enough. <br /> <br /> Thanks for the high school teacher Ms. Kogan getting it over and over Thank you NFB for making it.Thanks MTS to show it (free at least at the moment). <br /> <br /> Now I want a Big Snit t-shirt. Have an animation tick, but at 440.00 a doll, it won't happen. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and watch it.
