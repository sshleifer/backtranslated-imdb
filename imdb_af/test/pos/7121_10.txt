Gamers: DR is not a fancy movie, it's more like amateur video. Terrible magical effect, really fake fireball, terribly made dungeon, castle, village ...... sword, ax, shield, cloak, plate ..... okok ... everything. You will need about 10 minutes to adjust your expectations for visuals. Then you get 105 minutes of fun. <br /> <br /> I'm from Hong Kong and it's really hard to find RPers. None of my friends play RPG. I always want to be one of the characters in the world of D&D. Gamers watch: DR just shows me how to be a gamer. You see line books, dice, games, etc. You hear terms like "warrior", "wizard", "hit point", "level", "character", "flaming hand", "chaotic evil". <br /> <br /> Whatever RPG fancy to me it does everything you want, not bound by software RPG. Gamers: DR provides the same element, you will not know what happens next and it will probably only kill you. The movie is about the gamers' real life as well as the D&D world. You will hear that the gamer throws the dice when the character takes action, which makes you feel like you're really part of the game. <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil anything, but briefly, Gamers: DR is a must see movie for RPG lovers. RPG games never play for people, I'm sure you'll still get a lot of fun out there.
