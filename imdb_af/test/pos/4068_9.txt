Despite all the negative criticism, I really enjoyed this movie. I don't say it lightly. I love movies and are pretty picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are OK, some I don't like). And to everyone with criticism: it's a comedy. I just love this movie. It is light, funny and very quiet. I'm aware of all (or most) of the shortcomings, but I love it. The comic talents of Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro are typed (fully - for this kind of movie). Don't compare it to other movies with these star actors, just enjoy it. The movie is wonderful and I believe the purpose of this movie has been fully achieved. If you want a very "easy" and very quiet night, watch this movie. DeNiro and Murphy just had fun making this movie, so we should (watch it). And, please don't be so negative. Don't expect Godfather performances or meet DeNiro's parents, don't be expected from Murphy. It is a completely different genre, and it made me relax after a hard day's work. Your sides may not be split from the shave, but it's still VERY funny.
