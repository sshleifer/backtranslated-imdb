John Voight plays the title character in this movie based on author of author Pat Conroy (Prince of Tides). A good teacher film, it tells the story of a naive Pat Conroy, a young English teacher whose first mission is in a primary school on a rural island. The only white man on the island has to fight internal and external pressures while trying to create education and values ​​in children who have been systematically denying such things to generations. A solid performance that really makes you think.
