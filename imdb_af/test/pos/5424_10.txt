Richard Condie's perfect insanity cartoon 'The Big Snit' is a journey through qwerkyness, infirmity, hillarity, pleasant backgrounds, melting characters and a conclusion that brings me to happy tears almost every time. <br /> <br /> I have been doing this over and over and over and over and over again and I never did it (luckily it was on the band of a broadcast on TV) !! It never ceases to burst out uncontrollably into laughter, and then into the depths of my mind in the light of the greatness of the human condition. <br /> <br /> Because if someone says, "Let's finish the game". Everything is right in the world and the problems we face every day suddenly realize that all small things do not have to fight or worry anymore. . This movie only looks like a simple cartoon slapstick humor exercise, but it's much more than that. This film makes a greater sense of spiritual significance with humanity in the aftermath of everything as bad and trivial. <br /> <br /> It's flawless ... in every way. AND DAMN FUNNY TOO;) <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10.
