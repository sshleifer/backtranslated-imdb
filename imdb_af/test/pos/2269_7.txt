"Everything is enlightened" is a simplified interpretation of just over half of the Jonathan Safran Foer novel. This version is about the changes in Eastern Europe from World War II to the Cold War and how the younger generation relates to history as a family reminder. <br /> <br /> Debut Director / Adapter Liev Schreiber retains some of the novel's humor and language clashes, mostly by the wonderful Eugene Hutz as the US fraudulent tourist guide in the US. He is so conspicuous that the film becomes more of his odyssey in his country and his family than he is from his comfortable environment in sophisticated Odessa to the heart of a cynical, isolated country devastated by the Communists and now capitalists, with both Jews and non-Jews as detritus. Just as funny as his opening styles are when he establishes his fiery bravura, we later feel his fish-out water in his own country when he tries to ask local yokels directions. <br /> <br /> Shreiber uses Elijah Wood as the American tourist as a tight tooth in a visual panic, as his character is less verbal than one of the narrators in the book. He and Hutz play each other well to the conclusion that in this streamlined plot become more sentimental. As soon as the grandfather's story took over in the last quarter of the film, miraculously and unpredictably drawn up by Boris Leskin, the younger generation does not seem to be undergoing a catharsis, as they just clean up the closure. <br /> <br /> Schreiber does a wonderful job of visualizing man's urge to document history. One of his consultants in the credits is Professor Yaffa Eliach and her style of remembering the pre-Holocaust's life through artefacts that have clearly inspired the appearance and are very powerful and effective. <br /> <br /> The Czech Republic stands for Ukraine and the design design staff could find unforgettable symbols of changes in cities, towns and countryside, as it is now a road movie and the long drive - Scenes a little. Schreiber retains some of the symbolism of the book, especially of the moon and river, but to cut out the parts of the book that it explains, they look beautiful or ominous to atmosphere and no longer represent time and need. <br /> <br /> Like W.C. Fields would have predicted, the dog stealing most of its scenes for easy laughter. Generally, Schreiber goes for more poignancy than the book. It becomes irresistible, especially for those who haven't read the book, but less morally and emotionally messy. <br /> <br /> The movie is largely exalted by its wonderful soundtrack, ranging from Hutz's gypsy band songs to traditional songs to contemporary songs to Paul Cantelon's klezmer fusion score. <br /> <br /> This is not a Holocaust movie per se, it is a kind of mirror image of the Train of Life (Train de vie) than of the memory of a time now met with meaning but will resonate more with those who have an emotional connection to that history.
