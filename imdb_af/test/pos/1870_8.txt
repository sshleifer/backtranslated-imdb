I saw this title again on Shemaroo. I also asked my cousin who was 17 to look with me. I'm 35 and he's 17. He liked it and I did too. It's still funny, a little childish once, but still very clean. Satish Shah is hilarious in several roles. This sitcom will perform even better than many of the recent TV series. But, of course, some people love everyday rates that come out today. It would have been nice that Shafi Inamdar would continue for all seasons. He no longer lives today. I'd like if anyone could list all the episodes here. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the lines? Yeh Kya Ho Raha HAi "" What a relief "" Kaat Daalu Boss "" Vyavhaar shark Vyavhaar "" 30 year Ka Experience shark "<br /> <br /> and the title track Yeh Jo hai Zindagi, we learn the Live life as it comes and enjoy it. The life of ordinary people. <br /> <br /> I still like this sitcom, it may not be so funny, but some episodes are still hilarious.
