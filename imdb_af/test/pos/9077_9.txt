* Flat SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Five fellow students, Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland), David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), Joe Hurley (William Baldwin) and Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt) on ' try an experiment to die for exactly 5 minutes (this is the maximum time someone can do before the risk of brain damage). <br /> <br /> Almost everyone does this experiment, Randy is the only exception, but they start unwelcome visitors; David sees a little black girl insulting him, Joe sees all the women he had sex with (and what he made video) ask him why the TV screen, Rachel revives her father's suicide and Nelson faces' a small boy with murderous intentions. <br /> <br /> Why are they here? And how will they get rid of them? This tense and interesting film, located in a hallowed city and in a Gothic Med School, is quite the experience, both for the story and the characters played by then-emerging stars such as Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Oliver Platt , Kevin Bacon and William Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The director is Joel Schumacher, who has already worked with Sutherland in 'Lost Boys', and this second collaboration is even better than the first. <br /> <br /> A must for psychologist-thriller horror buttons and metaphor lovers (this story is about forgiveness and rectification of past iniquities), this is one of the under-age classics of the 80's who even gets respect today, like the mention by Rebecca Gayheart in 'Scream 2' or the Tru Calling episode that featured the movie. <br /> <br /> Flatliners: 9/10.
