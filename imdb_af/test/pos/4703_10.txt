I went to the Sundance Film Festival in a screening of SISTER HELEN and didn't know what to expect. <br /> <br /> I was cut by people in this documentary sound. Sister Helen is an amazing character !!! The filmmakers captured the essence of sister Helen's wonderful soul and unknown to me in a world. I was thoroughly satisfied with the trip and was totally impressed by the end of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie talks to those who want a second chance in life.
