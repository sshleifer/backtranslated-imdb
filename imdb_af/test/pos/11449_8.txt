A bunch of mostly unpleasant and grossly unpleasant teenage years go to a flu, secluded, outdated old mortuary near a cemetery to do anything. The entire Halloween party is hosted by freaky, occult, obsession oddball Mimi Kinkade and her hearty son-hungry bimbette friend Linnea Quigley. The mere, ominous, bizarre, sex-happy dipstick, looks like a joke (very bad idea, because the desert's old dive is, of course, claimed to be haunted by demonic spirits). Of course, the uncontrolled season awakens the modest, uncomfortable and hostile evil spirits that horribly kill and possess a majority of the children, turn them into ugly, captive, cleaved, calved, murderous ghouls, causing the usual horror of devastation throughout the whole a particularly long, dark and disturbing night of pure terror. Yes, it is essentially your most graphic and unmistakable wall-to-wall cheap shock-ridden "Evil Dead" rehash, full of locked, there is no easy way out, but a single-phobic self-populated, excessively excessive shabby pieces, a ceaselessly terrifying synthesizer score, a total sense of dark and fearless nightmare, and alive in African manic care kinematics (the expected head-length induction of hyperactive hand-camera work, smooth, thin detection shots, crooked camera angles, even the camera on a dolly that makes a funny 180-tomb with a grave figure). Fortunately, Kevin S. Tenney's smooth, assured, attractive direction keeps the extremely thin and distracted performance thundering on a quick clip; Tenny also gives the film an attractive, seasoned look, effectively creating a certain, rugged, energetic and enthusiastic grotesque, haunting, eye-arching carnival funhouse atmosphere. <br /> <br /> But Steve Johnson's wonderfully imaginative and imaginative makeup effects are the true star of the show. Blood-thirsty highlights include disgusting fat slob Hal Havins (who played a similar annoying obese a hole in the immortal "Sorority Babes in the Slimball Bowl A-Rama") while his tongue was bitten, Quigley a whole shot a spoonful in one of her breasts (yow!) and threw a guy's eyes while she loves him (double yow!), a deadly teenage couple arriving while doing exactly what you think in a coffin ( the chick broke her neck while the man cut off his arm), Kinkade set her hands on fire and in the movie's most dirty scene, an average old man has his throat slit from inside to eating an apple piece cut with razor blades. The trashy'n'thrashy rock score also smokes. And then there is Kinkade's incredibly wild, sexy and unobstructed demon dance, a sizzling number, accompanied by a flickering stroboscopic color and surprising jerks that Kinkade choreographed herself. Okay, so this overall is nothing more than a completely unrelenting and useless one, even though it is quite nicely mounted and a vulgar hungry scary horror piglet, but if you are in the mood for an entertaining brain-dead misconduct. youth trouble makes the trick good.
