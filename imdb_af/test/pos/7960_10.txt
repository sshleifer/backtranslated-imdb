A small town photographer Gunsan in South Korea learns that he has a terminal illness, but its seriousness to his family and friends. We never discover the nature of the disease, but the main focus of Hur Jin-ho's terrible first film Christmas in August is not his illness. This is the grace in which he performs his life - his ability to accept what life has without repentance. Unfortunately, it was the final film shot by the movie Yoo Young's chick before his death. The film is dedicated to his memory. <br /> <br /> The photographer, Jung-won, is played by Han Suk-kyu, at one time, Korea's most popular star. A beautiful man in his early thirties with a contagious laugh, he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to portray him as the end of life approaches. Jung-won owns a small photography store and lives at home with his hard-of-hearing father (Goo Shin) and sister (Oh Ji-hye), teaches his dad how to play movies on the video recorder, and writes instructions for him to take over his shop if he would die. As Jung-won deals with the daily business of getting his business in order, Dar-im (Shim Eun-ha), a meter reader, comes in his shop with an urgent request for some photographic enhancements. <Br /> <br /> Suddenly and impatiently, he treats her with contempt but apologizes and becomes regular as a client. Without open expression of romantic feelings, their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their very nature, the place where they come from. To protect Dar-im from suffering, Jung-won does not tell him that he has only a short time to live, but that does not make the situation easier for her. His growing absence from the shop inevitably causes her to be betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop's window. Although Jung-won's decision to withhold Dar im's disease, it is organic for his character in the film and is not merely used as a plot device or an excuse for the character to live to the full. don't leave. by playing. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful rows in the movie is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a photo of herself. Jung-won makes sure the picture is exactly the same, knowing that he will soon take his own image of remembrance. Christmas in August is a pretentious movie that never considers melodrama to make its point. It's about the pleasure in ordinary moments: cycling, joking, eating ice, caring and feeling thoughtful and feeling good about what life offers. It's a love story where love means to say you're sorry. Although there were many films about the death process, Christmas jumps in the new genre in August and in the process offers a memorable comment on the human condition. Unfortunately, this film about death is an experience of the greatest joy.
