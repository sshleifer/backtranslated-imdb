'Oldboy' director Park Chun-wook returns with what should be one of the latest and most serious vampire sticks in film history. <br /> <br /> Trusting the latest Hollywood whine, vampires are supposed to be rather rather non-violent, asexual, love-lorn Chevaliers instead of the evil rampant sexual blood-sucking mind-manipulating man-cattle of fore. That's the movie you want to see if you want to remember the tough excitement of the past ... well, at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> 'Thirst' begins with a long character depiction that culminates in a slightly different love story. The priest's vampire transformation is placed along the romantic and sexual aspects of the story over a period of time, which provides an uncomfortable display. But the last 40 minutes or so is surprisingly gory. Well, maybe not as surprising as you are 'Oldboy' and 'I'm a Cyborg, but it's OK,' but it's fair to say that 'Dorst' beats Park's earlier films in terms of violence in your face. <br /> <br /> All in all, be warned that it is not an artificial cinema or an abomination. It can be too bad for many and too short for some. 'Thirst' is original, entertaining and fortunately a little less strange than Park Chun's earlier efforts.
