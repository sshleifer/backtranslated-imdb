When the ad was first advertised, the ads made it look ridiculous. When I saw it, it was pretty good. Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) spent her days on the computer and never got to know her neighbors. Then, through a series of events, her identity is erased by a gossip of shady people, and she can't prove that she exists. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the movie are a bit far-fetched; you will probably know which parts if you saw the movie. Yet it is a good look at what the existence of the internet may have on unsuspecting people. I recommend it.
