Having grown up with GWTW, I have so far avoided both the "Scarlett" sequel and the mini series. When I first watched the video for the first time, I was amazed at how much I enjoyed watching Timothy Dalton's depiction of Rhett Butler and Joanne Walley-Kilmer as Scarlet. I feel "Scarlet" needs to be judged on its own merits, rather than trying any comparison with the venerable Selznick masterpiece GWTW. While the "Scarlet" story line and some of the dialogue suffered from lack of inspired writing, I thought it was a valuable dramatization of what could have been between Scarlett and Rhett.
