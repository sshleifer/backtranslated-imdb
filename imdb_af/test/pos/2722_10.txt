From "36 Chowringhee Lane" to "15 Park Avenue", Aparna Sen did indeed travel a long way. If the first one in history falls to a clean sweep of butter, the latter will definitely cut a special place as an "adult" movie. Until you see 15 Park Avenue, you can't be excited to feel excited at the same time. Experience to see the directors' ingenuity and agility in portraying serious challenging situations and moving through the sensitivity of the entire film. It's not a movie that just makes you feel 'tchh tchh, how difficult life has to be for schizophrenia, but asks you a much deeper question about the reality you see and believe. Sen has done a brilliant job of emphasizing this pure fact of our existence that we all somehow try to live in a self-image world, trying to run into mirages, called happiness, peace, satisfaction. Along with the portrayal of a deceptive mind, Sen's magic brought many tiny nuances of human relationships to sustain stress and tension. The fact that we sometimes get calm, break down, make wrong choices, be found guilty, act selfishly, and so on, is taken by Sen with nerve adroitness. She showed the cruel dilemma Shabana had to deal with throughout her life. , to choose for herself between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with a man and children. And in the act of always being next to her sister, always being a strong persona, giving support, making judgments, she unknowingly cut off the oxygen that her sister had to bleed. Isn't it a very hard truth that at times, in an effort to do the best for someone, we strangle our self-esteem and ultimately do their self-esteem? Of course, Konkona and Shabana's plays are always the reason why the ingredients were not as good. The dish could not have been so strange. Aparna Sen once again made a masterpiece of a movie for those who desire a few "food-for-thought". Bravo!
