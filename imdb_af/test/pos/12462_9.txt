Where this movie is true to Burroughs' vision, it is excellent; where it comes from Burroughs, it is wonderful. It is a story of family, from looking for a father through a real and emotional orphan. Lambert talks about one of the most distressed lines in all movies "He was my Father!" is enough to bring tears into the eyes of the most cynical critic. Not a perfect movie - the notorious over-doubling of McDowell's voice by Glenn Close is unpredictable and only explicit in terms of a very British mistake - but a fine as a defective masterpiece and a noble farewell to Sir Ralph Richardson.
