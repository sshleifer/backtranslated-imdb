It's a tough movie to review, as several factors need to be considered. Let's filter the more judgmental. And you're interested in the facts about Jeffrey Dahmer's killer? Can you resist an independent, low-budget movie? Are you objective enough to NOT hold a movie just because of its lack of stars or professional appearance? Well, if you say yes, you should have an open mind to handle this one. This film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and subsequent murder, and is founded as an autobiography. This is not a glamorous, unrealistic account that unfortunately was the movie "Dahmer" (2001). The movie started with Dahmer, played Carl Crew very convincingly and sat in the police car while attacking his apartment. His thoughts on what gets him there are presented in an outdated, narrated style that explains many of Dahmer's psychoses and motives that led him to kill almost 20 times. We learn to know the character, both the dividing side and the side that has come moderately close to a normal life. It's not someone's fault, but Dahmer is 17 people dead, but as a criminal psychology student, I was more than just representing his animalistic side, truth, in this movie. You see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother and trying to find companion, but of course we see the side of him who remembers everyone. It should be noted that there is little real violence on the screen, much of it suggestive of shots such as bloodshed or a body struck by a blurred curtain. You see two deaths I remember, one is a beautiful bloodless throat and the other is a man who has been moved alive into a barrel of acid. While you see nothing graphically, this cruelty and convincing action by both Crew and his victim make it a disturbing scene. And while the actual screen is mutilated, you'll see the results. There is a prop hand and head or two, but it seems to disturb the viewer and does not look exploitable. In addition, these false anatomical pieces are where budget constraints are visible. Although acceptable, they look like fakes, not to be disturbing. The movie actually ends before Dahmer's death in 1994, due to the fact that it was released a year or two earlier. It's about the only big difference from the real story, and the information left is, as I said, a lot of truth to the facts. The movie quality can be better, the dialogue often sounds a bit too quiet and the acting of several characters is a little hammy, but it is not overboard. In my opinion, this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look at one of America's most revered serial killers. I think it's safe to say the movie is also memorable, and I respect it to overcome its limitations to deliver the story in a credible way, with the help of a superbly excellent Carl Crew and Dahmer.
