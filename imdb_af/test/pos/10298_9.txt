"L'Apartment" should be one of the best French movies I've ever seen (along with "Hatred", also Vincent Cassel, and the great Gerard Depardieu / Pierre Richard movies). Cassel and Bellucci are wonderful in the forefront. Apart from "Brotherhood Of The Wolves" and "Dobermann" I haven't seen a bad movie with this couple yet. "L'Apartment" sucks you from the beginning and the turn and turn keeps you excited to the end. Fragment storytelling doesn't really work as well since "Pulp Fiction". Let's hope there won't be a divine American reminder of this unique romance / mysterious thriller. (EDIT: Guess what! A God's American remake is made!)!
