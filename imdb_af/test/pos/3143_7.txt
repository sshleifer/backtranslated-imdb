Perry Mason: The case of fatal fashion finds Perry and Della Street in New York an award from the American Bar Association. An unlucky trial record should get recognition what I would think. Anyway, a friend of Della's fashion editor, Diana Muldaur, was arrested for killing a rival, Valerie Harper, and in fact Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale witnessed a two-man confrontation at a nice dining room . <br /> <br /> These two competitors have a thing that looks like Hedda and Louella like schoolgirls. Of course, Harper has a number of other people who just loved her. <br /> <br /> The same offender also ran a fashion designer who could have exposed the individual. It throws Perry along with his trusted investigative lawyer, William Moses, in an alliance with some people. Looks like the designer was a cousin of a gang boss who also wants to find justice in their usual way. <br /> <br /> One thing I couldn't find was when Moses and the murderer Robert Clohessy found the offender. I can't believe the police didn't keep the fight either. Of course, Clohessy has access to resources not only police have. <br /> <br /> But the best part of this particular Mason entry is Scott Baio as the young, rather full of himself Assistant District Attorney who introduces him to Raymond Burr saying he has studied all his cases and him looked forward to hitting him. Foolish Boy. <br /> <br /> In fact, my favorite scene is Burr and Baio at a sidebar with the judge. Baio wanted to reopen his case and add a witness and prepare with precedents. Burr wakes him up and says he has no objection to the new witness and then continues to scrape the witness over cross-examination. Absolutely priceless. <br /> <br /> Scott Baio is the best thing in this particular Perry Mason movie and it has to be seen for himself alone.
