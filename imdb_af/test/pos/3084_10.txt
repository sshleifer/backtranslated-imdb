Cary Elwes has to say a better performance when Costner did in RHPOT, but anyway. <br /> <br /> To say this movie, it makes me just as much because the actors really look into what they are doing and you just sit there and think what the hell they are, but on a lot of very good way. The random bursts of songs were brilliant and good and the musical score I really enjoyed. Good decisions and as before said so in their roles <br /> <br /> 10/10 challenging me <br /> <br /> 'Unlike another Robin Hood. I can speak with an English accent '
