Despite some acceptable adjustments to the books' main themes, the King of the Lady / Vampire Lestat did not faithfully tell Anne Rices's intricate story. The deep layers that build up all the characters are cut off only on their surface, if not a completely different identity. The chronological order of the main events in the movie was warped and uneven. <br /> <br /> However, there were quite a few things the movie did to earn my score of 7. One was that the film greatly influenced the influence of the film. who had Lestat (among others vampires) to the public, especially young girls. The film also did a pretty good job focusing on the importance of heredity and history, after which the vampires were proud. The sensual scenes were also satisfactorily atmospheric. <br /> <br /> The play in the QUEEN of the DAMNED was moderate, but disappointing. Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah have a surprising chemistry, but it only shows when the play is at its best (not very often). The characters are nothing compared to those established in VAMPIRE MAINTENANCE. It also lacks the emotional intelligence of THE SAY OF ALL SAINE, which is a shame because Rys Queen of the Hidden Book had it and more. <br /> <br /> This movie does not give everything it seems to be. The effects are boring and very disappointing. The exuberance required in many scenes is not given, and the dialogue is tempting. The settings for many scenes are not how I suggested them in the book, and I think many of them have not even been taken out of the story. There are only a few areas of incoherence near the beginning and the middle of the movie, but it keeps pretty neat and gives the viewer a full story (if they haven't read the book). <br /> <br /> Somethings that I need the movie include a good original score (Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein), instead of the mix of rock music; although I had no problems with some of the songs. Another thing that would make the movie better is better. The scenery was boring and unclear. This is important in a story that moves around very often. <br /> <br /> Overall, THE KING OF THE DAMNED was an unevenly disappointing but somewhat satisfying adaptation to the important novel. With a few simple changes it might have been a very successful piece of film work. I would recommend this movie for people who have seen INTERVIEW or read the books so they can make their own opinion on the adjustment.
