Following the lines of the classic formula to a point to take another leap from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the coolest repetitions of his time. John Carpenter outlines a fairly vague scenario about some things (or perhaps very descriptive who knows), who gained incredible miserable, brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh, detached environment. Carpenter sets up his characters. The film captures the story of a group stationed in a research bunker, in the midst of an Arctic climate, deployed against a malicious force taking on other people's forms. It is given a full life by Carpenter's choice of tones and surprises. For someone following Howard Hawks's footsteps, the film maker here has more confidence and talent in performing the material than most given the opportunity to go back to an old movie. <br /> <br /> With the effect people work to full power - between what is likely to follow Backdraft than most fire per scene (it can be left overs, but it fits in after a while in tension) - the actors pull together as a fine ensemble. Unlike the group in Predator, it's mostly just ordinary working guys, with the leader coming in the Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent). Juicy supporting roles are out of the game for Wilkes Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the kind of absurdity of what is going on in the film (a stranger who starts with dogs and then moves on the other in a greedy, demented transforming form) is a pit against such a timing with everyone. I sometimes loved the long silences, with Ennio Morricone's haunting, curious music in the background (and that baseline is in itself merit). <br /> <br /> It is important to be heard as nothing else that strives to hear its genre / cult. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a scarce race of horror movie where the story is clearly and precisely stated on the basis of the position of the camera, dialogue and timing with the screens. That's not to say the movie isn't full of violence, it's and almost a few times it's almost funny. But as it goes back to what looks ridiculous like a passing era, the creatures / makeup, along the steady, well-calculated writing, are completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and atmospheres to a T.
