hello <br /> <br /> Blades are a sensational action movie. the hero (Wesley Snipes) and the villain justified their roles. <br /> <br /> The movie's action series are better than Matrix! <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes is one of the best action heroes ever. <br /> <br /> If you like action / vampire movies, it's the ONE. <br /> <br /> Considering the fact that so many vampire movies have been made, the theme is pretty good. But that's the best of them. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the ride.
