"Closet Land" is sponsored by Amnesty International and has many political overtones, but there is so much more to this richly moving story than that ... <br /> <br /> It's not just about the political tension at the end of the 80s - it's about the personal prosecution that a woman has placed herself as a child molested by a family friend. We see the subtle reference to the parallels of a dishonest government / society structure and the culture of sexual predation where one in four young children is molested and one in every three women experienced a kind of rape. <br /> <br /> For me, a cold-and-egg question is being denounced: make the attitude of our sexual oppression, which leads to predation, the political environment of fear and censorship, or push the socio political dysfunction a culture of sexual predation? The psychological consequences of the question even ask us where we are brought to develop our own answers. <br /> <br /> In the end, our young female writer (Stowe) has a similar moment to the one at the end of Hensen's "Labyrinth" - she realizes in one shiny, brilliant moment that the idea of ​​her power by stealing the secret police (Rickman) from her is an illusion. No one can steal your power - they can only trick you into giving it up, and then you have the right to take it back at any time. <br /> <br /> It is not a movie that needs to be entered lightly and you absolutely must do it. The minimalist aspects, along with the childish animation, stir the deepest parts of the psyche and leave no viewer unchanged.
