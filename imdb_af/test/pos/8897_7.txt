It's a pity that Asterix and his friend Obelix don't get the worldwide recognition that other comic comic characters get. <br /> <br /> It's another funny Asterix cartoon captured with entertainment. The animation is excellent and the voice characterization is good, even if the synchronization is a bit out. The music and the score are good in the story and the setback of some modern music numbers is a fine touch. <br /> <br /> Running time is short and while it's not the best Asterix story or the most developed cartoon, it's good fun. The modern (Disney-like) animation will catch kids, Asterix fans and new arrivals ... Enjoy the Gaul adventure!
