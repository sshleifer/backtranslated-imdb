Great movie from the late 1970s. Say a lot about corporate corruption at the expense of the ordinary person, so that the powerful can get, get big profits and ignore the environment and safety of others. <br /> <br /> Almost 30 years later, this film is compelling about the power of some corporate entities that have received ten folds of control ability since the release of the films; It shows the need for public regulation against powerful business interests whose primary goal is profit. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon is brilliant, while Jane Fonda and Micheal Douglas are just as compelling in their roles. The sensible 70's where too many are condemned, release this movie the decade. <br /> <br /> A movie that looks better after each look.
