Chuck Jones' 'Beep Beep' is the second of the exceptionally popular Road Runner series, and is a major improvement on its predecessor, the historically important but slim 'Fast and Hairy'. While it contains several predictable quickfire gags, 'Beep Beep' also expands on that initial cartoon with more ambitious, longer rows. Head under this is a fantastic, extended chase through an old mine in which we see the Coyote and the Road Runner represented by two small lights. There is also a very funny longer ghost that includes some rocket-powered roller skates. 'Beep Beep' also sees a great improvement in the representation of Wile E. Coyote. Not only does he look more attractive than his scruffy prototype in 'Fast and Furry-ous', but he also draws the audience into the cartoon with a greater degree of looking at the camera to the brilliance of his idea or his fear of threatening to indicate pain. Although it is a bit slow to go (too many persistent shots of blueprints prevent the pace of some early gags), as soon as 'Beep Beep' arrives at the pattern ring, it is clear that Jones is a true handle on these characters and greater possibilities of what he could do with them. There are better Road Runner cartoons than 'Beep Beep', but there is a real sense of triumph over this cartoon, as if it was the confirmation that a series of this scenario has been milked.
