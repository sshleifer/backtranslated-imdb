I agree with the Aussie's remarks for the most part. However, there seems to be a fairly decent plot, if not original. Christina (Kelli McCarty) inherits a rural property that she plans to open a mountain home. She is recognized with Chip (Bobby Johnston), who she knew when she grew up there. The plot thickens when James (Paul Logan) arrives at his new stripper friend, Shene (Devinn Lane), because Christina has been James's stripper friend for years. The implication is that James did somehow wrong her. To add an interest in the film Sophia Linn (Monique Parent), a novel as a guest appears at the lodge, such as Eric (Sebastien Guy) and Linda (Flower), a few city lawyers. James pushes the local building codes inspector on Christina's business as one of his dirty tricks to close her. So the question is, "How far does James go to sabotage the lodge and will he succeed?" <br /> <br /> Look for Devinn Lane here and in "Beauty betrayed." She seems to be a transition from the hard core business to the "R" world. Another noteworthy thing is Samantha McConnell, who plays the role of "Aas", clearly the most outrageous character name in the movies!
