It was really a deep moving movie in every sense of the word. I myself was a Mormon missionary and I know firsthand the will to complete my mission, but at the same time hide the fact that I was gay. Like the character Aaron, I was sent home to be found out and wiped out, but the only Mormon in a family of Catholics was not as sorry as it was for the main character. This movie really took me the days and helped my years later realize how happy I was to have a family that accepted me and understood what I was going through. I found myself ending a movie when Aaron and Christian found each other again at Lila's Restaurant. I was really moved to tears. I recommend this movie to anyone who reads this review and also states that it should be a must.
