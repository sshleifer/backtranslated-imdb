I'm not a movie, but I'm not familiar with the names of leading directors, screenwriters, producers and the like, but I can tell a great movie if I see one. <br /> <br /> The creators of this fine movie can now be on top of their fields, or may soon be there. I know the actors are already there. <br /> <br /> It takes talent closer to genius to show with such a realism how a national tragedy like Vietnam has influenced the everyday life of a typical average American family and let's see. There are so many homeless Vietnam veterans. <br /> <br /> Without getting into free scenes of gore and bloodshed, let us understand why so many people you had had flashbacks on what they were spending. /> <br /> The dialogue is extremely poignant and gives us an idea of ​​what happens in so many families in the aftermath of Vietnam. <br /> <br /> I wish there were more good movies like this one, not just about Vietnam, but also about other social conditions.
