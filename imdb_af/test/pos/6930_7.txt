To suspect, this movie involves two actors (Caine and Moran) trying to make a gunman. The plot is at its best poor, as several plot holes occur throughout. However, this should not be normal, as the comedy should carry such a film. There are some really funny bits (mostly by Dylan Moran). Other times, however, there are long melodramatic scenes that do not add anything to the movie. Caine's character was exaggerated to me. Especially at the beginning, he constantly picks up Shakespeare and acts like a pumpkin actor. One can say he plays the part right, but the character seemed to me flat and unfunny. Overall I would say just see as a fan of the actors concerned. Otherwise wait for video or TV.
