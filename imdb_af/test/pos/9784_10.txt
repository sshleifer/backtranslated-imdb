Critics claim that this movie is one of the worst movies ever. Watchers also demand the same. But there is a flip side on that coin. They are wrong, very wrong. This is the most clever movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> From start to finish you see a story that is unrealistic. A story that reflects the real world. This movie is like a mirror. You see yourself in another way people see. To really understand the directors' position, you have to see it again. <br /> <br /> When you see this movie ... Try to understand the story (and look at the background) ... Listen to the lyrics of the music ... And smell the industrial complexes. .. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of a kind. You will hate it (most people do) or you will love it very much. <br /> <br /> Ernest Hemmingway once said, "The world is a good place and worth fighting." I agree with the second part.
