Well, I tend to watch movies for one of three reasons. Unfortunately, there are no Transformers in this movie, so I can only recommend it to comedy value and pretty women. (Read girls) <br /> <br /> Yes, it's funny, I know this because of the number of people in the theater who laughed regularly. Personally, I love Laura Fraser, whose IMHO is FIT!
