It's NOT the masterpiece that Snow White, Cinderella or Bambi is, but it is a very nice, pleasant, romantic, well done Disney animation. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are lessons included. for the kiddies and some very suitable kiddie cheeks, but there is also plenty for the adults. <br /> <br /> While it's a bit of a thrill at the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still has elements that belong exclusively to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the "tramp" and Dutchess is the "lady", but Dutchess has several kittens and they all try to get home. <br /> <br /> Phil Harris is our Tomcat O'Malley. You may recognize his voice, as he also provided the voice of Baloo the Bear in the Jungle Book, and Little John in Disney's Robin Hood. Eva Gabor gives her sweet sweet voice to Dutchess. <br /> <br /> Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, who directs or works on every Disney animated film mentioned until his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> It's my favorite of the Disney animated feature films, and belongs to any Disney collection. The 2-disc special edition is the result of this summer (2007). <br /> <br /> These rates are 8.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
