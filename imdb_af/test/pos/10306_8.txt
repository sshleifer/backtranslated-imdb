I agree with Andy, it's a good movie. Kevin McKidd's character is credible in the film. We are forced to hate him and sympathize with the latter. Paula Sage who plays Roberta also presents a good performance. It is alluring and emotional without any surplus. Credit to director Alison Peebles and author Andrea Gibb for this. A very valuable look. The pace of the movie is just right, but just enough interest in the subject to flush you, rather than bombarding you with facts in a documentary style. Nice little soundtrack to go with the movie, use it sparingly, not to distract from story. Recommended.
