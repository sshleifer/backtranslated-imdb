I am surprised that mines have so far been the only comment on this tsv. movie ... as far as i know, the series itself had a huge impact, adjudicators and real people, praised it to a person. Anyway, let me tell you right away that, if I'm a sucker for eager police dramas, you'll like "The Lost Child" Tennison, the heroine, throughout the "Prime Suspect" series. Male police station, throughout the series, comes to her current, relatively strong position in the police hierarchy through hard work, stubbornness and mere talent for police work. She is essentially an ambitious career woman, but she has a romantic side and is definitely not a man-hater. Unfortunately, her relationships are affected by the bad hours her profession requires, and she never married. When she conceives her of her latest affair, she is confronted with the choice to become a mother and endanger her entire police work, let alone future progress, or abortion - for which she prefers. This abortion never waits great in the ensuing drama. It is treated very skillfully, in less than a few minutes, a wonder of economics in mini-dissertation and editing - but it's always there as a counterpart for Tennison's desperate efforts to find another. "lost child" - a kidnapping victim - before it's too late. The story takes many twists and turns, before the surprise ends, and one is fascinated by the plot and characters (although I have surpassed the many villains a bit), the police and especially Tennison are not always competent and not so adaptable not, what figures, given the unpleasant work they have to do, in the shaky underworld that this series usually holds. <br /> <br /> Mirren herself said she would not make any more films in the series, but excellent because she was always in the role of Tennison, the series itself as an actor proves another addiction from my -Dick Wolf's American "Law & Order" - who appears in it, each one can last forever. Just like my fiery hope.
