I'm sure people from the US don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they shouldn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrites as the US. The only places where sex between teenagers is agreed is illegal, the US and the Islamic nations. In France, for example, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it is 14. In Spain it is 12. Therefore, the teenage actors, 16 and 17 at the production, do not do anything illegal. Nudity is not considered large-scale in almost all civilized countries. And just a freak can consider a teenager's love as child molestation.
