The 80's are largely regarded as the decade in which horror decided to have fun. Sometimes there were some definite brains behind it all ("Evil Dead II", "Night of the Creeps" and "Return of the Living Dead" for example) and then there were those movies that were contemptible but a clear low rent had charm and was perfect for an evening with beer and friends. Movies like 'Pieces' and 'Blood Diner' stacked rental shelves in the 80s and 90s, with little in intelligence or craftsmanship, but much in silence. Kevin Tenney's 1988 film "Night of the Demons" is part of this stupid tradition, poorly acted and not an original leg in his body, but dammit if you don't have good time. <br /> <br /> The plot is so simplistic that it only comes from the 80's: a group of dumb teenagers played by a lot of actors in their mid to late 20s, decide to go to a festival at Hull House to go by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) and Suzanne (Scream Queen Legend Linnea Quigley.) Well, Angela and co. decided to cast a session. It seems like Will Arnett's "Arrested Development" character Gob would call it a "Big Fail" because a demonic force soon possesses Angela, and also begins with the other. <br /> <br /> Take 'The Evil Dead', a nightmare on Elm Street 'and your average dumb dead teen movie, throw it in a blender and' Night of the Demons' you get. The movie is nothing but original, and really, it's not a good movie. The whole thing is insanely distracted, the acting is terrible, the jokes often fall flat, the characters are annoying (especially the character of Stooge) and the plot holes are numerous. It's still fun out of the way. So why? <br /> <br /> Good for one thing, the make-up and gore effects are, with a few very memorable moments (especially a nasty and just strange bit with a tube of lipstick) that really protrude. It also rarely, as ever, takes too seriously, but with the exception of some awful words, it plays straight and never wastes hearing time with self-awareness. In addition, there is a definite energy and enthusiasm for the entire business that is almost impossible to resist. Yes, it is nothing special, but it knows it, and it can no longer be proud of the fact. It's a goofy party horror movie, and it never makes it any more. <br /> <br /> It may not be a classic, but 'Night of the Demons' is a good example of the horrible mess that was done right. It may not be too memorable or original, but sometimes you don't want a fine beer. Sometimes you want a Budweiser.
