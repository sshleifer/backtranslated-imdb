"Showtime" is a funny movie featuring starring Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents, a Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective going into a TV shop trying to break some criminals. When police come, Tray (Eddie Murphy) a policeman, tries to arrest Mitch because he doesn't know he's a policeman. During this scene, very funny things happen that catch the eye of the TV producer Chase Ritz. She is so excited about their adventures, she decides to make a TV show called "Showtime" featuring the lead roles of Tray (the policeman) and Mitch (the detective). But that's just the funny part. The rest is strict tension and action. There is a strange man who is selling and making extremely dangerous guns. While LAPD is playing on the show and doing it in real life, DeNiro and Murphy have quite an adventure in this story. On a scale of 1-10 I give it a seven or 8.
