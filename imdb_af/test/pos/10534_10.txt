The centuries are one of the best cartoons ever and it has to be put on TV and DVD so people can enjoy younger generations, enjoying such a good performance that is much better than the garbage they've made in the past 14 years. I have a petition online that was originally on the website http: //www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html originally trying to get this view on five days a week, but now try to view this show on DVD since the TV station on which it is focused has had bad links. We must all convince the people who own this show to post it on DVD so that it can be seen by future generations. Also, since Hasbro Toys owns the toy series of this show, we can try to convince them to make a lively action movie, just as they did with Transformers and sometimes this year G.I.Joe. We need good cartoons like this to come back and enjoy the younger generations. Please sign this petition so that one day we can have DVDs of the guys known for the "Power Extreme!"
