Wolfgang Peterson's In the line of fire is dragged and sometimes a true white-cut ride, even though we feel we may be the same roads once or twice. How can one not, when Clint Eastwood, just after (allegedly) closes the book on his western legacy, probably closes one on his eager detective photos (don't count Bloodwerk in it). But there is more to it than that because Eastwood's character, here's a hard-bitten, demonic and stubborn service agent, has a slight charm, even the more romantic side one should never see in the photos where he doesn't spray his trademark lines . There are a few complexities going on that not only rely on the ordinary swagger, and it is striking for how such a potentially confronted story (Kennedy did not kill to be murdered in 63) is slightly credible among the rest. made of his persona, which more than likely hides his wounds - most of the time. Eastwood goes to town to make him a big presence in the movie. Under the circumstances, the character seems to him tailor-made. <br /> <br /> But there will be a risk that his role in the movie will be slight. conventional (we still get the 'Harry' tone scenes from him who is smarter - and so smart-all in the room, and is shaken and told to be at the top buyer, here a head of staff) here protection of a president who (wisely) never really sees or knows us. Even the romantic sub-plot, which is kind of undercooked when laughtering for some machismo, will make the picture a bit sub-par if the other quasi-Dirty Harry aspect doesn't come in the picture: " an indelible villain. This time there are some extra Hollywood tensions, but brillaintly intelligent suspense (almost smarter than the rest of the movie), with the character of John Booth, played in an Oscar nominated performance by John Malkovich, as someone described more than a predator. as an assassin. There are ways it can go wrong with the Eastwood character, but Malkovich may be trumpet his former villain counterparts by being extremely cool and uncharged (there is that devastating, worthy scene where he kills the bank and her roommate) and As his past is revealed, there is still that element of "what hell is with the man" guessing the audience and Eastwood's agent and keeping extra paranoid. It's a classic Malkovich show, actually creepy and always measured at the level of madness and professionalism. <br /> <br /> Apart from the conventional points, it's also a pretty picture of Peterson and the company, and they are getting beautiful. near the spotty pulp realm of Don Siegel. But Peterson also has a few movies that had his sleeve that sometimes grabbed me; Every time someone in such a blatant but exciting tribute sits, vertigo jumps from the roof to the roof, the hero who diverges from the edge, the 'twist' - it still gives a few shakes in my spine . There are also the phone calls between Eastwood and Malkovich, where we see the depths of the cat and mouse game, probably another kick in the ribs at Hithcock. But ultimately, even with all the excitement and brutal danger and sharp formalism in the climax, it is also in some ways a character, and everything is reasonably realized to give the audience a good amount, at least in the suspense movie sense. Eastwod is a good lead, Russo sincerely plays the feminine possible love interest, and Malkovich is the best of the pops. There are also some notable supporting roles, and a good studio score in it. One of those better films of 1993.
