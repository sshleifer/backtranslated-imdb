I really like the film's opening, then spot. Ted Masters realized on his fighter radar that four hostile planes are approaching from about 10 hours. The good news is that the film does not initially mention that the colonel, together with a pilot who was a lieutenant, tried to do a "freedom of navigation" exercise along the eastern Mediterranean, but also A little beyond the limited airspace zone reserved for a rogue Middle Eastern nation, accidentally flying along it. <br /> <br /> I also like all the interference on the colonel's radar readings and computer versions as the hostile aircraft are aggressively picking up the two US fighter pilots committed to violating their airspace. The first dogfight immediately reminds me of the famous fighter pilot, "Top Gun." From the crop of the hostile convicts to the enemy's aircraft's thirty-millimeter laps that hit the colonel's jet air and forced the plane and forced him to throw out. This reminds us of one thing. Dogfight fighting techniques can keep you alive ... but one false move can cause you to be shot down. <br /> <br /> The only problem in the movie was the "snake sequence" scene. It was a little too long. Yes, opening the movie was great if you saw the conflict ... what was the dogfight engagement. Only when one son told Doug Masters that his father had been shot after the Cessna aircraft landed in the "snake" race, we force ourselves back to the time the conflict has already begun. I think the snake range in the waist should be slightly interrupted by patch. Masters in handcuffs dragged in the middle of the Bilyad desert on their way to the detention center ... while the music series for the "snake" continues. The movie doesn't. If so, the details of the conflict would have been smoother at that time. Even better. <br /> <br /> When the word found out that spot. Ted Masters trial for high treason (violation of territorial air sovereignty) was over and he was convicted in three days of hanging on the gallows in three days, Doug Masters decides to take action. With the air force having unprofitable efforts to save the man, Doug decides on his friends and patch. Sinclair (played by Louis Gossett Jr.) for a plan to save Masters. High chance of facing a court and spending more than a year in a military stock goes against the air force policy and plans to save Masters without the permission of the US government. <br /> <br /> Doug and his friends sneak into various classified areas of the base to get enough stuff in the area where Masters are held for the upcoming hangover, and the surrounding area around Bilyad (which seems to be a false Middle -Eastern country for the movie). One plan included shooting shooters outside the air force darkroom area as a distraction to get classified photos and interview points on fighter aircraft, fighter base, intelligence and all other military stuff around Bilyad. <br /> <br /> When all was said and done, and Sinclair studied all the intelligence, he almost rejected the plan because Doug was too much. Not before they got the two F-16 planes and tried a dry run over a firebreak, which I realized what they were going to do overseas. I realized Doug's fighter was shooting and bomb was not good until he heard rock music. I can remember when he dropped one Mach 82 bomb on a horizontal target and the bomb missed by 20 feet .... I realized Doug was unusual. He likes music when he fires the ammunition of the fighting fire. <br /> <br /> The last part of the conflict, the final dogfight action in "Iron Eagle", was better than Top Gun's climax of the hostile daughter sequences. I like the way the final conflict unfolded, especially when the Doug masters face a Middle East fighter pilot, who actually ran the trial against Ted Masters. Short, but lovely, when Doug pulled out the enemy fighter after a second test with a wheel drive. It seems this Bilyad colonel in the Star Wars is related to Darth Vader. In the air he can be very angry, because if you saw Star Wars, Darth Vader was actually Anakin Skywalker, who was a pilot. space. Unusual connotation for this, but still work!
