Let me first say that Liev received a great deal of respect from me after seeing his legal director "Everything Illuminated". Anyone who read the book knows how saturated the story is with relentless and hilarious vocabulary by Alex along with many flashback scenes and crazy dream-like sequences. Liev took it all and made it work. The movie itself is great - the soundtrack, the performances, the cinematography - it all works. There are many stories about the town and its inhabitants, but there is just as much you can do with an indie, so this part didn't bother me too much. It's just disappointing that not many people will see this movie, or even know it exists because of the lack of promotion associated with it. I didn't even know it was in the theaters. I didn't know when the DVD came out. You might think that, since Frodo Baggins was one of the main characters, SOMEBODY would have released at least a commercial for it. I had to see the trailer on my "Paradise Now" DVD (released on DVD in the spring of '06) to even know it has a "Fall of 2005" theater release. Haha - really sad. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you stumble upon this review, somehow because one of your friends has read the book and loved it or seen the movie and recommended you see it - take my advice and see It. It is a very good experience. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
