I'm not sure what about this movie intrigue. It is grainy, poorly written, bleached, often ridiculous and dull at many points (the person I looked at fell asleep twice.) And yet there is something in this movie that fascinates me, though I do not. sure is not. that; maybe the character of Sam, an enormous former patient who loboties the former chief doctor and constantly sucks on an ice cream, or the wonderfully played chief doctor (I forget her name). <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch it and form your own opinion; It has one of the greatest endings I have seen in the movie.
