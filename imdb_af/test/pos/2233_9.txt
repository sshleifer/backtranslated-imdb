While the health-owner needs to be sold, she comes up with a scheme for employees to buy the company for a while. salesman (Robert Ames) as the "front", although she is the brain. <br /> <br /> Of course, he becomes a great success and becomes his executive secretary, still running everything and teaching him class. She loves the dope, but he never picks up as he wanders with a string of bimbos. She is being driven by a married but divorced man, Ricardo Cortez, who is not free. But when a community man catches Ames, everything goes to hell. <br /> <br /> Astor is just as wonderful as the too clever woman who makes a big mistake after losing her husband. Ames is good as the push (but what does she see in him?), And Cortez is good, but doesn't have much to do. Kitty Kelly is good as the sidekick, Dolores. Charles Sellon is the original owner, Cather Dale Owen is the society babe, and Edna Murphy is funny as Daisy. <br /> <br /> Worth a look.
