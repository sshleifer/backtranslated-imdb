A real scary movie. History of the Fair James Artler's rations led me to recently formed weblogs such as LATOC, Energy Bulletin and The Oil Drum and the data behind the theory of Hubbert's Peak. Like this movie, LATOC and Kunstler paint a grim picture from the back or the back. I hope they are in time, but in mid-2005, petrol prices, rising oil prices, are rising Chevron's Will You. We are involved in our campaign, BP becomes Beyond Petroleum and even T Boone Pickens is confident of the idea that we are at or near a peak of oil production. <br /> <br /> After extensive research on limited data, oil investment banker Matt Simmons suggested that Saudi production could no longer increase in their large but aging fields. Given the increasing demand (mainly from the US and China), the Saudis did not respond with higher production, despite previous assurances. Established world production from 2000 and 2004 suggests that light, sweet crude oil has indeed been tracked. which means refining will become more expensive. <br /> <br /> The movie is aimed at baby boomers, but younger people, our children, must also understand the implications of an energy-depleted future.
