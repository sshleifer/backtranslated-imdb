This movie makes me laugh, even though I think about it. such a clever comedy! very precise, but easy. the decisive can't be better. all actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play exactly the best, and there is no stupid laugh or screaming throughout the movie. layers and the progress of the story work perfectly together and the rhythm flows smoothly. Most of all, when the Village People's YMCA is turned on. This eliminates the importance of the Indian statute, which was only briefly mentioned in the movie. It makes the smartest and funniest climax among many comedies. I give it a ten, especially many times that comedies are so underestimated.
