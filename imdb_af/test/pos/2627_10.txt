I never forgot this movie. All these years it has remained in my life. I watched this movie on so many websites and stores. If someone ever reads and has a copy, I will pay you a copy of it, or let me know where I could get one. It's a movie that should be known as a Classic Romance, as well as my other favorite, sometime in the time. It was really brilliant. If the real actors want to try this movie and give it the patience it needs to be the right one, it can be a blockbuster. A love story that is so powerful that it should be for all lovers. I remember how sad I was at the end and it really came as a shock. I believe with my whole heart that Johnny loved the woman and she has him. It was a great movie and it is a pity that it is not available for us to buy. Please contact me at shawe49@aol.com - I would like to thank a wonderful woman who responded to my message almost a year later. She had a copy of the movie and was so kind to send it to me. She's a big fan of this movie like me. With her help, there were 3 happy ladies to receive these DVDs. "She is waiting for the book on which it is based. I check at my local library, entitled 'Mrs Maitlands Affair, by Margarett Lynn. I'm sure it's good too. Many thanks to Julie for her grace and friendship. I'm always your friend, Sharon
