The 1978 adaptation had all the ingredients of a potentially wonderful movie. It is based on an absolutely beautiful book by Charles Kingsley. It has a truly talented film by James Mason, Bernard Cribbons and David Tomblinson, not to mention the vocal talents of David Jason and Jon Pertwee. There is also Lionel Jeffries, the director of wonderful classics such as the Railroad Children and the Amazing Mr. Blonde, and while the movie is mostly good, it was also a bit disappointing. I had no problem with the performances, especially those of Mason and Tomblinson as Grimes and Sir John Harriet respectively, and Tommy Pender and Samantha Gates are credible like Tom and Ellie. The voice throw is also commendable, especially Jon Pertwee, who portrays characters in his own right. I also liked the accidental music it was so haunting and beautiful, and the writing was pretty faithful and generally well written, especially in the beginning. The characters, especially the Water Babies, are very charming and the villains are sinister and funny at the same time. I had the part when Tom and his friends escaped the Water Babies, because the shark pursued the electric eel with an ax. funny. However, I would say the movie looks dated, especially the animated rows, the live action parts were not that bad, if you forgive the rather dark camera. The character animation was rather flat and the backgrounds were sometimes a bit dull, but there were some nice moments, like the scene with the Krakon and of course the first meeting with the Water Babies. I also had mixed feelings about the songs, the Water Babies song was beautiful, but I forgot the first song, if Tom came under water. Hi-Cockallorum is an example of a song, it's like marmite, you like it or hate it. I don't personally know what to do about this song, it was nice to listen first, but once in your head, it might be annoying. As much as I love Lionel Jeffries and his films, his direction is just the wonder and the magic he usually does is lacking. All in all, definitely not a terrible movie, but could have been better artistic. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
