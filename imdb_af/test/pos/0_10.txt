I went and saw this movie last night after visiting some of my friends. I would admit I was reluctant to see it, because of what I knew about Ashton Kutcher, he was only able to do comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with so much professionalism. The sign of a good movie is that it can play with our emotions. This one did exactly that. The entire theater (which was sold out) was conquered by the lag during the first half of the film and was moved into tears in the second half. As I left the theater, I saw not only many women in tears, but also many mature men, desperately trying to let no one see them crying. This movie was great, and I suggest you see it before you judge.
