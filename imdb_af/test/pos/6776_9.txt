This is by far the best movie I've ever seen. It is a totally original and beautiful plot. It's not boring, nor is it dramatic. The characters are tangible and realistic, but it doesn't take away from the storyline. The fact that not in English is probably the final touch. The end will fill you in a way I have never experienced in a movie. <br /> <br /> I wish I found this movie earlier. <br /> <br /> More lines. <br /> <br /> more lines. <br /> <br /> More lines on many more lines, I'm done
