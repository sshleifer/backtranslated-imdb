A frightening, fast-paced comic strip story / drama / farce against France's 1939 implosion. Played with wide eyes, straight-faced intensity through a talented saucepan and bat with action, satire, social commentary and authentic period details, from smooth brilliant-cut hairdresser and marbled haircuts to a Citroen Tractions fleet, a rolling soundtrack and short but credible impersonations of Charles de Gaulle and Marshal Petain. <br /> <br /> It's just some of the best entertainment recently shown on the screen, without suspicion and "message". If movies were trains (and there's a creative recreation of a trip on a steam-powered train that works despite the fact that there's no steam locomotive - an expensive strut, no doubt) it's a TGV .
