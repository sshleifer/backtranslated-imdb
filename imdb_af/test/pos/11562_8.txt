I haven't seen this movie since it came out in the mid 70's, but I remember it as a very realistic portrayal of the music business (upstairs with Paul Simons "One Trick Pony. Another great movie IMO) < br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel does a great job as a producer caught between the music he believes and the commercial 'tripe' wants the record company packs. /> Since I spent my entire career in the music business as a composer / arrangement / manufacturer, I can really ascertain the veracity of this film. <br /> <br /> If it ever came to DVD, I would buy it!
