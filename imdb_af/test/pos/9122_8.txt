There were heist movies for this one, and indeed, like Rififi, it was a clear influence on it - but the Red Circle is more than just another entry in an overcrowded genre. With this film, director Jean-Pierre Melville has managed to create something that excites both on the surface and gives his audience something to think about. Being cool is just as important as a feature of modern crime film as guns and gangsters, and Melville delivers it with the movie in herds; The tone of the film is also very relaxed and Melville drills most of the film under the cool outside. The story has a number of corners, but the central character is Corey - a thief released from prison. His release coincides with the escape of the notorious killer Vogel, who slides under a train ride under the nose of police commissioner Mattei. The first thing Corey does on release, is money from his former boss Rico, and the second thing he does is to recruit Bird and a sharpshooter to help him draw a jewel cage. But Rico and the police are hot on the thieves' tails ... <br /> <br /> The film is tied together by four excellent central performances. Alain Delon is calm and calculated as the film's anti-hero, while Gian Maria Volontè looks formidable in his role as the escaped killer. François Perrier is also good as a dubious club owner, while the right action from André Bourvil comes in his role as the police commissioner. The film runs almost two and a half hours and is not exactly a thrill ride. However, the director keeps things interesting by concentrating on the key elements. The film includes crime movie posts such as shooting, but it is kept to a minimum. The first two-thirds of the movie really only builds on the spectacular honeymoon at the end. Rififi was best known for his heist order - a complexly designed scene in which no one speaks a word. The elevator in this movie is similar in that it's also wordless, and I have to say I chose the scene in Rififi; But Melville's skill in the direction and the calm and compound way it plays makes it good. The film comes down to an exciting climax that finishes it all nicely. Overall, this should not appeal to all crime film fans, as the action is more than a little slow; but The Red Circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.
