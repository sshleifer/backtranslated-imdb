This movie illustrates a certain type of comedy horror of a strictly mature type, but completely different from the Troma movies (which share certain features). The humor is rough and right, but quick and furious. If the idea of ​​ominous dolls with evil powers and twisted thoughts does not make you boring with boredom, reach for the six pack of beer and enjoy the best Chucky movie.
