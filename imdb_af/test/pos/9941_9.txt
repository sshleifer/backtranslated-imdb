"Opera" is one of the greatest achievements in the horror genre. This masterful picture has everything that should be in the pure horror movie: good, engaging story, lots of symbols, great imagery and many gore. The murders are very shocking and bloody. An unforgettable atmosphere of fear and fear. A must-see for a true Argento fan, so if you get a chance to see it.
