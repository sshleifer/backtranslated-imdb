The problem with TV today is that people are spoiled by "lite" TV watching. This kind of television program is the equivalent of lift music or "easy listening" jazz. The typical viewer idea of ​​"continuity" remembers who voted out of the island last week and wonders who will be next. Show them a program like surface, Firefly, Dr. Who, or something with a plot bow of more than three episodes and ... and they'll just fly back to Survivor. <br /> <br /> 95% of the sheep watching TV do not want to stretch their brains. They want excuses not to think. They want to make sure that the "boob tube" stays in its name ... and they don't want shows that try to do any other route. As a result, Surface and many other high-quality performances that took much longer had the ax. <br /> <br /> TV viewers don't want stories, either moral or philosophy, or anything more than a third. degree vocabulary level. They want people to eat terrestrial or a dramatic series of real life (not something like that! You can't observe anything without changing the nature of what you perceive) or hormonal performances involving groups of people and them then on their friends. <br /> <br /> Today's television is nothing but a wasteland, and the few diamonds you can get out of the dust are just thrown out because no one even knows what a diamond is. Surface was one of those diamonds.
