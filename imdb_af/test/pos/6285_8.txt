When I first saw this movie playing on TV, I was just a new cute kiss like this joke of a comedian who really wore strange outfits in the day. I still decided to watch it and I was impressed. Shore brings a fresh breath to the screen. In this movie he plays a college advisor who probably also needs his own advisor. Carla Gugino, in a minor role, plays Becca, a Midwestern "farm girl" with a simple family and a movie-clich√© boyfriend Travis. when she heads to ucla, she gets crawled and quickly turns her into an exuberant white Californian girl. She decides to bring home for the thank-you break. when travis decides to propose, becca must have a distraction. then decides to make everyone believe that he and Becca are already engaged. This leads to a crawl that satisfies the romance between Becca's parents, befriends her brother and even gets the dancers from the local bar to get a little loose. I'm not going to announce the end, but I liked it. Anyway, don't rent it if you want a good performance; rent it if you want to laugh your butt and enjoy an often missed part of 90's humor.
