Not to be a fan of Coen brothers or George Clooney, anyone can see the skepticism I have taken in the theater. Again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something else. This time it was the zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) Coens did "their thing" to one of the great works in literary history. Who would ever have thought Homer had in mind? I don't know where this movie will fit into Hollywood's history books, but it will be in both me and many other DVD or VHS libraries. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again. The story was written brilliantly. Clean and entertaining, with some Gumpesque brushes with fame, good performances by Clooney, Turturro, Nelson, and a short but hilarious Holly Hunter. To be born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the south, I wish more people would have a little fun on us. They even call a soundtrack for the rural south. You do nothing better this weekend, check out this movie! <br /> <br />
