This intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study of how people respond to tradition (reminds me of William Faulkner's novels). <br /> <br /> The characters all feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are expected to accept. , and looking for a way to live within those roles rather than throwing them down completely. But as the story develops, the two women, trapped in loveless marriages, pull together. They give the courage to abandon their roles on the basis of their friendship and love. <br /> <br /> They found that life in their traditions is not life at all, it is a kind of living death: without passion, without real connection with others, without fulfillment. Although they know, there will be a prize for their rebellion and freedom. This is a price that is much less loving than the sacrifice required by a comfortable, predictable existence. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderful, the acting miraculous. Almost perfect!
