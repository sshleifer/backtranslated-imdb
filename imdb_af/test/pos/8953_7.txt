It was the movie that started with the movie love affair <br /> <br /> between the Jaundiced Eye team and Matthew Ferguson. She <br /> <br /> Ability to depict RELATIVE normal characters like Birkoff in <br /> <br /> "La Femme Nikita" is balanced by its equally smart <br/> <br /> handling weirdos like "Kane." One wants to give him more roles, bigger roles and other, even more complex roles to test to push the boundaries of his abilities. <br /> <br /> There were <br /> <br /> four or five memorable scenes in this movie, and Matthew Ferguson <br /> <br /> stole two more experienced actors. This movie <br /> <br /> is good, and it's worth looking at on its own merits, but <br /> <br /> Ferguson makes it a little extra special. His * ouevre * can <br /> <br /> finally show what Anthony Perkins MIGHT's <br /> <br /> career was as if he wasn't chosen as long as Norman Bates. <Br /> <br /> ago. "Kane" is not quite as exhausted as Norman, and much less <br /> <br /> people have seen "Love and Human Remains" as "Psycho", so we can <br /> <br /> hope Ferguson will give us a hint of what Perkins MIGHT <br /> could have achieved if he could.
