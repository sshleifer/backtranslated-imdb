I gave this opportunity a chance because of Jaleel White, not for his Urkel character, but mainly for the Sonic the Hedgehog voice XD. Anyway, as I said, I gave it a chance, and I loved it very much. I never care for the Urkel character, so I was glad to see Mr. Seeing White in a different role than the ever-annoying nerd. And she Calvin J. Fraiser (first called Calvin, but comes the second episode, everyone called him 'J') was very entertaining and interesting. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite episode was when J the date was ex-Cowboys cheerleader with the sneaky kid. ("Don't talk like that!" My mom! "" It's adult talk, you stay there!). The only beef I have is that the show is supposed to have 3 main characters, but Mr. White's character always had the most attention and the other two (who are married) always have the back stories ... It's not a good thing as a story about the two who might be pregnant, the back of J must take. babysitting his girlfriend's dog ..... <br /> <br /> Unlike that, I really wish this show could take a little longer. Unfortunately, people do not seem to be interested in Jaleel White as anything other than the God-Awful, annoying ass known as Urkel .... <br /> <br /> Hope they have it at least as a DVD box set.
