Wow. This movie is the voice of a climbing generation. Director Sam Keith takes us to the darkest depths of man's soul where we find love, life and top-calling. World-weary Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) follows his heart and his anchors through a cerebral journey to find common sense in a post-apocalyptic Colorado. Instead, Telly meets confrontation in Don (Jason Bortz), the embodiment of machismo and a zeitgeist or humanities foibles. The epic film comes to a climax at a splendid top-roping competition that will make even the strongest willists at the most dizzying heights. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything: Top-roping outside, Top Call in the gym, Cut-off shorts and sleeveless flannel shirts, Awesome uplift (some as well, you see it 2 or 3 times!), Bear and snake attacks. <br /> <br /> I gave the movie 8 out of 10 because I wanted the romance to develop a little more. It seems the movie has led to a spicy, sexual scene between Telly and his new lover, but it won't fit in with the odd surprise. <br /> <br /> Fans of Cliffhanger and Mission Impossible II will find this movie to be a diamond in the rough. Overall, if you're ready to dispute your world view on humanity and climb, it's the movie for you !!! 1
