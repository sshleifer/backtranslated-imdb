An absolute classic of 80's scare flix. This one is not like any other, as it is pint-sized, wild-eyed, psychotic youths with an urge to kill against all the grown-ups in the village. Button of just one of the guys (80's gold gold) plays one of the killers and he is with one of the little girls trying to buy Jake Blues in the BLUES BROTHERS. There is a third blonde boy, but he stays out of the movie for whatever reason. The violence is sometimes scary and also surprisingly gruesome in places. The devilish gang of smiling children, although somehow possessed by extra-planetary means, have little likeness to the thirsty children of the condemned, who never thought to use pistols, crossbones, and kicks for murdered. Julie Brown (not Downtown Julie Brown - the other one) shows her shelf, like three times, while dancing in her bedroom. This movie is a rarity I can't believe I grew up in the 80's. It would have been my absolute favorite movie as a kid if I saw it. Where's the successor asking for the end? This movie is just incredible. Look it up at all costs.
