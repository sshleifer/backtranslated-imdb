Nevsky is one of the great epic war films. Sure, others, like the birth of a nation and Napoleon, have come before, but this one is just as influential. The play is stocked, but anyone who knows the first thing about Eisenstein will know it was part of his film theory. This film, unlike many of its silent works, deals with the lucky individual as much as it is about the group. This reflects the Stalinist philosophy that emerged in 1938. Yet his film shows us the power that can be generated by people who come together to fight something they regard as evil. Nevsky is just one of many men. He is prince because he is strongest, but not because he is somehow different from the rest. The film's romantic corners offer more of a personal story than Eisenstein has previously allowed. Not all elements work and the movie is probably a bit too long, but it still resonates.
