Mel Brooks really left himself on this movie. No one can deny that Blazing Saddles was a classic, and a breakthrough in this style of comedy film, but Men In Tights has become the culmination of his creative genius. This movie is a definite must-see. If you enjoy this movie, I would also recommend space balls and world history. The same goes for the opposite. If you've seen any of these movies, Men In Tights should be on your list next.
