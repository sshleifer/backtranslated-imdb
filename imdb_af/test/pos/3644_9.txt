Nice for his early work and no Kokaku Kidotai without it, and get 2 extra points for Easter eggs. For Shirow, this is definitely a rung in learning. I'm biased as a Shirow fan, but it was a big step from Dirty Pair I knew about him. Violent fun with a porn soundtrack! You can't help but see it. I know people appreciate him for Ghost in the Shell. But all the deep spiritual overtones were treated in Appleseed. ESWAT kills terrorists, the fight for humans to stay viable as bioroids phase out, and Deunan remains thin despite her junk food intake. Definitely like the characters, even the traitor .. and I don't know why.
