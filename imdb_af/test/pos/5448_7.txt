Now, I'm a little biased, since I'm a big fan of last night's television. I am a loyal fan of Jay Leno for about 6 or 7 years and think he's one of the funniest, most talented comedians out there. And David Letterman is also a helmet of a comedian, although I only watch his performance (unless Jay is a repeat) during advertising or when he has a better guest than Jay at the show. Daniel Roebuck and John Michael Higgins are both good actors and they look much like Jay and Dave, but have disappeared into the characters? Nope. Roebuck hardly ignores Jay's voice and expression, mumbling at a high pitch, sounds like a castrati Marlon Brando. Higgins nail Dawid's facial expressions (for example, his trademark is cut), but he doesn't nail Dave's voice. Those who are not big fans of late night TV can be much less biased. There are some comedians who can do Jay-on-Impersonations from Jay. Why couldn't they have chosen one of them for the part? And that also applies to Dave. I'd rather have Norm McDonald played the role. Norm doesn't look like hell like Dave, but he made a big look at him on SNL. "Hey ... do you have any gums?" It was so hilarious! <br /> <br /> However, I learned a lot about the late night wars I had little knowledge at first. I never watched the "Tonight Show" before Jay Leno hosted. So I didn't know about the fight to finally replace Johnny Carson and the many negotiations Dave finally convinced to go to CBS. I knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and found the film very enlightening. And Kathy Bates gives a knockout performance as the former executive producer of The Tonight Show. She basically steals the movie. <br /> <br /> My Score: 7 (out of 10) <br /> <br />
