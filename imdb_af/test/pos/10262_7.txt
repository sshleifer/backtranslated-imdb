Shameless Screen Entertainment is a relatively new and British (I think) DVD label, specializing in bad and excessive violent cult movies? mostly Italian children - from the glorious periods when everything was possible, from the late 60's to the mid 80's. The label's choice looks like a cross between the oeuvres of "Mondo Macabro" and "No Shame" (they probably even borrowed the name of the latter) and they already have very rare sick Italian puppies like Ratman, "My Dear Killer" , "Killer Nun", "Phantom of Death" and "Torso". "The scared woman" was completely unknown to me, but since co-judges from here, whose opinions I greatly appreciated, describe it as one of the greatest and most enlightening psychedelic euro sex movement films of his era, I have not hesitated pick it up. It's a very strange movie and is probably not suitable for about 99% of average cinema lovers. However, if you're part of the remaining 1%, you're in for a very unique surprise. The style, atmosphere and content are similar to Jess Franco's "Succubus" and Massimo Dallamano's "Venus in Furs", but they are both widely regarded as classics, while "The Scared Woman" is virtually unknown. It's all about profiling and good marketing, I think. The story revolves around a literally dirty rich doctor (he lives in a huge secluded mansion, owns several older rally cars and has a very impressive collection of artsy relics, including a lively puppet replica of himself) with a bizarre and slightly fearless attitude towards women. He regards them as a threat to the survival of the male race and thus spends his days abduction, humiliation and sexual abuse of arbitrariness that he picks up from the street. Dr. Sayer then kidnapped the ambitious journalist Maria with the intention of completely shattering her female spirit, but he slowly fell for her. Just starting to believe in true love, she returns with a vengeance. It's really not for everyone, but if you can appreciate moody & sinisterly sexy ambiances, bizarre scenery toys, and psychedelic touches that look completely flawless and surrealistic, consider this one as a top recommendation. It's slow, stylish messy and completely bonkers ?? Shameless Entertainment, okay!
