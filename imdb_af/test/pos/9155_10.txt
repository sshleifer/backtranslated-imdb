I loved this show, but then I never remember anything he did, starting with "Americanization of Emily". A city commander trying to steal the town blindly and travel to Mexico should love it. Like everything he does, he has a tongue in cheek taste that it regards as a Garner product. James plays the same character in many of his shows and movies, but somehow it never gets stale. <br /> <br /> P.S. re: Kill the main character <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, the "good" brother was killed and replaced with "evil" twins in an attempt to increase ratings, viz. Make it more like every other western on the TV at that time. I think this show was too far ahead of his time and I still miss it. TV without a Jimmy G show is something wrong.
