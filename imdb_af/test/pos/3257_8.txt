This deceptive, retracted, low-key, casual-paced Aussie crime thriller unraveled with comfortable ease and relaxed confidence that is a pleasure to see. Crying beaver-working class-child Jimmy (an attractive fearless Heath Ledger) desires to make something out of his unbeatable ordinary life. Jimmy gets his big break when local crime Kingpin Pando (an excellent Bryan Brown) grants him an easy courier, which means he has to deliver $ 10 for an old lady. Jimmy finds himself kneeling in serious trouble when he loses Pando's money. Author / Director Gregor Jordaan's engaging, simple story of how things are not always crashing, young love, all actions that have impacted, and old old chestnuts about how crime does not pay, works like a charm thanks to a wonderful wealth of well-observable small, peculiar details, a strong sub-text about the devil's capacity for both good and evil, a nice sense of unattached irony, the bad thing about the fact that the violence is being offered and the wonderful foundation of the assorted complex drawn warts'n'all low-life characters in an instantly recognizable and completely credible banal daily reality (for example, Panda is shown that Scrabble is played with a flunky and at one point interrupts a business conversation with a fellow capsule to talking to his son over the phone). Due to his finely colored and two-figure representation of the crap, not to be with Pando, Bryan Brown undoubtedly qualifies as one of the best actors to ever grace celluloid. A sturdy and satisfying sleeper.
