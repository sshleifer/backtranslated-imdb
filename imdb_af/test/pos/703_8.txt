Probably because it is Columbia's first film in color, the colors look different in the interior screens. They look stronger, sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic, but very pleasant. Randolph Scott is the sheriff, a good guy, but the real star of the movie is a very young Glenn Ford, who is a loot who wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is the woman who falls for Ford and Claire Trevor is the Countess who manages the salon. There is a funny character called Nitro who doesn't think twice before being blown. I especially had two moments of the movie, one when there is a tremendous horse tramp and you see thousands of horses, there was no computer to help at that time, so I suppose they had to collect all those horses, no easy task not. Another moment is the final shooting, technically very good. There's also quite a fist fight. Since these Western scenes were made in 1943 with such great action, you make a sad conclusion: they no longer make them. Would they be able in case they wanted to? I have my doubts.
