In spite of everything it is style and cinematic invention, it's basically another serial killer thriller, which favors the same kind of plot line by such old favorites as Silence of the Lambs. team police follow the track of (especially nasty) murders, someone else is taken and they have to somehow find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case is the only person who knows, the killer himself (played vigorously by Vincent D'Onofrio) in a coma, and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez's sci-fi mind-reporting machine to get in his head and force him to tell everyone. This is where the movie is all new and different, as we enter (via a 21st century CGI update of Dr. Wie's kaleidoscopic favorite, the latest tunnel), a kind of Hellraiser-y strange world of scary crazy stuff left over the whole place, ruled by D'Onofrio, now a kind of conqueror of his distorted spiritual world, within his fleeting body. The in-spirit ranges are well realized and often beautiful, all the leaders perform well, the horror scene is to the maximum if you want such things, but the hype around the whole thing has led me to my disappointment. I expected something completely new and different than ever before, not this pretty successful blend of serial killers and special-effect horror genre staples. Sometimes frightening, often beautiful, is a rather gripping story, with caution and attention told by talented filmmakers, but by no means the big jump in the unknown is not marketed.
