A Two Sisters' Languages, or 'Janghwa, Hongryeon', is a true masterpiece. Brilliant psychological thriller, heartbreaking drama, and gripping horror, all included in a beautifully orchestrated package. From the intricate plot, to the beautiful cinematography, to the absolutely perfect casting, every aspect of this movie is exceptional. <br /> <br /> Fearing too much about the plot, I'll just say it's very satisfying. . Although it seems to be a bit difficult to understand at first, it is a good job to finally explain things. And whether you prefer psychological thriller, drama or horror, promise you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, it's almost flawless. The set, cinematography, lighting, and especially the soundtrack, are all fascinating. The waltz was initially a strange choice, but apparently has an ingenious choice. <br /> <br /> As for the casting, we speak absolutely perfectly. I'm Su-Jeong is quite convincing than the challenging, but upset Su-mi. Mun Keun-yeong is as convincing as her emotionally traumatized sister Su-yeon. These two girls were magic on the screen. I will definitely watch their other movies. Yeom Jeong-ah is deceptively cheerful and hauntingly evil like the stepmother. Lastly, Kap-su Kim gives an excellent performance as the tired, broken father. <br /> <br /> I really love this movie. If you want to see another story of two sisters, I strongly recommend finding a copy. It's a real gem worthy of anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> (10/10)
