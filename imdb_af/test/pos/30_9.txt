"The Dresser" is one of those films that is so perfect that you have trouble finding something that doesn't like them. Written by Ronald Harwood (himself a former tailor to the legendary Donald Wolfit), it boasts energy and true love for life behind the footlights. <br /> <br /> As 'Sir', the remaining actor and main focus of the game, Albert Finney is a joy to watch - whether you complain about the lack of storm during the 'blow, winds ...' "King Lear" or with his faithful stage manager, Madge (Eileen Atkins, good as always) over the years. Like Norman, his camp teacher, Tom Courtenay, gives a fantastic show, wrapping around the stream and calling 'Lear', collecting a bottle to go to the bar, or the fool, Davenport-Scott, but never seen it!). <br /> <br /> In an engaging support cast, Edward Fox is Oxenby (a typical arrogant second lead), Zena Walker as her Ladyship, Lockwood West as the replacement fool, and many others. <br /> <br /> This movie has great energy that originates some of the greasepaint of its stage, it's true, but it's so well behaved that you don't notice. Very well done indeed.
