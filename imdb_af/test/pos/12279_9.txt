In the late sixties, Sergio Corbucci directed four spaghetti westerns in a row - the classic MERCENARY, THE GREAT SILENCE, THE SPECIALISTS, and COMPANEROS. Three of these, except the specialists, are constantly updated on ten best listings when spaghetti westerns are evaluated. Until recently, everything I saw was a very poor quality collection with some English, some Italian, a fuzzy photo, and it was almost incomprehensible. Now, having seen a beautiful widescreen version with subtitles (still in two languages), I can include the SPECIALIST safely in the group of four classics. Johnny Halliday is very good as the charismatic Hud, a notorious hand with the gun returning to Blackstone to investigate the death of his brother, who was shot dead by the townspeople to lose their savings. It involves a perfect beauty that the bank owns, a Mexican bandit leader, El Diablo, who once was friends with Hud, an honest sheriff who dreams of better days and a small group of hippies - well, that was the late sixties , and hippies were everywhere, even believing in our western. It's not a desert western country, shot somewhere in the alps, and is beautiful to watch. There is a little more nudity than I expect in western, but it is not a bad thing. Sylvie Fennec is beautiful as Sheba, who may be Hud's cousin or dead brother's friend. It has never been made clear. This movie deserves to be seen, and again we are pleading for a nice DVD with all the decorations. I think the specialists will be as familiar as any of Corbucci's other westerns, and that is indeed a great praise.
