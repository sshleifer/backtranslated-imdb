if you watch it at home on DVD or Bluray! Be sure you have good sound system. The musical score through this is what moves you through the movie. I watched the movie a few times and thought it was great, but after I just upgraded my home sound system, it was different. I will watch this movie a lot, many more times. <br /> <br /> If you don't have a good sound system. find a friend who does and looks at it. <br /> <br /> Also look at the extra stories and behind the scenes extras that come with it (the BR or DVD.) Quimet's interview in the 1960s talks about his scholarship fund ... but for those times only boys got it. today i hope some of them go to girls .......
