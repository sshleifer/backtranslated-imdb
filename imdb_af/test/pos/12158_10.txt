Was there ever an Angel of Death like MIMSY FARMER in Barbet Schroeder's 1960s heroin opus? Sort Jean Seberg with an assassination. Pink Floyd Score. In spite of a few insignificant weaknesses, a classic, disgraceful one by Erich Segal / Noel Black for their fearless JENNIFER ON MY MIND (1971), although Tippy Walker, who is a similar character, made herself very comfortable in the latter rubbish. MORE, though, is great, a great 60-drug movie and, simply, an important document of his time. Many, a cult film, therefore join the cult. <br /> <br /> So far, no American movie has exceeded the same territory as far as I can remember. MIMSY is an astonishing archetype that elevates it to mythical realms. Not for the dull. Big sex scenes too.
