She's the Man was the funniest movie I've ever seen. I laughed so loudly that I was crying. It was also very romantic. Channing Tatum is absolutely beautiful and can really act. It certainly doesn't hurt that he has a lot of shirtless scenes. Channing and Amanda have wonderful chemistry and were absolutely wonderful together. I love this movie. If you look, make sure you watch the last removed scene. It was a big mistake to cut that scene because it is one of the best scenes in the movie. I recommend this movie. Amanda has never been harder. And Channing is going to be a big star. It's just the first of many for this shiny new star.
