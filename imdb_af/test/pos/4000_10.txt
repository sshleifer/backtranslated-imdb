The fire gives everything ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most masterful meditations of the film on works of art. In the 19th century Korea it tells the story of the famous painter Ohwon, but rather than sticking to bad anecdotes, melodrama, or psychological egg hunting, a series of episodes are portrayed in his life. Both are beautiful works of art in themselves. . It does not give any interpretation of these episodes, but allows the viewer to think with the Ohwon paintings themselves. In this way, the viewer enters the same view as Ohwon, and minus his talent they can feel in the inspiration of his paintings. <br /> <br /> Sharing why it's so effective is the utterly masterful view of 19th-century Korea and the musical / artistic world that Ohwon has drawn. There are so many beautiful shots of the world outside of the paintings that we get a mirror effect where we see the beautiful world living inspiring Ohwon, Ohwon and looking into that world and the artworks he creates all reflect each other. <br /> <br /> The story is told with extreme economy. An excited feeling is almost never going on or explained. It just looks fast and then is gone for the next one to appear. As an analogy, it is a kind of Mozartic artwork (endless and quick succession of good ideas) rather than Beethovinian (obsessive which remains one good idea). It has a classic restraint, like Ohwon's paintings. There is really no music that shows how to feel except some classic Korean pieces that are used with great effectiveness in various scenes (and mostly played by characters in the movie). A ghostly image, if I remember correctly, is of a herd of birds moving across the blue mountains, while a female singer crown <br /> <br /> "This life is like a dream and only death will wake us up "br /> <br /> One of the suggestions in the movie, one of Ohwon's teachers, is that the painting lies between strokes. The film follows that attitude, because there is so much matter * between * that is spoken and described in the film. I saw it twice and it was very rewarding on the second show. A very sharp movie, with little in the way of discarded explanation, one can see how it's my 96th movie. This is an artistic masterpiece. As Ohwon's good friend and mentor tells him in describing one of his paintings: "Not a single stripe was wasted." <br /> <br /> I compare it with Andrei Rubylev in quality, but in style it is very different. It is much easier and more entertaining to watch, but classic in form where Andrei is gothic. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is highly recommended for almost everyone except appetizer buttons. Both times I left the film. I felt a wonderful spiritual renewal. <br /> <br /> One point of Ohwon's life that initiated me was that his crazy drinking and villain suddenly began after visiting the noble visit that said, "Good art can only come from great knowledge and learning. "The next short scene Ohwon was very angry, and the next got drunk because he often stayed for the rest of the movie. I was curious why the noble words made him so much and drove him to the liquor that dominated the rest of his life. Or was it just coincidence?
