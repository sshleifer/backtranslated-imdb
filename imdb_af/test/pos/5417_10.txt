This short was nominated for an Academy Award, and lost to Anna and Bella. Not since Dr. Strangelove became the hilarious war! Condie takes a situation and turns it on his ear and then gives it a turn for good measure. Visual gags flow into Condie's work and I always see something I've missed every time I see it. On the world's greatest animation, it's worth seeing for this and many other shorts. Recommended.
