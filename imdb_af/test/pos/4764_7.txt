I'm not much for "cop" movies, but this one is supposedly a classic and when I found it cheap, I bought it and held it on a shelf just to get around to get it yesterday. watch and I leaked it! Now you can find New York City, but as a setting for a movie like this, in the winter months, it's perfect. Roy Scheider is a member of an elite police task force called The Seven Ups, who are 5 guys fighting the crime. In an openingstone, they repair a shoebox full of money from an antique store by distracting the crooks with a "bull in a china store" routine. But that's just the beginning. Looks like there are two guys, who stand as police, who are kidnapping and holding them for ransom. Richard Lynch seems to be one of these sleaze bags, and he's just as creepy. When one of the seven UPS positions at a funeral as a limo driver, its lid is blown, it is beaten and put into the car's hull. This may then lead to one of the most exciting car hunts I've seen. . Incredibly, how light traffic in NYC is for hunting scenes, but it's quite incredible, as Scheider follows the two kidnappers through what I guess, is the Bronx and then on a lathe and then Scheider's car stops. in one of the most passionate finals after a chase I've ever seen. Anyway, as the policeman dies, Scheider and his men are under suspicion because the police commissioner knows so little about their activities, he wondered if they were being kidnapped by gangsters, so of course these kinds of thoughts should be cut. In the bud & Scheider is ruthless to get to the bottom of things. Overall a decent cop action / drama, not really my thing, but I liked this one. Look for Joe Spinell (Maniac) in a small role. 7 out of 10.
