The answer ..... No, unfortunately. Although the miller and whip should be regarded as a most whimsical spectacular entertainment. The drama, suspense, romance and the unknown crowd at the end all add to the movie complex story that had to be too much for the 1898 audiences. An enlightening experience, one for the whole family!
