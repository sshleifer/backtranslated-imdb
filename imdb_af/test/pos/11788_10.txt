Oh well, the workout was wonderful. Not only did many women come in, but many teenagers also had a good workout. I'm not saying that the performance was in any way suitable for family viewing, but if you check out the other works by the show producer, you'll find more mature themes in his work, which are also excellent. Many of the viewers looked forward to the show, men and women all getting good information and a wonderful release, from the workout. The girls were perfect, and beautiful, the show was a classic and had to do well in syndication. The show still has to be, because there are never enough choices to see when it comes to health and beauty.
