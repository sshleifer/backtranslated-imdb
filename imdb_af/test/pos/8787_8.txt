You can't help wondering Hitchcock's early work. For example, "Saboteur" is so smooth and fast that it's hard to believe he's made this movie more than 60 years ago. There are a few propaganda elements, but they are so well known in the riddle that the game plays beautifully many years later. You also get some previews of things Hitchcock would do later - such as using a national landmark as wallpaper. This time it is the Statue of Liberty. Of course, in "North at North West," it is Mt. Rushmore. You will also recognize things that later appear in "Back Window" and "Vertigo" in "Saboteur", but don't let us give the show away. Robert Cummings is excellent as the o-so-charming Otto Kruger. Look for Hitchcock's mini-western in this one. It does not happen so quickly.
