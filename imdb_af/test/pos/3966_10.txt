Accept ... let's see. The only reason I chose to watch that movie was the hot dog that appeared in advertising when Shrader (sp?) Said: "Ask me about my WEINER". Then I saw that movie and I watched it with some of my friends ... and WOW amazing. One of the best films of the year. The whole movie was laughing like crazy! The plot in this story is that Bartleby (Justin Long) is not accepted into any of the schools he has applied, so he makes another false college for him and his friends so he can mislead his parents into the college. So he makes the rounds and he dreams his parents ... until more students look at the website and see the clerk (ACCEPTANCE IS A CLICK AWAY) and all these rejections come to this school. They have a lot of problems and they just can't do anything. 10/10 LOVE NOW
