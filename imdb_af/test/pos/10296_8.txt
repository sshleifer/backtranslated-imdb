Forget the recent serious American remake that unfortunately unleashed the reputation of the French original due to the director's involvement with both. It is a finely drawn romantic 90's noir with lots of twists. It works best as a Gallic ode to Hitchcock's rear window, because the idea of ​​voyeurism is the constant theme that burns the intricate screenplay. The story is amazing, like a Picasso painting, which offers several perspectives on the same event and requires the viewer's participation throughout. The settings, music and haunting points are great as well as the excellent cast of the cast. See it more than once.
