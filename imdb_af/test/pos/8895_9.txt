For those who enjoy the Asterix books and movies, you'll love this movie lover! Yes, I will admit that it mixes some of the books and movies, but the characters are brilliant and it is not just people showing their CGI left, right and center. I've seen it several times and laughed at my socks. <br /> <br /> Of course, it contains the main heroes Asterix (Astérix), Obelix (Obélix) and Dogmatix (Idéfix), but this time they've got someone new to handle. <br /> <br /> With such a sense of humor, the Galles continue and continue. Bless them.
