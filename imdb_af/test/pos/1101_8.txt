OK .... so, by minute 15 in the movie, there's still no dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie arrived at me in a packed bag from Down Under, with Sharpie encrypted information in front. I am a programmer of a North American festival, and MOD LOVE was sent by me as a possible starter that appeared on the distant Moscow / Karlovy Vary interface. <br /> <br /> Straight away I thought "this movie is not for us" (no dialogue per minute 15?), but anyway. Well though. Built and built and built, halfway to this movie, as you go to the zoo, you are initially reticent, but by the time you get to the dangerous snake beam, you are completely "there". <br /> <br /> This movie has a danger, not like WolF Creek, but because it is so completely "different" in all respects form and shape, and it looks like it is a web all the fantasies of most independent first time helmets ie. - gloomy weather, red neck intrigues, strange splicing, ominous music, and a plot that, although imperfect and basically, has a little in common with one of the 'big Aussie Movies', viz. The cars are Ate Paris, at Wier. But MODERN LOVE is actually not a very Aussie movie in the sense of Ocker-ishness and playful self-correction that penetrates many of the country's films. It works from the start on a more nightmare empire. No cell phones, no brands, no i-pods, no avid urban middle class or class anxiety. Just a man married to a look, an old Volvo, and a little boy who has strange teeth and chucks. round. Oh, and it's in strange sea-side village where people all look a little 'wrong'. 'Photographed by Nick Matthews (2:37) and music by Tom Huzenroeder (Ten Canoes) MOD LUV succeeds where many Aust. movies fail - ie it stands up without the "god-leaving" country from which it comes. Instead, it gets into a darkened but entertaining puzzle that the movie itself can't solve - here lies the weak link ... What on earth did this movie with "Modern Love" ???? The final minutes of the movie seem to give an answer, or at least tips to one .... and when I sat down and drank coffee and ate my Hershey afterwards, all I could imagine was Alex Frayne have a lot of fun with this one.
