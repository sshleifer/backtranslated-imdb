It was a day in 1891 when Scottish inventor William K.L. Dickson surprised his boss, Thomas Alva Edison, with his remarkable work in film development. After many experiments, Dickson could now capture real-life screens with his camera and propagate them through his invention, the Kinetoscope, as if a fragment of the time was preserved in celluloid. Soon, Dickson's Kinetoscope will be a huge success as a new way of entertaining. Many people are eager to pay the nickel charged to dance people, or acrobats performing stunts through the "kitsoscope" of the Kinetoscope. However, the invention was not complete, so it could tie onto the real movie as we know it. There was sound needed on the movies. So Dickson experimented and this short experiment, Kinetophone's first film, was the result. <br /> <br /> In this experiment, code combination simple as "Dickson Experimental Sound Film", director William K.L. Dickson is standing in front of a recording cylinder for a washing cylinder (earliest method of recording sound), with his violin on hand, with a song called "Song of the Cabin Boy". The idea was to record the song in the cylinder, while the camera recorded its movements. To show that it was a movie, two of Edison's "Black Maria" lab decided to do some dancing in front of the camera. Contrary to what author Vito Russo in his book The Celluloid Closet claimed, this little dance has nothing to do with homosexuality, as it is of course a reference to the loneliness environment of the lab, such as the lonely sailor to whom the "Cabin Boy Song" was dedicated (the title Russo suggests "The Gay Brothers" is actually anachronistic since "gay" had no homosexual connotation in the late 1890s.) <br /> < Unfortunately, Dickson was unable to achieve the desired effect, and the Kinetophone could never really produce the synchronized sound with images. While having the cylinder with the sound and the celluloid with the images, the synchronization of the two elements was not exactly effective and the sudden appearance of Auguste and Louis LumiÃ¨re's Cinematophe focused Edison's team on the project system and eventually Dickson leaving the company. . Fortunately, in 1998, Dickson's film reel was rebuilt and movie editor Walter Murch restored the experiment as planned. Lastly, "Dickson Experimental Sound Film" could be heard with synchronized sound just as its creative inventor intended. While this was not a successful effort, this outstanding film is proof of the enormous genius of Kinetoscope's father. 8/10
