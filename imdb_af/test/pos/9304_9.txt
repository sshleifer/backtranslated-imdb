There are numerous productions that tell of the development of the atomic bomb. The Robert Taylor movie over (the flag of interservice propaganda, if you believe the Army Air Corps, in the person of Paul W. Tibbits, ran the whole show!), Has the NBC ENOLA GAY (probably " A lot closer to the point, and the BBC TV series, OPPENHEIMER, along with Sam Waterston in the title role. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY take the same approach the BBC series did but broaden it; it avoids the "Give Whiz" technology of the Manhattan project and focuses on human aspects; the personalities involved at work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a wide variety of mythical, but very typical, people. <br /> <br /> With discussions, Dwight Schultz did a good job as Oppie, with a dreamy Ivory Tower academic struggling to relate his physicist contributions to his tendencies around the world. view wider social and moral context ... just to win that struggle through an overwhelming desire for personal power and glory. IN THE DAY AFTER CRIMINAL, it has been made clear that Oppenheimer regarded himself as a "superior being" because of his wide variety of intellectual skills. In the end, it was Robert Oppenheimer's downfall; He considered himself a kind of "Philosopher / King", a moral and intellectual superior who (and should rightly) prescribe "wisely" what was best for the rest of the world. development of nuclear weapons and deployment. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, wisdom does not dream of the actions of nations or directions of events on a global scale. Wisdom does not give temporary power. When trying to exert such a non-existent force (as Oppie found when he opposed the development of "The Super", the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and banished by those who really have the power. <br /> <br /> In one way I have made myself guilty of Schultz character; His Oppie also exposes him to the Manhattan project now and in person, despite the doubts and fears that have broken his intellectual base. The true Oppenheimer had a different approach; In the beginning, he had to come to the solid decision that the project would eventually be good. The ugliness that it produced on the road would be a coincidental price to be paid to achieve the ultimate good, and it should be ignored ... at least until the end of the project when there was free time to determine the profits and losses. Oppie did it clearly, and that led to his controversial post-war statements that science now had, and it was a knowledge that could never be lost. <br /> <br /> As the project progressed, such considerations had to be set aside if he were to maintain his common sense. <br /> <br /> As a result of this ambiguity, Schultz character emerges as a weak, scared young boy who has never been able to act as a "quick-break" coordinator, as Oppenheimer did not officially name his post. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman's call on General Leslie R. Groves is fascinating and a bravura show as possible a little over. <br /> <br /> Groves was a civil engineer by training, but firstly he was a SOLDIER, and a general to start! He is accustomed to the fact that things are going his way ... intensely driven, a dirty mouth, spoiling a child who has tantrums at the hat, who respects his country and is not too proud to fall and pray on his knees . In other words, much like REAL (ie, no civil engineer) soldiers, including George Patton! Grove's MISSION doesn't just come first, it's his only consideration ... feelings and egos are condemned, except for his OWN, of course! <br /> <br /> Growe couldn't admit it, but he knew well that he needed Oppenheimer; military rank is nothing in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was an essential interface between the two worlds he had to disturb. <br /> <br /> Again ... I have to write the script on this and the same reason. <br /> <br /> In fact, Groves already has owner Oppie; If he did not, Oppie would never be chosen for the position in the first place. History tells of many instances where other scientists, some like stars like Oppenheimer, simply walked away from Groves' recruitment efforts. At one stage, Groves was so desperate that he suggested he needed the physicists. <br /> <br /> Groves are trying to maneuver and control the movie. Oppie was unnecessary. They only exist here as a dramatic device that indeed helps make the movie's atmosphere very ugly. <br /> <br /> Kusak's "Michael Merriman" is a compilation of several real characters, but they come from a different time frame. Several research accidents, similar to the one depicted, took place in POSTWAR weapons research. <br /> <br /> Merriman's radiation dose creates another filth in the movie, but one that IMHO needs, and fairly accurate. People with poor stomachs have a difficult time dealing with the hospital order; they are all actually. <br /> <br /> The main idea left over, but not strong enough, is the great truth of the Los Alamos experience. The scientists who signed were young, idealistic and naive, as well as talented. Most were on their first outing from the campus shelter. For them, the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice large-scale experimental physics without the limitations of budgets or "excessive" bureaucratic oversight. <br /> <br /> It wasn't just their glory, but their youthful exuberance that made the atomic bomb. <br /> <br /> There is plenty to make the thoughtful viewer intensely uncomfortable about this movie. Likewise, if you're the Hollywood BS filter (there's not that much of it really), it's probably a nice, accurate view of the inside of the Manhattan Project.
