I love horror movies, but I think they work better if they have a dramatic impact. (The devil's spine, for example, the exorcist). It's that kind of movie, and it's not only ominous and frightening when it has to be, but it's also very beautiful. A Two Sisters' languages ​​start very slowly, so if you're in a hurry to see ghosts in the first 20 minutes, you'll be disappointed. Actually, it's not a ghost story, though there are a few. It's a bit more complicated, and it's done so that it turns Ringu and The Grudge out of the ring. A story ?? is a way smarter movie than those great cultural hits, because it really cares for its characters, and the direction is flawless. Every detail in this movie will leave you breathless if you are the kind of person who likes to pay attention to detail while watching a movie. The acting is great, especially from the stepmother and the head girl. The two are the price of the ticket alone. Do yourself a favor and look at this wonderful movie.
