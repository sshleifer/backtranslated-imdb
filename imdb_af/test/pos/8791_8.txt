Great movie! oh yes! Full of energy, fun, presenting our generation, our alienation: a praise for positive thinking in spite of the world we live in, a story of a great feast, a story of a lot of friends desperately in the week And the only thing to do is The Club. But fun and ecstasy keep boredom away! Very funny, pretty grotesque in a few points, beautifully shot ... and a good soundtrack!
