Charlie Wilson's war-based war story tells the story of a Texas Congressman and a CIA agent who wanted to protect the secret support of the Mujaheddin in the 1980s following the USSR invasion of country. This conflict played an important role in the final years of the Cold War between the US and the USSR. <br /> <br /> In terms of film making, Charlie Wilson's War is a definite winner. It is well written, benevolent and well shot. While most of the attention went to Tom Hanks for another good performance, I was even more impressed with Philip Seymour Hoffman's turn as CIA operative Gust Avrakotos. Sites of Soviet attacks on armed villages and refugee camps are dragging their hearts. The film also gives good backwards scenes and watches Congressman Wilson go to secure the desired funding. <br /> <br /> There are, however, two complaints I have about the movie. The first is that there is a subplot that includes a scandal that is not well developed and, as such, only serves as a minor derivation of the story line. The second complaint is that the film does not have the context of the war. The film makes the Mujaheddin look like innocent victims, and while having major civilian casualties, the Mujaheddin was actually rebels trying to overthrow the government of Afghanistan. This government, completely ignored in the film, did not fight surprisingly to suppress the rebellion, and later requested the Soviet Union for support in their efforts. The film also ignores the fact that the US was the Mujaheddin before the Soviet deployment in Afghanistan. The film testified to the unintended consequences of our covered actions - effects we still feel today - but it seems as if the author, Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols, were willing to sacrifice a historical context to create a coherent story. give. (I didn't read the book, I don't know if George Crile made the same compromise.) However, I enjoyed Charlie Wilson's War and recommended it. I would have preferred to choose a movie that depicted the complexities of the situation more accurately, as Stephen Gaghan did in Syria, but the audiences were more closely related to the coherent narrative of Charlie Wilson's War than to the ambiguities that Syria occurs.
