Opera (the US title is terror on the opera) is a bit of a dilapidation to some of Dario's other movies such as Phenomena, Tenebre and Suspiria. (I still can't find Inferno.) It's one of those movies with a good first half, but halfway through it is like someone slowly starting to release the air from the screenplay and logic. <br /> <br /> The basic plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is portrayed by a bewildered obsession. This killer starts killing people very close to her. He tied and grabbed her and stuck little sharp pennies under her eyelids, so if she closed her eyes, she would stick out her eyes. It forces her to watch while the killer kills her acquaintances in the typical brutal and greedy Argento fashion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is slow and illogical halfway through the movie. (It is especially aimed at the killer's motivation. I haven't quite figured out why he's such a nut.) The end comes especially in the worst possible sense from the left field. <br /> <br /> But for about the first hour or so it's some of Dario's best films and the camera work is awesome. too bad, it can't keep it to the end. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
