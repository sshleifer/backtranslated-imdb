I've always been a fan of Jackass, as well as Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And if you're a fan of something, your expectations are high that your "heroes" might die into. And if there's one thing I've learned to expect many of the people you just like to watch and listen to, it's never too much to expect, because in 99 out of 100 you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although, when I heard there was a Jackass 2, I thought, "Not even can I deviate from my expectations for this movie," and as a result I am ready to laugh today. but also ready to finally say, "Well, that was OK, but I'm a little disappointed." How wrong I was! Every member of the Jackass crew brings this movie to the first one and shows you the one crazy asshole after another, so the whole world sees that there is nothing they won't do to hurt themselves - and that's what we love ! I cried my eyes to laugh from the first minute and until the very last second of the movie, even shouting in laughter, unable to control myself! Stunt after stunt, prank after prank, and hilarious comments on the flow - it simply can't get any better than that! Amazing from start to finish, guaranteed to make you laugh your ass off. I have two things to say; WHAT THIS, and, please. God, let there be a Jackass 3. These guys have a lot to offer!
