Beware, My Lovely recently came on TV on BBC2 in the early hours, so I set the video to record it and was happy I had. <br /> <br /> A man finds a dead woman so that he escapes so that he is not blamed for her murder and gets a job as a servant at a widow's home, but she does not know what she go on here. It seems that this man is a psychopath and possible killer. He began to worry her and lured her into the basement. He then cuts the telephone line so she can't get outside help. A young boy who regularly buys something for her is not quite right when he goes shopping. Eventually the man leaves and acts as if nothing has happened. <br /> <br /> I can see why Pasop, My Lovely is given an X certificate when released in the theater. Some of the screens are quite dirty for this time. I also thought the man was going to do something to the young boy. <br /> <br /> The movie has an excellent performance by Robert Ryan as the psychopath, Ida Lupino as the widow and is linked by Barbara Whiting and Dee. Pollock as the boy. <br /> <br /> It's definitely Robert Ryan's most cold performance I've seen. A must see. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
