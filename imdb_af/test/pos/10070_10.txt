Don't listen to what the critics have always said about this cute, charming little movie. Madonna is BIG in this clever comedy. I worked at a video store for a few years and introduced this movie to many clients. No one ever got it back and yelled at me to tell them to rent it. Everyone has always enjoyed it. It's actually a good movie for kids.
