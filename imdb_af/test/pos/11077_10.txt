I'm NOT one of the Anime Cartoons (eg Pokemon, Dragonball Z, Naruto), but Zatch Bell is different in my opinion. Satch Bell is more exciting, has better characters and doesn't focus much on a kind of weapon or Mamodo as much as the episodes I've seen, like the episodes "Big Brother Kanchome", "Zatch vs. Kiyo". Satch Bell really focuses on the life of the strange sail, the clever Kiyo, the clever Suzy, and the WeirD Ponygon.Satch Bell is probably my Fav Cartoon for now, but I encourage others to see one episode of it, you will probably will find it! <br /> <br /> -Robbie H.
