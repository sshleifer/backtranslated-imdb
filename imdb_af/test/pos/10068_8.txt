"What's his name?" "Loudon." "Loudon what?" "Clear." <br /> <br /> Twenty one year after the film was released, the gag still gets me. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie again and I love it. I had to watch it back a hundred times a day and when I recently bought the DVD, I could still remember some of the dialogue. Madonna does not commit Nikki Finn, a young woman sent to prison for a crime. When she comes out, she decides to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Griffin Dunne (what happened to him?) Plays a lawyer for his fiance's father (John McMartin). The future father-in-law asks Loudon to take Nikki from prison to the bus station and make sure she gets on the bus, as part of a supposed new public relations program. A seemingly easy task, but there are complications abundant, some funny dialogue, and some admittedly silly-but-funny scenes along the way. <br /> <br /> Madonna has a stupid voice in this movie, which until I was able to watch subtitles, made one or two rules incomprehensible to me (so only 8/10), but to the on the other hand, I cannot imagine that she does it in her normal voice. <br /> <br /> This movie shows Madonna's comic team (maybe missing these days, and she's really funny in the role. Thin makes a good foil, while Haviland Morris is perfect as the delights fiance > <br /> Yes, it's predictable, yes, the jokes can be better, but I think it's a good movie and will happily sit down and watch it 100 times more.
