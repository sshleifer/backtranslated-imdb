Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, who lives in a world that is incompatible with modern life. He relies on his homemade weapons - helmet, sleeves and spear - made of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote drove Rocicante, "The Man" drives his connection (literally) through the lost lives that have captured the difficult and humiliating modern world, up to the modern man. Both characters are looking for adventure in an effort to rectify the injustice of the world. Both characters are protectors of values ​​unknown to most other characters in the story. <br /> <br /> Unlike Cervantes' story, in this movie we identify more directly with the anachronistic ideals of the main character. We can only compare this strange and forbidding landscape to the sumptuous and beautiful world we live in. Our frame of reference is the fantasy empire that the lonely knight may remember. Our vision will be to expect the main character to conquer, to conquer, to turn his world (to the better) back into a world of many that no longer exists. <br /> <br /> We watch this movie and see a real knight among a world of human-as-animals. Don Quixote sees himself as a true knight among animals. <br /> <br /> With Cervantes's story we can only see the dreamer, without understanding the extent of his anachronistic displacement. In Besson and Jolivet's story we see the new world from the eyes of Don Quixote, because we value the same views and ideals as the main character.
