I just watched Nightbreed for the first time because I saw it in theater almost 20 years ago, and while I remembered it at the time, I didn't remember it as it was today. I really can't complain about anything in this movie. Craig Scheffer is excellent as the main character of Boone. I never understood why he didn't have a more successful career because most of his early work is outstanding. As good as Scheffer, Cronenberg is even better. His portrayal of the psychologist Dr. Decker is unforgettable and steals the show. The rest of the cast, which includes Doug Bradley, is very good, except for the ridiculous about the redneck sheriff. The footage is good, and in some shots it is good. The Danny Elfman composite score is as good as it gets and is one of his best work. The end was epic, with nonstop action for about twenty minutes. Overall, Nightbreed is a tremendous achievement for Clive Barker, and stands as my favorite of his movies, just slightly for Hellraiser. 9/10
