Lush cinematography, beautifully written and edited, John Boorman's Beyond Rangoon is a must-see for anyone interested in world politics and the arc of personal transformation. It intertwines a personal and political story that still haunts me, in the mind's eye with frequency. The story line is poignant, and the inner and outer journeys are meticulous and fine, both cinematically and in the story line. I watched this movie at least six times, and it keeps a lot of attention. This is particularly relevant today, given world events. Check it out, you won't regret it! VAT, NetFlix does not yet carry it, but you can request that they do so.
