The thirty years that have passed since making this movie have made the tension a little, and will not keep the public so attentive, as I probably did in 1979. It's still enough to remember enough - and regain some of its power when one finds its sad relevance today (look at the story of Davis-Besse's core industry, FirstEnergy). With the top-line actors and steady pace, one can overlook the dated 70's and see it for political criticism. However, I doubt it will survive the test of time. It may not be completely forgotten, thanks to its role, but otherwise the dialogue, setting and counting will make a repetition of this movie inevitable. As the oil situation is now comparable to the situation in the 70's and alternative energy sources are becoming a hot topic, we can only hope that the current generation gets stronger warnings about the risks of (privatized) nuclear power like this.
