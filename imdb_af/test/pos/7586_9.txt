I watched over 2,000 Studio-Era audio films - including many Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Shirley Jones and Deanna Durbin's own Universal features - plus a decent amount of live and studio-recorded musical comedy and opera. And I assure you, no one with the job of singing with a camera and microphone, or anywhere, ever, DURBIN'S SOLO has ever listened here. Mono soundtrack and crap 1930s microphones and everything. The kid from Canada sang this bit of Il Bacio as she lived and wrote it herself and then appeared for a retrospective in Italy, late in her career, not like a child who taught it from her music teacher. <Br /> <br /> If you hit this Extra on the DVD, or remain after the Garland solo, you will be deprived of yourself as this cheap MGM teaser only achieved one of the 20c's greatest performances.
