Most people will consider Yul Brynner's greatest performance as the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND I. It certainly gave him a wide variety of moods to test his abilities, from the comic to the tragic, from the eager to learn to dominate to hate. It also benefited him as a "singer" and a dancer. Finally, as it was his Tony Broadway winner, the movie allowed us to capture something of the great Broadway show. <br /> <br /> But he did other movies that showed his talents as well as THE. KING AND I. His comic twist in ANY MORE WITH FEELING was quite nice. So were his performances as General Bunin in ANASTASIA, or his Ramses in the Ten Commandments. Yet he came terribly close as a 1950's successor to Eric Von Stroheim as "the man you love to hate." A certain vulnerability in his play and role wrapped him in the film, even after his best years as a star behind him - and he has increasingly withdrawn to repeat the King of Siam on television and stage. <br /> <To me, his best performance in this 1959 drama is with Deborah Kerr, Jason Robards Jr., Robert Morley, EG Marshall, Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard. The film is in beautiful modern times - the powder coal that was Hungary in 1956, when it briefly looked as if the Iron Curtain was under the reforms of the Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his supporters. But the Hungarian Revolution has collapsed due to bad timing. The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent tanks to shatter the uprising (and arrested and executed Nagy and other reformers). The West stood and made it happen: England and France caught in the Suez crisis, and the US robbed them and Israel of attacking Egypt. Due to the actions of three US allies, the West found it difficult to condemn the remains of the Soviet Union. It was an unfortunate situation, and the Hungers have never forgotten how they were left. <br /> <br /> In the film is Brynner Major Surov, a Russian intelligence officer who looks at some of the leaders of the Hungarian uprising, one of whom is Paul Kedes (Jason Robards). Kedes can get help from some Westerners on a bus trip through Hungary, led by Robert Morley (including Marshall, Jackson, Howard and Kerr). The latter is being held in a hotel while their bus is being repaired, and Brynner mixes with them and hopes for an advantage over Robards' residence. But Brynner is human. He is trying to be with these people, all of whom regard him as a monster. And if he drank a little too much, he confronted them with the questions that historians had bothered since 1945. How is it (even if one observes that Russia had Stalin in control) that the relationship between Russia and the West was so rapid? The allies generally worked well from 1941 to 1945, but to Yalta and Potsdam all forms of mutual suspicion only broke out. Did they have it? Surov is a good officer, but he is married in half to the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and in Hungary he supports, and his growing love for Kerr, who hides Robards, but is also prepared for the more human side. to see. of the Russian major. And if the film reaches the tragic climax, we look at Surov to decide whether he will follow his sense of service, or be sorry for Kerr, Robards and the other Westerners who want to leave. It becomes a real battle for him - and one that he can win too late. It was a wonderful movie about a tragedy of post-war Europe, and possibly the most thoughtful role that Yul Brynner ever portrayed.
