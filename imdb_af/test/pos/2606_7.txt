The movie starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows down the pace considerably. Billie "Buckwheat" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When left on the riverboat, his fear and surrender are tangible and his tears are really heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man to ask for help and is repeatedly rejected, the viewer really starts to wonder if it's a comedy or not. Looking at a children's birthday party through a poster fence is another moment. As another reviewer mentioned, I was also worried about the big dog choking on chicken legs! Once Spanky and Bokwiet are in Marshall Valiant's house, Spanky tends to communicate mainly with adults and the children's chemistry is essentially lost. <br /> <br /> The Old South / Huck Finn-type environment doesn't really work much for the plot, except the kids can be out of the door. Ralph Morgan is the most encouraging adult, but then the other roles don't really matter to them. Louise Beavers manages the funny moments with a Yankee soldier. <br /> <br /> The villains aren't actually shameful enough and the lovers aren't intense enough. Still, I think it is worth watching if you are a Our Gang enthusiast, but for no other reason the weird curiosity of the whole piece. I give it seven stars because, while it wasn't a big movie, it captivated me all the time and was curious about what would happen next.
