WARNING: PLOT SPOILER <br /> <br /> The ever-abnormal films of David Cronenberg are definitely an acquired taste. Fans of his previous films are likely to hold 'eXistenZ', but this is certainly not one of the pain. All the common elements are here. A game tree made out of your skin (slipped into your back), buckets of blood, a gun made from legs, and a manic mechanic to name but a few. The result is good in parts, bad in parts, and just strange in others. But one thing the movie has is unmistakable originality. <br /> <br /> Despite the excessive use of ?? weirdness this proves a point-virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people. In the movie, a character kills someone who claims he was "annoying" (assuming she was still in the game). But it does matter whether it really happened or if it was a look in this wonderfully lively game. "eXistenZ" leads to a conclusion that can be reacted in several ways. <br /> <br /> Despite some extra gadgets and jokes, was it just your classic "it was all a dream?" or was it a breeze. It's a clever surprise and answers a few questions, but giving the whole movie so far has been a little disappointing. In just 97 minutes it could have been a bit longer. In a strange way, the film raises moral issues, but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Jason Leigh appears here in her first major role in some time. But her character doesn't have enough features to jump her off the screen or even give her a similar character. Jude Law on the other hand (equipped with a peculiar American accent) is good as your average Joe sucked into this abnormal world. We see the film through its perspective. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is far from flawless, but it's definitely a movie experience to remember. There are tons of strange features that match the similar styles of David Lynch (next? - are consumed by a question mark?!?!?!). It is definitely not for all tastes, but it is rewarding enough to recommend. My IMDb rating: 6.2 / 10.
