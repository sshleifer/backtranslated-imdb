I only saw it on syndicated TV in the 1970s and admired its production values, which were high technology for the time being. The remastered video is rich and colorful, much more intense, then pushes the light 35mm TV. This movie earns more attention: it paved the way for UFO, Space: 1999 and even Star Wars with its detailed miniature and cleverly designed gadgets. Of course, the story of an alternative planet against the planet of the earth since the Star Trek has been reclaimed a hundred times. The beauty of this movie is its self-confident European flair for design: from the Rolls Royce engines to the Euro Sec. Letterhead business paper, JFSS or Dopplegangers as it is called in Europe, is pleasing to Europe's imaginary vision in space in the shadow of the Superpowers. Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's ambitious epic becomes a bit boring when the American astronaut finally realizes he is on the plunger ground. And everything is literally downhill to the poetic graceful commute sequence. A mediocre story is helped by a large and lyrical classic score by former Barry Gray, John Williams of Britain.
