I just saw it at a preview screen. I didn't read the book, but heard a lot of good things. <br /> <br /> The movie was absolutely fantastic, much moving. With a roller coaster of emotions, you are completely connected to the characters. Shaun Toub was wonderful, it was a complete departure from his ordinary roles, and his acting for those who understood Persian / Dari was incredible. <br /> <br /> One thing to note is that Khaled Hosseini is the movie that actually loves, unusual for book adaptation movies. Even after watching the movie several times, he struggled. <br /> <br /> The animation of the intro was also beautiful, especially as if it were Persian calligraphy, very unique! Sometimes the translation did not convey the message effectively, but it was all a good movie.
