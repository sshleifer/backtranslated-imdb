That's what movies should strive for. Funny without being completely stupid, a bit sexy without every female in the movie showing her boobs, biting without using every 'line' on 'f-bombs'. I've seen Justin Long appear in many movies over the past few years, I played the right role he could break out. (Mac ads are not resisting.) This movie can only be posted to the A list in a quick way. The rest of the player also did their job perfectly, which is an excellent little movie with a good message. (But you don't have to buy the message to have a good time.) Lewis Black is as usual hilarious, and Blake Lively is a fresh face. <br /> <br /> Take a few hours and watch this movie, they won't be wasted.
