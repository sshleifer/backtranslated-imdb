I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing about this movie is that you can expect nothing but entertainment. It's not an intellectual comedy, it's a clever popcorn movie. The three main roles are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standpoint in the supportive role of himself, a former TV cop who was introduced by Russo's character to train police on how to be 'TV police'. This is by far the funniest scene. If you want to entertain and just sit down for a laugh, watch this movie.
