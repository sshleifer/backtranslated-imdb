Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett, the supporting roles round off to the foursome of lies and intrigue. But in the heart of everything, every character holds a streak of decency - moral conscience being acted upon in spite of obvious contradictions. "Inconsistencies are the source of all movement and of all life." How these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the heart of this plot - she is the central conscience with which the other three closed. She is unsatisfied with the decency. <br /> <br /> The circumstances of lies are for each one his own: one to defend his professional name; one to hold back due to family / partner pressure; One simply does not want to face the result; one ironic cannot believe the truth and lies to save friendship. These are already uncertain situations. There lies the plot - fascinating to see how each one tackles the truth and lies. Contradictions, indeed. Despite the apparent dishonesty, thoroughness and heart remain strong. <br /> <br /> Handling the particular subject and how each of the characters are worn is simply masterfully delivered to the brightness. It's not sensational or complex like another movie "Where the Truth Lies". Credits due to Fellowes' writing and the recent performances of both Watson and Wilkinson. There is some kind of warmth that comes from the seemingly brave or frustrating lies. Under all this, human weakness not excluded, they meant well. And according to the story, the event gave satisfaction and smiled at how the two Manning's grew and grew in their relationship. <br /> <br /> You can say there is no clear action drama or exciting scenes in "Separate Lies" but the plot is there and it will keep your attention. The meritorious production efforts include cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts (a veteran of the Merchant-Ivory films) and music by Stanislas Syrewicz, with the vote of composer Zbignew Priesner (from filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski's Trois Couleurs, especially : Bleu 1993). It's a British movie you might not want to miss. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson (Anne's wife): Breaking the Waves 1996 debut; Hilary and Jackie 1998; The Luzhin Defense 2000; Gosford Park 2001; Punch-Drunk Love, Red Dragon, Equilibrium in 2002. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson (James the Man): The Full Monty 1997; The government, rush hour (as villain) in 1998; In the bedroom 2001, Normal (HBO movie) 2003, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2004, recently as Father Moore in: The Exorcism of Emily Rose 2005 vs. Laura Linney. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett (Bill): He is simply delightful in "My Best Friend's Wedding" 1997 versus Julia Roberts and wonderful in "an ideal man" 1999 d: Oliver Parker, an Oscar Wilde game .
