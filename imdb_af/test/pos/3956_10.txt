I had the chance to see Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it immensely. I thought it was one of the most engaging movies I have ever seen. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpected and brilliant filming of great places. The three heroes share a chemistry on the screen that runs across the film, making it so exciting. They are geared towards outstanding landscapes that are visible to such an original eye (the DOP's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time. The mood of the desert is flowing everywhere and even the scenes filmed in the streets of Los Angeles or San Francisaco seem to be a natural extension. The story rides you smoothly through all these beautiful settings to lead you to a bittersweet end, the perfect climax for this perfect trip. The construction of the film itself is a masterpiece. The skilled use of innovative resources (such as Danny's memories in the film) will be compared to those handmade pieces of work so scarce and so enjoyable. Blind Spot obtains the essence of the desert and takes you to a universal common ground where anyone can feel as a discovery and native.
