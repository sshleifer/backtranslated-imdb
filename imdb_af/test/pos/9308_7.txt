It was a fascinating story waiting to be told. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes us in the trials and tribulations of a group of top American scientists in World War II handing over a lofty task: defeat everyone at the atomic bomb. Advanced in a heavily guarded New Mexico composition, the brainiacs slowly change the idea from ambitious concepts to the immense reality. <br /> <br /> BUTTONS AND LITTLE BOY are one of those movies that pay attention to you. It is a real person's movie, not just the scientific aspect of developing a seemingly impossible weapon, but also the moral implications of massively contributing. Characters are constantly torn between that reality and their wartime as Americans. The movie is never a minister, but let us free ourselves to marvel at the enormous inner turmoil that these men face. The performances also deserve special mention. Paul Newman delivers one of his great, understated performances as the Pattonesque General in charge of delivering the ultimate big stick to the Allied Forces. <br /> <br /> Where LITTLE MAN AND LITTLE BOY lose much of his traction, it is unnecessarily romantic component. Dwight Schultz as the leader of the scientific team struggles with his grief for his family and his relentless obsession with his big project. Director Roland Joffe apparently had the need to investigate the more human angles of this story, but the romantic overtones serve mainly as a distraction. In addition, it is the interaction between the scientists and their military hierarchy that gives us the best insight into the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant men. Yet it is difficult not to recommend fat and small boys. It is a largely forgotten gem that puts a human face on one of the most interesting stories in human history.
