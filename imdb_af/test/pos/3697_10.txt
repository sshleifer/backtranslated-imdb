This movie is excellent. The passion between Jade and Billy is unforgettable and the acting was wonderful. That's why you're not leaving a 16-year-old and a young man alone! It shows why a single mother does not have to be a younger man at a teenage daughter in the house because he has seen young enough to be Jessy's son. <br /> <br /> I give it ten out of ten, The acting was great and the movements between the actors were correct. <br /> <br /> The age difference between Jenny and Rob was also good, as they were alike. <br /> Overall, this is a pleasure movie but I don't think anyone under 13 should watch this movie because of the sexual scenes.
