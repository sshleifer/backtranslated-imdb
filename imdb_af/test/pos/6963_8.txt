The beautiful, yet deadly Alexandra (beautiful static blonde beauty Stacie Randall, who really crushes a tight black leather outfit) must find a magical amulet so her evil demonic master Faust can cross our dimension. It's for the intrepid, stout policeman Jonathan Graves (licking Peter Liapis) to stop her. Meanwhile, two unfortunate "comic relief" runs dwarf gum creatures amok in Los Angeles. Seasoned veteran schlock exploitation expert Jim Wynorski tells the highly boring story at a rapid pace and takes nothing of this remote folly seriously. The hectic struggle with folly: the worship of Barbara Alyn Woods as sassy, ​​picks up police captain Kate, Raquel Krelle as tart, sexy hooker Jeanine, Bobby Di Cicco as Graves' hug, exciting partner Scotty, Peggy Trentini as various museum curate Monica, and Ace Mask as all Dr. Rochelle. Mark Stevi's puerile cookie cut script, an amusing lowbrow sense of no-brainer humor, Chuck Cirino's bouncy cornball score, the two dwarf guys sport obviously cheap rubber Halloween masks, JE Bash's simple cinematography, no tension or free female nudity to speak of, and the sticky (less than) special effects enhance the overall delicious cheese of this first cut celluloid Velveeta. An entertaining mindless piece of lovely loops of drink.
