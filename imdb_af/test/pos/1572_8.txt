It's a low budget, well-activated jewelry. Alice, a small town of the Massachusetts teenager, set her up on her way to escape her mother who abandons civilians and her own work as a lookout in a supermarket. She goes out for Florida and stays with her richer high school friend, who is a freshman in Miami. After her car breaks down suspiciously on the thruway and loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple in an RV who also travels to Florida. The couple, brilliantly played by Judith Ivy and Bill Raymond, are guest. And it turns out a prostitute and her pimp. Slowly, Alice is lured in truck stop prostitution, as the RV is moving down the general direction of Florida. Through intermittent flashbacks, we learn a little more about Alice and her desire to leave little Milford. We also see the couple in a new light and their lives and the choices made by the couple and Alice seem quite credible. An excellent, well-made movie that you will think of when it's over.
