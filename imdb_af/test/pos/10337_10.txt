When I was in the 7th grade (back in 1977), I was asked to read the novel on which it was based as part of my English class study. I can remember being touched and excited when a TV version came out a year later. <br /> <br /> Kristy McNichol was a popular TV actress when this film was produced and is already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family. on the hit TV series "Family". It was clear that she had the scope and ability to pull off this part. I sometimes remind her that it is a bit stiff, but she does a good job about everything. She's wearing the movie well. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle is fantastic as the household that is apparently the only one in the household that really cares for her. Barbara Barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good, as young Robin Lively (who would eventually appear as the black widow Lana Milford in Twin Peaks) as the favorite younger sister who seems to be the focus of the parent's focus. love. Bruce Davidson is also quite attractive as the German soldier of the title <br /> <br /> The best performance, however, belongs to Michael Constantine. It is truly powerful and deserves more recognition than it was at the time. The bitterness and coldness he expresses makes the scenes in which he looks difficult to look at, but makes it much easier to understand the silence of the rejected daughter. Constantine gives everything the right intensity and looks a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivation. <br /> <br /> The film only differs from the book in some small ways. It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope it will be released on video or DVD again. <br /> <br />
