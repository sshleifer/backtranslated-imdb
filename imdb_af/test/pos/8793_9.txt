Well, I must say, "the only movie related to club / dj / electronic music and raves ... that respects ravers." <br /> <br /> Seriously now. It is a wonderful, quick and fairly accurate depiction of the night of a rower. Though in a club, it is in Wales and its somewhat dated. The movie leaves some of the sketchy elements of club life, but it's not quite theirs. It offers an idyllic but serious representation of the up and down characters. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the movie, and the best element of Justin Kerrigan's writing, are the characters, eccentric, unique but completely understandable and accessible. This movie simply won't work and becomes infinitely less entertaining if it's not for Jip, Koop, Nina, Moff and Lulu. Viewers can deny the political and social implications of the sub-text of Human Traffic as a drug film, Trainspotting wannabe, key in British youth culture about 90's, BUT .... they can't deny that they involve characters. <Br /> <br /> It's crazy, she's brutally honest, it's sober, it's top, but it's a big comedy. <br /> <br /> Raves are a complex thing, so the drugs taken at these events are the ones you will experience. But from someone who has gone to parties, a naked and still goes ... Human traffic is the best snapshot that can be taken from the subculture. Whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic.
