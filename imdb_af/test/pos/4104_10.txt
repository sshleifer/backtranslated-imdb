It could be a remake of the 1937 movie by Capra, but it's just wrong to consider it! It was supposed to uncover Hilton's novel in a completely different way. As a musical is excellent. The scenery is great, the characters good and anyone like "Leonard Maltin" who judges the Bacharach music must be completely deaf! I highly recommend it.
