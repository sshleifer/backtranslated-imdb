It plays like your regular teen audience T&A movie, but the sentiment is incredibly dark. If made today, it is considered an art house movie. It goes through the ordinary routine of a man trying to be laid, but the results of his efforts are hard and cruel and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> The whole teen movie formula is met, but nothing shows you will expect. Imagine a director's cut of "It's a Wonderful Life" where James Stewart did not return to the real world. An amazing movie that endorses all the expectations of the genre. It then makes you feel dirty: there is no salvation for the characters. I'm surprised it was ever made. The eighties version of detective story.
