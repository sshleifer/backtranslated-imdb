It's a gently amusing comedy that comes from the later, more mature period of Neil Simon's writing. Although there are many wisecracks to go around, it is not one of those Neil Simon pieces where each character smacks one-liner jokes for one hour, as they are a guest star on a Bob Hope special. There are also dramatic elements (some work, some are overcome) that give some weight to the story. <br /> <br /> The performances are good on the board, especially Blythe Danner as the mother (although she and Judith Ivey are strangely WASP-ish choices to play Jewish women). I have never been a fan of Jonathan Silverman, but I will say that he hits the right notes as the unpleasant, gawky and completely audacious teen narrator / main character of the story. <br /> <br /> The movie is very similar to Woody Allen's "Radio Days", but the latter is imaginative and funnier than this one.
