Unfortunately, this movie has been affected in the UK and it has not earned it. The trailer of this movie is slightly misleading, and I think it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was "Reconciliation: Part 2". While the film was marketed to capitalize on the earlier success of Joe Wright's BAFTA award-winning film, it is very different in tone. It focuses on the imagination of all sorts of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas during World War II as the author of propaganda for the war effort and his subsequent return to Wales. Director John Maybury presents Dylan's (Matthew Ryhs) granddaughter Vera Phillips, played by Keira Knightley. She was Dylan's first love in their homeland, but the moment is over, and singer Vera just wants it as a beautiful memory. Or does she? Vera unexpectedly expects a close relationship with the other woman in Dylan's life, "Queen of Ireland, the love of my life, my mother of my child" Caitlin Thomas (Sienna Miller). The three form some kind of a trois in the war, hit London, but Vera then falls for a pounding soldier, William Killick (Cillian Murphy). They get married quickly, with Killick leaving for the war. A terrifying Vera convinced the Thomas to return to Wales, but the three are confronted with the realism of the birth of Vera's child, William's jealousy and jerk after returning. Caitlin realizes she can't share Dylan with her best friend. <br /> <br /> Filmed on a low budget, it's more of a tuner than anything else. It works best as a realization that some memories and feelings need to be appreciated, but not renewed. The performance of Sienna Miller is particularly excellent (unfortunately, the paparazzi nonsense is detrimental to being quite talented), and Knightley and Murphy are very good again. The downfall is Rhys as Dylan, who, while the Welsh poet was not a bed of roses, had no charisma and made us wonder what these women in Dylan see. The writing is many brackets, a few beautiful moments that are drenched with messiness. However, it is worth looking at.
