When I see Bon Voyage, I expected a good, skilled multidrama on the order of the Grand Hotel (1932) and Les Enfants de Paradis (1944). It was better than that. With few exceptions, none of the characters were quite good or completely angry - just like in real life. The acting was great, especially those that played Frederic, Raoul and Camille. Photography was wonderful, as it recreated the time perfectly and managed to be shot in new time in Bordeaux, but managed the "look" of June 1940. Costumes and make-up were accurate. There is so much in this movie that it is worth a second show. It is exciting, funny, and finally touching. NB - Be sure to see it in a good quality projection theater. It's in wide screen, and in the theater I saw it (the Clairmont in Montclair), the first 30 minutes of the subtitles were in focus at the bottom, but the actors' faces became slightly blurred! It was finally fixed, but detracted from the pleasure of the movie.
