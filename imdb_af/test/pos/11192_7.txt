So, I will disagree with the critics, but I was not really everyone who touched this movie. I was a little hesitant to rent it, because I'm going through some of the same things that the protagonist is supposed to experience. Yet I hired it to think that I might experience some catharsis, or at least understand that I am not alone. while I understand the protagonist's irritation with his negligent cousin, I didn't feel his internal struggle with isolation as much as I would have liked. I felt there was more emphasis on his disruptive cousin who exceeded her welcome. It's a beautiful movie, and I used the silence to express the feeling of isolation.
