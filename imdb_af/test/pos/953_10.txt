brilliant screenplay. <br /> <br /> The script is very strict .. that you will be seated in the seat. <br /> <br /> This movie is an example for movie to survive just with script and no story. <br /> <br /> Story is very simple that you can write in one line. but screenplay was incredible. <br /> <br /> Brilliant performance by Vijay and Prakashraj .. <br /> <br /> although the plot is similar to Occidental .. director only adapted the plot. Tamil version is much faster than Telugu. <br /> <br /> Film moves straight without any chance of deviation, though you can understand every character relapse. <br /> <br /> Keep up
