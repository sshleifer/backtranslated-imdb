Normally I try to avoid Barbie movies, but this one was unmistakably wonderful. Kudos to the graphic and character voice books. It all flowed well. This enchanting story is a good turn of others, but is worth buying! I don't have kids, but the kids I babysit (including boys) find it intriguing and like the extra features on the DVD. I honestly don't know why it's so low, but for kids, especially your Barbie Lovin '8-year-old, it'll love it. It's not straight forward and predictive like most movies. These "kids" films have excellent morals and show teamwork. It has no curse, romance (if you are old enough to find out) and a beautifully written storyline. That's why I give it ten out of ten!
