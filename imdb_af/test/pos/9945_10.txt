When I was growing up, Voyage in Space was my favorite movie. I remember the time KTLA (Channel 5) ran the movie all week and my sisters and I watched it every day! I still remember every part of that movie. The end was so sad when Giant Robot was blown up with Guillotine and then Johnny Sokko watched Giant Robot with all the tears blowing on his face. There had to be a sequel to the movie, in which Giant Robot somehow survived the explosion. :) I can't believe there are so many other Voyage in Space fans out there. I really want to buy the movie when it comes to DVD, but my sister said those out there are now in the boat and probably bad quality copies of the movie. I don't know why they haven't released it since it's been 40 years now. I think Voyage in space was made back in 1968. Only now, my second favorite Japanese monster movie of all time (The War of the Gargantas) finally comes on DVD and is released on September 9 and I can't wait! :) Now if they would just do the same with Voyage in space. Giant Robot, Johnny Sokko, and Voyage in Space will never be forgotten! In my eyes and probably many others, it will always be a childhood for me! :)
