John Huston made many remarkable and memorable films. Those who were remembered most and more easily were released long before his passing in 1987. However, it was the year that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game, due to his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's award-winning novel "The Dead." <br /> <br /> One day ago man, called Doc, asked me, "Isn't" The Dead "remarkably more lively and bright than any of the other stories in Dubliners?" I tend to think it is. The story and film both feature Joyce's common commentary and criticism, but mostly, paint a warm and loving portrait of an Irish Joyce himself. He responded so often and would leave soon. <br /> <br /> Huston's handling of protagonist Gabriel Conroy, who realizes the world as he sees it, is nothing more than an illusion, is simply remarkable. To claim that the movie doesn't have a plot is to miss the point. As with any of Joyce's Dubliners, the plot - while definitely present - is not the focus. Plot is simply a tool for transmitting the protagonist's epiphany. In addition to an apparent lack of action, there is very little dialogue in Joyce's short story for the director to lean on. Huston's ability to translate what Joyce puts into words in figurines is probably the movie's greatest triumph. Feelings, thoughts ... Gabriel's discomfort during the dance ... all these intangible assets jump to life and come into viewer's understanding in Huston's depiction. <br /> <br /> To claim that Huston softened his writer's criticism of society, misses the point. While "The Dead" can be painted with cheerful colors, the complacency and prediction of the movie characters is just a commentary on society on a smaller scale: we are the old lady; the embarrassment drunk; the tenor with the sore throat; the woman with the sad, rain soaked secret; even the self-centered middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> But the "Dead" believes his title. It's not a dark story. It's not that dark either. For a moment, forget about the snow falling on the living and the dead and its inherent symbolism; Gabriel wakes up at the end of the movie: it is only with the destruction of the illusions that Gabriel has of himself and his world that he can really move forward. So is the centerpiece of the movie. This is the central point of our lives.
