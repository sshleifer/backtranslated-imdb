For me, "Anatomy" is definitely one of the better movies I've seen. I don't think "Anatomy" was primarily meant to be a horror movie, but a film that questioned the ethics of science. Keeping this in mind, it becomes a very good movie. The only annoying bit was the terrible voice copy for the English version. How can you expect a non-German person to listen to this unbearable German accent for two hours? Let native English speakers speak or use subtitles rather!
