The three main characters are all hopeless, and yet you feel sorry for one of them: Ernesto, hopelessly devoted to Mercedes. It was part of the frustration: screaming at Mercedes to get a clue and to relax the non-good Harry. <br /> <br /> Then there's the satisfaction: Steve Buscemi plays a big role as a transvestite, and Harvey Keitel's moving story of his indignation to play a gorilla for a cheap TV movie is incredible . When you least expect it, Quentin Tarintino does a half monologue, and Anthony Quinn makes Ernesto a rich man. <br /> <br /> Once again, great moments appear in the story, but in the end it's hard to know what to feel about this movie. It doesn't have a happy ending, or even a complete one, but somehow it feels right. <br /> <br /> This movie is strange, but so am I; No wonder I like it.
