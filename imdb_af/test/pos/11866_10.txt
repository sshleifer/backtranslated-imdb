A very funny movie. Michael Douglas' 'do' is worth watching this movie because if there is no other reason. I want to see him do more of these low life roles. He was fantastic, just like all the artists. <br /> <br /> The movie has managed me as an American Roshomon, just funny and easier to watch, because it was in America and doesn't need any stinkin subtitles! <br /> <br /> In a funny movie with a laugh every minute or two, two were the best with John Goodman (not someone I'm crazy about). 1. He tells the priest about Jewel to do something he liked and said: "I had to wipe the smile off my face." The visual shows that he is not smiling and clear is a man who never smiles, but probably does not know. 2. The scene at the end between Goodman, who was all tailor-made for Jewel in his cop uniform and clipped the table over a table ... and the two then protest that they are not gay in another that happens at the scene - it alone earns a special comedy academy award.
