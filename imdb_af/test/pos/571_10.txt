I don't have to say much about how good this documentary is - it's really a wonderful piece of real story. The story is simple enough: A white senior citizen tourist is murdered by a young black man in Florida and the boy arrested is being abused and tried on his side with the public defender and his family. It is very encouraging and the public defender is delighted to look at all his human ways - you cannot help pull the victory of justice, and the end is more than what can be expected from a true story. <Br /> <br /> It is a pity that more people have not seen this documentary, but hopefully you will find a way to see it. For those interested in racial relations in the United States, and the actual functioning of law enforcement and the legal process, it is worthwhile finding your time and effort to find this documentary document. I give it a 10.
