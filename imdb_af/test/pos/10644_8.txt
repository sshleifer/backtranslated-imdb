I wanted to see it for a while: I never thought I'd look at it in a moist Trafalgar Square, London with 15 000 other people and everything after a new score by the Pet Shop Boys. <br /> <br /> Quickly, that experience specifically. A new departure from PSB suffered as though he had the miniature expert Hugo Wolf when he wrote his opera Der Corregidor: the long structure was a chain of short, ie songs. PSB delivered a more liquid, integrated score, although it was fairly static on its own. They also could not resist the song: an institution of the caption text worked in this respect, a freestanding meditation on the actions of the Odessa Steps massacre during the actions of that series itself, I would go so far Going to say counterproductive. Overall, however, it was very exciting. This is probably what Eisenstein is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> It's a very exciting movie with faster editing that takes the place of acceleration or action. In fact, the film, though beautifully shot and passionate (it has a silent movie melodrama, but not in excess of the Hollywood comic style) breathes through its careful editing-pacing specific shots with a sense of pace against which the audience will take them. And there is also a great variety of perspectives; either he had many cameras or the rows on the harbor and steps took a lot of time. <br /> <br /> Superfilm, which can be assessed regardless of sound, as is how the end product would have been. 8/10
