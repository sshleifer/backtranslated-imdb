When will ART overcome racism? I believe Americans grew up since this movie was made. Porgy consists of a star cast and music. This film is an excellent adaptation of a large opera. ie, Miss Saigon is based on Madame Butterfly, Les Miz is based on a classic book. Recently, an opera was presented here in Los Angeles, based on the film The Fly. An OPERA !! So it will be !! <br /> <br /> Disney is hesitant about the release of the Song of the South. The NAACP made no contest for racing, and let's not forget Amos N Andy was a big hit in the 50's as a TV show. Ethnicity is our heritage in the US and we need to embrace all forms of ethnic artistic diversity. <br /> <br /> PLEASE PORGIE ON DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> j hartz
