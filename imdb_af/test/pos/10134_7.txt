Not much, but a confirmation of small town values ​​and the embrace of a mental young man in his heart. <br /> <br /> I read some of the reviews and was amazed at some of the hostility it caused. I felt Cuba Gooding handled the part with dignity and respect as opposed to Sean Penn's flyhalf image in "I'm Sam." <br /> <br /> The fact that it is based on a true story makes it increasingly heartwarming. Sport is taken seriously in the small town of high school America (and elsewhere I suspect) and I felt that the portrayal of these competitive students opened their hearts to one less fortunate rank, at least for me. <br /> <br /> The coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and Radio, but rather made the decision himself under Radio's loving and open manners. Well done for everyone. 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Debra Winger, we need more of you in pictures!
