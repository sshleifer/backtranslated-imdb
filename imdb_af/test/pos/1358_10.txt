Finally! Other people who actually saw this show! It's the funniest anime I've ever seen, but most people even heard about it. It's just hilarious. "And so Kintaro will continue to ride his reliable bike and maybe one day he will save the world ... or maybe not." just type in a few classic bits in it 'and so he'll drive to the next city ... because he has no choice, since his brakes are broken (study study)' And some of the lessons he writes in his little notebook , "Today I had a very educational experience. I tried to look back, but unfortunately I have already looked like this. It hurt. Today's lesson, the human head can't turn 360 degrees."
