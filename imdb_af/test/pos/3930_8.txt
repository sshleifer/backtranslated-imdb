I didn't expect too much from this movie when I was in the theater, but I've been waiting for it for many years. To sum it up, it was pretty damn good! Chad Michael Murray was pretty good, I thought he was going to be another Chris Flynn from Wrong Turn, but I was wrong. Elisha Cuthbert was also good, but the best performance should go to Brian Van Holt. He also played the bad guy, I mean he was sick, sadistic and very cruel. The back story between the brothers was good, and I liked that there were no deadly acts up to about 40 minutes in the film. It gave you time to choose the character you wanted to see and the one you wanted to see. Jon Abrahams was pretty good as the goofy best button of CMM. I liked how Chad cried when he found himself dead. It was better than just being like, "Whatever, my partner is dead, who cares." It showed how he really cared. So overall, it was a darn god skater with some great effects. Bravo!
