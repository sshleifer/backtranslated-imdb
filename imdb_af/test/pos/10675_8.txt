"Doppler" (or "Journey to the Far Side of the Sun", as it is more commonly known) was written (with late Donald James input) and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, best known for their Supermarionation television show like " Thunderbirds. <br /> <br /> The international space agency Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun and suggests sending a manned flight to it. The committee beams at the exaggerated cost and picks up the project. But when a security leak at the agency is discovered, the fear that the Russians can get there is getting the green light. <br /> <br /> American astronaut Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) is with British scientist John Kane (Ian Hendry). After weeks of disturbing training, the Phoenix explodes, heading for the unknown. <br /> <br /> Three weeks later, they crash into a dark mountainous landscape. Ross survived, but Kane was seriously injured. A light is seen moving towards them. <br /> <br /> I'll leave the synopsis here. Up to this point, the film is underway, with excellent special effects (by Derek Meddings) and music by Anderson's resident composer Barry Gray (why it was not released on C.D. is a mystery). But when Ross and Kane land, and we discover the secret of the alien world - it's a duplicate of our own, all at the same, the only big difference is that things are reversed - it gets less interesting and ends with ' a disruptive anti-climax. I think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea, but Gerry & Sylvia later did something similar on their Space: 1999 show. Ross (and eventually loses) his life in an attempt to return to earth - his earth. But why? The new Earth is so similar that it might not have bothered. <br /> <br /> Roy Thinnes recently did The Invaders television series, giving a skilled performance (sorry, there were no more scenes like the one he was driving with his wife). Ian Hendry is good as 'Kane', but soon disappears from the story. Several actors appeared in the Anderson's "U.F.O". such as Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Shine and you will miss Nicholas Courtney ("The Brigadier" of "Dr.Who" in a small role). But the acting honors go to late Patrick Wymark as 'Jason Webb', head of Eurosec. The character is not far removed from 'Sir John Wilder', the one he owns in A.T.V. played 'The Power Game'. Webb is such a cunning character that he is wonderful to watch. Herbert Lom's contribution (as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye) amounts to little more than a cameo. <br /> <br /> As I said, the special effects are great, just like the sets. The movie is therefore worth watching, but does not expect much to happen as soon as the action moves to the mirror planet. With a stronger script it could have been another 'Planet Of The Apes', or - I dare say it - '2001: A Space Odyssey'. <br /> <br /> In Anderson's productions, he has the future as a wonderful place, an adventurous playground where science was cool. Everybody swung cars, whose doors opened vertically, sexy women and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world. We are now in the future and people are watching another night at 'Coronation Street'. How disappointing. If a mirror Earth really exists somewhere, you hope it's a better place than this one. If all the women look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, I'll be on the next flight!
