Well, as you can see, I brought this party properly, but have the advantage to read all the previous entries before commenting. I found this site by chance chance when I was looking for other Marine Corps movies. So, let me start telling you that I played a Marine Boat in the movie, Pvt. Labarsky, and was stationed at MCRDep, San Diego. Jack Webb and his crew selected 15 Permanent Staff, some of whom had the talking parts, and another 15 Marines who only completed Boot Camp. It was the Platoon and the Marines who portrayed the various DIs. To the best of my memory, The Capt. And Pvt. Owens (Don Dubbins) was not in the Marines. We shot about three weeks in Hollywood (Studio City Film Lot), CA, the movie of the movie we were involved in, and then they completed the other shots after we left. <br /> <br /> So as I walk here, let me explain what was asked in previous entries as well as I can. "Cuff Daddy" was about our ability to shout "Yes Sir" without moving and so on. Yes, we did the shout for the Sound Guys and that was while we shot the scene. As your fellow Marines remember, when the DI or who ever started asking a question and before completing it, you've taken your airliner so you can scream the right answer on top of your lungs. This is how it was done. <br /> <br /> "74Sooner" commented to walk through the same building in Paris, but as I mentioned earlier, all the screens in Studio City, CA, were shot. They were built from photographs taken on Paris island and from on-site hikes and marine advisers from Paris Island. Sorry, you were in the right buildings, not the sets. <br /> <br /> "Schappe1" gained very good points, but about the incident with the platoon in Paris Island, that jack Webb said. we were, "The movie came because of the accident, and the Marine Corps wanted to put anything out that would affect any of the Marines' relatives who died that night. Although the Marine Corps would provide any Marines and need help for a movie that answers to the public, why a Marine DI does what it does. "<br /> <br /> As mentioned by some of you, when I shot the screens, I caught my self-thinking Dialogue is cleared too much and of course it's not how it goes in real life. Back in the 50's, so did it. <br /> <br /> One story I would like to convey is about the interaction between our Marines and the Movie Crew, and between the Movie Crew and Jack Webb. From the beginning, the Marines have "Yes Sir" to anyone who has moved. In the second week it was more common to hear "Yes Sir" coming from all directions. On stage someone will ask for a request for something to be done with the lighting, and from outside on a catwalk above the set, an answer from Ja Mene will go out. For all this at one of our informal meetings, Jack Webb said. "If I knew I would get so much respect from this crew, I would have brought you here many years ago." There was a Lt. educated from San Diego to play the role of the DI from the other platoon and the one Jack Webb, but during one shooting seconds he was at number 32, and still Webb tried to work him. by how he wanted to do it and showed no lack of patience with him. The next day they used the Paris Island Advisor who was a DI Sgt. from Paris island and he worked out well. <br /> <br /> Then I was somewhat of a camera buffalo and he got the Still Camera Man to get him a wiser and as it turned out he would give me. still shots and some of the 35mm film of the daily shooting that will not be used. Those slips I cut and made chips from them. After the movie came out in VHS band (The DI, 11706 B & W / 106 min.) Have my kids and the big kids an explosion when they try to see who can get me the most on the screen.
