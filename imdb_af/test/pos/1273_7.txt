If Christopher Nolan Memento made the following, all the errors in Following would be correct. In Memento, Nolan built the switches on time in time. We were able to tell when it was past, when it is, etc. However, Nolan has experimented a bit, and it just doesn't work. Although he had a small budget and could not use color (this is one way in which Memento worked), it was just too difficult to distinguish between time. On the DVD is a feature that lets you play the scenes in chronological order. I intend writing my review after watching it, so hopefully it would make more sense, but of course it wasn't working. <br /> <br /> You can't blame Nolan for not original ideas. . A young man, Bill (Jeremy Theobald), is bored, so he decides to follow random people on the street. He finds one, Cobb (Alex Haw), who is particularly interested in him. Soon, Bill becomes friends with Cobb and goes with him as he breaks into homes and robs them. Then a juicy young blonde (Lucy Russell) comes in, and the movie even comes from there. <br /> <br /> The end of the next is one of the most shocking endings I have seen. Certainly, Fight Club had a wonderful end, but the way Follow's end was played was wonderful. I felt somebody hit me on the head and gave me a concussion. Nolan has a good ending (well, maybe not, I can guess Insomnia's miles away), and can really make a wonderful story. The following may not be the easiest to follow or watch, but it is such a finely crafted, original story with a shock that ends up that you probably want to see the 70 minutes again. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Valued R for language and some violence.
