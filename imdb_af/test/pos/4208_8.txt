The young John Garfield delivered a good performance in 1939. "They made me a criminal." Boxer Johnnie Bradfield denies a ring victory in a folded locker room. He loves love for mother, rejection of liquor and clean lifestyle for fans, including policemen, who upload it. Later in the evening he was plowed and dipped with his bimbo bell while his driver shared the evening. And the whiskey. <br /> <br /> A problem develops when another couple arrives. The man is a newspaper reporter and he says he will expose Bradfield's false life to the front page. The driver killed the reporter and he and the floozy room. The murder detects, policemen, are later on the lookout for the now somnolent boxer whose car is driven by the driver with his new girlfriend Johnny's now direct ex. A police hunt ends with a fiery car accident. Driver and girl are dead and unrecognizable. <br /> <br /> Johnny discovers he's supposed to be a killer. But he is also declared dead. Looking for advice from a lawyer, he trusted the counselor with the key to a bank deposit that kept his only $ 10,000 savings. The lawyer later gives Johnny $ 250 and tells him that the balance is his fee to give him professional advice: get out of town quickly and go far away. (I'll never charge a customer more than $ 5,000 for such a spicy, concise and wise way.) <br /> <br /> Johnny, now a freight train oboe, winds up at a Arizona date farm, where he was nursed Back to health by beautiful Goldie West, Ann Sheridan, a fine actress whose career was in the rise. With Jack Dorney as his moniker, the pugilist loses some of his rough sides, as he falls in love with Goldie. He becomes a mentor and a girlfriend - The Dead End Kids. Famous screen characters for pre-war filmmakers. <br /> <br /> An opportunity to earn money arises when an exhibition boxer challenges any sucker to keep several rounds in the ring with him. This is a natural temptation for Bradfield / Dorney, but there is a fly in the ointment. Who needs to arrive, but New York detective Monty Phelan, the department's laughing stock? He's been in the old age duty due to a slight mistake early in his career that an innocent man sent to Old Sparky (we all make mistakes or not?) Phelan recognized Bradfield from a news photograph and he is there for the fight and make the pinch. Claude Rains is the policeman who has been abusing his fellow officials for many years. <br /> <br /> What follows is predictable, but it did well. I hope this was an important feature when it was released. It is too good to be a "B" second for an exhibition. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley, known as an outstanding choreographer, directed "They Made Me a Criminal, and Max Steiner, one of Hollywood's overall beneficial composers, has beautiful but not extraordinary music for the movie written on. <br /> <br /> Now available on Alpha Video DVD, the movie gave me a mere return of $ 4.99 and really gave me pleasure, I'll see it again. <br /> < br /> 8/10
