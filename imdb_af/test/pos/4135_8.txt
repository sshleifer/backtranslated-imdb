I saw the Buddy Holly Story first when I was about seven years old. I didn't know who Buddy Holly was, and I can't remember what made me sit down in front of television, set on HBO, and watch this engaging biopsy. What I remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story about someone who actually lived. I remember the music, big songs that I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so good - What a stud!) Then the end came. He died. He died. I could not believe it. I have no warning, no previous knowledge like most in this movie. It taught me a hard lesson about life and how it doesn't follow the rules most movies teach us. I just watched the movie again tonight and was engaged again ... and a little sad. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, but I'll admit a little bias.
