Crimson started with some cool jazzy music, so I liked it right away, but like the movie, I started to wonder if the music wasn't the best part. We have a few thieves pulling a jewel box and when one does something wrong, the alarm is triggered and the police chase them and when the car turns to a road block, one of the thieves becomes (Paul Nash, Jacinto Molina whoever he was shot. Now he seems to be dead, but with the help of a drunk doctor and his mad scientist (and wife) he is rescued, with a part of the brain of a nightclub owner named "The Sadist ". The Sadist is unhappy because the men who kidnapped him have lost their knife to remove is head to give insulin to injuries (or, in this case, death), they remove his head with a train, leaving the body for the authorities to find, oops. Once the brain transplant is complete, Naschy wants to destroy any woman who comes near him, because he now has the disposition of his donor. Well, of course, it's pretty unlikely and has medical equipment bought on Radio Shack, and overall it's cute and messy. But it has a good early 70's and it looks and feels and the music is cool. It's not so much a horror movie, but more a thrill with many boyfriends fighting over the peat and babies and other similar stuff, but it's abundantly entertaining in ways I can't begin to describe. 7 out of 10.
