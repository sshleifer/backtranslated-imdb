I returned as a teenager in the mid-1980s and immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday movies. As you can tell from the other reviews, this movie has a very good storyline and good actors who have set it up. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is great as a bride who has second thoughts. Dennis Morgan's play is also strong. He goes unnoticed in most movies, but was a very competent actor, watch KITTY FOYLE. In this film he plays the visiting sailor Stanwyck leaves her husband to be. <br /> <br /> It's a Christmas classic. The settings and the story make for a great Christmas novels
