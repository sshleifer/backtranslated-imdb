With a role like this, I knew the play would be great. Yet I was careful, as I always have been persecuted. Will it keep the feeling of the first movie? Can they possibly repeat the tension and excitement of Ocean's 11 mastery lift? We will never know, because they did not try. At least, not as I expected. Instead, they made a light and really funny parody of the heist genre. If you want a gripping, logical hoist, don't look. If you want a good laugh, with humorous dialogue, peculiar characters and an absolute genius scene where Julia Roberts has to personalize her, you'll love Ocean's 12.
