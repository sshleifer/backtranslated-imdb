OK, OK, I have to say I was impressed. It's hard to say what I am more impressed with: my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch so that I don't stick out my eyes or the movie itself. Anyway, "Hitch" was pretty good. Hey, it was good enough for me to watch twice. Will Smith was funny and good. Kevin James was just hilarious, and absolutely essential to the movie. As much as this movie about Hitch (Will Smith), without Kevin James, it's just not the same. <br /> <br /> The story is: Hitch is a matchmaker who helps the girl. His job is to create the chance for the girl to see the guy when she wouldn't otherwise. After the meeting, the rest is the guy to make or break the relationship. He only works on referral and stays largely unnoticed during the process. Albert (Kevin James) is Hitch's project this time, and Albert has eyes on Allegra Cole (Amber Valleta), a Paris Hilton figure. As the plot unfolds, Hitch himself has an eye on Sara (Eva Mendes), a sharp, independent, captivated columnist who wants nothing with a relationship. <br /> <br /> The two stories make for a few funny moments and they tie together for a bit of a villain. Of course, no love story was completed without the mandatory miscommunication, misunderstanding, or misfortune to drive the man to the girl. Fortunately, they make it short and indifferent. Hitch was a fun and funny movie that flowed very well and ran without a hook.
