About as hilarious as the 50-year-old British comedy can get, THE BELLES OR ST TRINIAN'S have almost a gag a minute ... and at 91 minutes it makes a great time. Other movies that I also recommend at the same time are THE TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT and THE GREEN MAN. In fact, any movie with Alistair Sim or Terry Thomas, George Cole, Richard Wattis or Joyce Grenfell or any combination is a pleasure. In ST TRINIAN'S we get a double dose of Sims who play two roles with that hilarious contempt he is constantly ripping over his face. Joyce Grenfell as Ruby Gates (oh dear! That name!) Play her 'jolly hockey stick' constable-incognito to hilarious perfection. Perhaps the best laugh comes from George Cole as Flash Harry (who comes from a bush when it is whispered) and several visits to classrooms by me. Fritton (Sims) who responds to explosions ("oh Betty!") Or science lab gin production ("just send a few bottles of it to my room.") Every part of the movie is funny of the characters, their costumes, the antics and the environment There were successors, but the first three are the best: including this one, BLUE MURDER AT ST TRINIAN'S and later in color THE GREAT ST TRINIAN'S TRAIN ROBBERY.
