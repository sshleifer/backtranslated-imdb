just came back from the view of this brilliant, funny movie. <br /> <br />, part of the reason I loved it, was also because I could show people and places what I knew ("I go there every day!" "I work there!", " I had drinks there! "," Hello! It's our postman! "Etc.). But, if you're another "feel-good" with a little spice (excuse the pun) - that's just the right answer. relationships, culture and, above all, love are all woven together in the plot. <br /> <br /> with preston (where the movie is set), recently made a city, it is good to see this work with the place. and add to the sense of surprise. It is also a brilliant representative of many cultures in this part of the north. <br /> <br /> Fabulous!
