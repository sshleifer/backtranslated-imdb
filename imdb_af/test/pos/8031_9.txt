All over the world, the unmistakable pressure of the US is C.I.A. can be found in many a confused mess that they left behind. In the beginning, their goals were simple: spying, removing enemy agents, stealing classified information and destabilizing unfavorable governments. Years have passed and although their mission remains similar, their clandestine black business now includes domestic espionage, discrediting US citizens and infiltrating US organizations criticizing the US government. However, this film focuses on the C.I.A. 's world man hunt for the infamous Carlos, the Jackel. The film is called the command and tells the story Lt. Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez, (Aidan Quinn), a US naval officer who has a striking resemblance to the master brain of so many terrorist bombings. Recruited by Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) of the C.I.A. and Amos (Ben Kingsley), a special agent of the Israeli Mosad, has secretly trained Ramirez to view, infiltrate and then discredit the elusive organization Jackel for the Russians. This movie is exciting and full of wild hunting, murders and rural chaos. Quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic on both sides of the war. Easily one of his best efforts. ****
