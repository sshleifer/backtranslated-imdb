After being out of the air for a while, Columbo came back with some new secret-to-TV puzzles that, while not as good as the original series, are better than the shows in the later 90's. done. <br /> <br /> "Murder can be dangerous to your health" using the then (and I think now, thinking about it), shows real crime as the situation for a murder. The murder is committed by a very successful selfish true crime show host, George Hamilton (in a nice piece of casting). His chain smoke nemesis, who lost the job to him, played by Peter Haskell, attempting to challenge Hamilton when he noticed a porn video that Hamilton had made in his slaughter days with a minor actress. Hamilton uses Haskell's cigarettes to kill the poison, and himself an alibi. <br /> <br /> Columbo is brought in to find out what happened. You know the rest. Very entertaining.
