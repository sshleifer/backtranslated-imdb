Midnight Madness is a movie that unfortunately is highly understated and unabated. With a flood of classic "edgy" teen / college movies, this one is forgotten. As a child I would see this movie over and over again, luckily I had it on video. This movie shows a more easy but most exciting side of the eighties. In the cynical society we live in this age and age, with drug abuse the "coolest" thing, it is nice to see once a fun, innocent movie that is Midnight Madness. That's if you can find it. .
