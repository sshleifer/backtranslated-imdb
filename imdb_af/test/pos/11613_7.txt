I finally got the excellent Sazuma DVD of this movie loaded with interesting extras. I read a lot about it, and unfortunately I missed it at the Stockholm Film Festival. It does not deliver straight as I thought, but it is still worth watching if you like strange and unique movies. I see it much rather than any of the recent so-called horror movies being thrown out of Hollywood today. What detracts from the experience for me is certain types of music that sound outdated and rely too much on cheap synth sounds. For me, all these tonal / harmonic elements of the score could be lifted, and replaced by David Kristians excellent sound design. But that's just my opinion. Otherwise, it's a daring, fierce picture with prosperous meditative and poetic parts, such as blurring the beautiful photographic order. I look forward to seeing ascension, and I welcome Mitch and Karim for their efforts to produce non-mainstream theater. They're a great inspiration if I start my own short film production soon.
