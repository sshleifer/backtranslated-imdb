There are other movies about residences and the antics of the students and staff, but "The Belles of St Trinian's" towers above them all! The plot is thoroughly summarized by other posters, so I won't cover the same land. I just want to say that it is a pity that it is finally on DVD, but in a format that cannot be used in the US! :-( <br /> <br /> Enjoy, co-followers in New Zealand and Australia! And if anyone reading it can pull any of these, please help release it on DVD with region 1 encoding Is it also possible to be notified by e-mail when I do not appear on a DVD in the United States? Thank you!
