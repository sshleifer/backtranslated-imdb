I really wanted to give this movie a 10. For a long time I thought it was my favorite of the four modern live-action Batman movies to date (and maybe it will be - I still watched the Schumacher movies again). I am also concerned about whether I am inadvertently contradictory. You see, I've always liked the Schumacher movies. As far as I can remember, they were either 9s or 10s for me. But the conventional wisdom is that the two Tim Burton-directed films are by far better. This time I had a serious problem with the first Burton Batman. I finally got it a 7. And I apologize, as I may have, I can't help but feel that Batman Returns has too many small direction, plot and scripting issues. scatter to justify a 10. <br /> <br /> But Burton _almost_ comforts the problems with sheer power, and while there are many small mistakes, Batman Returns is still a good movie, especially if you are a Burton fan, as Batman Returns just as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990), as with any other in the Batman universe. <br /> <br /> The movie begins Strong, with the baby's Cobblepots. We see their dismay - people walk out of the room with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. Later they had the baby in a small cage. Eventually they take it out for a night walk and shower it in the Gotham City River. The baby eventually becomes the batman villain The Penguin (Danny DeVito). <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is the movie's "evil capitalist", comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He plans to capture Gotham City in various ways, and we are emotionally abusing his secretary, the harsh Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovered one of the deadly plots, Grissom tried to get rid of her, but she was saved by cats, Katwoman. <br /> <br /> While all this goes on, the Penguin, who has long been just rumored to be and who is dangerous, is starting a scheme that is being offered to the public as a good man, despite having less than goodwill. <br /> <br /> Before watching Burton's Batman movies again. This time, I don't remember how little the movies are about Batman (Michael Keaton). It's almost as if Burton didn't feel the character was interesting enough to focus on. The focus here is much more on the villains, especially the penguin. Batman does not appear very often, especially in the beginning of the film, and surprisingly often we look at the penguin. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers necessarily count the above as errors, I can't say I'm doing it, even though I want to know more about Batman and more about his story. The villains' stories are also interesting, and as an "original story" for two big Batman villains, Batman Returns is already more complex in terms of plot. <br /> <br /> However, there are some character issues that I count as a mistake. The Penguin has a cadre of circus printers that make its offer, but although they are often on the screen, we never learn anything about them. Burton has a core of characters as intriguing as that of Tod Browning's Freaks (1932), with actress who is interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he just doesn't have the space to use it. <br /> <br /> For that matter, he barely has space to explore Catwoman. The movie plays as if Catwoman might have been so developed and in so many scenes like The Penguin, but the cut of the movie would be 4 hours long. That's why most of the Catwoman scenes had to be cut out. Of course, this barely leaves Batman anywhere. Burton has become Batman very dark in the public eye in this film, and unusual, he never has difficulty solving it. As far as we know, in the end, Gothamites still think that Batman is a murder. This is an interesting development, but unfortunately it eventually fell between this film and the next. <br /> <br /> As far as writing is concerned, although there are minor issues, including some non-successors and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic) made by characters, it is clear that Burton and writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story. Much of the dialogue is word-oriented, but it is often rather subtle and / or complex (of course, sometimes it is also very blatant or transparent). It helps to see Batman Returns as a more "poetic" movie, as I believe it was. It's also about more common plot and legal decisions. There are many strange character actions, including small characters, serving a general mood or style, and the style works very well. <br /> <br /> "Dark" is the easiest way to summarize Batman Returns in a word, and whether it is positive or negative depends on your mindset. Anyone who knows me knows that I'm dark. So for me Burton's style greatly exceeds the bugs in the plot and the writing. In many ways, Batman Returns is like an insane, campy horror movie, with a beautiful honest production design. Like Batman, he still makes many references to other movies, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (there is still a small Star Wars reference), he calls films like Nosferatu (1922) Max Schreck "was the name of the actor who played the Dracula-like character there), Motel Hell (1980), the aforementioned Freaks, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal dark edge) zombie films - most explicit in the penguin's final scene. <br /> <br /> In terms of visual and general atmosphere - including the general feel of the story, the characters and so on can't be stronger 10.
