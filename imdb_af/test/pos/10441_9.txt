I really like this movie. Not only do I like it, because it is a good early 80's movie with a BIG soundtrack, but I found that it has a few thoughtful moments. They are just moments; not the whole movie. It's certainly not like "Less than zero". <br /> <br /> The scenes are about typical peer pressure and also with harder problems, such as the betrayal of trust. These characters are not easily solved or forgotten. Certain scenes will stand out and spark a reflection on your own teen experiences and how experiences can affect your personality and appearance as an adult. <br /> <br /> You can see this movie and think about the problems young adults have to face, and about your own experiences. Or you can just pay attention to the boys' quest to exploit themselves! :) Anyway, this is a good movie.
