During the Sci-Fi TZ Marathon of January 31, 1999, this episode was the last one to be sown in my time zone (East) in the 20th century. It was New Years Eve, and when the clown started singing, "We're here because we're here because we're here because we're here ..." I realized it was TZ's clever nod to be New Year's Eve , because the melody is also the voice of Old Lang Syne. Coincidence? We will never know. <br /> <br /> I love this story for the little ones: The tear on the ballerina, the fianc√© of the clown, and the shot of death in the head. This and the Art Carney Santa TZ are the only ones going on Christmas. <br /> <br /> My personal top five episodes, to five characters ...: 1. The hunt 2. The after hours 3. The Hitchhiker 4. The lonely 5. Little girl loses
