I ever knew I was a kid, I loved this movie. I've always been a fan of Joseph Mazzello. the child had pure talent in both this movie and Jurassic Park. I'm looking for the DVD or VHS to buy at a store near me. I can't find it, I hope it goes DVD! Well, cute movie. If anyone knows where I can find it, please contact me at wrp24@adelphia.net. Can anyone really explain what happened to Bobby? Was she really or was he imitating and was he an imaginary friend and his escape? lol i am clueless. my favorite part had to be where they made the monster juice and sowed it over the kitchen, but it was funny but also a sad part because of what happened to bobby due to the mess. I would like to see the boyfriends face because he played his role well. I think the mother was a great actress I think her name is Lorraine Bracco or some kind of name like that. Well that's all, please contact me. <br /> <br /> wrp24
