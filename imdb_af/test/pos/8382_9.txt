Brad Pitt sticks his forefinger into Diane Kruger's leg wound and holds it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, terribly so. The invented yarn takes a dirty box for a ride and sometimes leaves it to pay tribute to other movies. Great fun. Even "Paris when sown" is called in a beautiful organic dialogue. I was excited about Christoph Waltzer's character and his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a truly original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There's a thrill in the character that is pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe. Fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible all over the place.
