I really think this movie deserves Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie ... because it is a very well played part of Samuel L. Jackson, and mostly by Christina Ricci !! I am a big fan of her since I saw her in Addams Family ... trying to see everything she does and that is one of the best parts she played !! I like her look (though people say she is not pretty ... I think she is ... and I love her eyes) !! The movie is about many things ... people say it's religious ... people say it's about racism ... people say it's about drugs ... people say it's about nimfomania ... well ... maybe it's a bit of everything! But what I really feel is that this movie has a high level of eye-opening for what blues are ... what it stands for ... and mainly where it comes from: life ... heart ... pain ... sad ... and most of all ... spontaneous feelings !! I hope you get it to see ... if you're that kind of person who likes a movie, not just the pictures or the story it tells ... it's a good movie to see ... if you don't ... Well ... see it anyway ... can't hurt so much and you'll see Christina Ricci acting so horny !! She's a fox !!
