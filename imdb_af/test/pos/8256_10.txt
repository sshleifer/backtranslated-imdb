This movie is an almost forgotten jewel of 1979, though essentially a comedy based on one of the largest bankers in the United Kingdom. In fact, one of the titles known by this film includes "caper", which in itself is an indication of the type of film. A of a lot of lovely rouges, which are not the violent or psychotic types, which with the cheek of the cheek derive the greatest work of their lives. To be honest, I don't know too much about real crime and can't comment on the events that unfolded or accurately portrayed the characters involved. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan is very good at playing PINKY Green. and is very credible as an easy, small-American-born villain who looks very comfortable with himself. I have to add that sometimes American actors talk to English actors in a British movie, but chemistry is not always there, but it is no problem for Jordon who is in his role. <br /> <br /> It is worth pointing out that Jordan itself was probably one of the most underrated actors of the 70s and 80s and never really recognized what it deserved. He seemed to hold onto supporting roles and B movies, not a fair representation of his acting ability. He played a corrupt policeman in THE FRIENDS OF EDDY COYLE, a sadistic killer in the middle of the season. In the secret of my success he played a kind of comic Gordon Gehco character and also in the 1980's EQUALIZER TV show he played a good guy. All this shows the versatility of his acting skills while mixing with David Niven, Kurt Russell, Edward Woodward and Robert Mitcham. <br /> <br /> In this movie he easily plays his role as a little crook with a view to the ladies and immediately takes his character and root to him from the beginning. You Can't Help Green, ?? ?? You see he really wants to go straight, but once it is cut off, it has all been too much to succeed. In the end he delivered the thought of all the money. <br /> <br /> David Niven is the boss and calls the shots, the police inspector was brilliantly played by Richard Johnson, who typically portrays a smash but thorough London detective who loves his work clearly. The other supporting role players don't say too much, but look at them. They were all well-known British character characters who often play themselves as villains or coppers (not ironically). Elkie Sommers, Oliver Tobias does what they have to do and it's good to see Gloria Graham in a cameo role. <br /> <br /> For some viewers, especially Americans, it seems mysterious that someone with Greens record can land a maintenance work. At all, a bank and come and go when he pleases it. In addition, the stunt he pulled at the crown court after sentencing was not that far, as it might seem. Back in the 1960s and 70s security was not as nearly as it is now. <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself, there are some interesting observations. With little crooks the trek was too much here. There are other movies wherever they occur, ie THE BRINKS MAT. It is not only the disposal or the hiding of the booty, but with so many people involved, someone will be indifferent, blowing or just breaking once. In addition, the authorities are very hard on local robbers when such a large robbery is carried out. Also, they say there is no honor among thieves, but Ivan was determined that PINKY had blown her. You just have to look at his star in the dock, if the body can kill, a look of total betrayal! How could he have pushed them all in after taking care of him? You have to ask yourself a question why are crooks so stupid? Did Green really think he could talk so much a second time? Inspector Watford was not at all fooled by his innocent face, as well as a well-built alibi, the whole hijacker looking inside. In addition, you have to wonder why they leave so many clues? A notepad with the safe numbers broken down, travel overseas travel brochures, still leaves its telescope, as well as unusual behavior on the day of the robbery that was out of character. <br /> <br /> With some decent but common sense police work Insp Watford quickly became Green's partner, picked him up and quickly sang him as a canary. It just shows how, in spite of well-thought out things, you can quickly unravel, there is never a clean break for every body. Although it is worth pointing out that much of the money has never been recovered. <br /> <br /> All in all, an entertaining movie, interesting shots from London and England in the late 70s, did well, with a good ending. I would highly recommend it, especially if you are a hairdresser. (Note: I recently purchased a DVD from this, but the transfer is of course taken from a VHS band and is of poor quality. So don't pay too much!)
