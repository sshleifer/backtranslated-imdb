I play final fantasy 7, and this movie is great like the game, all fans of the final fantasy will love this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic and history is good, but the best of this movie is the visual effects, it's great. The characters are equal to the game and that detail is good for the fans. <br /> <br /> You don't have to play the game to keep this movie, all people can enjoy the movie because history is different and easy to understand. I buy the DVD because it's great, it's 100% ADVISABLE, if you don't see this movie, what are you waiting for? believe me, you will fascinate me
