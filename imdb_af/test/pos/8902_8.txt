If I were a true Asterix fan of all my life, I must say that "Asterix and the Vikings" are probably the best of all Asterix movies. It has some very funny jokes in it and the animation is wonderful. As many people pointed out, this does not follow the plot of the cartoon ("Asterix and the Normans") very closely, but in many ways it is just as good, because that book stands out in my mind as one bumped into fun in the sixties' culture, and much of it is dated today. <br /> <br /> What really bothered me is how they take a Disney plot in the movie that takes away much of the focus away from Asterix and Obelix. We have a misunderstood son who doesn't fit, Justforkix. We have a Tom-Boy girl who doesn't fit, because his will is treated like men, Abba. They meet and fall in love, but their love is threatened because the boy is ashamed to be honest with the girl, but eventually their love disappears. It was the plot of so many Disney (and also fair, other studios) movies that were not funny and the plot was twenty years ago. I mean, they even gave Justforkix a whimsical animal bud. <br /> <br /> Not only did I find this derivative and clich√©d, but it really deviated from the story and left me dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> I think it speaks volumes about how beautiful the rest of the movie was, thinking it still very high, despite the way the plot was hijacked.
