This show is great! I love all the actors! It has good story lines and characters. It's the perfect drama. James Caan and Josh Duhamel have good dialogue. They can both be very funny. I miss Vanessa Marcil at General Hospital, but she's wonderful here. James Lesure is wonderful! He can be hilarious. Molly Sims plays a very good thing. The writing is wonderful! They keep an excellent fit. The show can really make you hang out, which is one of my favorite elements of a show. I can't wait until the new season starts. This show makes it the top ten of all my shows. I hope this show stays for a very long time. If people know what is good, it will. I never want the show to end. Ever.
