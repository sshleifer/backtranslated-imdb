Proud and challenging worker porter Perks (Mr. B. Cribbins) is ultimately won by their high school family. Father (Mr I.Cuthbertson) who was set up for treason - for which the punishment was dead in those days, so that it would not be forgotten), mother (the very beautiful Miss D. Sheridan) brave and resourceful, loyal and loving and - mainly - older daughter (Mrs J.Agutter) raging at the height of adolescence and confused about the fate of her father. Mr. Perks, like many working people of his time, has nothing to do with anything he considers "charity", and that is an important moment in the movie when he finally gave the birthday gifts he gave to the children. does not endanger his principles. Although the beautiful Miss. Having received all the awards, it is Mr. Cribbins and Miss Sheridan whose performances dominate the "Railroad Children". They both know how Edwardian society works from opposite ends of the spectrum, but there is an unspoken mutual respect and understanding between them. But it's basically a movie about family. In an era when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and hold her in ransom and be considered "socially inactive" than not living in a decent society, and when two "people" can kill a baby and kicking without being accused of murder, a family can be regarded as an old-fashioned, elitist, racist, even homophobic concept, but a century ago it was the glue that kept society at all levels. 'and Miss Sheridan's families are archetypes for old age. Strong and loving, holding together against outside influences, integral units with a moral certainty mocked in the 21st century. What may seem like a dull, beautiful political channel is being said by Mr. Lionel Jeffries transforms into a beautiful psalm for hope, faith, optimism and courage. That all those attributes were once considered the norm and now too often the subject of mockery and cynicism is a reflection on our society rather than Miss Nesbit's. No one with more than a passing concern for the human condition cannot be significantly displaced by this perfect movie.
