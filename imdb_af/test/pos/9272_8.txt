Remember Greg the Bunny? It was this show that started on the Independent Film Channel, but turned into a full blown sitcom on Fox. My cousin and I thought it was pretty funny, past the preliminary idea that dolls are taking TV PG material. Puppies Who Death occurs in a similar universe, where puppets live in the same world as humans, and like us, work and work of their own. Let's just say if you couldn't handle it, don't watch PWK, because this show is a profile of 4 dolls that fell out of society's good grace through drug abuse, hedonism, and violent crimes just in a half to end. -way home. There is a lot of violence, sex and bad language (so it will never make its way to American Network TV). As if sociopathic dolls were not enough, the fact that it is happening in Canada is even more disturbing (VAT, government pays for this), and I think any American television viewer would demand demented cable TV feeds like this. I don't know where to get it in the US, except for extra satellite TV, but I advise you to try it. Really funny things. (It flies on the Comedy Network in Canada)
