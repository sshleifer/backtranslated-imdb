Werner Herzog explores the man's psyche again. In 'Little Dieter ...' we meet a vibrant man who survives the war in Bavaria and survived famine and strange attractions, moved to the US and fulfilled his dream to be a pilot. War, food, death, survival, hoarding, airplanes, heads come down ... how one American is born. Herzog sees madness again as the existence of the existence and the surrealistic accelerations with the gripping as Herzog himself tells this psychic travel report of a German who becomes an American flying in a late 20th century aircraft where the culmination of technology, pilgrimage and eating out of rubbish tins with spoons is redefined by constant optimism in a American man. As always at Herzog, we were confronted with flower madness, brilliance and what is man in the light of his own excess, social and personal. We laugh and cringe and am surprised at this man. Where else for this man except America?
