Chaplin stars in a dual role as a Jewish barber who, with amnesia, is wrong for the dictator Adenoid Hynkel, (Hitler). A film made in 1940 when the war was in its dark days and by no means won by the allies. . It was banned in Germany by Hitler and was a risk to Chaplin. For if the war were lost, he would surely be sent away to train again. <br /> <br /> A funny satire with the classic scene of Hitler throws a huge balloon of the world. Good fun, but with a message. a little sermon in the end. It was the last movie with Chaplin's trademark, a little mustache. on a scale of one to ten. 9
