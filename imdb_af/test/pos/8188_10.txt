This film is beautiful in many ways: the plot, the depth of the characters, the spectacular photography and acting, the colossal screens of battles (no computer graphics here, just thousands of people). Someone said the story has something to do with the Sheakespearian tragedies. I also find links to the Greek tragedy tradition. <br /> <br /> The emperor, extremely acting, struggles between power and love, but is forced (for the greater good, for the will of his ancestors) to choose the power (and the loneliness, the hatred of his subjects and family) as his fate. He was, like Creon in Antigone, a good guy before he became emperor. Once he has gained strength, he must be merciless and cruel (with innocent children, his mother, his father, etc.) to defend and expand the empire. With power he becomes a monster. Overall, the Qin emperor is a majestic Greek tragedy figure. <br /> <br /> The assassin evolves to a different direction: from pure evil to heroism and morality. Even this character is forced to his fate by love and his new ethics. This character is also memorable. <br /> <br /> Lady Zhao, a wonderful Gong Li, is the uncorrected morality, not by power or love or hatred. She is morality against power, somehow like Antigone. Her conspiracies (for and against the emperor) always have a moral rationale. <br /> <br /> Finally, a wonderful movie. If you like cinema and you want to try Chinese movies, you can start here.
