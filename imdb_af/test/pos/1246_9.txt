I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, there was a lack of respect in the film, but Bruce Willis learned from The Kid that there is more value to reject others and change his life of disrespect. This movie was a refreshing change from the trash that Hollywood is trying to move our throat off. There are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie. I really believe it was one of Disney's best, although a few things could be left out. I was impressed with the lack of curse and lack of sexual innuendos. It's not perfect, but much better than most other things out there.
