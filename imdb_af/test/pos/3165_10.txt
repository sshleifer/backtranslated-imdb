I saw it in Europa plex. Great movie !! <br /> <br /> This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Meat in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, driving an unconscious RV over America, often stops filling his gas drop. He is middle-aged and confused. He burns his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio talkers. He is the Meat: chased and sometimes spaced, quite unaware of the growing tension around him, but feels uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The Spirit illuminates the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as in the visual field and beyond. The Spirit eventually collided with the Meat and Kirk went off, couldn't understand what had happened to him. He is in denial of how bad things have become because of the well-being of all of us, because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh. We are all in the same denial and therefore we, like Kirk, are in danger of going down and being hidden by desert sands, just like him.
