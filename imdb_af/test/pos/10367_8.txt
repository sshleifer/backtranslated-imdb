Richard Abernethie, a very wealthy man, died and his family met for his funeral. Included in the funeral party is Abernathie's youngest sister Cora Galaccio. Although none of the family saw Cora in at least 20 years, everyone agreed that Cora was always a little different. So, if Cora says something about Abemethy is murdered, then most of Cora's eccentricity is laughing. But someone obviously takes Cora seriously. The next day, Cora was found dead in her bed by force. Is there a connection between the two deaths? It's up to Hercule Poirot to find a killer. <br /> <br /> After the funeral is one of the well-composed episodes of the entire Poirot series. I've always been a fan of this particular Agatha Christie book and, from what I remember, the movie is so faithful to Christie's source material as any of the Poirot installments. What's more, the riddle has many clues, suspects and red herring. And as I wrote before, I always enjoy a Christie story where Hercule Poirot meets in a drawing room for the final revelation. It can be older, but that's the way I like it. After the funeral, technical and artistic After the funeral is a winner. Sets, editing, direction and cinematography are as good as you would find in one of these movies. The acting is equally impressive. I expected a nice show from David Suchet as Poirot and he didn't disappoint. The rest of the cast is just as strong with Monica Dolan who delivers a remarkable performance. Unlike a small issue with the fast lane that the characters are launching, I have no real complaints. It's a good show altogether.
