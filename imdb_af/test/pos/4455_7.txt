In and near a poor working class village in the mountains of rural Italy, this is a story of madness. The landscape can be quite picturesque, but there is insanity in it, hidden behind the mask of a person who looks normal. This person kills small children. <br /> <br /> In style and tone, this movie looks like Dario Argento's well-known Italian giant, those fascinating horror movies, except that Argento's films look much better. Yet the footage in Fulci's "Do Not Torture A Duckling" is capable, with some interesting compositions and lighting. Lightning and thunder on a rainy night increases tension in one order in which one of the "ducklings" is vulnerable alone. <br /> <br /> In one order, the gores are slightly exaggerated. But it's not a slasher movie. A legitimate theme underlines the story. And that theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms, not just the obvious ways of people who practice voodoo or black magic. <br /> <br /> Many red herring make the puzzle solution difficult if the viewer does not accept it. an agenda of the director. Don't dismiss someone who may not look like a suspect. The turn near the end offers good misdemeanor. At one stage, however, a dialogue could be added to explain the relationship between two characters, one of which is the killer. The movie's final takes place on a beautiful mountain top with the wind whistling in the background. We see flashbacks to get clues and get insights into the killer's mindset. <br /> <br /> I don't care about the movie's widescreen projection. But background music is effective, ranging from creeping creepy to low-key jazz, to native Italian songs. Acting is generally average, but in some cases it is a little exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Although not as visually brilliant as Argento's giallos, "Don't Torture a Duck" is a fine movie, one that contains a thematic storyline and plenty of whodunit puzzle to interest most viewers who love thrillers and murder stories.
