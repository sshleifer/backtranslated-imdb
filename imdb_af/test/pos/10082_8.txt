I saw this movie twice, both times on Cinemax. The first time in the amazing version that is softcore porn at its best and the second time in a disapproved (cut out all sex and most of the nudity) version that was entertaining in a typical beach movie of that kind. The unprecedented version has a terrific sex scene with Nikki Fritz, a man and a bottle of oil outside this world. Unfortunately, the scene in the cut version is almost completely cut out, just like any other sex scene. Graded or ungraded is still fun to watch all the brothers and sisters of bigger stars (Stallone, Sheen, Travolta, etc.). We also get performances by B queen Linnea Quigley and Burt Ward (Robin of the old Batman series).
