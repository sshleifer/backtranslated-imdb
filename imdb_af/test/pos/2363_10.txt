I just downloaded it (last weekend) and it was absolutely hilarious, some of the screens I just couldn't stop laughing! Dennis is sometimes so incredibly thick and just says the worst things ... but at the same time he is just cool to impress his girlfriend (which is arrested anyway!) The beach area is very quiet ... coming down Robbie Coltrane ...! Not the biggest movie ever made, but definitely something to think about renting on a Saturday night when you don't have much more to do (as I did). But maybe you should find it - I was happy because my local video store has it.
