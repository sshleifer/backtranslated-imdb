I have always been a fan of these largely unseen filming of the Gershwin opera since I first saw it in 1959. As many of you know, it was not available on video or DVD; In fact, the Gershwin family tried to destroy all existing prints. <br /> <br /> However, for some reason, the Gershwin family hopefully put an end to its opposition, approving the display of a collector's press at the Museum. of the moving image in Astoria, Queens. . <br /> <br /> Well, the wide screen, Technicolor print was excellent! (Not perfect, but excellent.) The sound was excellent, in the road-show quality stereo. The people who saw it in its original release would not have seen a much better copy. (The program notes include the original Variety Review, which warns that people might fall at the steeply limited release ticket price of $ 3.50!) <br /> <br /> And as much as I originally liked, PORGY AND BESS was better than I remembered. It's just wonderful. Sidney Poitier as Porgy was at the point where his career just started to burn, and his charism shines through. Dorothy Dandridge as Bess is spectacularly beautiful. Brock Peters as a crown is aggressively masculine. Pearl Bailey like Maria offers some comic moments, although her role is small. And Sammy Davis, Jr., as Sporting Life, steals every scene he's in; He is particularly sounding in his two big numbers: "It's not necessarily so" and "There is a boat soon to be in New York." (The last one won applause in the show I saw.) <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS is tied, but it doesn't matter when the set is as beautiful as this. The costumes are also outstanding. <br /> <br /> Sidney and Dorothy's voices are canned, but they are very well bought. The beautiful "Summertime" is sung by Clara, played by a young Diahann Carroll; her song is also called. (Actually, only Pearl and Sammy do their own vocalizing.) <br /> <br /> Of course, the music is sublime, but what really got me the time is how much emotion Preminger got from the story. People actually sang in the audience a few times - once when Bess sings the beautiful "I love you Porgy". And I had a kick from the audience who actually laughed aloud in "It's not necessarily so." Could it be that they have never heard this song - or never really listened? I believe that much of the emotional impact of this movie is due to Poiter and Dandridge's performances - you root for their love of winning. <br /> <br /> A slight doubt with the 136 minute run - one or two slow spots, and a stereotypical Amos-n-Andy kind of scene about Bess who sees a sham lawyer for a divorce from Kroon even though she was not even married to him. (I would have cut it.) And the start is a bit confusing. Both title characters are uncomfortably suggested - they are part of the movie before you realize who they are. <br /> <br /> And I don't think Preminger used a single close-up throughout the movie. It looks like it was shot in 3/4, which I guess was his way of working with the wide screen. <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS has always been a cult movie for those who saw it. , for those of us who love the soundtrack, and for some of us who just heard about it. Let's hope they find a way to release it and post it to DVD. It deserves the widest audience possible.
