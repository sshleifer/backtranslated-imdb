Forget some shiny (and useless) comments left here by some. This series is well maintained, well shot, and makes a refreshing change to most of the porridge on TV. <br /> <br /> Any fool can call anything. However, in this show, the characters are credible, the story lines intriguing and compelling (but require some intelligence on the part of the viewer), overall it's nice, and that's British !! (We sometimes do a few gems, and that's one of them). <br /> <br /> The performances are every hour and I think there are four of them all together (at least I only saw four of them). The show clearly impressed an American TV station / director who made a longer series that was nowhere to be done, despite the bigger budget. <br /> <br /> If you see soap and reality, you won't keep or understand eleventh.
