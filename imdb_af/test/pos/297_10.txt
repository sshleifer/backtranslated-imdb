Brilliant actors and brilliant photo !! I love the bright scene with the music in the beginning, it is just as touching and at the same time truly but surreal! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe these movie shows have terrible people can act under certain circumstances. Modern war films spend so much money on bonds. It's just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A movie that really hurts and hates mixed in fear and fate. How insane the world is and the power of will and friendship, love and passion. A must have seen film and without a doubt the best war movie ever! Many have tried to copy, but still there is no movie as good as this!
