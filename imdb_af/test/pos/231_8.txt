The main feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors, the sense of companionship in their dialogue and dances. These typically rising star musicals have an overworked plot, even for 1944, but due to the actors it is still fun to watch. Hayworth is not even a dancer, but she has a lot of inexperienced charm that fits her character. Kelly plays his usual caring authoritarian role, while Silvers offers a lot of self-defense and laughter. The movie can sometimes be very serious. Not a must-see, but recommended if you like the actors.
