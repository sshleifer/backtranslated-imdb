It seems that some previous reviewers might have set their expectations a bit too high in this movie. I found that it was scanning the satellite channels for something (without knowing what) and about it. I thought at the title it could be one of the many soft core pornos that often appear on movie channels, but I was pleasantly surprised. Although there were some male frontal nudity (in fact, more than your typical soft copy title - go figure!), It wasn't the focus of the movie. It was just nice. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by my taste: my recent performances included Night Falls and Europe, Europe (both geat, IMHO). But I also enjoy total spiritual endings when I watch a movie. Virtual Sexuality has done this for me and it is not a bad thing!
