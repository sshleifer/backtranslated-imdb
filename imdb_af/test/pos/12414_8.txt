It's a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold and snowy night. If you like some horror with your horror, it's the movie for you. Realizing a true cult classic. It has everything you want to see in a horror movie. A beautiful girl, a hero, the buffoon, a monster trick and of course a family of mutant satanic killers. This one is full of blood, gut and gore. I strongly recommend seeing this one in the early hours of the morning, and be careful who you see entertained by the sounds of Monster Trucks, Bad (But Funny) One-Linen and our Hero-Ego Bowl. Not as good as evil, but a close second. Just remember WARNING ..... DO NOT EAT BEFORE YOU MAKE THIS MOVIE ...
