Knute Rockne has led an extraordinary life and his story is told quite well in Knute Rockne All American. We follow Rockne's amazing journey from young Norwegian boy to iconic American soccer legend. Produced in 1940, the film can sometimes be dated and sometimes even straight. And the filmmakers sometimes lay it on a bit thick as Rockne is glowing and lovingly portrayed. You might get away, Rockne thinks had to be named holy when he was just a soccer coach. But it is undeniable that he had a huge impact on the game of football, as well as a tremendous impact on the lives of so many of the young men he coached. This movie shows the great impact he has and gives you an insight into why he is so respectful to this day. <br /> <br /> Playing Rockne, Pat O'Brien, gives an impressive performance. It's undoubtedly O'Brien's movie to wear and he makes the movie and the character his own. The real Rockne was known as a great inspirational figure and O'Brien's performance will make you understand why. The only doubt comes early in the film when O'Brien, in his early forties, plays college student Rockne in his early twenties. All the make-up in the world was not going to make it credible and the effect is pretty bare. But as the Rockne character starts and starts his legendary coaching career, O'Brien fits in perfectly. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, one name jumps out and it's of course Ronald Reagan who is the young, charismatic, but ultimately doomed soccer star George Gipp. In the big scheme of the movie it's not really a big deal, with Reagan not appearing more than 10-15 minutes. But the show has become legendary, thanks to Reagan's famous "Win one for the Gipper" death speech. It's a brilliant play full of emotion. Reagan may not have been on the screen for a long time, but he has definitely made a huge positive impact on winning. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie strikes a balance between football and life in general with Rockne having great lessons for his young men in both areas. For soccer fans (and history buffs) a rare treat has been done as the actual archive material of Notre Dame games from the Rockne era is spread throughout the film. It's a rare opportunity to see how much the game has evolved over the past six-plus-decades, and an opportunity to showcase Rockne's legendary strategic innovations. If you're a Notre Dame fan, you'll probably enjoy the fact that Notre Dame Victory March offers a seemingly constant soundtrack to the movie. If you are a Notre Dame hater ... well, you probably won't watch this movie. Knot Rockne All American is an inspiring, uplifting, emotional movie. Maybe a little too sentimental, but it's not such a bad thing. It's a very enjoyable movie, worth the time to watch.
