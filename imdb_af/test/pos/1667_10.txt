To subtract a work like this cape in Rififi (eg, the score and its opines) one must have nerves of steel. This one day demands and orders it. Jules Dassin is the master. <br /> <br /> I was constantly on the edge of my seat. It is better known, though not in the time of its release in 1954, as one assumes that the director is blacklisted in the holiest Hollywood of his day. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't have the pleasure to see it. <br /> <br /> I can't give it enough stars.
