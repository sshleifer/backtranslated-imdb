OK. Overall, this three-part documentary will keep most interested people informed of the physics world and the past 300 years of discovery of our universe. Having read and understood Stephen Hawkings' brilliant book, a short history of time, can benefit from the visual description of certain concepts, which I have done to some extent. Greene is bearable, but of course for the sake of the masses, it tends to explain things in a slightly condescending manner. This is, of course, deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who views this series. <br /> <br /> The gas scientists were good. (no Hawking, but I think he has his own DVD (s)). I waited to wait for him to appear, but they turned for the same almost 3 parts ... (many Americans are weighed here, with some British and one antipode) I have the Nova 2 Disc Edition (NTSC) bought and there were a few inclusions that really detract from the overall experience. <br /> <br /> 1. The "It is brought to you." At the beginning of EVERY part, it was an essential evil for the first part, but it was still twice. It was over. It was very ordinary. <br /> <br /> 2. I can't be helped, but there is quite an overlap at the beginning of 2 and 3 which reached me the FFW button a few times. <br /> <br /> 3. This disk set was straight from TV. (Ie ads, what happens last show to those who missed it, and often "goto pbs.org for more ....") that appears throughout the presentation. (completely different from BBC material that is unparalleled for presentations. Plans, The Blue Planet, etc.) My 7/10 is based on content only. The niggles were there, but I came across them. If it's done with the classic British accent presenter (you know one), it would be a perfect CD set, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> If you saw it and want more ... then I highly recommend Hawkings book "A Short History of Time" ... I wish it was a movie too. <br /> <br /> Happy looking.
