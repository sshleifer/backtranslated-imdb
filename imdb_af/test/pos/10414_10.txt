This show should be my favorite from all the 80's horror TV shows. Like Tales from the Darkside, also from the same creators, this show is a rare gem. If you agree with me, please sign this petition I started, to get the word for monsters and get it out on DVD. Here's the petition address: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Some of my favorite episodes should be Glim Gl and Rain Dance. I also loved opening the intro with the monster family. It crept me! One of the things I would have wanted to include the DVD creators would be the organ sound that was previously heard where the commercial break would be. I don't know if any of you remember the part, but it's one of the most important things that reminds me. I mean, come on! War of the Worlds has already released the TV series on DVD, so I say Monsters, and also Tales from the Darkside, and Friday the 13th must also be released! We need the fans to talk our minds! We Need This Wonderful Play On DVD, PLEASE, SPREAD THE WORD !!!
