Sometimes the user's comments on IMDB read me with despair for the species. For anyone to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as "boring," they shouldn't be interested in science, technology, philosophy, history, or the art of movies. Finally, I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and empty - they understand their audience. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, those who don't appreciate Kubrick's performance can still be a minority. Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into making this epic. This is the film that science puts in science fiction, and the depiction of space travel and the future of humanity remains unbeatable to this day. It was so far from the time humanity has not yet been caught. <br /> <br /> 2001 is mainly a technical film. The reason why it is slow, and filled with minutes, is because the goal is to predict the future of technology realistically (and past in the awesome opening scenes). The movie's greatest power is in the details. Remember that when this film is made, man hasn't made it into the moon yet ... but it's in 2001 and it's just the beginning of the journey. Creating such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later is still the best we have is convinced - I still can't figure out how some of the shots were done. The film's only noticeable flaw was the optimism with which it predicted human technological (and social) development. It's our shame that the year 2001 didn't look like the 2001 movie, not Kubrick's. <br /> <br /> In addition to the amazing special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also offers the viewer plenty of food to think about what it means to be human and where the human race goes. Yes, the end is strange and difficult to understand - but that is the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke began the task of predicting it, and it is now up to the audience to continue. There is no neat resolution, no definite end, because then the audience can stop thinking about the final line. I know that's what most audiences apparently want today, but Kubrick won't let us out so easily. <br /> <br /> I'm delighted to see this movie in the IMDB's top 100 movies, and just wish it was even higher. Stanley Kubrick is one of the best film makers in the world, and 2001 is his best performance. 10/10.
