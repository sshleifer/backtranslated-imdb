Odd but wonderful original movie. Actually scary, creepy and ridiculous in equal measures. Setting up a high brick red brick apartment is a perfect backdrop for the ghost action. The idea of ​​a secret sealed room in a place like this is good enough, but if the main naive couple starts cleaning the old bed, they find in this room some classic chills. The cast is fantastic. Tanya Dempsey really gets something to chew after being undervalued in other full-length films. Joe Estevez proves why Brother Martin Sheen is so much bigger in Hollywood - his rolling eyes while making the beds are really hilarious. Charles Band was made with Stuart Gordon and it is really an exceptional Full Moon / Darkwave release. Danny Draven also directed Hell Asylum with Dempsey.
