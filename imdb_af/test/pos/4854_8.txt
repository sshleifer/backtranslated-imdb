The first reviewer is right. In this movie we see ourselves to the majority, pleasant, trying to stay out of trouble, just trying to live our lives, and we see how easily these many human traits, so fundamental to the functioning of society, we can a great evil becomes difficult. <br /> <br /> The story is set during World War II, with the radio, newspapers and movies reminding us of Hitler's attacks on Jews to emphasize the irony of the same kind of violent anti-Semitism taking place in America. Sometimes it seemed to me a little heavy hands. <br /> <br /> It feels more like a play than a movie, but it's so tempting that such jokes make little sense. Perhaps less trivial is the fact that the whole plot hangs one thing that has become unquestionable to me. Larry lived an inevitable life until a middle age; yet this is all he needs to wear some glasses for everyone - EVERYONE - to see him at first glance for a Jew. Unfortunately, I was willingly suspended because the plot made me move forward, but the impeccability bothered me throughout the film. (And honestly, I didn't understand why his wife was also taken for a Jew. Larry thought so because her name was Hart. And later when he married her, I don't know why his neighbors adopted she was Jewish.) For the first part of the movie I wondered if there would be elements of fantasy. Larry's modesty was exaggerated, almost to the point of grotesque. Why not call the police to see the rape, even if the attacker was a neighbor? And I thought the lighting suggested something slightly unreal - the reds of the houses were too red, Gertrude's entrance was deliberately telling, usually the colors were almost chalky in intensity. <br /> <br /> In the credits I see that it was filmed at Campbell Avenue and Wallace Avenue in Toronto, and I plan to travel there (near Bloor & Dufferin) to explore the colors. Really :) It was good to recall that at that time the clergy often led the evil racism. (Remember how the Pope refused to speak out against Hitler, only to get protection from the Church? It was the same pope by the way, what, when Rome was about to be liberated by US troops, was the first soldier Asked to come into town, don't be black, go your history.) I've never heard of this movie. It's a shame. It is certainly of great importance to every person imaginable, to anyone interested in American history or racism; This is one of the clearest illustrations I've ever seen from Bertrand Russell's statement: "Don't go with a crowd to do evil."
