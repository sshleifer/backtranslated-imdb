This eloquent, simple movie makes a remarkable statement about a teenager and his father. Although a theater release, it has a "made-for-TV" quality. We can ascribe this to director John Frankenheimer, who taught his craft in the early days of live television in New York City. Indeed, he directed the play on which the film was based, "Deal a Blow", on the CBS drama series Climax. "Young Stranger" represents his Hollywood debut. After a four-year period in which he would do more television, he returned to send "The Young Savages" with Burt Lancaster and a year later "All Fall Down" with Warren Beatty and Angela Lansbury. <br /> <br /> The casting is competent with James Daly and Kim Hunter (especially good) who play the parents of the title characters performed by James MacArthur (his first theater film), who played the same role in the television version. It was his first appearance on the small screen. Search for James Gregory and Whit Bissell to support roles.
