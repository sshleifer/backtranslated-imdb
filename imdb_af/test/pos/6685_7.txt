Following an attack in New York's Grand Central Station, an innocent bystander (Kevin Spacey, "The Usual Suspects") is arrested by police who believe he is under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. We can understand why they think it, considering how the man experienced them wearing his dark glasses, because "the light on your planet is really bright." And so Prot (as he recognized him as a goat with a goat) was shipped to the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute, where a tired unemployed doctor, Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges, "The Big Lebowski") attempted to understand. this man's so-called error. <br /> <br /> Prot's way is courteous and cooperative. When asked why he believed he was institutionalized, he did say it was because "you think I'm crazy." Within minutes, after satisfying his insatiable newfound hunger for Earth fruit, the completely righteous Prot revealed that he was an alien planet of the planet K-PAX, which is 1000 thousand light years away and the binary star system Agape and Satori in the Lyra constellation. He also describes how his infinitely advanced species have mastered faster than the light journey by using the energy of light, an achievement allegedly gone for humanity. <br /> <br /> Powell is understandably very skeptical about these outrageous claims, though he is fascinated by them and commits himself to understanding how Prot believed such a thing. Meanwhile, Prot uses his time to observe his fellow patients in the psychiatric ward, and eventually everyone offers him something to live and hope for a cure. On July 27, Prot will reveal later, he will leave for K-PAX, and he can only take one person with him. No one is sure of what will happen on that date. <br /> <br /> Originally it was for dr. Powell to play? With Will Smith as Prot? Kevin Spacey starred as Smith had to withdraw from the film. You can tell that he had a lot to do with his character, the utterly real delivery of his sometimes ridiculous dialogue ("Your product alone is worth the trip") which often provokes the real laugh. There is undeniable intelligence behind much of Prot's words, but logic claims he must be delusional ... shouldn't he? <br /> <br /> The audience is guided back and forth between the possibilities ?? For the first segment of the film, we almost accept the possibility that Prot is an extraterrestrial (this is a scientific film, isn't it?!), Before it is completely convinced that Prot inexplicably becomes an impossible knowledge of the astronomy of ' a newly found planet system. A final investigation by dr. Powell offers us a neatly packaged terrestrial explanation for Prot's delusions, but it is being beaten as quickly and we are going to scratch our head again. The film is just about to open its door, allow the public to think what they have just looked at and to discuss it with those around them. Yet, whether you believe Prot is a stranger or not, two irresistible certainties depend on your mind: the universe is indeed a fascinating place and perhaps there are higher powers that our people still have to discover.
