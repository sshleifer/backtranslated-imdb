I believe this is a heartbreaking movie. Richard Donner (Director Superman "Superman") did a good job of directing this movie. Some of the bandits were good, and several were terrible because Bobby (Mazzello) was beaten by The King (Baldwin and especially their dog). Shane attacked the king, which meant he had paid for what he had done to Bobby. <Br /> <br /> Elijah Wood has played a good role in this film. He dreamed the unforgettable scene that he had taken the buffalo's advice about Bobby's abuse. Lorraine Bracco (Pre-Soprano) portrayed an impressive role. br /> <br /> I give this movie *** four !!!
