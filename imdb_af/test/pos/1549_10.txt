Back in the 60's, this grim study by Joy, a young proletarian woman, introduced Ken Loach's career, which has become one of the most famous and respected British filmmakers of all time. By that time, I knew very little about Brecht, the politics or the reality of the underprivileged, and I was very impressed by the aesthetics of the film, its free style, the severe color kinematics and Joy's monologues in front of the camera. I was also very surprised to find that Terence Stamp (who became famous, thanks to Billy Budd, The Collector and Modesty Blaise) had so little screen time. Although the 20th century Fox "Poor Cow" spread in Panama, Loach was not in the mainstream theater (which this film is scarce) and I lost contact with his films. I just heard of his successes, "Kes", "Family Life", "Black Jack". until I got trapped in the 80's. The beautiful title song by Donovan, incidentally, is available in his anthology "Troubadour".
