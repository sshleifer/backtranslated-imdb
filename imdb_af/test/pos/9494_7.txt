"Don't change your husband" is another soap opera comedy by Producer / Director Cecil B. De Mille. This is striking as the first of several films he starred with Gloria Swanson. I think you could also call it a successor to its "Old Women For New" (1918). <br /> <br /> James (Elliot Dexter) and Leila (Swanson) Porter is a 40-year-old couple where James went to the seed and became sloppy and lazy. He loves smelly cigars and eats raw onions. He takes his wife for granted. Leila tries to make him straight. <br /> <br /> One evening at a dinner at the Porter, Leila meets the spectacular Schyler Van Sutphen (now there is a moniker), the playboy cousin of socialite Mrs. Huckney (Sylvia Ashton). She invites Leila to her home for the weekend to let James miss her. Once there, Schyler starts the movements on her farm, promising her pleasure, wealth and love if she leaves her husband and goes with him. The succession of Leila's imagination of this promised new life is overwhelmingly presented and predicts De Mille's epic costume dreams later in his career. <br /> <br /> Leila, bored with her marriage and her interested husband, separates James and marries the playboy. James finally realizes that he is losing the only thing that matters to him and begins to recover. He shaved off his mustache, worked out, cut onions and repeated a few ways. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Leila's new marriage isn't all rosy. Schyler seems to like to play and recorded with the gold diggers Nanette (aka Tootsie, or such a name) (Julia Faye). Schyler loses all his money and steals Leila's diamond ring to cover his losses. <br /> <br /> One fateful day, Leila meets the "new" James and is taken by him in the changes. James drives her home and becomes aware of her situation and ....................................... .......... <br /> <br /> This movie was the start of Gloria Swanson's rise to superstars in a career that will compete with Mary Pickford. Barely 20 years old, she started her career in Mack Sennett with two line comedies as a teenager. Elliot Dexter was almost 50, but he and Swanson make a good team, but it's hard to imagine someone being the most beautiful girl. Swanson tired as in the movie. Dexter and Sylvia Ashton appeared in the similar "Old Women For New" where the woman went to the seed and the man is unfair. <br /> <br /> Also in the film De Mille is often Theodore Roberts as bishop and Raymond Hatton as a player.
