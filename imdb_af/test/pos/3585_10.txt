I think this short TV series was absolutely wonderful and provided both a profound and clear explanation of everything on the screen at that time. It was by far David Attenborough at its best. I personally thought it was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. It's definitely worth earning people's money! <br /> <br /> I also found the little bit about the abyss and deepwater the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the Blue Planet team has discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life! <br /> <br /> In this documentary, Attemborough has almost certainly led to its high reputation. <br /> <br /> It was a masterpiece and will always be considered one of the best modern documentaries. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the Blue Planet team.
