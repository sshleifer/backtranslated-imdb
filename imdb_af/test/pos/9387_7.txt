Deathbed: The bed that eats. <br /> <br /> Judging by the title, you can guess what this movie is about. And yet there is much more (background) story to this movie, then you can suspect. <br /> <br /> Well, so is the main plot about a bed that people and food eat, but there are also some subplots. I won't spoil them, but they are a good touch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the play in this movie is very mediocre. The fact that most of the dialogue is not even spoken by the actors does not really help to improve the quality of the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Because there is a lot of voice work. The thoughts of characters are also revealed to the viewers. Sometimes it works, sometimes it's not. <br /> <br /> The effects are good. Certainly, it can be much better if you compare it to today's movies. But you really shouldn't; just judge the movie as it is and don't take it too seriously. You must admit that a killer BED is very creative. If you're easily haunted, don't see this movie. You will never want to sleep again. <br /> <br /> Deadbed: The bed that eats is a strange horror jewel with a low budget, but I still recommend it to fans of horror movies. /> <br /> Finally, I give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars for its creative story and unexpected turns here and there.
