This movie was really funny. The people who expected to see an Oscar-worthy comedy should come across themselves. It was a fun movie to watch with interesting and funny characters, plot lines, dialogue codes and catches. I judged a movie a 10 if I bought the DVD, or in this case the video tape, and I watched it many times, and in this case, still laughed out loud. I have about 12 movies in my collection with a score of 10 and about half have nothing to do with the Oscars. Again, it was just a fun, light movie. I hope it comes out on DVD. I strongly suggest watching this movie, if you're in the mood for a crazy comedy.
