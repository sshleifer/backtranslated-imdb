I saw this movie about the nagnat TV from Buffalo about 30 years ago and I die to see it again before I ... well ... you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) "robbery" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a failed kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean (?) Or head of department is invaluable. How many movies can you name that can relieve man's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end? This film reminds us that we are all in the same struggle, regardless of class, race, sex or religion. And who can forget about the scene of the suburban homeowner on his hands and knees that attack the few little weeds that dared to venture on his perfect manicure lawn overnight!
