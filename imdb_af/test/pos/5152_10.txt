Roy Andersson's "Du Levande" is not entirely original, as it is a contrast to Andersson's previous film "Sanger from the Second Floor". Yet the film has aura of total originality. Some movie-making conventions are still being discarded: most of the actors look nothing like what you would expect in the movie and the shots last long. Most of the magazines do not move, but people are moving around. The shots start from somewhere and many times the landscape builds in incredible relationships. WG Sebald comes to mind with the same technique in literature. Due to the time invested in each shot, the suspension is very high in many of the screens. There is a story and is not - it is for the viewer to build up in his or her own mind. This movie is positive. It is determined not to see it negatively and at the same time social injustice will not succeed. One of the messages I received was that perhaps all failures and accidents are not fatal. Great movie.
