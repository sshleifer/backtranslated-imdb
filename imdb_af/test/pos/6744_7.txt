In this crackerjack noir thriller from Columbia, which is a combination of Panic In The Streets and The Naked City, Evelyn Keyes is unknowingly the killer who stalked New York. Evelyn, who smuggled some stolen jewelry into the country of Cuba, also smuggled into smallpox. It is misdiagnosed by Dr. William Bishop and when they find out what it is, it's her. <br /> <br /> For most of the movies, the Treasury Department is also looking for Keyes, but for the smuggled gems. It's not nearly the end of the movie that the Department of Health and Law Enforcement realizes they are looking for the same woman. <br /> <br /> Evelyn is also on a mission. Her husband, Charles Korvin, left her flat, the most ignorant cut of everything he had been chasing with her sister while she was in Cuba and collecting the jewels and contracting smallpox. When Lola Albright, as her sister, commits suicide over the whole thing, Evelyn gets a Korvin mission or tries to die. And that is not an idle threat given the situation. <br /> <br /> The movie was shot mostly in New York, such as The Naked City, and its film is sprinkled with many famous names and faces. Keep an eye on good performances by Connie Gilchrist as Evelyn's uncontrollable housewife, Jim Backus as a hidden club owner, and Art Smith as Korvin's fence. <br /> <br /> A true sleeper in the noir category, don't miss it when broadcast.
