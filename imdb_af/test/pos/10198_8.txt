Scientist Carl Lehman (well played by David McIlwraith) is being blown up in a deliberate chemical explosion. He transplanted his brain into the body of an almost indestructible metal-cyborg suit by his evil colleagues. He is led by the wicked obsessive fellow scientist Alex Whyte (a perfect hateful depiction of Richard Cox). Lehman begins with an overall death buoy. It is a bad mercenary Hunter (a wonderful cruel turn by the divine Pam Grier) to put an end to him. Director Jean-Claude Lord, who previously made the undervalued slasher psycho thriller "Visit Hours" clear, stretches the huge action scenes with considerable fad and keeps a zippy pace and ensures these movie sizes are a nice trashy sci-fi / horror action outing. Pauryy character thesp Maury Chaykin easily cuts top acting honors as disgusting fat crawling Burt, who in the movie's single most tasteless series fought a brutal fist with Lehman's pregnant wife Lauren (a winning performance by beautiful Teri Austin). Stan Winston's inventive make-up f / x and Paul Zaza's exciting score adds to the overall slick fun.
