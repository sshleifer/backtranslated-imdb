Well, it wasn't the biggest horror movie I've ever seen in my life. Despite being a lower budget, it is a pretty good movie. The samples are unique and credible. Heck, they are even so scary in the screens where they briefly destroy them over this poor family. Although, if you finally see the monsters completely, do you really think "WTF!? There is a bitter thing to them?!" The only part that really disturbed me is when they sniff * they killed the kitty! Not the kitty, noooooo, why? However, seriously, if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore, this is not the movie for you. Go hire The hills have eyes or something along those lines. If you have small children, I wouldn't recommend looking at them; They will probably give nightmares over trolleys in their room.
