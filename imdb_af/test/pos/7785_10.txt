According to me, a movie can best be rated by the number of 'best scenes' there is. There are probably at least 80-90 scenes in the whole movie that are probably the best of anyone or the other. <br /> <br /> This movie is a masterpiece. Period. I know many who called it before his time, probably because it bombarded at the box. However, I think any generation can relate to this movie and have a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I'm personally pleased that Mahmood is also part of the movie. His role is not so "fleshy", but it is good to see that he is part of the movie in the funniest Hindi movie.
