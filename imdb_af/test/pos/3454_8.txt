A few years ago, I hired this dark Aussie relic to show up at a friend's place and that was an immediate success. The classic story of the wizard of oz with a definite cricket ball 70's Australian twist. The play is not exactly shakespeare. Societies here, but later, 'Mad Max' star Bruce Spence is a beautiful understated surf / scarecrow and there are some wonderful comic innings by Gary Wadell and Robin Ramsay as a delightful 70s camp festival peer / dad character. Also note the musical contribution of former dad Cool Foreman Ross Wilson on the title song. In a similar action to later-day aussie comedies such as "Priscilla Queen of the Desert". Good fun.
