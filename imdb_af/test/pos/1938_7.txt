"River's Edge" was one of the most disturbing movies of 1986, and for a year that also saw "Blue Velvet", you know it's something. See today its lost little of its power and stay much better than the overstated "Kids". The previews for "Kids" regarded it as a discovery of the decline of the country's youth. In fact, it was little more than an exploitation competition based mostly on shock value. "River's Edge" was promoted as a teen exploitation flick, but was actually much better. The only time it gets disturbingly unpleasant is the constant image of the dead body. Besides, the film is tempting and, for all its minor mistakes, quite realistic. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves, known as a special wood-jumper, gives his best performance as a burnt-out teenager. Ione Skye is equally sympathetic and fun. Dennis Hopper (on the spring trail with this, "Blue Velvet" and "Hoosiers") gives a good performance as the creepy but pathetic hippie generation remnant. Crispin Glover, while always entertaining to look, looks a bit out of place as the manic stoner and group leader. The best performance is definitely Daniel Roebuck. Like the killer John, Roebuck is terribly emotional. It is a pity that he has not become a bigger star than a much better actor than Reeves. <br /> <br /> The movie is overwhelmingly fantastic and daring. Don't miss out on another lamb not John Hughes clich√©d high school movie like "The Breakfast Club". This is a shocking piece of nihilism that resonates with the viewer. Fans of this movie are advised to call a 1981 Canadian movie called "Out of the Blue", led by Dennis Hopper. It is another shockingly dark investigation of the genital gap and, despite its darkness, can have an influence on River's Edge. (7/10)
