Not everyone likes this movie. It is still one of the best "movies you need to think about" the satanism ever made. The fact that it doesn't spin MTV era or lasts every seven minutes is irrelevant. Also, as someone who actually knows Satanists, the (spoiler warning!) Speaks part of the movie where the Brotherhood exchanges their old bodies for those of preadolescent children. It has some really scary scenes. The section where (second spoiler warning) Strother Martin orchestrates the transition is almost hyper-true, as it uses very few special effects, a feature of this film. McEveety is rarely given a big budget, but was often effective. It also worked in this case.
