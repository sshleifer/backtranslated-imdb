Another black comedy that won an Oscar for best screenplay. With George C Scott, it redefines the phrase "tear a new $ hole." In this case, the target is America's Medicare and large hospital system. Throughout the hospital patients and doctors die because their names and prescriptions change. Scott roars, screams and blows away his workers and bosses because they fail more and more. His comments on Dachau on one of his many bosses are sure to laugh. He even hit a hippie 3 times and raped. This is one that has to be seen and heard, since the monologues and soloists are the key points in the film.
