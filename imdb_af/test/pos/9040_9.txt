It is quite surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand over black and white problems. The film deserves strong kudos to accept this point of view, because it acts exceptionally from its mostly lesser-known role and for the super-intelligent writing that does not insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism. Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running, it's a wonderful job! <br /> <br /> Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played roles in various films of the era) is a proud black man accused of killing a white man in the South. The crowd can really care less about the details - they are just in a pending way. And in spite of his commitment to the law, one attorney in the town who agreed to defend him also asserts that he is guilty and does not want to know the truth - just delay the hang until they can try to convince him and then have a legal hang! Fortunately, a young white man (Claude Jarmin) begins to wonder about Juano's innocence and begins to seek out the truth. At this point, the best character in this amazing drama is introduced - played by Elizabeth Patterson (the old lady who later played Ms. Trumbull on I LUCY LOVY). She steals the show as the white person with not only a conscience, but the will and determination to stand up for the black man. At a wonderful point in the film, a crowd is trying to overtake her to get the prisoner to kill him, but she is very stuck and forces them to return. There is much more to this rather complicated but intelligent written story, but I will give it to you to see it for yourself. See it with your kids if you have a chance - it will open a wonderful dialogue on how far race relationships have come in the past 50 years. <br /> <br /> By the way, 1949 was apparently a wonderful year. because Hollywood eventually addressed the main bias, as Twentieth-century Fox also released Pinky - an equally effective and strong film about racism, mutual marriage and even rape! See both movies as you can.
