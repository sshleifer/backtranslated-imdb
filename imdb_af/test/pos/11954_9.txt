80's comedies (especially those with John Cusak) are wonderful. Almost everyone is hillarious and instant classics and this film is no exception. Many buttons to other movies (that is, Godzilla and Jaws) through the hilarious movie, you will laugh for hours. Some may complain that the movie is a bit lean, but it was the 80's and things were always a bit cheesy. Throw a young Demi Moore and an even harder Bob Cat and you have a laugh at your fans. If you haven't seen it, you'll soon be better !!!!!!
