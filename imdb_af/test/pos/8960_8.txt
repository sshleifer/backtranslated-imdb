Yes, this movie has many gay characters. It also has straightforward characters, characters who are not sure about their sexuality, people who are looking for truth about their existence. <br /> <br /> It's not a sexual orientation movie. It's about loneliness and the problems people often associate with each other. In a filmistic manner, Denys Arcand balances the different dimensions of the relationships and the contrasting, continuous shift of relationships. The serial killer element is slightly less successful (it feels more like a way to encrypt multiple plots and, unlike the rest of the movie, it's thematically heavy-handed). <br /> <br /> Thomas Gibson centers and bases the film; It is a quiet performance, but behind the attractive, arrogant outside, he slowly shows a terrible soul who is afraid to show or accept love from those around him. The supporting role is strong, especially Mia Kirshner as Gibson's friend, a stupid-for-hire with precognitive powers. Her role is more metaphor than a literal conception --- strangely innocent and oppressed at the same time, representing the light and darkness of the characters' sexual consciousness. <br /> <br /> The film's involvement and surprises in its character development. The effect is a bit like Robert Altman who sends a David Mamet script. The dialogue is not diminished by a few searing observations except a few confronted moments in the beginning. Often we ignore in our quest for love and a conventional "relationship" the love that already exists around us --- in our friends, family, those we can see as we are. Arcand and the author, Brad Fraser, make a few remarks about the different ways people try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial comes back to haunt us in so many unexpected ways. <br /> <br /> This movie is a rewarding experience. It should not be to bigots who cannot pass the sexual orientation of some characters to see the larger, transcendental message of hope and salvation. Loneliness is a universal experience. A film like this, exploring the dark side of our lives with a smart and eye-catching eye, deserves applause and an open-minded approach.
