Well, it's safe to say that subconscious cruelty is a strange movie! Suppose an insight into the human mind, subconscious existence consists of four macabre and bizarre stories of the extreme. The first segment, titled 'Ovarian Eyeball', is really just a warm-up, but it's good that it gives the viewer an idea of ​​what to expect from the next three segments. It only sees a naked woman lying on a table while another woman is cutting in her stomach and pulling a human eyeball! I have no idea what the point is, but it certainly makes visceral viewing. The next story is the best of the bunch, and incorporates the "old favorite" movie movie of incest. The segment follows a man living alone with his pregnant sister. He is repelling her pregnancy - yet he wants to have sex with her anyway, and of course he gets his way. This story comes out because of the monotonous and factual narration as well as the end - which does not deliver the shocks. This segment is well behaved, well filmed and easily the culmination of subconscious cruelty. Of course, the next two sections are not as good as the second one; So the only way out of it is, but director Karim Hussain still manages something from the bag before the film ends. However, he does not do so immediately, as the third segment is the worst of the film, and simply sees many people have sex with the ground. It is very surreal, and therefore memorable for the same reason; but there didn't seem to be much, and I was in the mood for something a little more morbid to the second section. However, the movie ends at a height, while I'm not quite sure what the point was - the final segment contains the best images of the movie. This segment focuses on religion, and certainly not for anyone who appreciates it! Director Karim Hussain achieved something here - as this collection of four 'extreme' stories does not come together as a whole, the film feels almost tasteful as it has been shot in such an eloquent and striking way. The director looks to emulate the highly respected surrealist director Luis Buñuel, though with gore, rape and incest; and if you ask me, he didn't do a bad job at all. Not for everyone, but definitely a look for extreme fanatics!
