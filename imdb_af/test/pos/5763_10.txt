I haven't written a review on this yet, but I've watched all the bottom TV shows, live shows and it made me feel I needed to make my views on this movie known! That is, I feel, the perfect comedy movie. It doesn't have the love story story lines (I don't really want to mention wealth, with the love of Gina Carbonara you want? Or he and Eddie go there naked ... not love) that goes the rest of the comedies of good to crap, it lacks the usual dilemmas you have to overcome in most other comedy films ... unless you have to escape the poisoning of the guests and escape from the guests, it must come as a dilemma similar to other comedy films ..... No, this movie just sets out and manages to do one thing and just one thing: make one laugh. What does one need from comedy movies? Laugh. This movie just laughs and laughs without making the laugh with serious shit like other comedy movies! So I call it the only perfect comedy movie ever made and I will never ever stop watching this beautiful movie! I beg rick and ade on such a fantastic genius!
