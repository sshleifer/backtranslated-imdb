Since many other users have already explained and commented on the storyline, I will not. <br /> <br /> But I would like to repeat that Bardem's interpretation is wonderful as well as that of the other actors and actresses in this movie. <br /> <br /> Read previous comments I have noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film does not show views on euthanasia and that the small gift is ridiculous. In my honest opinion, this is far from true. <br /> <br /> There are many characters who love to move in a gray zone between Ramón Sampedro and want him to stay, and understand his desire to die. Most obviously this is the family. For example, Ramon's son-in-law never speaks for or against euthanasia. Another character is Gené (the social rights activist) who reminds Ramón in the last minute to reconsider it all. The scene clearly shows that she doesn't want him to die. <br /> <br /> There are then characters that are clearly against euthanasia. Ramon's brother is clearly against him, like his father ("there is only one thing worse than the death of the boy, and it has a boy who wants to die.") Other users said the conversation between Ramón and the priest ridiculed and filmed to make us think that Ramon is good and the priest is BAD. Well, the scene is undoubtedly slips, but that doesn't mean the priest is caricature or mocked. From my point of view, the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest tried to persuade Ramon to stay alive with arguments that are totally strange to Ramón's thinking. The priest's speech goes on the line of "giving God and taking God", "We are not the owners of our own lives, they belong to God" ... and so on. The comedy comes from the fact that Ramón is atheist and all the priests say he is nonsense. <br /> <br /> This film is the antithesis of Manicheism, which allows the viewer to think about the subject and express his own opinion. And above anything else is a visit of freedom.
