This movie starts a bit slow and ends. Not that it was bad, it was done to illustrate the trait's breakdown of the main character. Consequently, if you are not in tragedy, it is not your movie. This is the thoughtful philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile. If you like Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, you'll probably like this if it's just for the comparisons. The interesting question the movie asks is: "What makes a well-known writer totally disregarded by his publicly-tried ideas for another set?" The new ideas are totally against the status quo. If you are conservative, you won't like this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to other philosophical questions, I have to admit that the film was also quite aesthetically pleasing. The grassy hills and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start. There was also a colorful symbolism that represented the smallest of the main characters. If this kind of thing doesn't impress you, skip it. Overall I give this movie a 7.
