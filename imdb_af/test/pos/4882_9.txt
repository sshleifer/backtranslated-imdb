Finally !!! A good movie made on the most demented serial killer in history. For those who were less familiar with Ed Gein, he was actually the madman who was known for the grave and robbery of his victims (who ripped off most horror fans). In a period that perfectly reflects Wisconsin's wilderness plains, it is easily the most atmospheric horror movie to portray Gein and its abominable murders. Kane Hodder (Jason of the 13th series on Friday) and Michael Berryman (Heels of Eyes I & II), deliver chiller appearances in this series of opus killers who easily leave behind the dark former Gein efforts. So far I want to say this is one of the better horror movies released this year (Turistas = 0).
