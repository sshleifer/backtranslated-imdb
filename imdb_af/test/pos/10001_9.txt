As a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the sport's history, I was pleased with Disney's sensitivity to the issues of class in golf in the early twentieth century. The film challenged the psychological struggle that Harry Vardon fought in himself from his childhood trauma for his own inability to break the glass ceiling that prevented him from being equated in the English golf community. Similarly, the young Ouimet goes through his own classrooms, a mere kaddy in the eyes of the upper crust Americans who scoff at his efforts to rise above his status. <br /> <br /> What I loved best, however, is how this theme of the class is manifested in the characters of Ouimet's parents. His father is a working class drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class; however, his mother acknowledges her son's talent and desire and encourages him to follow his dream to compete against those who think he is inferior. <br /> <br /> Finally, the golf phones are well photographed. Although the course used in the movie was not the actual website of the historic tournament, the small freedoms taken by Disney did not detract from the beauty of the film. There is a small Disney moment at the pool table; Otherwise, the viewer doesn't really see Disney. The ending, as in "Miracle", is not a Disney creation, but one that could only have written the history of man.
