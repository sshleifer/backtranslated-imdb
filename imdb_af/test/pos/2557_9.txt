Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), named Ale for short, works at a car repair shop that became known as the Iron Triangle, a weakening twenty-block rack of car rollers and sleazy car dealerships near Shea Stadium in Queens, New York. . Here clients do not question whether parts of stolen cars come or why they can receive such big discounts, they just put their cash down and hope everything is up and down. The spectacular outskirts such as these are not highlighted in the tour guides, but Iranian-American director Ramin Bahrani puts them on a spectacular show in Chop Shop, a powerful Indian movie last year at Cannes, Berlin and Toronto. received love. A follow-up to his award-winning "Man Push Cart", Bahrani spent one and a half years in place, describing F. Scott Fitzgerald as in the Great Gatsby as the "valley of the ashes". <br /> <br /> For all his portrayal of whiteness, Chop Shop is not a work of social criticism, but like Hector Babenco's Pixote, a pleasant character study in which a young boy's survival at the price of his innocence is bought. Shot at Willets Point in Queens, Bahrani makes you feel like you're there, with a hot and humid New York summer with all its noise and chaos. The focus of the film is on the beautiful, street-smart 12-year-old Ale who remains on the edge without any adult support or supervision, except his boss (Rob Sowulski), the actual owner of the Iron Triangle garage.

In this environment, Ale and Isi use any means needed to keep their heads above water, while their love remains constant and they are still laughing at the childhood that was never theirs. As Barack Obama says in his book "Dreams of my Father," the change may come later if their eyes stop laughing and they have closed something inside. In the meantime, Ale complements his earnings by selling sweets in the busy New York subway with his friend Carlos (Carlos Zapata) and pushing bootleg DVDs on the street corners, while Isi tries the tricks to save enough money to buy the money. While Ale is a "good boy", he is not above the stalk of purses and hubcaps in the Shea stadium parking lot. Events that observe Bahrani's camera without judgment. In Chop Shop, Bahrani gave a compelling antidote to the successful stories of the Hollywood dream factory. He gave us a film of beautiful naturalism and respect for his characters. This is in many ways similar to the great Italian neo-realistic films and recent Iranian works by Kiarostami, Panahi, and others. Although the outcome of the characters is far from certain, Bahrani makes sure we see a giant sign at Shea Stadium that reads: "Make dreams come true" and let us see the tip that in Rumi's phrase "the drum of the realizing that promise, "
