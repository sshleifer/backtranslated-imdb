When I first saw this movie, I also expected our boys to be cute, and more like an extended version of the TV show. I didn't find it again. But years later, at a party years later, on a 70s-type PAR-TAY, where certain drugs were smoked, inhaled and with lots of tequila, "HEAD" was late at night. We watched it and finally realized what "HEAD" was all about. It has its own show, "as in a song called itself," a crafted image. As Davy Jones wrote in his autobiography, "They made me a monkey", he openly admits that everyone in the movie was smoking all night. They made fun of themselves, society, everything! Great movie! Tho, as a 52-year-old grandmother, I no longer have 'invaded', I still watch this movie if I want a good LOL !!!
