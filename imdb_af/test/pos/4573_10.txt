Idiocrics felt that Mike Judge had taken my thoughts on society and put them in the movie. In fact, the movie is a social commentary. Almost feels like a documentary. Luke Wilson played a good job playing a boring average guy (like in most of his movies). The Idiocracy course was an extreme of the current state of society. But it makes most comedies funny, extreme of any situation. Fiction is not so much different from reality. <br /> <br /> With children who are materialistic Hip-Hop culture and proud to be ignorant. When people feel unusable in life, they are bred. Give them a goal in the world. And it looks like only the worse people are getting the most. I can understand how others do not like it. It doesn't help most of the jokes were 2nd grade bathroom humor. Not much different from a Kevin Smith movie. <br /> <br /> Idiography throws away logic, reason, any intelligence (For good reason). <br /> <br /> The return of Mike Judges was a hit.
