In 1984, Edgar Reitz surprised film lovers around the world with his epic opus Heimat: a chronicle of Germany. Eight years later he emerged a sequel, The Second Heimat: Chronicles of a Youth, which is even more amazing than his predecessor. <br /> <br /> It's not really a successor. It's more of a "midquel" because it covers events that took place between the ninth and eleventh episodes of the first Heimat cycle. <br /> <br /> The Second Heimat began in 1960, four years after Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold) was separated from his first love, Klarchen, courtesy of his intolerant mother and older brother (the controversy had him being under age while she was about 25). Still angry with the events, the young man never promised to fall in love again (an eager, creepy scene) and decided to move to Munich (as the director himself did in about the same time) in the hope of " to become a professional composer. after a few years at the Music Academy. He is staying in Munich for ten years and the thirteen two-hour episodes of Heimat 2 cover that time frame. Everyone focuses on another person among Hermann's fellow students, people who, like him, are looking for a second home country, whether it's music, movie or something else, where they can finally have peace. <br /> <br /> As the first Heimat, this cycle is a perfect union of film and television: the episodic structure and the various romantic subplots make it look like a soap opera, and the Second Heimat should be seen as a whole to successfully embrace. while some of Heimat 1's chapters can be seen as separate stories (especially the one about Hermann's teenage years), the style and content are purely author theater, with the well-known black and white / color transitions (actually a bit more predictable this time) and ambiguous characters, the latter being underlined by the relationship between Hermann and selosplayer Clarissa Light Blue (Salome Chamber): they love each other very much, but they keep going with other people and inevitably start to is late. This time, Reitz looks more pessimistic about his characters (at one point Hermann is so disillusioned that he says, "The Beatles are much better than us!"), And build whole episodes around dark, controversial themes such as abortion and suicide. The decade he is exploring is not suitable for everyone, as some have been dramatically dramatized by the central events of the 60s (especially the '68 revolution). <br /> <br /> Reitz also shows this mini-series specifically for movie buffs, given the numerous movie references (including a brilliant Casablanca quote) and clever in-jokes (one episode in Venice, whose film festival) played an important role in the success of the Heimat saga). And since 1992, movie lovers have never stopped thanking him for delivering 26 of the most compelling hours ever dedicated to celluloid.
