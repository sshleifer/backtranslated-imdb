I just wanted to say that I was excited to find this comment about the show. I tried online searches for information on past performance with no luck. I loved the show. I have a hard time motivating to practice, but this show made it enjoyable. As another remark noted, it wasn't as complicated as the routines nowadays. It was an ideal workout that did the job! I will give anything to buy a copy of just one workout. I remember a lot of the moves, but not nearly everything. Someone tries to get it back on the air and also makes it available on DVD. It's so nice to know I wasn't the only one who loved that show! Thank you for making my day!
