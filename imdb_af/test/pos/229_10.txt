One night I listened to radio and they had Leslie Nielsen on the program. He explained why there were only 6 shows. '<br /> <br /> With TV shows like MASH you can go to the fridge to get a beer and as long as you hear what's going on, you have missed nothing. But with the police team you had to watch the show, with the eyelids you missed a lot if you didn't see it. Who can forget "... the part of the village known as" Little Italy "..." with the coliseum in the background. <br /> <br /> Even the movies relied heavily on the percussion, but then again In the theater you were a prisoner. <br /> <br /> Leslie also said the one reason why the show, movies and other movies like the plane were funny was because they didn't try to tell what was funny. It was up to the viewer to get the jokes. <br /> <br /> Well, it's just me 2 cents.
