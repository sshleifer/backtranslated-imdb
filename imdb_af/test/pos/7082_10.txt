If you're under the IMDB audience that put High Fidelity in the all-time top 200, this movie is NOT for you. This movie is so unhip as Steve Frears is self-conscious hip. Renee Zellweger is excellent as a hip urban magazine writer who returns to her suburban Bucks County nest to take care of mother Streep (who is still doing a hall of fame). William Hurt is ideally cast and the fearless, faithful and selfish man. If this movie does not move you to cry and laugh, then you are too hip to enjoy it.
