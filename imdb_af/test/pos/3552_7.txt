A remake of the 1916 silent movie, based on the 1909 novel by Maurice Leblanc. The detective series will be made over the years in numerous plays, films and TV shows in the UK, USA and France. This 1932 version died of the breaking Barrymore brothers John (like the Duke) and Lionel (as detective screen). They will also die together in the Grand Hotel, Eight Dinner and several others over the next few years. Sonia (Karen Morley) appears in the duke's bed during a festival in this pre-Hayes code film; first the lights go out into the bedroom, then they go out into the main ballroom, then the search is for the crook and the missing jewelry as well as other missing valuables. You can also tell that talkies aren't there too long because they still use caption cards a few times. Also look for a new type of safe that doesn't need a combination. Well-considered plot, no big holes, but no surprises here either. Not bad for an early talkie movie. Smart end.
