I saw "NSNA" just after I watched Roger Moore movies and I have to say it's so nice to see Connery again. He always proves that he is the only Bond. <br /> <br /> The movie itself isn't really a masterpiece, but it's really worth watching. The jokes are much better here, the effects are funny and interesting, Connery is Connery and Brandauer is really a good villain. But von Sydow is just messed up and the score is not often good and there are some scenes that look pretty unnecessary. <br /> <br /> 7/10 2.5+ 4+ (1+ - 6-)
