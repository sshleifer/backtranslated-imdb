This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can lead to nightmares for others. Her physical aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see how the main actress wore. I think women might think of this behavior, but I don't think they do it. The dark scenes added to the feeling of evil that had to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfactory solution, but it didn't. Maybe it's more realistic. Life looks in the same direction instead of creating a new riverbed on the hill.
