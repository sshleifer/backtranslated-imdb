This movie probably gave me the pleasant surprise of someone I have ever seen. It's not a big budget production and its prospect, middle-aged amateur jazz musicians, get an unexpected professional engagement at a Catskills resort, seemingly modest. What is not modest is the success of the movie. This is a small cut-of-life movie that is most entertaining. Director Frank D. Gilroy also wrote the script and it is full of interesting subplots and unexpected twists. <br /> <br /> The actors are travel companions who do a solid job. The biggest revelation for me was Cleavon Little. He plays a professional musician who is hired to fill in for a bad band member. His attitude immediately collides with the other. As they see it as an opportunity for fun and once in a lifetime, he sees it as his work and not a particularly interesting one. This leads to conflict, but when the group gets in trouble, they send them through. Little, who died too young, really showed me he was a good actor with this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a real sleeper, the kind that a filmwoman always hopes to discover. I highly recommend it.
