This story, the rise of China's first emperor and his efforts to unite the empire, was the most expensive film production in China's history. <br /> <br /> This is worth every penny. Visually spectacular cinematography, versatile characters and outstanding characters make this one of the best epics ever released on film (foreign or otherwise). Please do not miss the opportunity to see it on the big screen.
