As a father of four in his forties, I thought this movie made compelling viewing - if it wasn't the seat of the seat. I earn a much higher score than the 4.3 I had when writing it. (I gave it 7.) <br /> <br /> I agree with some of the comments about the characters, but Cameron Diaz has played a very different role. The plot was a bit stupid, but the point of the movie was beautifully summed up in the final, rather surreal sequence. A movement that ends for any parent. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that a young, single block can find the movie very boring, but for other people who haven't been diagnosed with high doses of testosterone, it will find something nice.
