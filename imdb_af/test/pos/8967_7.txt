Mike Nichols's movie Charlie Wilson's War, which appeared in the 1980s, tells the story of how the title character (played by Tom Hanks) could achieve a secret war with the Russians by helping the Afghan forces. Of course, we know how well it turned out in the long run, but unfortunately the film doesn't shine about the unpleasant descendants. <br /> <br /> The movie is starred, with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts being one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood. As a bonus, you have the versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman in a distinctively memorable supporting role, one for which he received an unjustified Oscar nomination. I'm not much of a Roberts fan, but Hanks is always trustworthy. Nevertheless, I can't buy him as a drug-using women's buy, although the real Charlie Wilson looks just as nice as Hanks. However, apart from the big three, it's not worth mentioning, even from a recognizable name like Amy Adams. <br /> <br /> The story is tempting and enhanced by Aaron Sorkin's fine script. The verbal interaction between the main characters is excellent and is full of memorable lines. The subsequent events that are being implemented during the war are not ignored, although the accounting scenes that Wilson honors seem to me to be too serious to reach the bittersweet feeling that is likely to be. Overall, Nichols's direction is man-made and the act of writing follows wonderfully. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that, like Charlie Wilson himself, has mistakes, yet is disillusioned. Certainly recommended for fans of the three stars and for those looking for an engaging political drama with a light-hearted feel.
