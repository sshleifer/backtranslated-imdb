Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictional story about a police department in Mumbai, India. Sadhu Agashe is a hard-working, head-on head of a common-dressed crime group that names itself by killing dangerous criminals in prison police rather than closing them in jail. His loyal officers no doubt obey him, but form a rift when one of his officers, Imtiaz, is frustrated by Sadhu's high position and secretly fights him for criminal death and status. A new site is also being squeezed into the fraternity and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu enables him to lead his first case. Further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of Sadhu's tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see such a well-directed action thriller from India. The camera work is excellent, the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds. The acting, the pace and the political subterfuge convince the viewer that they are a fly on the wall that sees the blood, sweat and tears of a close and personal view, and that the events are based on reality. It is undoubtedly why we are told that this is not the beginning of the film, although it is likely that the director, Shimit Amin, has taken factual freedoms. Nevertheless, Ab Tak Chhappan is a highly polished piece of film.
