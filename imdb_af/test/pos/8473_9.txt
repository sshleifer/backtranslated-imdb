A masterful performance by Jamie Foxx is just one of Ray's highlights, a 2004 film that also supports Kerry Washington, Regina King, Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, Sharon Warren, Patrick Bachau and many others. film. <br /> <br /> The film has several main focuses: the first is Charles's childhood - the drowning of his brother George who haunted him for years, the glaucoma that blinded him, and the power taught him by his - Don't bend, don't break, don't ever be a cripple. She eventually sends him to a special school where Charles's gift of music is discovered. The next focus is Charles's artistic evolution as a Nat King Cole-like singer, after his arrangements of gospel music, decay in country music, and the unique sound that Ray Charles has become. The third focus is Charles's personal life - his marriage to Bea, his many affairs, his heroin addiction and ultimate rehabilitation. <br /> <br /> Because Charles walked for 74 years, there was a lot of skipping. Although Charles was left in his teens, the death of his beloved mother, his rock, is not in the movie. While on the chitlin track, refusing to play in segregated clubs, his famine as a musician is not covered. At one point he got a pot jelly and tried to eat it, but the pot broke. He was occasional. Bea was shown to him when the state of Georgia, who banned him, accepted "Georgia on My Mind" as their theme song in 1979 and Charles welcomed back to his native state, but he and Bea were divorced in 1977 which is not mentioned. . However, she was probably there. She was not his only wife - he was married once before meeting her; that marriage is not covered. In the movie we are told of one illegitimate child - there were 12. It would be impossible to get everything and more in a movie. <br /> <br /> What is not skipped is its glorious music. , which is constantly being constantly strengthened by the film, and constantly enhancing its genius and artworks. <br /> <br /> Charles's story is compelling and keeps the audience's interest throughout. Those who make it as a TV movie do not give it the credit it deserves. Taylor Hackford's direction gives Ray a good fit, and the movie has a lot of atmosphere and has excelled the various decades. <br /> <br /> If Ray, Jamie Foxx occupies the character and lets you forget he is a comedian who plays a part. Foxx wore prosthetics, played his own piano play, and spent a lot of time preparing Charles for the role. He nails him, but it's not a personification - he's a flesh and bloodman with hallucinations to stand in the water and find his brother's body; a man full of denial about his addiction, hate the word junkie and believe he is not addicted; and he is in denial about his domestic life and thinks his wife does not know about his various matters and illegitimate children (in the film, child); and a man had taken terrible advantage in his career because of his blindness which later refuses to be walked. He claims to be paid in $ 1 accounts so they can be counted; When he discovers he is a brothel for a club owner and her partner and was almost out of a record, he made his own deal and left his job. <br /> <br /> One doesn't wonder so much Foxx's performance accepts him as Ray from camera for the first time. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent biography, such as 'Walk the Line', played with the fantastic music of the artist. Whether you're a Ray Charles fan, Ray is something to experience.
