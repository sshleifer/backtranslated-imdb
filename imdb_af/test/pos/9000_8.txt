I just watched it last night and it was wonderful. I can see why some ppl have bad feelings about it from a rugby fan and maori culture point of view, but otherwise I have no idea what is so negative about it. The movie is wonderful. It has a lot of heart. Very inspiring and encouraging for all ages. Great family movie! They did a good job as it was a budget movie. I love movies based on real stories / events. I raised my whole life around rugby, it's a great game, but I never really used it, because (forgive me if I offend anyone, nothing personal is just how I saw it). I thought their exercises were not. relentless or hard, the players are not as disciplined and do not look as serious as other sportsmen and it seems to be just muscle and flower approaching each other, and so on. But after I was strong forever, I was like, wow! I was proud! It did good things for rugby (well, it changed my view of rugby) and also the New Zealnd Haka. I actually called out. I'm not even New Zealander and I was proud of their culture. Didn't even know what the chant meant by this movie. The movie is NOT about rugby techniques or rugby, it's not even New Zealand All Blacks or the Haka or etc ...... Mother of pearls !!!!! hahaha SHUX! <br /> <br /> For all your beautiful negative ppl, you miss the point! I'm sure if they had the means, it would have been better, the haka is there because it was part of Highland Rugby culture, tradition or what you ever want to call. <br /> <br /> Therefore, any new members on this site like myself should not be discouraged by the negative comments. See it for yourself! Must watch movie! There are many things you can learn from this movie, ppl of all ages. It definitely makes you a better person and humble! This movie reminded me of many things I have already known and raised, but I have lost my way to the road! Love it! Happy Reading Plans and All the Best! <br /> <br /> Muawha!
