If you want a good time then it's the movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Take the Point - There is this college that recognizes people with minimum qualifications from BA, B.Com, M.Com, MA, MBA, MCA, BE, M.Tech and BCA. So you have to take the time spent into consideration and so it is clear that all students are 40+. The school also recognizes students of a heavier dispensation and has a course of P.Hd in weight loss and the only student who failed this course is Manisha Koirala. Only she was a snake in the past. Still not convinced? OK read on. <br /> <br /> Here's a scene. Akshay Kumar, a college student, is chased by Arman and he takes a bazooka and shoots him! Then throw grenades. Then one of those grenades hits Akshay. But don't die and continue to fight, the snake Arman throws half a foot-dagger in Akshay and bumps it, but Akshay is still there. Then Akshay comes on a jet ski and follows Arman. They fight and Arman smokes Akshay underwater and eventually Akshay is dead. So we think, as soon as Arman is out of the picture, Akshay swims away to Raj Babbar, head of this college + Boxing Refree + Parapsychology ka professor + mumble priest. <br /> <br /> But no one I repeat I take the cake, but a certain Mr. Nigam. You look at more to learn. :-)
