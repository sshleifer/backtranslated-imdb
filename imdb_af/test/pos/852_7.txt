I can't really criticize this movie. This is literally the first movie I ever remember seeing and leading a lifelong love of science fiction and horror movies and prehistoric animals. Luckily we see it again years later, it kept pretty good. Rod Cameron plays a great game hunter whose last safari has been wiped out by mammoths. No one believes him, including his best friend, played by Emperor Romero, whose brother was among the murdered people. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film was shot in India and has good scenery. The acting is on a high level. I don't think Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero and Marie Winsor have ever turned in a bad performance. The mammoth, when they finally arrive, is reasonably effective. The ending also has an unusual twist, especially for a 1950's science fiction movie. Definitely worth seeing.
