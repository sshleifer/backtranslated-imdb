I was very amused to read some of the bad reviews on this movie. First, many said they had taken their 4-year-old daughters and grandchildren to see it and they didn't enjoy it. Firstly, I don't think it's a children's movie, at least not a movie for very young children, and not 4. It has a lot of subtle humor, but it is not meant to offer or entertain quick entertainment like in Tom and Jerry. Many people also complained that it was going very slowly .... I think people were all used to "quantity" about "quality". Although I myself have a small problem with this movie and it is that the movie was not as detail oriented as the short movies, I still believe it has succeeded well for a complete feature film. And how can people complain about the jokes? The jokes were meaningful, timely and well thought out, never rude offensive or "in your face". Wallace is extremely smart, but careful and Grommit is the most beautiful, smart and cute character it can be. It was a beautiful movie and the theme was very suitable ... for adults who .... especially with the increase in obesity and metabolic disease in the world, there is nothing wrong with promoting fruit and vegetables once. and it has been achieved in a very tasteful way ... while people are worried about the aspect of vegetables that does not necessarily mean that they are healthier or that they eat more of them ... but just because they make nature more difficult , is actually causing the legend of the rabbits to become true. And for those out there who complained about the religious jokes, I say ... came! Are you serious? Many villages revolve around the local church, and legends / promises etc. Are normal themes, no harm done. This movie was absolutely incredible but some people had negative comments on it and I find it absolutely absurd !!!
