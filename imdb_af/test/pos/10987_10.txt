Manna from heaven is heavenly. It's a movie for the family - teenagers and grandparents can enjoy it together. But it's not syrupy sweet or stupid. The characters are really characters. The plot is somewhat complex and you have to pay attention, but it's like adding a puzzle as it all falls in place. The beginning of the period is to watch an old photo album, or to remember when. It is very well done with very accurate hairstyles and costumes. The story moves fast with twists, turns and lots of fun. <br /> <br /> A special surprise is seeing the big company of familiar faces, many of which we haven't seen long ago. Part of the fun is to recognize and name them spiritually, as it does, although it can be distracting. Cloris Leachman at the end of the movie seems to have had a "makeover" on "Oprah". I never saw Faye Grant in a movie - just knew her as Grace's mother in the TV show "Save Grace". She was big, even minus the southern accent. And I didn't even recognize Shelly Duvall. The five sisters who created this wonderful movie are a very talented quintet and Sister Theresa is a heavenly treasure.
