Taken from my x's DVD collection when he was with my best friend (said enough), it looked one night when there was nothing left on the telly (nothing new) and a very pleasant surprise. Many British (you hardly have a budget, no faces you know or even seen), the accent was a bit thick for me, but started to worry (a bit too close to home) my case) it started growing on me. Aside from the unnecessary wink that didn't really add anything, I lifted the movie thoroughly, accomplished many real natural performances, I wanted more of an end that suddenly came too soon. Highly recommended!
