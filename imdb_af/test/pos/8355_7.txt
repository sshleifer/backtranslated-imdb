Well, first of all it's not a bad movie. It's good, and I like the characters being offered. I also love Lady and Tramp's voices in this. <br /> <br /> But I'd like to see Lady And Tramp more. I know this is' Scamp's Adventure ', and I love Scamp And Angel, but it's a sequel to the original, where I think they should just release it as' Scamp's Adventure', not 'Lady And The Tramp II '. : Scamp's Adventure '. <br /> <br /> Tramp played a role, but he didn't have much time with Lady. <br /> <br /> But anyway, the songs are pretty good, and Scamp And Angel is sweet. I saw better successors, but hey, it's not a failure. <br /> <br /> I give it 7/10. Very good, but still has errors.
