I'm rarely partly into movies about clever teens who have authority problems, but "Toy Soldiers" grew on me with repeated views. It is so much a movie about Billy Tepper growing up and becoming an adult other than anything, and I give credit to Sean Astin and author / director Daniel Petrie Jr. They don't make much of it, but just let it unfold and sneak over you. The companionship of Carpenter's friends, their sadness about Joey's death, and their joy over their survival, all really move. And I have to admit, I enjoy a certain patriotic (and perhaps slightly reptile) pleasure when the US Army finally moves in and just kicks closer to terrorist. Ooh-rah, General Kramer! And the heroic Robert Folk score is the cherry on top. I'm sure I could find a hundred reasons not to keep "Toy Soldiers", but as long as we don't take it too seriously, I don't see the need. It's one of the most entertaining "bad" movies in my pantheon.
