Ignore everyone's comments for this movie and watch it on pay cable (as I did) or rent it. You owe it to yourself. This movie is what (supposedly) movies are about. Difficult to categorize (and God knows how it is written as a "high concept"!) But this is one for the angels. Look at that. What do you have to lose?
