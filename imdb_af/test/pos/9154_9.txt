Wonderful silent version of Francois Villon's story. Although in the 1930s IF I WERE KING, with Frank Lloyd director, Preston Sturges essay and Ronald Colman starring, this version is even better. Barrymore, with a cohort comedian, plays the comic fool and the wine-depressing Villon with Colman's cowardice. Photography is exciting in its beauty and innovation and its supporting role, especially Conrad Veidt in his American premiere, the incredibly beautiful Marceline Day, and the supporting comics, Slim Summerville and Hank Mann, steal every scene they are doing. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Barrymore did so few first-class comedies. Among his sound films, only his lead in TWENTIETH CENTURY and his supporting role in MIDNIGHT can be compared, and only because of his beautiful voice. In this silent movie, Barrymore tells his story without words of benefit, and he does it, alternately hilariously unrecognizable as the King of the Fool and in love with Villon. He will even be transformed into the antelope style of Fairbanks. He also leaves his supporting role player his share of glory, hijacking in this ensemble working like any talented cartoon of the era. <br /> <br /> Finally, a short word on Alan Crosland, a director who is only known today for directing the first talk function, The Jazz Singer in the same year it was released. Crosland was a cautious, innovative, delightfully original director, and it is a pity that more of his works are not known. Perhaps this movie, much more interesting than a movie as its best-known work, is your introduction to its other talents. If so, you can do much worse.
