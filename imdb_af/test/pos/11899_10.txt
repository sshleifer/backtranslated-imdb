I finally see the El Padrino movie, from what I can see is an amazing movie, and a lot of action. Damian Chapa is a good director, but I have to admit that I love his performances best. <br /> <br /> I also saw behind the scenes, it was edited by a lady named Kinga, she had to go back to school and learn how to edit. <br /> <br /> However, the movie El Padrino is a pure 10-action epic. Why can most people who create direct movies make you wonder what the plot is? I am so happy to see someone I know to be a great actor, also become a good director. <br /> <br /> I'm one of those people who love making artists. <br /> <br /> BS
