what a refreshing change from the PG movies that teenage girls jump in and out of bed, young high school boys count how many girls they can hook up, drink kids, drugs, etc., etc. Carl Hiaasen wrote so many books that are nice, but hardly classical literature. but he eventually wrote something that high school children would like to read. And this movie sends a message to children who might make a difference to them, maybe their voices can be heard. Filmed in South Florida, the scenery is beautiful and natural and real. Who cares if it is predictable, and a little lean. So was FREE WILLY and watch how well it did. It's a good family movie .......... a rare race.
