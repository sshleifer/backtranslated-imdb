Mishima: A life in four chapters is an art house biography of Yukio Mishima, the famous Japanese writer, similar to Paul Schrader's earlier character Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver).

This movie shows that Mishima was a person who saw the fall of Japanese culture. He loved very much and with his final act he tried to save traditions and proved himself to be a real fighter, but he realizes it as a person he was just a man with no power to change events .
