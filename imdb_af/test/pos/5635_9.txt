When we are young, we all choose an ideal career for ourselves: artist, actor, writer, rocket scientist, etc. While most of us grow out of our pipe dreams, the main character of the American film, Mark, has not yet come from his (and also at the age of thirty): to become a rich, dedicated director. In spite of the fact that Murphy's law will not leave Mark alone and always always go wrong, Mark can persevere during every frightening incident with an even bigger drive to reach his goals. His desire to be a director therefore controls his character that he sees any person or thing in his life as something to exploit to achieve that goal. While I noticed that other IMDB commentaries are lambasting Mark's selfishness, I think this is an almost justified kind of selfishness, because Markus, who is not a well-known director, is equal to death. He speaks unceasingly to leave a kind of mark on the world, and he sees filmmaking as a way to do it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, any viewer of this movie looks early on the fact that Mark has a close chance of ever achieving his dream. Is he aware of that? No, not in the slightest, and none of his family or friends wants to leave him in secret (even some of them believe in him). Oddly enough, the disappointing future that the viewer feels is surely emerging, as Mark does not prevent the ability to find humor in the film. This is a very funny documentary. Most of the laugh comes from when Markus filmed plays for "Coven". There is a scene where an actor has to break his head a cupboard, and it just doesn't work. Another scene has Mark's very old uncle Bill, who said a few lines to the camera; Needless to say, after taking a bunch of head scraps and a line-stumbling bill, he finally had enough. Many humor comes from Mark himself. His screenplay, which he seems to be worthy of a Pulitzer, is laughing badly: "It's good, it's good, there's something to live, and Jesus told me." <br /> <br /> Unlike what people think, American Movie is a documentary that everyone can enjoy (although my sister, who watched a few scenes, seemed to be really bizarre). The fact that Chris Smith can successfully track down a film that stops both the grief of Mark's depressive lifestyle with crooks with Bill (who unfortunately died before the film was released) says a lot about him. I wonder how the dreamer Mark sees this documentary. Did he realize it was shedding him in a bad light? Or that it shows him as a fool in many scenes of the movie? Or does he see it as something that will be shown in front of his own A&E Biography segment? This is an interesting subject of wonder, and I hope the last one has become true to him. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie: 9/10.
