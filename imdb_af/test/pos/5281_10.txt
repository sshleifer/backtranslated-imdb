Gake no Ue no Ponyo is a beautifully animated film and a relief from the many heartless, soulless CGI movies. The background and colored pencil backgrounds were a surprise after Sen until Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away) and Hauru no Ugoku Shiro (Howl's Moving Castle) were similarly stylistic. The style worked well for the film and was done extremely well. The time and effort used to animate it is much appreciated as it gives the characters much more life, the detail and care it takes, making the movie so much better. There are several great scenes throughout the film that have lots of movement and action. The biggest for me is a scene where Ponyo's sisters change into big waves like fish, walking on top of them. The story is simple but fairly well written and played. The plot focused on character relationships and while it was not played out, as well as in Tonari no Totoro (My Neighborhood Totoro) it is still large. I felt that each character had the appropriate amount of screen time, unlike Spirited Away, which was so characteristic of being in a whole range. (The Radish Spirit. There was another movie there!) My only real problem with the movie was the end. The way it is spoken in the English version seems to be a good test for S≈çsuke, which seems to be just Ponyos's mother he will love Ponyo. Although it becomes more thoughtful, I guess the translation may not be as accurate as the real meaning, as the test is the promise and that it really means deep. The movie, however, suddenly began to end. Other than that, the movie was good and I highly recommend it.
