Now I understand that this movie is not meant to be an indictment against all Indians, but it is a wonderful movie because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy some Indians have over their wives and sexuality. For some time I knew that sexism is very common in this society (with women being murdered because the husband's family no longer wants them after his death, or because she had a small dowry and the regular killing female fetuses because they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing). I also realize that some of this culture is largely offensive to the movie, but the bottom line is that there is some truth about the subject - even though the film was so heavily attacked when it started in India a decade ago. Because of the extreme misogyny in the movie, most Western audience members will be shocked or at least emotionally drawn into the dream of the ladies in this movie. <br /> <br /> Although I'm a man, I'm not rabidly feminist and I'm straight, the movie has had a strong positive impact on me and it's NOT a calendar movie made only by Lesbians and man haters can be enjoyed. In fact, I don't think the film promotes hatred of men or homosexuality, but rather gives a credible argument how in the case of these two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative because of their evil men. Yes, I use the word "wicked" and mean it, since both men living in this great household are intensely selfish and do not consider the sexuality of their spouse. In many traditional societies it is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existence. <br /> <br /> One man married to a vibrant young woman, Sita, out of family commitment. This regular marriage is uncomfortable for both of them, but Sita is initially trying to connect with her naughty husband. However, he sees himself as a victim and could have warned less about Sita - and he still has a relationship with a liberal Chinese woman. To make matters worse, he did nothing to hide the case and did not apologize. In their dead marriage, sex was just meant to produce children and there was no way Sita could meet any of her sexual or emotional needs. And unfortunately he could care less. <br /> <br /> Another man was married to a woman who was barren (Radha). Strangely, after initially trying to have children, they went for the next 13 years without any sexual contact whatsoever! This is because this man has decided to become an ascetic (ie in Hinduism, a person who gives the pleasure of the world to gain inner relief). Now he wanted to do it, it was good and good if he wasn't already married and had obligations to his wife. However, it was an incredible selfish act, and like his brother he assumed that his wife had no sexual feelings, and he did not care either. The closest he would allow him sexually was to sleep next to him - because she had helped her to teach herself to overcome the desires of the flesh. It shouldn't bring anything but frustration to her. <br /> <br /> So, you have two neglected and normal women living in the same household, longing for emotional connection as well as an outlet for their sexual needs. Eventually, these needs bring these sister-in-laws together - first, just emotionally, but later sexually. The film was brilliant, how it got me to watch and understand how homosexuality in some cases is inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional destruction. <br /> <br /> Late in the film, when the intensity of their sexual relationship is discovered, it leads to an unexpected reaction from Radha's "enlightened" man. However, a man who seeks religious insight and peace is wrapped up in himself so that true insight and growth is impossible. <br /> <br /> It's a very challenging and mature movie. While there is very little nudity, the subject is very mature and it's not a movie to show your kids. Very disturbing indeed is a minor character masturbating in front of an old paralyzed lady - as I said, it is NOT a movie to have your children watch. However, for an adult audience, it's an excellent and highly erotic movie that will make you think. <br /> <br /> The movie features good acting, complex characters, excellent writing, beautiful mood and slow pace. Some may be irritating, but I've found satisfactory. The only serious negative I can't blame on the movie itself, but on the idiots who released it on videotape. This is because, although the film is in English, the accents are sometimes temporary and it is not always easy to understand what is being said. BUT, and this is the worst part, there are no closed or open captions - including they are a must for Western audiences. Watching this movie, see if you can find it on DVD or hopefully a newer version on the video will be subtitles. Sure I didn't. <br /> <br /> By the way, director Deepa Mehta (a popular female director) has made several other great films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD / Hollywood. A consistent theme in her films is the conflict between traditional Indian culture and expectations and Western - with a strong emphasis on female characters. Not surprisingly, this Western-thinking woman makes her in Canada and is divorced - an unusual woman to say the least. For a similar film exploring traditional culture, Western culture meets another Canadian gem, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN.
