John and his wife, Emily, accompanied their child Edward enterprise from the comfortable neighborhood of the suburbs to the town where the man spent his childhood. There was a death in the family and John had to start the proceedings to take control of an old ramshackle cottage, located by the sea, once occupied by an old man who allegedly committed suicide. <br /> <br /> Skeptical about the circumstances of death, John separates himself from his family and separates from reality his own life into danger and puts on the clothes of the old man who is now dead. <br /> <br /> The film is now changing - nothing is what it seems - the people of its past appear in full Gothic / hilly glory - his wife worries his spiritual condition - and his son disappears into the reeds. <br /> <br /> John thinks the old man doesn't commit suicide, that his death is far more mysterious and strange. In a backbone cold final, we learn that the film's events have never really happened and that the whole story is portrayed by the little boy, Edward, who is struggling with his parents' divorce procedures. <br /> Modern Love is a macabre piece of high art theater, a mysterious and perverse piece of pretentious, full of vague suggestions and unexplored reddish-browns. It is humorous and apparently unaware of current Indian tendencies that both its creators endorse, but it also makes it pass. <br /> <br /> But the weaknesses of this Australian film are fully understood by its mere muscular film vision, its bloody sense and compromise precision and its strange Euro horror. The bastard of script norms and a lack of smooth dialogue fall into insignificance against a background of noir and a main achievement to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> One of the most aggressively foreign Australian films in years.
