WARNING: SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER !! <br /> <br /> It's written for movie goers who walked away from 'Mood for Love', confused and confused about roads that choose the main characters in life. From reading other comments and reviews, it appears that many viewers and critics have missed some very important details that prevented them from enjoying this beautiful movie story. <br /> <br /> We've been used to seeing blatant SEX in narratives. that we forgot that there was a time when filmmakers would suggest the "dirty act" by merely showing that sleeping couples just run into a sledge or hooves to return to the next scene with a bulging bowel or a thick toddler on the hip ... "Meet your child." <br /> <br /> The director has chosen the same nostalgic approach to the story of Mr. Chow and Mrs Chan to tell. Last Warning ... SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> Mr Chow fools Mrs Chan to show her true emotions as they rehearse his departure forever. Next scene: Mrs. Chan leans her head on Mr. Chow in the taxi and said, "I don't want to go home tonight." Translation: "Let's Do It" <br /> <br /> Why didn't the couple just do the modern thing to shower their fraudulent spouses, get a divorce, raise their love child and ever live happy? The answer is that this whole story takes place in Hong Kong in the 1960s. A bastard would live in a dark life of shame if he was an adultery, while a "lawful" child could live a tragic but noble / honest life if his mother chose him from his cheating "father" to raise - the invisible Mr. Chan. In short, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan sacrifices their relationship for the future of their child. <br /> <br /> That's why Mr Chow, after learning that Mrs. Live alone with a little boy, give a knowing smile and his dreams of making Mrs Chan his wife Chow. He therefore realized why Mrs. Chan went all the way to Singapore to be with him, to reconsider and leave at last. He decided to never see him again. (But not before he made a remarkable reminder). Mr Chow lives with this wonderful secret with no one to tell. No one, except for a crumbling temple wall and of course the viewer ... but only if we listen carefully.
