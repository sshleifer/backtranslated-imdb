It was a movie I finally thought "Now it was a pleasant 2 hours!" I hate about $ 20 (without baby session $) for my husband and I to make it feel. "This was OK". <br /> <br /> I think Will Smith will be better than a comic actor as an action hero. He was well thrown into this. His character was very nice like Kevin James. <br /> <br /> There were several sound screens. It's also a romantic movie, so guys, if you want to impress the woman in your life, take her here. Women will have as much as a chick flame, but I won't categorize it as one. There is a lot of old humor in it for men to enjoy. I think this is one of the reasons why this movie is as perfect as a date movie. It has romance AND slapstick. I don't like to slap so much, but it wasn't overdoing and I can't think of any scenes that didn't. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. The first thing my husband told me after it was over was, "I want to see it again!"
