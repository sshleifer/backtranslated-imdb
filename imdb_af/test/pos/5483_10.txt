"In the line of fire" is one of the best thrillers I have seen, it builds and builds to a great climax. This movie really pulls you into your heart, beats and you're out of action. The film is made in strong performances, especially Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich. This film is expertly directed by Suspension Master Wolfgang Petersen. Thrillers don't get much better, it's not missing out.
