I first heard of this one while the 'Net for reviews of another Italian giallo / horror attempt, the eternal PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK (1974, whose R2 SE DVD from Raro Video, incidentally, recently bought). ? where it is referred to as in a similar vein but also as well. After watching FOOTSTEPS for myself, can I see where the reviewer comes from? in that both films deal with the psychological collapse of their female protagonist. Stylistically, however, is this one much more owed to Art-house theater than anything else? in particular the work of Alain Resnais and Michelangelo Antonioni (and specifically LASTE YEAR IN MARIENBAD [1961] and THE PASGEWER [1975] respectively); According to this, some have accused it of being "deadly boring"? an epithet often attached to such "pretentious" (read: cerebral) rate! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie involves the search of a woman (Florinda Bolkan) to determine her movements in the preceding three days ?? of which she apparently has no memory. After a series of cryptic clues, does she travel to the 'mythical' land of Garma (nearby places, then carry the equally fictitious names of Muda and Rheember)? where she met several people (including Lila Kedrova as an aristocratic rule of the resort) who remembers the heroine during her 'blackout'! Most prominent, however, is a young man (Peter McEnery) and a little girl (Nicoletta Elmi, of Mario Bava's BARON BLOOD [1972])? the former always seems to be on beneficial moments on the scene, while the latter confuses Bolkan with another woman (sports long red hair and an average stripe!). <br /> <br /> While essentially a tuning piece, is it a gripping puzzle: inevitably, vague events appear on a deliberate fit? and how much of the film's power comes from the remarkable central performance (which can be seen as an extension of Bolkan's role in the fine Lucio Fulci giallo A LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN [1971]). However, the contribution of the cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (which does not offer any number of moving camera movements and an effective color scheme is not accepted.) Orange / red / blue filters are adapted to create atmosphere and with a saturated look at the disorienting , bizarre finale) and Nicola Piovani's appropriate melancholy score (the composer is best known today for his Oscar-winning work on Roberto Benigni's Holocaust-themed tragi comedy LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL [1997]). With this in mind, it's worth discussing how FOOTSTEPS was presented in the version I watched. Well, it's obviously hard to get in its original form (I can't be sure it was cut here or not, except to say that the movie for 89 minutes while the IMDb list it at 96) edition deleted from a fairly beaten English VHS (the dubbing is surprisingly good, given the international cast) with built-in Swedish subtitles to start (except the DivX copy freezes for a few seconds at a key point in the story around the 82 -minute point! Yet we get a welcome bonus, ie a 9 minute 'soundtrack' highlight in MP3 format. <br /> <br /> I realize I haven't mentioned the moon mission subplot, to which Klaus Kinski's presence is limited: about the same time he also played a short but important role in another good artillery with sci-fi railings (and also in a distinctive place)? namely LIFESPAN (1974). While watching the movie, I couldn't understand the possible connection to the central plot, except that Bolkan calls a recurring dream of a movie she once saw, though not to the end. not, "Footsteps On The Moon" (a somewhat misleading alternative title for the movie itself) ?? amusing, she first remembers the picture as BLOOD ON THE MOON (which is of course a classic 1948 Western noir with Robert Mitchum and director Robert Wise!). That said, did I contravene this 'deviation' as just one more foreign touch to the film (also given Bolkan's former employment as a translator at a conference on the future of Earth)? And certainly did not expect the astronauts to arrive at Garma's beach eventually to pursue the female lead, after which the sand was ominously changed into the moon's surface! <br /> <br /> The movie's plot will probably make more sense on a second show ?? To be honest, it is best approached as a visual / audience experience, and you should not really expect to make a narrative that is in any way bright and easily rationalized! For the record, the only other Bazzoni attempt I could catch before, was the middle straight reel THE FIFTH CORD (1971), with Franco Nero (who I recorded late night Italian TV); Some time ago I had his Spaghetti Western version of "Carmen" titled MAN, PRIDE AND VENGEANCE (1968)? also with Nero and Kinski ?? as a DivX (after missing a matinee broadcast)? But the conversion was somehow wrong and the disk wouldn't play properly!
