Lucio Fulci's "Don't Torture a Duck" illuminates an extremely budding portrait of small town Sicily, plagued by a series of brutal murders of young boys. This surprisingly well-directed film (especially compared to later Fulci's grand festivals) is distinguished by the overall atmosphere of perversion, nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence. The soon-to-death children are portrayed as coincidentally cruel and burgeoning mere toms; Bruno's after-seduction by the naked Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) should really be seen as being highly recommended - especially in combination with my other cult lover "House with the Windows That Laugh" (1976).
