I must admit when I saw the preview of "Inglorious Basterds", I gave great expectations to me. THIS MOVIE DID NOT MAKE SORRY. <br /> <br /> Rarely when I watch a movie with such high expectations, I have or exceeded those expectations; this movie did it and more. I rarely struggle at the end of a movie I and everyone else did in the theater. <br /> <br /> I have to say I'm a bit biased towards Quentin, I grew up with "Pulp Fiction." I watched it when I was 12 and it's still my favorite and most influential movie. <br /> <br /> But since then Quentin didn't really live up to his bill. His style has become somewhat predictable instead of known, the quality was honestly not there (I never watched Jackie Brown, and then there is Grindhouse). It's up to "Inglorious Basterds." What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but to see how Leone died, Tarantino was the self-appointed guy on this masterpiece . <br /> <br /> Let's look at the movie I won't throw away. The writing was about to be a beautiful transition between the use of none but four different languages ​​in this movie. To name this movie is set in the classic Tarantino form, great scenes of rich meaningful dialogue and sudden shocking action. <br /> <br /> The play was wonderful !! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, seriously. I'm not saying so often, but frankly, the man should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie and delivered such an incredible touch and speech. He stole the show in a movie that was all incredibly impressive. <br /> <br /> I have no problem building this movie because this movie is the best movie I've seen all year and probably next year. Frankly, the more I think about it, this movie can crack my best movies of all time, and is Quentin's best movie since "Pulp Fiction." Take it from me, watch this movie. I loved, it doesn't make this movie enough justice. <br /> <br /> I watched it yesterday and I'm still blown away. Thanks Quentin from the bottom of my heart for making this movie. You're top buddy again. I can't say enough for "Inglorious Basterds!"
