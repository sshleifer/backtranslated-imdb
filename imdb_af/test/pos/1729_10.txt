Well, I grew up on Who, but didn't love a doctor since Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston loved me Who will be angry with him for the room. <br /> <br /> The writing is great, the acting fantastic, the direction (which was terrible in the old days) is just fantastic. I was very skeptical about this program and just watched it, but now I'm a big fan and love it (I have a ringtone from a Dalek scream "Exterminate"). <br /> <br /> Some of the things I love about the new program - 1) people actually see when Rose (Billie Piper) disappears from the planet. Some of the old performances that an assistant would have fled, then come home, as nothing happened, no one noticed. 2) Chris Eccleston's Dock Loves Rose Romantic or Not will be discussed, but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares for his companion. He would destroy the world if he had to save her, missing the old show - often a doctor would not care if he hadn't seen his assistants again. 3) They talk and think like real people - when Rose shows something weird or new (like strangers), she acts like a real man would - gobsmacked. I never liked it when an old show assistant, who had never seen anything strange, would just fit and adjust immediately. I want to see the surprise on Rose's face as she sees a plastic doll come to life. She gives it to me. <br /> <br /> The few things I don't like about this series: 1) Almost everything happens on Earth (London or Cardiff) and I was hoping for a more global kind of show. 2) That Eccleston left so fast, he really made the show brilliant. <br /> <br /> But I can let the few things go - I enjoy the series much more than I ever expected, so I don't care if they have things on earth. <br /> <br /> Don't take this show seriously - it's fun, it's smart, it's entertaining, but it's not a super-serious show. It's pure fun, and pure British, and I can't get enough. Watch it with an open mind, and just put your brain in neutral and enjoy! <br /> <br /> ps - don't look series 2 or later. series 1 was brilliant, the first few episodes of series 2 were good, but didn't see it when it got love and monsters. Full mess, completely destroy the display.
