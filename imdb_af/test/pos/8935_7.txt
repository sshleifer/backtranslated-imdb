Only the Brits can make such a movie and have such a delicious charm! Betty (Brenda Blethyn) wants something more alive, but she doesn't know what, when she realizes she's in love with her childhood, Boris (Alfred Molina), who owns the local funeral parlor. Meanwhile, an American mortar (Christopher Walken) who wants to put the "fun" back into funerals, moves into this small Welsh community with his assistant (Lee Evans) and Boris wants to run for his money with flashy theme funerals. . (Star Trek Funeral, Anyone?) Brenda and Boris decide to study Brenda's death and funeral, with hilarious results. A very enjoyable movie - if you're a fan of British comedies like "Waking Ned Devine", you'll love it.
