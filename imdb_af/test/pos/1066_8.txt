Forget Jimmy Stewart to relive his life and rather choose this clever comedy of error. I suppose just institutionalized sexism explains why this movie and Stanwyck's other great Christmas story, "Meet John Doe" is not respected with the same level of love as ... well, you know it's the name. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck plays a food writer for a McCall-type cloth that has laid her pumping publisher over the recipes for her recipes for years. She is a bait b. Artist to the day Morgan's sailor is pulled out of the ocean after 18 days and 6 weeks of recycling in a Navy hospital. Outlived the last year of World War II, the film was pushed with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia, but never sinking to sentimentality. Stanwyck is as always and sexy, and meets her game in base Morgan with whom it is love at first sight. Unfortunately she must be married to Gardiner's spicy architect. She's been trying for years on her farm in CT, just to deceive her boss. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakall adds a large amount of Hungarian malaprop & double-enters humor as Babs' true source of cooking. Una O'Connor is hilarious as Gardiner's stupid Irish housekeeper.
