The producers of this picture are Hungarian. It is not by crazy artistic momentum that X and Z are capitalized in the titles as the word 'isten' means 'god' in Hungarian. - By the way, David, Isten is the word for God in Hungarian ... - Hum ... Is that so? <br /> <br /> Let us consider this movie as a history of violence, science-fictional brother or sister. Both films had the strength to blow up different genres; thriller and drama in the 2005 one and "no FX ed as hell" science fiction in the one we are watching now. Everything he does has a meaning and is surrounded by details: The nod to Phil K. Dick (who wrote In The Days of Perky Pat) created a Perky Pat fast-food restaurant. Use the wink to Stanley Kubrick by 2001's name pattern; As IBM became the 1968 film HAL (one letter in the alphabet), in eXistenZ 'classic lubricant syringe', the WD-40 becomes XE-60 (one letter) when Allegra Pikul's port cleans. The nod to David Cronenberg using Videodrome's spectacular kind of formula ('Death to ...' & 'Long Live' ..) and taking another medium for the central theme of a photo (TV in Video drama, video games and virtual reality in eXistenZ In 1983, you entered a TV device, penetrating a game in 1999. Welcome to Canada!) The nod to good taste by Peter Suschitzky's cinematography, Howard Shore's music and Ronald Sanders' editing (a team that wins). For everyone born in the early 80's with a super famicom, a genesis or an arcade stick, the movie rang a clock. Enough with the nods. The storyline? "Jennifer Jason Leigh stars as a game designer (Allegra) who creates a virtual reality pattern that falls into the minds of the players, as we can see on the main page's main page. It's the story in the story. For me, this picture is over" a young couple of reality protesters who infiltrate the 'new new virtual game' presentation session to destroy his programmer, assuming what we see in the last five minutes is reality, if there is something like reality. Jason Leigh always plays a game designer in the game in which they participate and the end of the movie IS reality, with video games, freaks giggles, big furry dogs, Cronenbergy realistic plastic textures (helmets and stuff) and 9mm handguns. you see is true.They play transcendenz in an hour or so (in this game there is a game (eXistenZ) in which JJL plays the genius program of eXistenZ and Jude -Pikul - Law a marketing expert about Allegra's play), they play eXistenZ because Allegra is very worried about her pod's health (the thing you plug into your nervous system to play), she must connect herself and win Pikul in the game (Transcendenz) and back in the reality they Yevgeny Nourish, killing TranscendenZ programmer. <br /> <br /> Playing eXistenZ and TranscendenZ is about your essence, face your subconscious mind while creating a virtual reality that you have to overcome in unexpected ways to win the game (by playing the game, the girl what Allegra plays, the "reality protester" changes into Allegra, a "virtual goddess". <br /> <br /> What game would Heidegger have played to feel his abstract daine term? Really engaged in the world? <br /> <br /> And what about Nietschze (Ja Friedrich, God is dead and you know what? Willem Dafoe stands for him! - God, the mechanic -)? <br /> <br /> Yes, we are building a story for ourselves, and this thread loses us from one day to the next disintegrating people as personalities; eXistenZ's are discussing the fact that reality is the whole perception of itself by anyone who has really involved it. And we can sometimes get neat things; a perception of virtuality in virtuality in reality.
