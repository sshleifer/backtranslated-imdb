I was fortunate to record this wonderful drama, both parts, when it was originally broadcast on Masterpiece Theater. I loved it but lost it. Then, one day, while going through old tapes, found it again. I recorded it on DVD and watched and --- WOW! I still love it! The leaders are excellent and my only complaint is that I wish we had seen more Kester! What a man! And Prue. She is so strong and wonderful ... at a time and age where her tribulation and how she deals with it are considered unhappy and angry. Even her own brother tells Prue to her face that he doubts that a man will ever have her. * Suck * Unfortunately, my copy is not the biggest, with wear and tear over the years, and I would also like to own it on professional DVD if ever it happens.
