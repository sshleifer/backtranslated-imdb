hello everyone, all I have to say is that the human traffic and all its characters are so funny. I live in Australia (Melbourne) and I am finally out of the club and remain lifestyle throughout the weekend. This movie explains everything currently in the world. So precisely that I can't stop watching. I was exactly like Moff, so my friends said and I didn't even see the movie. I raced back this weekend about 3 months ago after 4 years of intense party to change my life. I was at a DVD store when I saw Human Traffic and I remember my old friends about it, so I bought it to see how all the fuss was. I was so in it I watched 4 times in a row because I couldn't believe that someone made a movie that declared everything a T. Anyway, this movie is by far the best and funniest movie I've ever seen. It's funny because it's so truth in everything that goes on in the movie. AND Moff is a legend !!! That's all I have to say .. :) Enjoy 11/10 blow my socks down on how really it was, that's exactly what happens in the world. Hr rm I jabber a lot <br /> <br /> take care of everyone ...
