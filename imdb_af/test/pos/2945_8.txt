I watched this movie at the Philadelphia Film Festival today and enjoy it overall. It's an interesting and experienced analysis of the everyday revelation that our parents' marriage was more flawed and difficult than we originally imagined. In addition, this movie is an excellent example of the process of discovering the truths about our parents' lives after their death and the associated problems. However, I found that the sound quality (recording and editing) is relatively poor and annoying. *** It may well be related to the specific theater and projection conditions. *** I am not a film maker / student or anything and do not demand a real understanding of the sound production process, but as a consumer I found the sound part of the movie distracting. Specifically, I heard many unpleasant lips sounds (especially one long interview with the younger sister), and often the background noise level was higher than the voices of people (for example, the scene a small group through the motherboards). Did anyone else see this movie, have noticed nothing of the sound ... thank you
