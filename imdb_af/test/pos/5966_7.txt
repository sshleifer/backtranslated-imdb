THE ASCENT is a very valuable addition to recent Soviet Union reissues. Director Larisa Shepitko's 1977 film explores the moral consequences of loyalty and honor in German-occupied Russia during World War II. On foot and in a snow bath, two members of a partisan Soviet group leave to find supplies, and are captured by Nazi soldiers. The focus of the movie is on how each manages or internalises his moral alternatives. One chooses dignity and integrity, while others choose to work with the enemy. In the end, however, he cannot comply with his selfish decision. The film uses a lot of slow, wide-angle pans that move to extreme proximity, and illuminates the spiritual slander in the souls of every person. It's not a good movie, but it effectively illustrates an intense moral dilemma against the backdrop of a hard and peaceful Soviet wilderness.
