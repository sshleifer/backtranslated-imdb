Bergman's regular Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann die as a village couple, Jan and Eva Rosenberg. The story started with an ordinary couple fighting and making. Jan was a sensitive person, but an escapist who set him apart from the world. Eva is a practical woman who experiences her husband's lack of ambition. Because Jan postponed to fix their radio, they were unaware of the impending war. Of course, the war arrived and the movie was a fascinating study of their transformation from one another to another by invasion, because they were abused by the enemy and their own government. <br /> <br /> There was no musical score to the movie, but the soundtrack was the war noise. In one scene, the pulsating background gun was shot, the blast and the sound of flying through planes incredible. Eventually, Bergman grew in the facial expression, as various events occurred. When something violent happened, he came out to make the audience feel rather than close. Very well done movie.
