As one of the recent top dramas by Hollywood has shot us out, this movie is exquisite where others have failed completely (especially the most underrated performance in the recent dramatic character depiction of Natalie Portman). This film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both Susan and Natalie share. They seem so natural during the movie that you will miss them for a real family. They go through so many mother-daughter conflicts in the story, it's hard not to pick up on their acting abilities. I feel that these two actress's talented performances have picked up where the story is lacking and almost too familiar (full of clich√©s) and really save the story of suffering. I would highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy one of the two actresses or such top dramas.
