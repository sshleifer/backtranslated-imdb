In Ponyo At The Cliff, which is displayed in beautiful water colors, there is definitely a face to remember the trailer, witch I didn't find so impressive, I was amazed at how beautiful and detailed it was. This film just purified me with its purity. <br /> <br /> At the center is a young boy who comes into contact with a sea creature, and that is their relationship with the film. Miyazaki is a master, both to create memorable images and to make young people communicate in a credible way with their small features. <br /> <br /> There are a few parts that didn't fit well with me. It would be an understatement to say that the music during a particular scene is "like" Ride Of The Valkyrians, it's a shame because such a precious movie, since it doesn't afford to take liberties and it has an otherwise really good scene injured. The antagonist and his back story have never been interested in me either, but I think it served more than background, anything else. <br /> <br /> Anyway, good movie. The boat ride scenario with all its images and sea creatures stands out from me. Pure and magical. And yes, craftsmanship is more intimate than computer animated, I'm really pumping for Princes And The Frog.
