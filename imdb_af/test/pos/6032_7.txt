Being a self-confident treasure addict means it's very scarce to get the chance to revise much larger-rated, credit-worthy movies. Apart from James Mangold's successful box, sign Identity; There have been no major names since the Scream trilogy again back West Craven's name on the Hollywood card. That's why Mark Malone's Last Stop ?? A mysterious thriller with blatant slasher overtones instantly intrigued me. With a decent series, including Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow and an intriguing soundtrack that even finds space for Lynn Anderson's Rose Garden, I have to admit that the first signs were very positive for this claustrophobic feature. To my best, there are only three other snowmen, unless of course you fit Demon Possessed in the category. The first cut and dice on the ice was the dry Satan's Leaf. Then came the Lisa Loring cheese festival that was Blizzard or Blood, and the enjoyable Shredder followed about fourteen years later. <br /> <br /> During an extreme blizzard, state trooper Jason (Adam Beach) fights through the snow to reach a remote lodge in the Colorado Mountains. His task is to inform guests that the road is closed and that they must stay at least one night until a road can be cleared through the dangerous conditions. This news is not going well with the suspicious cluster, which includes two brothers (Callum Keith Rennie and Peter Flemming), a truck driver who doesn't really want to hang around (William S. Taylor), a frantic couple of lovers (Winston Rekert and Amy Adamson) and Jason's ex-girlfriend Nancy (Rose McGowan). The motel owners (Jurgen Prochnow and P. Lynn Johnson) are also not happy with the news, but they offer rooms to stranded guests and try to calm the tense situation. Things are getting worse when Jason finds a mutilated body and a bag of stolen cash in the snow behind the cafe. Just like a chapter from an Agatha Christie mystery, the residents are beginning to die in the hands of a masked attacker who appears to claim the money. With so many dodgy characters to choose from and no way to leave the crime scene, should Jason try to stop the maniac before he kills again? <br /> <br /> A good mystery needs at least a handful of shady suspects, each of whom has a credible motive, a remote place where no-one can escape and a smart protagonist to help unravel the clues . Fortunately, The Last Stop offers each of those essential ingredients in a set that has its equal moments of shine and straight stupidity. The movie kicks out as the dubious personalities clash in a claustrophobic environment, which can keep the tension high over time. Malone keeps the interest levels up because every character reveals their own reasons for making the suspicion, and to be fair, the essential turn is not one that you will easily guess. In fact, I watched myself watching the movie again to see if I could get any tips I missed for the first time. Unfortunately, when the maniac is revealed to be a top psycho that wisecracks like a comic book bad man, The Last Stop forfeits a great deal of credibility. Fortunately, everything is not lost as an unexpected and brilliant orchestrated plot turn will save the final of the movie. <br/> <br /> Lights can be signed with the excellent Identity, as the two plots are almost interchangeable. James Mangold's attempt should be the best of the two, mainly due to the star bill of John Cusack and the trusted Ray Liotta. However, Adam Beach says he is doing a good job, while Jurgen Prochnow, Amy Adamson and the brilliant Callum Keith Rennie give credible support. Rose McGowan works so excitedly in this role as she probably does from day to day, and Winston Rekert started out tremendously before going completely overboard with the movie's climax. If you're an evil heavy fan looking at some bloody murders, you're going to be disappointed. The ready-to-wear psychopath appears only once and the rest of the murders are committed outside the screen. But as I said earlier, Malone's legal practice means that the tension is never too far from boiling and you can forgive the few mistakes because the positive is just about triumph. <br /> <br /> The Last Stop is worth looking for slash addicts and movie lovers. Yes, there are a handful of negative ones, but overall it's a good example of upcoming Hollywood talents. If you loved Identity, you should definitely try it?
