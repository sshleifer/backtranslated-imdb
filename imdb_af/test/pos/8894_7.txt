Owen loves his mom. Only he will love her better six foot in this dark, noisy comedy that both stars and directed by Danny DeVito. With admirable help from Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the title role. <br /> <br /> "Throwing Momma From The Train" is a great comedy, though not a good movie. It's too shallow in parts, and the end feels less organic than is being seized. But this is a brand new ride most of the way, with Crystal and DeVito using big-screen chemistry, while being their own separate comic work, at the heart of a struggling writer. (DeVito is diligent but unprocessed, Crystal is blocked and bitter). </ br /> <br /> Crystal's professor Donner believes his ex-wife stole his book (the unfortunate title "Hot Fire") and cannot write as the opening line of his next book. It doesn't come easy. He learns a creative writing class of emerging mediocrity, including a middle-aged woman writing Tom Clancy-type fiction, but doesn't know what that submarine captain is talking about; and an upholstery seller who wants to write the story of his life. Mr. Pinsky is probably the funniest character for the laugh-per-minute on-screen, a screen-bearing weirdo who regards literature as an excuse to write his opus: "100 girls I want." <br /> <br /> Then there is DeVito's Owen Lift, who calls himself Professor Donner's "star pupil", although the teacher will not read his work in class. Owen is a somewhat unusual character to die in a movie, a late-30s male child who lives with his excessive mother, Anne Ramsey. He calls him "lardass" and other engaging feelings. In any other movie we will be asked to be sorry for Owen, but "Throw Momma From The Train" stacks the cruelty of life on this sad bag for laughter and expects us to go along. This is one of the major reasons why this movie is likely to lose many people. <br /> <br /> For those of us who enjoy the humor of this character, even identify with him and the rest of what we see here as a Lark, it's not that big a piece to go with the bigger gambit taking this comedy, and asking us to watch entertainment while Owen Professor Donner's help in a plan to kill his mother. Actually, he first goes to Hawaii to kill Donner's hated ex, and then the professor tells it is his turn to Mrs. Lift to kill, "swap murders" as seen in Hitchcock's "aliens on a train." <br /> <br /> As a director, DeVito not only complements his acting performances with scene-setting, which puts the emphasis on dialogue, he makes a few bold visual explanations and throws in surprising unreality into his audience. Keeping tone (and taking things away too seriously.) <br /> <br /> Also helping matters is the writer Stu Silver, who keeps the laugh with his quote plug. "You have the size of Oldsmobiles here." "She's not a woman ... She's the Terminator." "A small murder and I'm Jack the Ripper." It's all Crystal's words, but some of the funniest lines, working only in context, but absolutely killing, are DeVito's and Ramsey's. Apparently, Silver has never written another script, according to the IMDb, and it is a pity that he had real talent for it. <br /> <br /> The best scene in this movie, when Crystal arrives at Ramsey, is actually used as a whole as a theater appearance attraction presentation, I have seen the only time I saw a movie , so promote. Owen announces the professor to his mother as 'Cousin Patty' and when Momma says he doesn't have a cousin Patty, Owen loses it. "You lied to me," he shouted, the professor's forehead with a pan. <br /> <br /> Of course, in fact, the professor will not stick out of the floor, but "throw Momma Van The train work effectively at such moments when he plays his Looney Tunes sphere for all his effort. . Of course, DeVito has not disappeared from movies, but it is a mystery why he did not really follow the promise of this movie. Maybe it's because, like 'Go Momma Van Die Train's lack of mainstream success shows, its kind of vision isn't for everyone's taste. It's too bad for those of us who can see and love it over and over.
