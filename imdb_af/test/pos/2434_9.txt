Sacchi is the best Bogart mimic ever ... dry and mad as Sam Marlowe. The music of award-winning composer George Duning, of eternity, the picnic, the world of Suzie Wong, the cinematography of perfect places, including the famous Ambassador Hotel, is right on target as well-known TV director Robert Day [Kojak, Streets from San Francisco, The Avengers] lead the most engaging group of well-known character actors through a ghost of every dark detective film each made. See it if you loved all the old movies and have a sense of humor. This one is a hoot.
