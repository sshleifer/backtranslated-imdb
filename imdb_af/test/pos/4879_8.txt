For anyone struggling with naughty, crazy or awkward children, it is an essential program to watch. It's just the best behavioral documentary, not just for tips, but for the transformations. The very attractive Jo Frost is Supernanny, with fifteen years of surprising experience, now she has a program where she shows a family where the children are very, very badly missed. Frost is the nanny who doesn't allow the kids to win. Every episode has their young children who are angry and very, very naughty, eg. throw things, constantly curse, hit family and parents and many other terrible experiences. But every episode at the end of the show, the children are converted from small monsters to lovely children by the parents (using Frost). It's just wonderful when the transformations are successful, Jo Frost is an excellent Supernanny. This has been named the National Television Award for the most popular factual program (twice). It was number 15 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. Very Good!
