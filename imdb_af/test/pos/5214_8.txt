This is one of the best TV movies I've ever seen! The title makes it so obvious and predictable, but come on, all TV movies are so! <br /> <br /> The story is fantastic. It may seem ridiculous, but it is based on an incredibly true story. Gary Cole plays a military man named Dave who feels trapped in his marriage. He leaves his wife and children and then decays his death! He can be with Alyson (Karen Sillas). How far does Dave go to keep his secret? <br /> <br /> The play is also for TV movies. Gary Cole especially likes the movie as a beautiful, smooth-talking sociopath who has an answer to everything when his wife is suspicious. Karen Sillas does the best she can as a woman who discovers that her husband is a LIAR and doesn't know what to do about it. Teddi Siddall, what I believe is Gary Cole's wife in real life, plays her role well especially when she cries about her husband's "death". Wendy Makkena adds a good contact as Alyson's sister. Linda Goranson is wonderful in her little role as Dave's mother. <br /> <br /> Predictable, but the play and the story make this movie several hacks.
