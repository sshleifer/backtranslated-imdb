I read the above comments and can't believe it! Of course this is a children's movie, this is an adaptation of a children's book !! This movie is easy to hold, try play.com or Amazon and it's very easy to get a copy! The jokes are hilarious for kids and adults, and the adventure is clean without violence! It's perfect for kids of all ages! The songs are fantastic, and yes, a little repetitive, but that's what kids need and while I see it, my little ones hear "hi hi cocalorum" all night! They loved it, a story of innocence and friendship! Very beautiful and worth watching for kids and adults of all ages!
