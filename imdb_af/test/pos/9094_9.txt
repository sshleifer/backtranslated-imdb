The entry fee for the Rock-off is worth it! Any D-fan will love this movie (although it's a bit short) and comedy from John C Reilly, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Meatloaf and Dave Grohl (just about recognizable) prove that the D is hard enough for everyone. Even Dio ... The sasquatch / mushroom scene is going to be an instant classic (I don't want to say anymore and am accused of bringing spoilers here). Fans of the original HBO series will see some of the D's early screen performances in characters like Lee and the open microphone. I just wish they had played some of the songs from the first album, and the omission of 'government sucking' from the POD album is also a shame. Other than that, these movie rocks. Obey the d!
