The 70's was a great time for horror movies. The Brotherhood of Satan is another leftover jewel. It's full on the edge with great surreal, disturbing scenes. It's also good to see Stother Martin and L.Q. Jones (who also produced) in decent roles. <br /> <br /> Some of it is a bit dated and cheesy, but the Brotherhood of Satan kicks over the race the devil and many other 70's satanism flashes.
