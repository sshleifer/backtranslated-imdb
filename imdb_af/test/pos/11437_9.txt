It's a nice movie. She is very realistic for the "wonderful world of music". I was there and did it. It shows a human element in every character and realism that no one is perfect. These amateur musicians weren't as bad players. Cleavon Little's character, Marshall Tucker, has played very well. Marshall was not a saint himself. Here he is paid to do work and he gives these guys a hard time about everything in the bus on the road there. You don't bite the hands that feed you. I find it hard to believe that a player with the jazz experience he has, claims he doesn't know any of the dixieland songs. He has a tremendous sense of predicting chord changes on songs he doesn't know. Not common, but not unheard of. He delivered a real and hard message at the end of the movie when he told the clarinet player, "It's not a religion, commitment is not enough." At that level he is correct, although I think the clarinet player could handle the job. He practices his buttocks and voice guidance music is not that difficult to read. Very enjoyable movie.
