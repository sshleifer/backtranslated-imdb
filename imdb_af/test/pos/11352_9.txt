When I watched the movie, I told myself, "such a movie can be made that way." Wong Kar Wai's beautiful poetic love story has captured me and even the movie. I have to admit it is one of the best love movies, perhaps the best of all I've ever watched. The content and shape overlap perfectly. Looking at the secret love, we see the characters in bounded frames limiting their movements as well as their feelings. Beautiful camera angles and lighting make the feelings and blues even more appealing. I want to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee on their fantastic cinematography that creates the mood for love. Also, the music defines the sadness of love that plays along the beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in despair. And, of course, the actions of the actors who make love so real. Eventually all the elements in the movie combined in a perfect way under the guidance of WCW and giving the audience the feeling called love.
