I just had to add my comments to increase the average on this one. Paul Giamatti puts it all in this one and is a hoot. He would probably say it was easy, but he was really doing a good job and had to win something for it. We've had the DVD for a couple of years and my kids (boy 4 1/2 and girl 9) will see this one over and over again and the humor is mature enough that I don't care to hear it in the background ( and I ran to the TV for the very funny parts). Simple moral message, very decent action and slapstick, "bad" adults acting goofy to take down the edge, minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes make it difficult to beat for a family standard.
