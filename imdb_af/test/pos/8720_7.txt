Pregnant bachelor Matthau, a successful dentist, joins his blonde mistress Hawn after telling her that he is a married man with three children. After attempting suicide, Matthau decides to be responsible and marry the girl. Worried that she would be a "homebreaker", bright eye, Hawn would like to meet his wife and explain everything to her. Matthau uses his trusted nurse, Bergman, to act on his wife, and that's when things really get complicated. <br /> <br /> A dangerous comedy with irresistible leads often leads to the point, but is not credible for one second. The script asks us to believe that our men are such one-dimensional villages, that it is truly out of faith. But maybe this comedy should not be analyzed too deeply, just sit back and enjoy the ever so funny Matthau, the ever so beautiful Bergman and Debutant Hawn, who basically created the stupid-blond girl role here.
