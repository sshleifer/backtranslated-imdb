The bills really look like a human factor added to the mix. Very sad. I'm sure I didn't wash him. Another thing to add is that all the women in this show aren't really beautiful women. But I don't think it's about women, though it was JFK Jr's passion. What a pity. any loss of life is a real shame. <br /> <br /> Looks like a good version of his life. I recommend it if you are in biographies and melodrama!
