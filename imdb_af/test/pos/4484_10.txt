This is one of the best movies I've seen this year! I disagree with the person who said it was boring. Of course, some people may not find this movie terrifying, but personally I spent a very good moment. This movie ranges very well into sex scenes with frightening scenes. There is also a nice sense of humor. For example, when the woman tells her husband that she has been abused by her father in her childhood, and then her husband says, "How can anyone abuse someone like you," and then try to keep her on the bed for sexual games: D Many funny! I recommend this movie to everyone, and incidentally, sorry for my poor English (I come from France).
