I consider this movie to be one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time. It has so many highly intelligent thoughts in it, that anyone who finds the movie is terrible, cannot find it and can undoubtedly recognize deep philosophical themes in all 3 Schneider films. Several universities in Germany and across Europe have conducted studies on Schneider's way of seeing things. By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on the Jazz music in Germany (maybe Europe). He is mostly inspired by the great M.Davis and T.Monk. So if you don't like him, it's okay, but don't try to convince others he might be stupid, cheap, boring or funny. For if you had to experience this opinion in a conversation, and if you were prepared to really look at the art of H.Schneider, you had to "surrender".
