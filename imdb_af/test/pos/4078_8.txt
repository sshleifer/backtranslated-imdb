I absolutely hate the idea of ​​making TV movies. For me, TVM usually means Jane Seymour or Jaclyn Smith as the mother of a sick child who dies of diseases that are difficult to treat, which is done in such a pure way that the audience does not need insects. So when DEADLY VOYAGE made a TV movie by BBC and HBO based on a real story, I remember vaguely remembering a few years previously on the TV schedules I was waiting to wait wisely. be. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> No last-strike, I wasn't surprised I was shocked. Here is a TVM that tightens you more than a large white shark. Indeed, DEADLY VOYAGE does not deserve the TV schedules, but it must be made and distributed by a leading Hollywood movie company due to its absolutely frightening prospect and what it is more - unlike PAPILLON and SLEEPERS - quite true > <br /> For those who don't know the story !!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS TO PLOT !!!!! Somewhere in the early nineties, a bunch of Afrikaners brought a French cargo ship to France to work there. Of course, this was an attempt at illegal immigration, but the truck crew had already been fined to allow illegal immigrants to go on a previous trip and no longer wanted to find any problems with maritime and immigration authorities. The crew killed the Afrikaners after they were discovered. hide them in the container. Everyone except one Africa, Kingsley Ofusu, who manages to escape the fire, but who should try to survive aboard the ship, but the problem is that the crew is hunting him and France is still away for days. <br /> <br /> To just type the above paragraph, remember how good DEADLY VOYAGE is. What a remarkable story, and again, unlike many stories claiming it, it is quite true. It was very well written, directed and acted, especially by Sean Pertwee (Why is it not the big name?), And above all, it is a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that I can still remember for six years after seeing have it for one and only time. I look forward to seeing again. <br /> <br /> But you have to ask yourself how can a TVM be better than most Hollywood action blockers that came out about the same time? Oh, stop, I just had a disturbing thought about Jerry Bruickhiemer doing a remake with Tony Scott's directing and with Denzil Washington playing Kingsley, Brad Pitt, who plays Pertwee's role, a massive artistic license with events are taken. VOYAGE is a superlative TVM rather than a poor blocker
