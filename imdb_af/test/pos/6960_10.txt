I recommend this movie. It blurs the line between the imagination of youth and everyday reality in such a seamless way that it must be seen to be believed. The actors and directors have such a perfect timing that in one scene a name is fighting, a kind of dance. I love the story line, the actors, everything. While I think there were one or two definite casey screens, the whole movie was immaculate.
