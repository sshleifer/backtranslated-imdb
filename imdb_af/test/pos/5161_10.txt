There is no plot. There are no central characters. There are no moving cameras or close-ups. In fact, this movie does not follow any of the conventional storytelling techniques used by mainstream movie. Roy Andersson's Du Levande, however, is a remarkable piece of film story. It is a pleasant look at the human psyche. <br /> <br /> From a series of vignettes, Roy Andersson has an intimate insight that makes us all human. In perfectly shaped static shots, added with the perfect harmony, but strange, music, Roy introduces us to a host of characters as they undertake their daily lives. Some who become tragic, other hilarious, are taken on a Nordic journey like no other. <br /> <br /> It's a journey to the little things we make. Instead of over-the-best storytelling or visual techniques, everything is kept to a minimum, so we only focus on the characters themselves. It focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that we make who we are; our dreams, our desperation. It is through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals. <br /> <br /> The washed-out colors and deadly-blue make-up of the characters just seem to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that they are different from them, we all live. There is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this movie, but you walk out of the theater with a sense of life. Much more accessible than its previous movie, Du Levande, is a truly inspiring piece of cinema.
