One Dark Night has a typical teenage horror movie set-up with a very unique twist. The ultra-breeding musical score and gothic / claustrophobic atmosphere greatly adds to this small movie. Meg Tilly is excellent as July and leads us through the mausoleum's maze, giving a sense of premature and loneliness. The other teens are equally effective in their roles like Melissa Newman, the ultimate heroine of the movie. The special effects are excellent, although dated. This film is highly overlooked, but it may be good so it has never been destroyed by endless persecutors. There is a big, dark magic flowing through this movie; Once packed, you really get it and you're for some fun. The double-disc DVD is available, although the original negatives could not be found to recover the movie. Maybe it will one day be located. In some ways I think the carbon specks in parts help the film, by giving it an old school responsiveness and in the end making it more unexpected when suddenly there are many consequences. <br /> <br /> The second disc has a rough cut / alternate version with a tempo-counting version of the movie that gives more explanation of the downfall of two of the girls, many Poe-ish ("The Cask or Amontillado "comes in a new way!) Also great end tension goes into the dark crib opening. Not sure it had the mainstream audiences, but definitely worked for me and extremely creepy. There is also a documentary version that is interesting because it is currently giving information about what is going on with the actors, crew, director and writer; sincere material, then current logos, discussions of shots and scenes, rehearsals. Very unique that these things exist for a small movie.
