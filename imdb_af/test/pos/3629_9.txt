It's a good movie for the whole family. I don't think many people have seen it because I ask people and they say they have never heard of it. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's son-in-law. My favorite scene is the whole movie, I can't even pick a favorite scene. My favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. If someone hasn't seen it, miss out on a great adventure. I just saw it because my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy of her. If anyone reads it, I suggest buying the movie and guaranteeing it won't be a bad decision. I saw this movie about five times and every time it gives me the same message, dogs are as smart as people just give a chance.
