An undervalued, invisible jewel. Estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in a spicy, heartbreaking way, the tension that arises between a boy in hell and back and his parents who cannot understand the emotional scars behind him no. It is no different than born on the 4th of July, as it deals with a soldier's emotional and spiritual collapse after serving in Vietnam, but one focused more on post-Vietnam politics (anti-war speeches , etc.), this one deals with a much more personal topic: family. One man's struggle to return to a life-changing experience to normal, and his parents' failure to see the change that occurred. <br /> <br /> Estevez delivers a smoldering performance like Jeremy Collier. You can feel the pain and frustration that comes under the surface. There is his real father, Martin Sheen, to hold him together. It's a journey to watch these two things apart, as you feel they are constantly trying to solve each other. It's like the presence of one another, inspired the couple to do their best, and their performances triumphed for it. <br /> <br /> Recommended to anyone who appreciates solid acting, writing and directing. And to any Vietnam war buffer. <br /> <br /> **** / ***** (8/10)
