Unfortunately, every single person I ask about this series says they have never heard of it. I remember this from my early childhood (I wasn't quite 10 when it found out). <br /> <br /> My favorite story was "A Story Short". Something about the way the "Stone Soup" story is woven into a larger story gets me every time. And then the narrator explains why he has no story to tell, and it becomes a story itself. I've always been a fan of Jim Henson, and that's just one reason. <br /> <br /> I add this DVD to myself with Labrynth, The Dark Crystal, The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride, The Last Unicorn, Willow and MirrorMask. These are all the DVDs I share with my brothers and sisters who are 6, 5 and 4 years old.
