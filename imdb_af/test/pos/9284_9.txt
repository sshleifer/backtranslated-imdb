The Chasers War on everything. 5 words I like to watch. The chaser war on everything is an excellent Australian comedy. As the name suggests, they are waging war on everything. They seem to love to beat the police. <br /> <br /> The Chaser is one of the best comedies I've seen and is the top of the line in Australia. It is on the Australian Broadcasting Corparation (ABC), where some of the best comedies are. <br /> <br /> It won the Australian Film Industry Awards (AFI) but did not win the best comedy at the lodge. <br /> <br /> Last year (2006) the hunter was broadcast on ABC on Friday night when everyone was out so nobody could see it. Well, they were moved on Wednesday evenings at 21:00 (a lot of better time) and the best thing is if I miss an episode or even just want to see it again, I can download it from www.ABC.net.au/chaser .
