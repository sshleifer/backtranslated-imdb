I agree with BigAlC - this movie actually prepared me for many cultural differences and practices before I went to live in Japan in 1993. Tom Selleck does a fantastic job here as always and the film is very humorous and educational. I'm a big fan of Tom Selleck's, and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part so that the movie can come to life so I can't think any other actor can draw. <br /> <br /> This movie features some leading Japanese actors, and it was very entertaining to see them as they were talking to Selleck. I can have the fun he had during the film's filming - Japanese an awesome place to go, whether you want to party, watch or just try to take it all.
