In this approximately 34-second Thomas Edison-produced short we see Annabelle Moore performing the Loie Fuller choreographic "Serpentine Dance" in two different fantastic flowing clothes. <br /> <br /> Moore was one of the larger stars of the late Victorian era. She was in a number of Edison Company shorts, including the one that was among the first Kinetos buying films in London in 1894. <br /> <br /> Loie Fuller suits the Serpentine Dance, which here is Moore's clothing (as well as whole frames) that is sharply hand-drawn in the movie, one of the more common symbolic devices of the quiet era predict. Presumably, the Moore films were popular enough to regularly rezone (including refill). The version now available may be a later version / remake. Moore became even more popular when it was rumored that she was appearing naked at a private party at a restaurant in New York City. She stared later in 1907 as the "Gibson Bathing Girl" in the Ziegfeld Follies. She appeared there until 1912. <br /> <br /> The short is striking for its movement frame, which becomes almost abstract especially during the "second half". It looks like a Morris Louis painting, even though it's nearly 60 years before Louis's relevant work. <br /> <br /> You should find this short on DVD on a number of different anthologies from early movies.
