I caught about the last 45 minutes of the movie, late night about 8 years ago. What a wild and funny 45 minutes. I am totally eliminated by attacks that take place in the night, in an old hotel broken down by a wreckage .... Incredible. I vaguely remember Stacy Keach, a police spokesperson, a policeman and a strong armed winner. Wino to Keach "Hey, why is this for us? ... Keach" This is my job. "You're right. They don't make them any more. Good movie. The golden 70's ... Hopefully it will be the light of day as a DVD with other lost treasures. Hickey and Boggs are one of them.
