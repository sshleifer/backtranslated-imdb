This is one of the movies that one has to start watching with an open mind. One knows it's going to be a dumb, one can look out for or be afraid of a lot of sentiment. <br /> <br /> Forget it. The movie starts with a little black humor, and then begins. From then on, it takes you on a terrific ride through the dark centers of Moscow. Well, it must be said: the unexpected twists are expected, and the dumb is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder. But this movie doesn't allow you. <br /> <br /> It's like the old gangster movies, but without any glare and in Russia. And this is one of the most important aspects of this movie: it is located in Russia. It has a huge impact on the movie, I think it does better. Everything becomes simple and basic, life is without nonsense. It could be a great potential for more movies in the future, gangster movies about the Russian mafia. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful and terrifying movie. It's horror, but you can't feel it, but sympathy for the little dumb. One last advice: don't look late in the evening if you want to sleep well.
