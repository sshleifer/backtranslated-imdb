A study of one of the well-known, physical and / or emotional states: isolation. I think the film also commented on cultural displacement. <br /> <br /> The film presents the experiences of two Turkish men (cousins). One has money (and the ease that comes from 'making it' with a steady income); the other has nothing and is looking for work. Also not happy. Don't expect a celebration of life here - it's loneliness, warts and everyone. <br /> <br /> The film manages to provide a powerful, proven traverse across the 'low lands' of the human condition. Make brave movie. Well done and well shot in my opinion (outdoor shots at the port are my own favorites). A movie that must be grateful to anyone who is not a stranger to happiness and fulfillment in life (not to mention work); everyone will find a companion in this movie. A movie with all the warmth and fitting of an ice-floe. Expect a bitter pill, not a 'happy pill'.
