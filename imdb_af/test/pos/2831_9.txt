"Only the Valiant" qualifies as a fiery good western. This Gregory Peck cavalry versus the Indian painter is a solemn suicide mission without a trace of humor. Veteran director Gordon Douglas has undergone a fierce, disturbing, out-of-court epic battle with an ideal throw of tough guys. even Lon Chaney, Jr., registers wonderfully as a powerful Arabian trooper. Apparent scenarios Edmund H. North and "A Place in the Sun" writer Harry Brown cut off the writer of Western filmmaker Charles Marquis Warren's sturdy novel about a group of racing cavaliers from any escape route that should prevent murderous rowing boats from becoming a devastating attack on helpless white settlers begins. North and Brown make the most of Warren's novel and last-minute revelation - when there is no way our heroes can survive another onslaught of Native Americans, it's a cork! This turn-of-the-century story develops an effective claustrophobic feeling in the second half of the action. Douglas and the company take study devices and make them convincing during the night hours. The sharp, black-and-white photography of the "Going My Way" kinatographer Lionel Linden gives a wilderness that is a wilderness that emphasizes its tension and atmosphere. Actor Michael Ansara, who later played the main cork in "Guns of the Magnificent Seven", is extremely effective in a small role as the hated Indian leader Tucsos. <br /> <br /> "Just the Valiant" voice story by Army Scout Joe Harmony. "This is my landmark. I am an exploration for the army. Has looked my work long ago. Behind that pass is the whole Pache nation. (There is a graphical version of the area with the Flinthead Mountains over the screen). Stuck with a bottleneck.) They swam out of the pace and murdered everything in attractions, then built a Fort Fort Fort Invincible, plugged it in, just like a cork in a bottle. But they got a little clever, one day the bottle blew the cork plum. "We showed the burning remains of Fort Invincible with a dead man stuck to a stock wall and a lance out of his mouth. Stretch stomach. Captain Richard Lance (Gregory Peck of "12 O'Clock High") and his men cook up and tie Tucsos (Michael Ansara). Joe Harmony (Jeff Corey of True Grit) wants to shoot him in the spot. Harmony points out that Tucsos is "the fella that started this whole business." Captain Lance intervened, "The army doesn't shoot prisoners, Joe." Predictably, Harmony is afraid of this prospect. "He is not a general order. He can get just as close to a god like a fella. If you shoot him now, things will be quiet. Without Tucsos they stir, the rest of the Indians will be reasonable , just as fast as you can get him alive, you will have every "pache in the area. We had three years of this, you can stop it now." Just as predictable, Captain Lance refuses to kill Tucsos, and Lance's decision to take back the Indian puts things in action. <br /> <br /> Colonel Drum (Herbert Heyes of Union Station) surprised Lance as he told Tucsos to shoot Tucsos, as it is, they need to get Tucsos to another post, all of the troops to Joe Harmony know that Tucsos asks Fort Grant to die, and the Apaches are ready in the mountains and fort we are introduced to Captain Eversham's daughter, Cathy Eversham (Barbara Payton of Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye) and young Lieutenant William Holloway (Gig Young of "They Shoot Horses, Do not They?") And they play a part in a big story complication, see Lance and Holloway both want to marry Cathy, obviously Cathy Lance wants Colonel Drum refusing to let Lance Tucsos go to Fort Grant because Drum Lance can't save Drum changes the orders and Holloway gets the mission at the last minute k and everyone is shocked. Lance has never changed an order. In addition, Lance has seen Cathy and Holloway kiss publicly, and everyone thinks Lance has transferred Holloway from jealousy. Indeed, one officer notes that the rewriting of commands on the possibility is to rewrite the Bible. Predictably, Tucsos escapes and surviving troops and Harmony bring back a dead Holloway. <br /> <br /> Although Drum expects a 400 troop relief column to come any day, Harmony points out that Lycus will attack Tucsos. Tucsos saw the fort and knew their lack of power. Lance requests to take 6 or 7 men of his choice to Fort Fort Invincible and prevent Tucsos from meeting a war party. The bottleneck in the mountains keeps the Indians from driving in power; Instead, they have to come through one by one. Lance believes his men can weaken them until the relief column arrives. Drum gives him permission and Lance chooses the worst men. All of them hate him and will kill him willingly. <br /> <br /> "Only the Valiant" illustrates the new race of military west after World War II. It's not a Gung-ho John Ford cavalry western. Indeed, Lance's own men want to kill him and this prevents troops during the Vietnam War when they relaxed their own officials. Lance carries the onus of everyone, except the few who know the circumstances that led to the change of orders to give Holloway control over the details. The black-and-white photography enhances the frightening nature of these westerns. "Only the Valiant" amounts to a final westward to the last minute delay. Obey, Peck hated this movie, but then it's not a spit-and-brush in Technicolor. As something, "Only the Valiant" lives up to its origins in Warner Brothers. It is small but significant and it is dirty with lots of drama and careless characters, almost a "dirty box" western.
