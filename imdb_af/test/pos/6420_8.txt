In a bizarre experiment, an astronaut is leaving the moon because Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a troubled translator living in Italy, wakes up from a nightmare about a moon mission mixed with an old movie that her a child scared. She also didn't remember the last three days, except for a torn photo of the hotel in her apartment. Alice is fired from her job and goes to the resort to work with the secret. <br /> <br /> Often it is considered a giant because of its director (THE FIFTH CHORD's Luigi Bazzoni) and the presence of Evelyn Stewart, Nicoletta Elmi, and Klaus Kinski, FOOTPRINTS is actually a deliberate psycho - thriller with sci-fi overtones. The horror between dream, reality, memory and movies is blurred. The disturbing story was beautifully photographed by Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro with a compassionate score by Nicola Piovani. It also combines elements of such diverse films as Armando Crispino's MACCHE SOLARI and Lucino Visconti's DEATH IN VENICE in the portrayal of alienation, isolation, hallucination and perhaps madness. Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan, who appears all the time on the screen, is reducing her Carol Hammond in Lucio Fulci's A LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN such as Alice, a young woman who has a mystery to her common sense ask. The places mirror Alice's unstable state of mind; The island of Garma, out of season, with its Arab influence and ancient ruins, is a lonely, almost mystical place that is not prepared to give up its secrets. Evelyn Stewart is a bit in the beginning as a worried friend, Nicoletta Elmi and Oscar winner Lila Kedrova are hotel guests. Peter McEnery plays an attractive biologist who helps Bolkan, and the keen Klaus Kinski is "Blackmann" in the film. -within-a-movie, "Footprints On The Moon". <br /> <br /> FOOTPRINTS is a classic case of "Guaranteed 100% Euro-rare", but not for everyone. There is only one murder to the end, but you won't see it coming when the movie starts to come together.
