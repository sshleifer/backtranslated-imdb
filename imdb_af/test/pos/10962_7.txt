What to say about an anti-settling film produced in a time of such colorless emptiness, social indifference and authoritarian satisfaction. Cassevette's first major independent film was not an ATM success and still did not receive the critical attention it deserves. I make comparisons with this wave of American independent projects that include such Beat filmmakers as Robert Frank and Harry Smith with the emerging scene known in Paris as the French new wave in the late 1950s. <br /> <br /> They discuss poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering American cultural rule; Even at this stage, this peculiar, highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking has fought against the creation of such political lexicons and bigots that kept the art of developing in the mid-twentieth century. <br /> <br /> Cassevette's film explores racial relationships and describes people as being weak in the face of love because as a culture we are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice. The great element for most of Cassevette's work is that his films have almost a minimalist effect; A mental reaction is caused by subtle character relationships, not so many images. That's why his work seems to be hanging out, as he takes a more intimate approach to the definition of characters who rely less on explicit action and more on interpretation. <br /> <br /> Although my favorite Cassevettes movie is men, this one is his most important.
