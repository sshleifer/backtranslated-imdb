I haven't seen this movie for more than 20 years, but it had such an impact on me that I remember sitting on the credits for a few minutes and then full respect. It is one of the most underrated films of the entire decade in which it was originally released. I just ordered a copy on DVD and paid for overnight shipping and can't wait for it to arrive. It is sometimes exciting, and also very dark and somewhat disturbing. It is a story of a concise relationship with regular children growing up in the city center and making one feel as if they are actually sitting on the sidelines, rather than watching a movie screen or television. Hard to explain, but this is something to be experienced. The story begins with childhood and follows the lives of the four main characters through high school and starting their separate journeys in life. The entire cast has done an incredible job and is by far the best work of Jodi Thelen's career. I hope the DVD stays with my memory and plans to watch it with a good friend on Friday.
