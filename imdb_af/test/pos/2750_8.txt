Very good "Precoder" with Dick Barthelmess, somehow reminiscent of Hawks' "Only Angels Have Wings" (1939), in which Barthelmess also performed. This film is directed by Mr. William Wellman, who was responsible for landmark aviation. Silent picture "Wings". <br /> <br /> Barthelmess is playing a pilot of devil-power aircraft, which is a blame for an aviation accident. Then he meets and falls for beautiful Sally Eilers, who participate as part of a law in a ruling Air Circus; but when Barthelmess's brother appears in the scene, there is a triangular relationship. <br /> <br /> "Central Airport" has many exciting moments and a few moving and touch-less, thanks to the great chemistry that develops between Barthelmess and Eilers (which, in my opinion, looks like many actress Dorothy Mackaill ). Tom Brown is good as Barthelmess brother, fresh from his success at Wyler's Tom Brown or Culver. <br /> <br /> Great special effects, good flying stumps, fast movie; in everything, highly entertaining. Don't miss out on TCM again.
