Judith Ivey as the exaggerated old whore is wonderful. Emily Grace the young girl. Is innocent and exciting as she learns what goes down. Excellent direction and camera. Story is dark and disturbing. Support is good. Show what happens and can happen with a crash run. Great independent movie. Small saucepan. The pace is slow and then moves well. A great movie to show your teenage daughter who has aspirations to leave early, for the open road and adventure. This movie movie has a low budget feel, but it works because of the low lives and areas to which these people move. I will never stop a resting place without thinking of this movie and checking my ties before I go.
