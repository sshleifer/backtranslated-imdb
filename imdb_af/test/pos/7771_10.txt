I watched Love Jones thirty times. This is one of the rare films depicting a love story about people who are African Americans. The dialogue was written realistically and delivered with honesty. It was so nice to see a movie where the story is centered on young professional African Americans. This is almost an untapped market. Love Jones was also fascinating. The chemistry between Lorenz Tate and Nia Long will bring memories of the past and present love. The feel of the movie is jazz and blues, bringing the sensuality of a warm creamy hot chocolate with a splash of Kahlua and Butterscotch. If you didn't guess, I loved it!
