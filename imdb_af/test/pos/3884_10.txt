Jeff Garlin's movie is full of heart and laugh. As darkened in your Enthusiasm, its shimmering son is hilarious; but in addition, we get both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, success and weight loss, it will appeal to everyone who dreams of a better life. The support throws the frustrations and joys of his life on the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship and trying again if life has disappointed us are all themes. The use of music is creative and adds to the many pleasures of this movie. Any fan of Jeff Garlin's TV look should see it!
