The best thing - and it's pretty good - about the black castle is that it's a black-and-white Forties-Gothic grabber with a murderous mad count made in some way in 1952. The star is apparently British actor Richard Greene, a capable front man reminding me of a previous version of Roger Moore. The villain is a bad score played by Stephen McNally, who does a credible job, except when driving a maniacal man. Shading in the shadows is a Boris Karloff trousers in a definite secondary role of an elderly doctor who may be the salvation of our hero. <br /> <br /> It's mid-18th century in Austria and Sir Ronald Burton (Greene) is determined to find out what happened to two good friends. They disappeared in the vicinity of Earl Karl von Bruno's castle (McNally), deep in the Black Forest. It seems that Sir Ronald and his friends were instrumental in defeating a brutal plan of von Bruno's in Africa three years earlier that had slavery and ivory. Not only did the shovel leave with failure, but with a scar on his face and a black plaster, he now wears a devastated eye. von Bruno promised revenge, and he seemed to be partially successful. So under a false name, Sir Ronald is arranging a hunting invitation from the Earl, and we are going through a dark journey of storm and wolves in the county's castle. It is an enormous mass of stone doors and corridors, shaded stairs, large fireplaces ... and flu sections that lead to dungeon cells, a torture chamber and a large pit full of sobbing crocodiles. It is also filled by the Count's lovely, blonde, sensitive wife, Elga (Paula Corday, who is sometimes billed as Rita Corday) and played by the Count's two good friends by the two actors we know of the fifties who specialized to be smart. a costume, John Hoyt and Michael Ansara. There is a dangerous leopard hunt, forbidden kiss, knuckle servants, cracked wood signs and in the cold wind and poison in a cup. Not least, Dr. Meissen (Karloff) has filled a special scale with a drug that will slow down the bodily functions that seem dead. The risk is that ... If the person wakes up ten hours later, he will hope he is not already nailed to his chest. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, for all the clich√©s, the Black Castle remains happy. The movie takes itself seriously, but it becomes capable enough to hold our interest, even though we come back with a smile as we look. It is even reassuring to realize that there are strong echoes of the most dangerous game. When Burton realizes how crazy Bruno is, he becomes even more determined to bring Bruno to accounts. And of course he fell to Elga. von Bruno, furious, but clever and capable, is a man who loves the hunt and is chased by death. Hollywood's second creative rule has always been: "If you steal, steal it from the best." This is the first creative rule, of course, is: "When you steal, steal it from the best and then turn it into liver sausage." The Black Castle is a nice bite of Austrian Braunschweiger.
