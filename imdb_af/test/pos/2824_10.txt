OK, first, to all the enemies: Get a life! I don't see why you even bother to put on these boards, of course, if you know nothing about theater, robots or people. <br /> <br /> This movie has important lessons for all of us to learn about gender, stereotypes, relationships and DESTINY. Really, we are all robots, programmed to respond to certain stimuli without thinking. How many times have we seen a sunset and made a few comments without thinking about it? I say THANK YOU Aqua (brilliantly played by Bernadette Peters) to let me stop and think about the wonderful power of Mother Nature. <br /> <br /> It is only when Val and Aqua reject their programs to understand their true desire - to find love and to flee the factory in search of a creative life. This movie should be compulsory to watch in prisons - just think of the dreams and hopes it can inspire in prisoners. Maybe they can overcome their "bad" programming and join the rest of us in a crime-free world. <br /> <br /> We can all learn a lot from these robots. I'm a better person for Heartbeeps.
