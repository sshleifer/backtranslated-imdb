Who doesn't remember The Muppet Movie ??? <br /> <br /> Kermit the Frog is now an American culture icon. Which child does not appeal to this character? <br /> <br /> As the first real Muppet movie, the movie simply called The Muppet Movie has performed very well. Kermit advises the Hollywood agent and goes out of his home weapon to respond to the ad. Along the way he met a pig, a bear, chickens, a rock band and some other quality dolls. Look for decades of upcoming events like Madaline Kahn, Steve Martian, Richard Pryor, Mel Brooks and many more. I grew up watching this movie and I loved it.
