After reading that, "By the time of its release in 2002, its $ 47 million budget, or FRF 327 million, has made it the most expensive French film ever made. However, Astérix et Obélix contre Cesar (1999) had a budget of $ 48 million, or FRF 274,620,000, which is believed to have made the most expensive French film. "I found the reason why I found this movie as one of the most beautiful and colorful of all I've ever seen. I loved the scenarios, the clothes (especially those of Cleopatra) and the atmosphere of the movie! It's so happy and cheerful! I found the jokes clever and hilarious, and I have to consider this movie in all my favorite comedies! <br /> <br /> The movie is also excellent, with Monica Bellucci (who is very nice like Cleopatra) Gerard Depardieu, Christian Clavier, Jamel Debbouze (who I first saw in Amélie Poulain!) <br / > <br /> I even recommend this movie to people who don't know Asterix and Obelix comics. You're going to have a lot of fun! :) <br /> <br /> aka "Asterix e Obelix: Missão cleópatra" - Brazil
