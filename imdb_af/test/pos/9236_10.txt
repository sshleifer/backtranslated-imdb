After watching a Texas Languages ​​or Treason, you feel a renewed aversion to the nature of the Hollywood animal. Within the interviews and conversations of everyone involved in the project, there is a common sense of conspiracy and rebellion that includes backgrounds, social classifications and even geography. This can be attributed to hard work on the turbulent commitment to the project and the love of the story of the original film, and the complete creation of vacuum that it is the creator. The scale of people involved in "Waldo's Hawaiian Holiday" was incredible to me, at no budget, no glory production. There were no trailers or craft services, no facilities, and yet everyone was involved. If nothing ever comes out of this project, Antwerp Productions has laid the foundation for being a serious, honest company that will never lie down, take it or sell it and just make a movie for the money. I would like to see any L.A. director go through the guerrilla process to get a shot. More realistic real life cinema is missing at this time of CG and green screens. The masses can enjoy their amusement spoon which they enjoy in cakes-green censored calm pieces, but there is a large group of people in the world who share the views and insights of the filmmakers who still make films for the love of the material. or love for storytelling, not DVD sales or boxing. I loved this documentary and I hope the IFC has the cahones to pick it up and air it so maybe, one more person might decide to pick up a camera and make a real life movie so we even consider a temporary understanding that everyone is the same everywhere, and anyone can be a true narrator everywhere.
