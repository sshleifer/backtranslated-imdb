This movie has remained in my mind for many years as one of the best movie mysteries I've ever seen. The acting is wonderful. I saw it twice and am still surprised at some parts. I want a copy so I can play some parts over and over. I'm interested in buying a copy of this movie, but can't find it anywhere. I wonder if anyone has any suggestions to find it? I tried e-bay, Amazon.com, internet searches, and I was completely frustrated. I didn't see it on Turner Classic Movies, nor on American Movie Classics, and I even asked fliers in our community asking if someone had a copy.
