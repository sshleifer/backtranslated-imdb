I watched every version of this play I can think of, including several on stage, and Sir Derek Jacobi is absolutely the best Hamlet I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> He has the most wonderful voice for theater performance, and his expressive face will take you on a wilderness of emotions throughout this play. The way he delivers his lines takes you through madness. He (as Hamlet) can be loving, gentle and gentle in a moment and in another moment rage against his life. You believe he has pain, you believe he is angry, you believe he is not a little crazy. You believe he is Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Of course, of course, thank you to Shakespeare, but without an excellent actor getting the words from the page to the stage doesn't really matter. how well written is a play. <br /> <br /> If you like Shakespeare, you should definitely see this version. If you don't like Shakespeare, you should definitely see this version. You will get a new appreciation for Shakespeare if you do. Sir Derek's nuanced performance will leave you breathless.
