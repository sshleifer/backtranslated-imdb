One of the most successful shows in television history is back. Now I admit I never came to the original show. Okay, so I never looked at it. But the new show is impressive. <br /> <br /> This weekend, Sci-Fi introduced the first two episodes, "Rose" and "The End of the World". We meet Rose, a twenty-something clerk driven by remote mannequins. She is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself the doctor. Using the internet, she finds a conspiracy buff that warns her that where the doctor goes, follows death. When her geeky boyfriend Mickey is replaced by an indignant, the doctor tells her about a plot to use the earth as a breeding ground for more of these plastic samples. The doctor fought over space and time and disguised himself in a Tardis who disguised a 50's. style police oproepkas. <br /> <br /> She helps him save the world - there won't be a show - and decide to join him. But if he puts her life at risk, he was confused and asked if her business was worth the risk. <br /> <br /> Although the special effects are similar, and some of the screens are a bit bumpy, "Doctor Who" is (after two episodes broadcast in the US) a clever, well-written work. Apparently, the second season has already broadcast in the UK, so I predict the same success here.
