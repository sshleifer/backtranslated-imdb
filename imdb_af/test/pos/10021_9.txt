A pearl of a silent era cartoon --- it has been rediscovered by CARTOON NETWORK, and has probably been broadcast for the first time in decades, as ever. <br /> <br /> What makes it so enjoyable is the varied combo ... Douglas Fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitoes; Will Hays visits as 'boss' of static studios; as well as appearances by Chaplin, Keaton, and William S. Hart. The image of chewing gum that clarifies the population's shoes (a money idea for Felix's post-bankrupt shoe-salesman boss) cannot be described. It must be seen. A great cultural gem.
