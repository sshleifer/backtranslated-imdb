It was a very good surprise. I got up late last night and couldn't sleep. I didn't think twice, I turned on my TV and HBO was on, and this movie just started. Luckily I saw the whole thing, and I'm very happy I did. Because this movie was very good. The actors were well-cast, and they did a surprisingly good job. Kris Kristofferson delivered a solid performance, there was a lot of dust behind his lines. This film made me realize he was a good actor. Brian Keith was great as his father, as Trey Wilson played the Colonel (it was Trey Wilson's final role before his untimely death. It was bad, he was a quality actor and looked like a good guy). Jobeth Williams also did a good job as Kristofferson's American wife. Regarding the direction, I had no idea. Franklin J. Schaffner was the director until I read the review in Leonard Maltin's film guide (that was the last movie he ever made). Now I understand why this movie was so good. Schaffner also directed Patton, a really good movie (I didn't see his other big movie, Papillon). Looking at "Welcome Home," I told myself, "This director really knows what he's doing," because he didn't know that Schaffner had done it. There's a very nice scene in a Thai orphanage, enough to bring tears into my eyes. Not only is it sensitive, but it is also very economical and robust. There was nothing wasted in Schaffner's attempt. The writing was one of the reasons why this movie is so good. The author does not weigh the actors with too many lines. It is very simple but very effective written. It just shows you that many can be said with few words. This movie also made me proud to be an American, and it showed you how beautiful ALL people are.
