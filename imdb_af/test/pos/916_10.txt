"Rouge" is part of a trilogy, but many stand on its own. It is not a persecution of any kind. The end, which I will not disclose, links the three movies together, but not to see the other two does not make it too confusing. <br /> <br /> This movie amazes me because it is so saving, so subtle and simple, but is as effective, emotional and intellectual as any big-budget spectacle or all-star melodrama. Kieslowski examines the phenomena of coincidence and fate. Both themes are loosely woven into the story. The movie is quite a puzzle, but the message is pretty simple: Everything happens for a reason. Love is in all our lots, as long as we open ourselves to it. The title, "Red" refers to the French flag, where red represents "brotherhood" or brotherhood. The color dominates the footage of the movie. I tend to think of it as love or passion, or the blood of life. It's great when a movie allows freedom to do so;)
