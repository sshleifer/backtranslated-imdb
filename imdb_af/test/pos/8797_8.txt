This movie features a brilliant soundtrack and beautiful acting of some pretty unknown faces. I especially like the Welsh docklands bath boy characters in what pushes like American rappers acting hard. The villain between Jip and Koop is brilliant. They appear as best friends, almost as if they were true in real life. I have experienced some of the things in this movie and let me tell you first hand, these people have not acted (especially with Jip and Koop talking and smearing). Danny Dyer is priceless as Moff's 'party prescription' dealer and has the funniest lines in the movie ... <br /> <br /> "I am happiest when I feel my lemon juice, you get me .... yes , I knew you wouldn't let me down, I knew it !!! "
