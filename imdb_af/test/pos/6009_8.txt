We all know pieces of Gulliver's voyages. Small people, yes, sure. Liliputians. Also giants, some of us can remember. Some may remember the word yahoo coming from here. That's where it stops for most people. <br /> <br /> Swift's book is ubiquitous in school libraries. This is where I first read, and there were many people who read it for the last time. It was treacherously lightly written, like many of the old adventure books. Children can read it. Yet it drips with satire, black and uncompromising. This is something I think most screenwriters forget about adjusting this movie. <br /> <br /> However, this movie remembers. Our hero, Ted Danson, gives credible and serious action, as the world-oriented man who is thrown to mysterious lands is our own. Gulliver's travels criticize everything. Theorists, scientists, government, communities, ethnicity, humanity itself. Little is spared, and most of the satire is just as fresh today. <br /> <br /> While very faithful to the story, the movie also ventures new angles, all of which work well. The author author deserves all the credit for management to balance well between time and activity (it's not boring, that is). <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are far beyond a TV movie. With a little marketing, this movie would have done well at the checkout. All the fantastic worlds Gulliver visits are well made, explain in detail and often very funny, much like Swift's book. <br /> <br /> Actors are all benefits as it is a British production. Mary Steenburgen stands up with James Fox's dr. Bates, the chillingly brutal doctor who, just like Nurse Ratched, wants the patient's best. <br /> <br /> So, a modest suggestion, if you ever get the chance To get this movie, do it. This is a real surprise.
