There are many, much older movies that are deserved to be transferred to the DVD format. This is certainly one of them. An Anthony Quinn triumph! Movie scores show the victims of Nazi atrocities before and during the war, but I don't think one of them has gone into the psyche of the victim and predator as well as this one. Anthony Quinn was really a man for all seasons. He had the ability to portray the humblest of creatures without any human appearance to a creature of extreme animals and deducted it as credible to the audiences who watched without thinking about what they had just seen! Actually one of our greatest artists. He is missed.
