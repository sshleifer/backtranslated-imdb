Having watched the show for about four weeks, which is enough to get a feel for the show, I think it shows potential. While other programs are being lent out (which are not sci-fi these days), and the characters are stereotyped, I like what they do with the stories. There is some continuity with plot development and character interaction / relationship building, despite the substantial modular nature of each episode. There are some science-related topics examined as well as character secret / poor revelations. It also added some comedy to the show, something I'd love to see more of a "serious" sci-fi. All in all, it makes good balance, which can appeal to larger groups of people, unlike the Star Trek vs Babylon 5 debates, I had many participants and witnesses. The visual aspects of the show are more than adequate and well budgeted for a first season. The play is acceptable, and I'm curious to see how well the actors grow their characters from their printed stereotypes. I see enough positive and potential to stay interested to see where the show wants to go ...
