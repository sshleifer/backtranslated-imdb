Surviving series on life in Oz - an experimental prison where they are trying to rehabilitate prisoners. There is gay sex, rape, torture, mutilation, murder, humiliation, tons of male nudity ... all in your face and power. <br /> <br /> It's also easily one of the best written plays ever put. On TV and almost all the actors are just fantastic. As it was on the cable, there were no restrictions on what they could say or show. There are many racist remarks flying here, but it is for all races. In fact, the white characters come out very badly (especially the Aryans) and the black characters come out better (the peace-loving Muslims). The Hispanics do not have a strong role and there are NO Asian prisoners. All the prisoners seem to be bumpers and willing to kill anyone at a moment's notice - but you still find yourself sympathetic to some of them. Even the guards, counselors and doctors in prison have serious problems. <br /> <br /> I recommend it BUT rent it - don't buy it. I have the whole collection and, to be honest, I don't think I ever want to see it again. It's amazing TV, but so dark, dark and depressed. Guess I have to sell it all online. <br /> <br /> I give it a 10.
