I knew as soon as I saw the first trailer for Black Snake Moan, I had to see it. I was not in the slightest disappointment in the film, which was written and directed by Hustle and Flow's creator Craig Brewer. It tells the story of a broken bluesman and the nymphomania he intends not only to cure for her, but also his own ... but that is so much more than that. It's complex and rich and it drives you into a sturdy, tough, sultry blue Memphis without making you feel like you need a bath. <br /> <br /> The characters are (mostly) versatile and very well written and executed. The accent and the dialogue were conveyed flawlessly. However, there was one weak link in the chain: Justin Timberlake. The best thing I can tell him is that he can cry. It's a rare male actor who can cry convincingly. However, Justin's Ronnie was flat, but as an actor he tried very hard. I will definitely give him another chance. <br /> <br /> Lazarus and Rae (Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci respectively) have good chemistry and great respect for each other. This is one of those films where it doesn't matter how good one actor is if the other one is not the job and luckily both actors were the task. <br /> <br /> The music was as good as you'd expect, especially when Mr. Samuel L. Jackson singing the blues. Phenomenal. <br /> <br /> On the technical side, everything was as far as I could see. It was well edited, well shot, and well mixed ... everything was wonderful. The character and set designs were just right, the casting of the supporting characters (even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards) was on the point ... Was crazy about it.
