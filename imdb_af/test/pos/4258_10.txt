At the height of the Black Power movement, African American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) is announced as chief executive of a corporation after the white chief executive dies (the white executives all hate each other and cannot decide who previous CEO). Once in control, he decided to make it into a militant organization. <br /> <br /> I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did, but he did it! "Putney Swope" is the ultimate jab on America's power structure. This is the kind of thing that seems to have come from Richard Pryor's thoughts. It's a comedy classic in every sense of the word. A true masterpiece. Hilarious.
