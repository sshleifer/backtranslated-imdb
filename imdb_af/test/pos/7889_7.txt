WARNING: Read this entry after watching the movie! As "Easy Rider" released a year earlier, "Joe" tries to illustrate what happens when the counterculture and mainstream (though right-wing) meet America: a violent end is coming. Although this film is usually a slow-moving, traditional "old-fashioned" American morale to the 60-year-old do-feel-good-lifestyle, it is also a higher class commentary on the lower middle class and their inability to meet in the middle as illustrated when the Comptons meet the Currans. Boyle's Joe represents a generation who held in the 1940s and 50s, where a commission for Mum (or jap or hippie) died for the case, as long as it helped and saved America. Joe and wife Mary Jo are clearly the archetypes for Archie Bunker and Dingbat wife, Edith. This movie - which will be known forever because it is violent (but not bloody - no blood is seen). However, the end is uneven. Joe (verbal), the hippie generation (literally), then (literally) lies with them to infiltrate their numbers to find Compton's daughter - when it was clear that he had to repel the idea, but the separatist idea for sex reasons. When he is betrayed by theft (read: trust from the older generation to the new generation), he knocks out an inexorable chain of murder. Perhaps it is due to the Tarantinos of Hollywood that the viewer expects the bloodstream death in the final tones, but the bloodless shooting is looking for any kind of impact or realism. "Joe" is not a good movie, but it is an interesting show of class and culture alienation and the animalistic underlying extremes of the gender gap.
