This program is a favorite of our family, and we feel it MUST be released on DVD this season! The title of "Promised Land" is very pleasant because it is a positive statement about all the good that remains in this great country and the people living in it! It is a "God Bless America" ​​type program with inspirational stories, old-fashioned values, earthly characters, truth and encouraging messages, beautiful scenery and well-written humor and drama. It's a show that the whole family can enjoy and benefit from - without worrying about bad language, "mature" themes, roughness, violence, etc. We've always been blessed when we finished reading an episode and can't wait to see everyone over and over when they're finally released on DVD!
