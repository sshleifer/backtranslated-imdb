This movie is a masterpiece to put it simply. Especially the double exposure of cameraman Julius Jaenzon. It is made proficient even with the standards we use today seventy years later. Viktor Sjöström, the director, also plays the main character, David Holm. On the night of New Year's Eve, he is murdered in battle and the legend says the first one to die in the New Year should work as a soul collector in the form of a transparent ghost. There is a new soul collector every year. <br /> <br /> The scene in which the alcoholic, David Holm, rises from his dead body (as the soul leaves his earthly body) in the church yard (where the battle took place) is a real award for " a movie ceiling. Even when the current soul collector comes with his horse and car, it is a beautiful but also a scary scene. David Holm recognizes this soul-gatherer as a drinking friend of earlier life. It is now his turn to take over. Just like Scrooge in Dickens's story, a Christmas story, David is shown what led his life and actions for the people around him. <br /> <br /> The movie is about the danger of drug abuse, in this case alcohol. It is based on a book by Nobel laureate Selma Lagerlöf. Viktor Sjöström has filmed a few more of her books, but this is the one with the best outcome, perhaps because this book is the most cinematic of them. <br /> <br />
