I just discovered this dark 70-year-old horror movie while browsing YouTube. For a low budget effort, it has very compelling moments in gradual pacing, leading to the surprisingly shocking finish. While there is one woman constantly taking off her shirt, the fact that she is a nymphomania makes the scene important to the story and there is one scene with the curly young man trying to trick her into tackling me before he withdrawn. shouted her crazy. The young nurse coming in and renting lures herself and I'm not surprised that she played for the cover of Playboy. Some characters are very annoying and some scenes seem ridiculous. For the most part, however, don't look in the basement (this is the title I saw on YouTube), offers enough drama and chills for an entertaining B movie.
