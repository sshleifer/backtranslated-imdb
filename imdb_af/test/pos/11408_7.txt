A hundred miles away from the scene of a grizzly murder in the small town of American, Jill Johnson (Belle) settles in for an evening of babysitting. With the kids asleep and a beautiful home to relax, she closes the door and sets the alarm. But when a series of fearless phone calls from a stranger say she's going to test the kids, Jill panic. Fear of terror when she found the calls. And what the police find is changing the perfect baby seat in a 16-year-old's worst nightmare. There are no other main players in this movie. Camilla Belle is the star with a cute face. The day she arrived at a baby seat, she really had no idea what was really waiting for her in hell. <br /> <br /> If I was in a house like the one that Jill was, I'd explore everything around. The fridge will be the first person I will look at, but I'm a man and I don't have babysitting. But what I found was the size of the house. I thought, would the movie be the same if the house wasn't that big? Anyone can get lost in that big house, but this movie needs a massive size house. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle has a cute face, a perfect smile, but it's like a movie like this, the main actress needs someone with experience. I didn't find Camilla so good. I don't know maybe, she thought it could be her breakthrough role. I love her, she is a cute girl, but someone to play a role in this movie has to be someone else to take it. <br /> <br /> This movie was not scary. I also found this movie more than a "chick flick". I think the only reason it was released during the SuperBowl weekend was that the guys stay home and see the game and the girls go out to see it. It also looks like a kind of movie when girls will enjoy more than guys. But I liked this movie, but for what it is. Girls just like a fright or scream. It was just a nice, fine movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone can keep this movie. There are many PG-13 horror movies that never fail. It was on its own level. So I like this movie. I give it a 7/10.
