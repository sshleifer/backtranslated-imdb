It's a movie about a man who thinks everyone is Jewish. It is a movie about Lawrence Newman, who lived in Brooklyn in World War II in the 1940s. One day, when he gets himself glasses, people think he's a Jew. And just because he looks like one. And he lives in a very anti-Semitic environment. So some people start treating him like dirt. They make the judgment, a Jew, of Larry's new wife, Gertrude Hart. This makes their lives unbearable. Only Slave's Focus (2001) is a fairly good look at anti-Semitism. It's a problem that doesn't go away. The film is based on Athur Miller's novel, which I admit, I didn't read. But the movie is really good, so I'm sure the book will be too. The actors do good work. William H.Macy is always good, and his work like Larry Newman is brilliant. Laura Dern is Gert Hart and she is wonderful. Meatlap is almost scary as the neighbor who wants the Jews in any way necessary. David Paymer's character as the Jewish shop owner. Mr. Finkelstein is the most sympathetic in the film. Easter is the perfect choice for the role. One of the greatest scenes in the end is when Mr. Finkelstein and Newman are fighting those Nazi-like people with baseball bats. They join together for evil. The Christian and the Jew.
