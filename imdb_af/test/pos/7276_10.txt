If you like subtle psychological dramas / thrillers, this is a movie for you. Those who want to see an ordinary sex-'ri-erotic thriller, will not understand this movie, as Colin Firth obviously did when he called it "garbage". But Jennifer Rubin is the real star of the movie anyway. She is such a brilliant and beautiful actress! Along with the twist and turn story, it becomes more and more psychological and makes you think about yourself, the wonderful direction, photography and especially the music makes this movie a masterpiece. Also the small parts are very good, especially Belinda Waymouth is great in her small scene. I hope it will be released on DVD soon, and a soundtrack album will be a dream come true!
