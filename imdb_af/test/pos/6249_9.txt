One of the strangest, frightening, terrifying horror movies coming out of the 1970s, "Tourist Trap", even through the loose, free wheels, convention-corrupting "anything goes" standards of its time tariffs as a real asset. Still, it is a very strange picture - a masterfully mounted unpleasant atmosphere of pervasively off-kilter supernatural fear, which comes out of the get-go as powerfully creepy and is becoming increasingly impenetrable and frightening as the film progresses and offers plenty of shocks from a few scattered moments of surreally beautiful dream-like elegance and ending with a bitterly ironic, shattering nihilistic note with a haunting final image that is difficult to shake - making it such a unique and particularly humiliating experience. <br /> <br /> Five teenagers traveling through the deserted California desert by car are getting lost. They stumble across "Slausen's Lost Oasis", a seedy, rundown roadside dive that was one part gas station, three parts crumb museum, and all parts ratty and forerunner. The closed, seemingly unkind and innocent owner, Slausen, became an outraged psychic killer with deadly telekinetic powers. Slausen brings his freaky assortment of awkward human mannequin to life and takes the kids one by one so he can add them to his ever-growing collection of victims. <br /> <br /> Director David ("Puppet Master," "The Arrival") Schmoeller each time distorts the last ounce of his stress from the pleasantly ambiguous and open writing he wrote with J. Larry Carroll. (The script's stubborn refusal to give a rational apology to all the bizarre things that occur throughout the film is often misinterpreted as one of the main weaknesses of the film. This is actually the film's main force, which makes the picture horror, anything and everything - can-happen, the general logical condemned quality of a real nightmare comes terribly on life that would never have been achieved if there were some sort of credible explanation offered for what happened.) Pino Donaggio The stunningly cool, underestimated score, Nicholas von Sternberg's shadow cinematography, and Robert A. Burns's dirty, cramped production design add to the film's deeply disturbing mood. Excellent performances are another significant plus, with the beautiful Jocelyn Jones (Ellie-Jo Turner in "The Great Texas Dynamite Chase"), especially fine and personal as the most resilient and sympathetic of the endangered teens. Even Tanya Roberts does well like a happy lass that has a knife in her head in the head. Indifferent and unusual, "Tourist Trap" is worth a visit.
