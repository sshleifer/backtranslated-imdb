The viewer who said he was disappointed seems to be missing the point here. This is an excellent film, excellent and realistic depiction of a Jewish middle-class family in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, from long ago. The nuances are perfect and I felt the decisive of all was better. I especially found the play of Judith Ivey, just perfection --- especially the speech she has with her daughter when the daughter comes home one night. This scene was worthy of Oscar. But really, all the acting was good. I recommend this movie. It's a fun, family movie and great to see a lovely middle-class family living in Brooklyn so long ago. See it and you'll be glad you did it. Has some very funny lines and the Eugene character is a real comedian - very funny.
