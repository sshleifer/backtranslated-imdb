My dad previously worked in the secret information in the DIA and he is the one who mentioned this movie to me. When I was a child I always asked him what would happen if he gave away secrets and he recommended this movie. <br /> <br /> In the movie it really puts 2, almost completely different FRIENDS! In a mess, they never really knew what the outcome would be. The snowman, Daulton, really cracked me because the film portrays him as just a drug storyteller, who didn't know what he was arguing for, and in the movie, he seemed to have the worst of everything. The falcon, Chris, is just a man who wants to express his feelings on the US government in a very radical way. <br /> <br /> For film lovers this is a must see !!!
