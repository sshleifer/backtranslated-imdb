This movie will send cold fever on your spine, even if you don't understand German. I first saw it in my German high school class and found it for $ 5 at my local Wal-Mart. I've seen it at least 20 times since * it's just a few years ago * and it's great to watch a movie night. The plasticized bodies are usually actually used by Body Worlds. This movie was a very lashes. A German dr. * Named dr. Death * has begun plasticizing human bodies for display and Body Worlds is now a tour, now in Chicago, IL. Many people opposed this and so a great German horror movie was made. I personally love this movie and will recommend it to anyone who likes thriller slasher movies.
