A refreshing black comedy with some of Australia's best. Just like Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels caught the funny side of London gangsters, Two Hands snatches the Sydney underworld. It wouldn't be so funny if it wasn't so close to the leg. <br /> <br /> An Australian classic. If Australia can pull more rabbits like this out of its hat, it can actually be a movie industry worth keeping.
