New York murder is one of the better chan mysteries and I've seen it for the first time. <br /> <br /> In this one, Charlie Chan is visiting New York to attend a police convention. At the same time, people who are involved with aircraft plants are being murdered and he decides to help with his 2-year-old son. These murders are evident from the effects of sabotage at the aircraft plants and Chan helps identify the killer ... Charlie Chan is well played by Sidney Toler and the rest of the movie includes Sen Yung as his number 2 son and Marjorie Weaver. <br /> <br /> I'd rather love this mystery and it's worth having if you like this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
