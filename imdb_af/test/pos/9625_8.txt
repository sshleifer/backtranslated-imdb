This is my favorite Kung Fu movie. It has a very authentic taste, seasoned by a terrible music score (from traditional Chinese instruments, I think), and some wonderful exaggerated melodramatic moments contrasted by heavily hit comedy. Indeed, while trying to create their own "Western" (ie Cowboy) movie genre, the Chinese have a whole new animal characterized by kung fu struggles and the accompanying sound effects. <br /> <br /> The story of Five Fingers of Death is simple, a story of revenge (to kill a loved one) and the pursuit of the main character to master the "iron-fist technique" that Enable him to bring about holy vengeance on his enemies. There is even a love interest, though uncomfortable, polite (found in most Chinese films of the period). However, the end result is huge and much more authentic than any Bruce Lee movie.
