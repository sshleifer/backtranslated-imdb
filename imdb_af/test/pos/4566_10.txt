I watched the movies to see Claudine and love the sound and the soundtrack every minute. Diahann Carroll was never better than in this role. We have Mrs. Carroll saw what her body looked like, barely saw her, barely saw her, smoked a cigarette, drank beer and she cursed. When this movie was shown on TV and eventually cable, I would call my friends to see it. Just the soundtrack from the start of the movie is incredible all thanks to Gladys Knight and the Pips. We saw a black woman struggling to raise her children, with teenage pregnancy, and daily life met a man she later learned, challenged herself. Finally, this movie made it on DVD and earned it well.
