I work at a nuclear power station, so I get a kick out of these responses. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I do. Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades_Nuclear_Generating_Station and you can see where I work. <br /> <br /> I couldn't think of a safer business to work with. We are required by procedures to sign up. Cuts events as small as paper. Any issue identified as a potential concern for nuclear, radiological or industrial safety is reported immediately in the corrective action process. <br /> <br /> Bottom line is that nuclear power plants in the US are working with security in the front of their minds.
