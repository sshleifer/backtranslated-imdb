I loved this movie well and I shared the romance with COBY and loved the girl. Rachel (?) 4 has her name .... I was honestly interested in that one. I loved them in the movie. I'd like to see more movies. but don't end up saddened where they can't be 2gether! = (It screamed me, but the romance between them. The plot of the trauma was all right.) I was just in Colby and Rachel. ha ha =) Everything about this movie was excited about the kind of holding you to your seat. for I was sure. Honestly, my only personal will be more focused between the couple (Colby and Rachel) and at least a decent end. I hated the end, a better one could have thought more, not the fact that he had forced him to death and Rachel had a son. The end would have killed the movie.
