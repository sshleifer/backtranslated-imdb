It is important and just right to remember that, by the time this short was produced, a war existed between the United States and the Empire of Japan. Add to that the tremendous bad will that created the beginning of the war, as well as the Bataan march and other incidents and the only thing surprising about this brief and others is that there were no more of them. Another thing: my only problem with this short is that it seems to be funny, but it is not. I'm not sure someone who goes with it really tries to make the jokes work or even care. It would have been much better if they did what Disney did with Education For Death and was quite serious. But this short becomes a bad rap and should not be judged from context. The times were different and this is an important consideration. Anyone who spends energy to save the world of a sixty-year-old cartoon should take a step back. Just like me, spend energy defending the same cartoon. It should be available to interested parties, even if it is not in wide circulation. Not a pretty cartoon, but sometimes life isn't nice. recommended
