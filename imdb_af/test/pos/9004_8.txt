Like most sports films that have come out in the past, this movie is similar to the fact that it is based on fact. What makes this film apart is that it is a rugby team, a sport not too many Americans know of. Put it aside, this movie is a very rewarding piece of film noir. It reminds me of "We're Marshall", but with a smaller budget and an independent film. This is a good effort by director Ryan Little to bring us a story about a rebellious teenager played by Sean Farris (Never Back Down), like Rick Penning, who finds himself in a strange place, both on and off outside the field. Despite some plot lines holes, this movie has heart, each of its viewers rewarded with good characters with which we can identify. Also good performances by supporting actors Gary Cole as coach Larry Gelwix and Neal McDonough as coach Penning (Rick's father). I felt like I was watching movies through many different emotions. In the end, I was left with a sense of faith in humanity and a hope for the future for my children, especially if there were coaches there like Gelwix.
