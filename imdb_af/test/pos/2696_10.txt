In a time of bad, if not terrible, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is, in my opinion, one of the top 5 comedy shows of all time. Nothing is as good as Married to Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to name someone as a comic genius. These guys really understand what's funny. I could see ten episodes of Seinfeld and will not get half the laugh to see KOQ only once. Other funny people in this show are Carrie, Janet Heffernan, Spence and Doug Pruzan (Carrie's boss). I'm so lucky that they could get so many seasons from this gem. The show was a hilarious winner at a time of mostly comic losers. Check it out if you don't!
