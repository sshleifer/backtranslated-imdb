Haines is excellent, because the brash cadet that thinks West Point will really be something if he has arrived. Haines shows off his easy-going, comic persona, such as taking West Point and Joan Crawford, the local beauty. Great fun for the first half. And incredible touch to Haines' character goes too far and is almost avoided by fellow cadets. The new humility-filled Haines get a prosperous postponement in the bill to play soccer match against the fleet and, despite a broken arm, win the game. Big, exciting entertainment by MGM in this Haines formula movie, Billy at best. William Bakewell also counts as the skinny follower. The spectacular character will be played by Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and others in recent decades. Another takes the pretty-but-daffy ladies played by Carole Lombard and Marion Davies. Wasp is a winner!
