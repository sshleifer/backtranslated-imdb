It is said that this film has been banned or banned in the US since it was released. Since there is no information about IMDb, I have to rely on my other sources and believe it. If it's really true, the movie is even more painful and frightening and anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie is a so-called author, although I think the subject is too serious, so call it. It creates a scenario where America is a military state and all revolutionary objects are immediately arrested without proof. After a compulsory tribunal, they have to decide whether they are going to jail for a few years or to choose the penalties. By doing so, they have to walk through the desert for three days to reach an American flag, which lies 50 miles ahead, while being followed by police and army troops. <br /> <br /> The movie itself proposes to be a documentary on these incidents and follows both the tribunals and the desert hunt, filmed by European film staff. All the facts are explained, the interviewers ask questions and film everything. People are staring straight into the camera and shouting at it. It looks very, very real. Talking about realism here is nonsense. This movie isn't about making a realistic movie, it's about how such a movie would look, if it really was. And it will certainly look like that. If it were to be filmed anyway. In a 'utopian' state like this, there would certainly not be a European film staff who could film those things. <br /> <br /> There are many things we are scared of. The defendants are people of all social classes. Political leaders, musicians, authors, philosophers, unemployed, etc. They seem hopeless, rebellious or scared. They are not heroes. They talk a lot in the tribunal, knowing that it has nothing to do with it, and all they have said before in speeches and books and songs. One says he's not afraid to die. Is that true? Well, he doesn't have to hunt men through the desert. The defendants have no chance, or anyway, their only chance, the decision between the prison and the penitentiary, is really no chance. The way they eventually decide and how film ends, makes it clear that this kind of heroism is suicide. <br /> <br /> These tribunals remind us of many tribunals in the Third Reich. The officials use the same kind of idealistic speech, ignore all the arguments of the defendants, begin to scream at them and then tell them to be silent. They warn the defendants of "watching their language" and insulting them much more. They ask their questions, the defendants cannot answer, but it never intends to do so. These scenes are a statement about what we call right. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the desert are on a different level. When we see the prisoners for the first time, we realize they realize, they don't have a chance. If you see the desert and the mountains, feel the sun and the thirst, they have no idea how to stand these free days. The movie staff follow them and talk to them as they try to escape this madness. They argue, if they play or escape the game or rebellion? It all leads to the same and no one is surprised. Some will question whether such parks actually exist in such a state? Why not? It escapes the prisons and leaves the government the revolutionary punishment they want. It is not a gas chamber, but the Nazis killed Jews before building concentration camps. The equation is fair because it is no real difference. <br /> <br /> The movie is scary and depressed. The problems being talked about to sound familiar to ignore. This is not science fiction. Talking about poverty, unemployment and crime is not utopian. The film shows us that government and democracy, as presented to us, are not only useless but dangerous. It also shows us that revolution is not definitely the solution. The defendants seem to be confused because they don't really know how to fight it. They do things, but for nothing. Even this is not a solution for us, it is still a statement. <br /> <br /> For me, the most frightening thing is the fact that the movie is banned. Here we have a film accusing the loss of freedom, moral and peace. It accuses the government, a fictitious government, of being dangerous and inhuman. And such a movie was banned. Think about it next time you see the American flag.
