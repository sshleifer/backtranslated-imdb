When I saw this movie at a festival years ago, I was very impressed and I started looking. Nothing to do, not in the theater, nor on DVD. Absolutely nothing !!! How this is possible, can it really happen? The direction is inexplicable, the story is intriguing and filmed in a very original way. The music is perfect and James Franco is hot like hell !!! <br /> <br /> Please leave this masterpiece free and let it be the real life !!!!!!!!!! It's really a very good movie that people should see and it deserves another chance !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Edvard
