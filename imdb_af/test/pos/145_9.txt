There is this whole theory of horror that some people oppose and the monsters and violence must be kept out of the screen. Park Chan-Wook throws the concept completely out of the window and shows directly what he wants - and what he wants to show is almost everything he can think of. To give it to the actors and dialogue to create subtlety from a stylistic perspective. Park seems prepared to do just anything to get its point. Whether it's been involved in ensemble scenes with the camera that is limited around a mah young table or whole weeks to a single shot between two other scenes, dialogue from the screens before and after bleeding over them, Park does not hold a specific structured style but focuses more on the story of removing the entire story of a couple's relationship of virginity by completely codifying to complete self-destruction - and using vampirism as the link and priesthood as drama. It's so simple, and it's complex, at the same time. <br /> <br /> You need to give him credit. Too many people are ready to compare any modern vampire movie to Twilight, with Twilight almost always the least of the works, but here the stories are actually comparable, but this one is more raw and honest. None of these sparks come into the window during the night to speak shit, but anything ranging from the dirtiest, the most desperate and the virgin sex scene to the ultimate abuse as the two lead, begins to conquer one another. It's the same thing - old and girl meet, girl finds out that a man is a vampire, decides to join him anyway, but with no luck, it's just straight time, as they are forced to each other closer and closer. run out of options. The girl's motivation is particularly interesting, as one urgently requires strength and attention, to a man who just wants a good life, just as well as he can under the circumstances, but he is a hypocrite who cannot admit that he is merely his vampirism as an excuse to act against his moral education. <br /> <br /> The movie is not perfect and it tends to stretch (there are no three acts, five acts or any action structure here, only scene after scene of character-based and dysfunctional romance), but is wonderful that Park Chan-Wook is willing to show everything honestly and honestly while the tension and gore are indignant. He also offers a knowledgeable soundtrack to hit the emotional hoes in a reasonably effective way. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
