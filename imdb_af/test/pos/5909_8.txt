Billy Wilder created a somewhat conventional movie about the Charles Lindberg flight. He structured the movie using flashbacks to tell the Lindberg story leading to the well-known flight across the Atlantic, which is currently happening in the film. Flying an airplane for hours to hours is not the strain, and Wilder will not deviate from his Lindberg theme as the hero of the ordinary man, so it is predictable. However, James Stewart is well-cast and reasonably credible like Lindberg, and the many obstacles he just has to overcome to get his plane up in the air are watching one. <br /> <br /> The movie comes through the most success, because Wilder weaves the parts of the story together in a way that creates tension, then relief, then creates tension. The cinematography is pretty good, the score by Franz Waxman makes the screens easier, and Stewart really does make Lindberg alive, but he believes he can be Lindberg. There is a bit of the religious skmaltz of 1950, but the direction, acting and high production values ​​dominate the predictability of the story. (Would anyone really see this picture and NOT know that Lindberg made it over the Atlantic?) A pleasant movie that is better off than most movies of that time. Billy Wilder has made films of a wide variety of types, which is one representative of his craftsmanship-like.
