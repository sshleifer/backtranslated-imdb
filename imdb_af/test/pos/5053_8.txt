Before, if you are tired, the first hour may be slow. Setting up the story has a natural calm pace, unhindered. It gives us time to appreciate the nature of everyday life and situations in which the main characters are. Once you reach the climate of the storyline, the events will keep you safe. How will things come true, which will happen to our precious Fanda (which is exhibited by veteran Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský), how will his wife (wonderfully played by Stella Zázvorková) treat him, what happens to Fanda's best friend Ed (played by Stanislav Zindulka - an additional sidekick to Brodský), and Jára the boy with selfish hidden agenda, blind to the kindness of his parents (sigh!) Vladimír Michálek made the film with sprinkles meaningfully of humor, keeping the insightful writing by Jirí Hubac. Thanks to the clear captions, I could notice for every "clapping" phrase of Fanda's women, and there is an indication of "caring" that is displayed / buried between the lines. Fanda is '76 at 80 'and the love of their enduring (engaging) marriage manifests even in their coping arguments. His playfulness can be contagious. <br /> <br /> This is 'Growing Old Together 101' for (at least) the other fifties, and lessons learned for boys and girls not to take parents for granted. One might need to reconsider if a home for the elderly is accepted, a way to put an end to it, so to speak. The movie was shouted gently to us to live life to the full while we can. (Hint: There is joy to stay and look at the final credit line.) <br /> <br /> We are happy to see a single Czech movie. The Sverák ("Kolya") father and son's 2001 "Dark Blue World" was revealing with pathos. It's good to take it occasionally and appreciate a strange jewel - its subtitles, landscapes, melodic scores and an engaging human story with elegant performances. "Autumn Spring" (aka Babí Leo) is available on DVD. Enjoy it!
