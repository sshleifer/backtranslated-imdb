Well, every scene is so perfectly presented. Never before have I seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> Well, while watching this movie, I remember Amilie. Amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy. These movies are both based on the same plot line. But both are perfectly perfect in their own way and can create their own world. <br /> <br /> Red is able to attract many thoughts in people about fate and dejavu s. And I still think about it. <br /> <br /> The story is wonderful and the end is a bit funny. I laughed at the final scene. Well funny how these three movies are connected to Red White and Blue. <br /> <br /> All in all, a wonderful artwork. A work of a master man. <br /> <br /> 10/10
