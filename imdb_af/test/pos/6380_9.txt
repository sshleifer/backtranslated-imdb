For all purposes, 'Teen Devian' may look like just another light Bollywood musical. To some extent, this can even be true, especially because the producers had to be sure that the film passed the masses. But somewhere behind the scenes, Sadashiv Brahmam (who had the idea for this story) or Amerjeet (who made the movie) decided that there would be a turn to the ordinary formula, and perhaps even beyond their own expectations. br /> <br /> It's not just about an attractive man who flirts with 3 women, is unpredictable about who he should choose as his partner. Dev Anand's character was very much in love with each of the three women at different times, and they were with him, despite being aware of the other two. Dev Anand's relationship with Simi and Kalpana is particularly interesting, as each of the women is very dependent on him. There are quite a lot of suggestive teasers in the stars' body language that depends on imagination, depending on the maturity of the viewer. The theme is surprisingly mature and after all, it was breathtaking that the end was tame, of course designed to please the masses and to criticize.
