Three separate and distant individuals' lives cut each other with the brutal murder of one another. The one-hour movie reveals only the event that the three individuals gather just after half of the movie is over. I saw other segments of the Decalogue, but this one was the most sparse one in dialogue and yet the most fascinating in structure. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a law student practicing a mock defense. for a man charged with murder. Of course, the same arguments must be repeated by the man as a full-fledged lawyer, but this is never shown on the screen (at least in the short 1-hour version of Decalogue 5). We are made to imagine that this should be the case. A misunderstanding taxi driver has two facets of his character: the good side feeds a mangy dog, cleans his taxi properly, puts on dirty clothes made by people who don't have a civilian mind, and she remembers woman while dying; The bad side frightens little poodles, refuses to give a drunk ride - probably worried that he will protrude into the cabin - and equally with pretty girls. The repulsive protagonist who murdered without grace, dropping bridges of bridges on fast traffic, and strangers in urinal pressure without any provocation, is also a person who can make innocent young girls laugh. Kieslowski's film and writing therefore offers the good and bad side of two of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> However, the film is not about the death penalty, but more a murder treatise. The fifth commandment "Do not kill" is investigated theologically - ("Even God saved Cain ..."), sociologically the tenderness of brute to children and poor-lost dogs, and psychologically (after-effects of drunk night with " a male friend who led to the accidental death of his sister, whose photo he carries with him.) What makes ordinary people turn into murderers - this is never fully explained, but suggestions are legion. <br /> <br /> In Kieslowski's world there is a pattern where events and people are connected in a cosmic sense (note the similarity of the clown to the murderer, like that of the mirror in the taxi connection). Kieslowski and the young idealistic lawyer want us to literally look at the commandment and figuratively - why do we kill? Are the people legally really bad? Is there a force outside society (the drunk night that led to the life of a girl) that makes us horrific killers? <br /> <br /> It would miss the forest for the trees to discuss the two detachments Obey murder in the movie - both without mercy. The movie invites the viewer to think why we are asked by God not to kill. <br /> <br /> I understand that a longer full version of the movie was made by Kieslowski. But even this short one-hour version is great with its dark and sparse writing, intelligent editing, interesting cinematography and top-notch much more than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> This segment expects more healthy Decalogs 6,7 and 8.
