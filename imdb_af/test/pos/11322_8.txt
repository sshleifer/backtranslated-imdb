Well, this movie was definitely in line with the current time. No happy ends, superheroes or miracles here. Just fiction of the earth to stimulate our thoughts towards terrorism, and what-if. Kudos to Percival and Mickery for an excellent script and great direction by Percival. Movies like this are needed to make us aware of what's out there. If every peaceable man and woman on earth apparently reported suspicious activity, I believe terrorism cannot thrive. This movie showed how difficult it is to suppress these terrorists, even with good intelligence. Although the film is a bit of a propaganda against Islam (using a Muslim police chief as a main character), I believe it was completely realistic. It was meant to be shocking in the bombing. As a very clever tool to divert the humility and indignation of people trapped in an attack like this, they have disassembled the full nakedness of women after the attack. It didn't take me long to realize that it was the intention to put even more emphasis on the thought, that is, we are not in control of everything in a situation like this. Although it took place in London, with the usual high-level British acting, it makes a statement for any part of the world. Big movies no longer have to be epic productions, and this movie is very worth watching.
