Just to improve something in a previous review here, I don't think this movie is just for people who know London, it's a case of a very specific situation used to make universal comment. Jack Rosenthal said in an introduction to the published script that it was meant to have characters who, by testing this comprehensive knowledge, get some self-knowledge. <br /> <br /> I think this is one of the most perfectly written plays I have seen: technically, it is highly skilled to carry fairly complex details, but it is also joyful in how it entails you. In the beginning, you no longer know about this London knowledge test as the main characters, but you get upright with them until it is of great importance to you. You become incredibly proud of those characters who succeed, and you get crushed for those who don't. Especially whose downfall, without giving anything, will fly your hands to your face. <br /> <br /> Like a fact, Nigel Hawthorne's character, Mr. Burgess, the Vampire, is not called Dracula. You don't need to know, but I'm not saying it's essential, but it's a measure of the drama: once you've seen it, you want everyone and you will evangelize every detail. <br /> <br /> I hope you'll see it. <br /> <br /> William
