<br /> <br /> When I first came back in 1997 about coffee with friends, I decided to check it out. The only problem was that it was on a small screen at one of my local theaters. <br /> <br /> It's not a pleasure to see just a fantastic movie, with a top role in Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland, and Ben Kingsley. The whole movie glued me to my seat. <br /> <br /> I just haven't found any mistakes in this great movie, and I give it my highest recommendation to those who love thrillers. I'm very proud to have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> 10/10 (I don't give it lightly).
