Considered by many as a strange overview of Chabrol, it seems to me the reason it is cold shoulders, is the sleaze factor. Not as openly sexy, violent or greedy as so many movies of this period, but it starts to be quite shocking and although it is measured more, it remains a rather unpleasant smell. Me. Audran, not the ice-cream girl here, but a drunk mother, Donald Pleasence does come as a child molester, David Hemmings has his face on underage sex and the central theme is the relationship between a brother, sister and niece. No, not at all, and Chabrol treats it all as if it's very normal (as it may be in a small French village!) Instead of Ed McBain's New York City. If treated in a more sensational way, it would be a more acceptable but less film. Here we really have to choose between the likelihood of several unpleasant options before the final unbundling. Very viewable
