I enjoy the anthem. I enjoy the national anthem as for nothing but just before the Midnight News, I think I play the cymbals in the band. Not as easy as you might think! One two three four; One two three four; but then what? So I am sympathetic to the practice bass player in Roy Andersson's wonderful movie, and wait patiently for his cue to listen to a 70's cassette player. <br /> <br /> The 70's motif seems to be going through, with some classic, sultry furniture. In addition, every scene was an exciting jade that emphasized the latest nuances of the subtle acting. <br /> <br /> What brings me to Jessika Lundberg's outstanding press boots. Boots that would otherwise inspire a Silk Cult advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> But then the difficult bit. Someone asked me what it was all about. Well, there's a scene where the opening line is "I don't have the length in green". Brilliant. Straight from a Gary Larson cardboard. <br /> <br /> I can't tell what it's about. See yourself. <br /> <br /> Ron Plasma <br /> <br /> Hmm. Larson! Sounds Swedish <br /> <br /> (See 15Apr08)
