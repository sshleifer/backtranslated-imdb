The impossible sexy Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale, a new nurse at one of those movie asylums where the doctor in charge has his own, unorthodox ways to treat the prisoners. Reluctant to bring her on board is the exaggerated Dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams, namely Annabelle Weenick). The prisoners are also not too friendly to Charlotte. <br /> <br /> Partial mystery, partial war, this initial effort by B-film director S.F. Brownrigg has an oppressive feel about it. These colorful psychos, including a self-contained nymphomania, a soft giant who has already had a lobotomy, and a supposed "judge" talking to the right jargon dominate the screen with their unpleasantness. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty good picture and correct the atmosphere. A few short pieces of graphical violence also help to give the good old-fashioned exploitation quality. <br /> <br /> It builds in intensity, as the hidden heroine struggles to maintain her own common sense and offer a surrealistic encounter to the other. Particularly effective is the poetry quote, old old woman. Callingham. <br /> <br /> For cheap 1970s era cheese, it's pretty effective, with a particularly nasty climax. I had a good time looking at it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
