I heard a lot about Porno Holocaust and his twin movie Erotic Nights Of The Living Dead. Both films are interchangeable and are filmed at the same place at the same time, with the same actors changing (and taking off) clothes for each movie. If you expect the D'Amato genius in movies like Buio Omega or Death Smiles on Murder, you won't find it here. Yet this film has a charm that exploitation fans cannot withstand. Where else do you see hardcore sex mixed with a zombie / monster and his huge penis killing and killing women? Only from D'Amato. There are some gores in which many of the men are bled to death. The film is on a beautiful tropical island. As far as I know, there is no caption version, so if you don't speak Italian, you don't know what's going on. But who is right? In all honesty, Gore fans are likely to go fast through hardcore sex. And if somebody just looks at it for sex, it will immediately offend. I can only imagine that contemporary porn fanciers play back through D'Amato's output and come across this cruelty! From the two, I find much better erotic nights of the living dead. But, no matter if it is cut. Porno Holocaust is extremely low budget as expected. Even the monster doesn't look as good as George Eastman's character in Anthropophagus. The movie is worth watching for the laugh and completing your D'Amato movie quest.
