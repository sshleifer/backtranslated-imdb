This movie is titled "Junior Pilot" here on IMDb, but "Final Approach" at Netflix. Go figure! The movie is a pleasure for both the target audience and adults who can suspend their maturity long enough to watch this movie through the eyes of their own youth. For the adult, the story is fairly predictable, and perhaps slow and melodramatic; while the story may look new and creative to young people who haven't seen or read many movies or books with such a story line yet. <br /> <br /> Anyway, credit to the film's creators, especially director James Becket and filmmaker Denis Maloney, has to be made to make this most entertaining and visually interesting movie. The gifts of the young main character Ricky's fantasy thoughts are hilarious and entertaining filmed. <br /> <br /> The young actors give uniformly credible performances, seemingly investing heavily in their roles - stupid as many scenes. Jordan Garrett starred "Ricky" with pretty good, excellent camera presence. Jeffrey Tedmori creates a deliciously soft and sensitive "Shashi" that thrives on all the ridiculous stuff on hot sauce. Skyler Samuels and Adam Cagley also give solid performances. <br /> <br /> As is typical of its always fine acting, Larry Miller creates a solid parent figure that revolves around the children's part-time, fantasy world. Compared to his father figure, the other great adult roles seem to be level and one-dimensional, deliberate and very humorous, to be sure. <br /> <br /> This movie is a simplistic, youthful story, of course, but it is quite entertaining, perhaps repeatedly, for the targeted youth crowd, but also for at least one adult-looking look see a movie from their once-youthful perspective.
