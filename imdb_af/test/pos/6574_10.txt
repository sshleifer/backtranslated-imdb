Roopa (Kamalinee Mukherjee) loses her parents and other family members in a horrible car accident. She started out as an independent woman on her own without getting help from her family. She has a boy called Rahul (Anuj) and marries him, but stumbles back because of her mother-in-law's behavior and lack of confidence her boyfriend has shown. Anand (Raja) joins her neighborhood. And he starts to feel Roopa comfortable and safe. The rest of the story is why Anand MD of the richest corporate house of AP has chosen to stay as Roopa's neighbor and what follows. <br /> <br /> This movie has freshness that we rarely see in Indian movies. Although the story goes slow, you get a sense of familiarity with it. Kudos to director Shekhar Kammula for such a wonderful direction! Brilliant music and background score compiled by K.M. Radhakrishnan adds to the quality. Kamalini mukherjee as Rupa did a wonderful show. I think she was the best choice for this role because of her non-glamorous appearance and wonderful histrionics. Anand as well as Raja also did well. I watched this movie three times and thoroughly enjoyed it every time. It's a class apart from the daily dose of action movies we get here. Highly recommended !!
