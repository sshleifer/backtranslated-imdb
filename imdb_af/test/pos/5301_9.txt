While Hayao Miyazaki's movies have always dealt with me in the story, they are undoubtedly beautiful to the eye, with characters of simple animation against a backdrop of artistic images. Ponyo sticks to the formula, with a main character so beautiful. I want a gentle doll from her and beauty. It doesn't look as nice as a picture on the wall. <br /> <br /> The story, on the other hand, I didn't enjoy as much as his last two issues, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. It was just a little too youthful, more than children for kids and leaving adults just to enjoy the animation. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed that the score made by Joe Hisaishi, which is also the score for the above-mentioned two movies, was not nearly as memorable. While I can't remember Howl's score, I still remember it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard. Ditto Spirited's - although I just remember it's very complementary to the movie. Perhaps it's because Ponyo is more youthful, that the score isn't quite so haunting. Anyway, this movie is still a must-see for fans of anime or Miyazaki.
