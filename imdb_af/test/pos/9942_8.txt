Betty is an understudy for the lead role in a production by Verdi's Macbeth. When a car falls mysteriously, Betty is drawn into the spotlight. Opening night is a great success and Betty decides to leave the after party to celebrate privately with her boyfriend. But when the boyfriend leaves the room, Betty is grabbed from behind by an unknown black-gloved, masked figure. The unknown attacker connects Betty to a column, tears her and places needles under her eyes that will cause incredible damage and pain if Betty is to close them. The boyfriend returns to the room and is surprised to see Betty in such trouble. He is even more shocked when the killer grabs him and a knife cut through his lower jaw with such a force, the tip of the knife can clearly be seen in his mouth. And Betty was forced to watch it all. So Betty's startling ordeal begins with a murderer, not only intending to hurt her, but also to force her to look while mutilating her friends. <br /> <br /> Opera is classified as a Giallo, but it differs in many ways from the model. Less emphasis is placed on the mystery of the story than in something like Argento's Tenebre or The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. The black-gloved, masked killer can be ubiquitous, but the clues and red herring usually associated with good Giallo are absent. Instead, Opera is worried about an unknown killer and makes the audience uncomfortable. The focus is on the creepy deaths, Betty's fear and the murderer's obsession with Betty. <br /> <br /> Opera features I think are of Argento's most artistic deaths. When the killer grabs Betty after her boyfriend leaves the room, you're sure Betty had it. But the sadistic killer just wants to force Betty to watch while he brutally stabs her lover in the neck? the knife came out in his mouth. It's a well shot and designed scene. And the needles in the eyes ?? brilliant. Or take the seamstress's death. First, her death seems like an ordinary murder. But if the seamstress accidentally swallows the accidental assassination, it has started, as just another death guard turns it into the heel. The killer uses a pair of scissors to cut open the girl's throat to get his chain. Finally, there is the most famous death scene in Opera that I am surprised with every time I see it? Mira is shot in the eye while hitting a keyhole. That scene shows a lot of what I like about Argento. It has style to burn. Argentina was definitely not the first Italian director to focus on eye reduction, but in Opera he saw eye trauma. a new level. Needles that keep eyes open, a bullet in the eye and the eyes that protrude are all part of Argento's vision. And these scenes have the effect of believing Argento. The first time I saw the killer, the needles sat in Betty's eyes, I couldn't stop shining. It actually had a physical effect on me. What about the eyes they make such a target for abuse in Italian movies? <br /> <br /> To be honest (and don't sound like such a fanboy), there are issues I have with Opera that judge me as the best of Argento's. One of my problems is with the air channel system that runs through Betty's apartment building. While I am not in doubt, there are air ducts in older apartment buildings connecting the apartments, the transfers in Opera are huge. I'm not an expert, but I doubt any building as if one in this movie would have had such mammoth flights. It doesn't seem practical at all. And don't you think anyone would have done anything to keep criminals and neighbors out of the other apartments? It's convenient for the plot, but it's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> But I think my big problem with the movie comes with the final. How about the end? It feels completely out of place, tackled and like a bad thought. I'm not sure what else to say if it's terrible.
