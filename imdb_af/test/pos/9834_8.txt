True, there are a few goofs for the one they want to find. However, they are not important. <br /> <br /> The primary feature of this movie is watching veteran experts doing their craft. Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful and plays the part of a strong woman, but one that has been hurt. The same for Harrison Ford, who is as good as Kristin to the ladies, is for our guys. <br /> <br /> Their hurt in the hands of their adulterous spouse brings them together uncomfortably, but one in which they find support in each other. How they call out their hurting feelings and their humanity on their screen is why it is so sought after. The viewer can't help but feel what they feel and can't help them out when they're together. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are several action scenes that include evil corrupt police, but they are just spitting it a bit, and not an important part of the movie. <br /> <br /> For music lovers, Dave Grusin offers an excellent Jazz-based wallpaper, featuring trumpeter Terrence Blanchard. Just like the actors, Grusin shows why he is one of the most sought after musical consultants in the movie business. Blanchard shows why he is one of the premiere trumpets on the scene. <br /> <br /> Not a movie for lovers of guts, blood and gore. But for those who want to see what makes us feel, watch a beautiful English actress with big, expressive blue eyes who, like Harrison Ford, can act to the endless soothing accompaniment thanks to Dave Grusin and Terrence Blanchard, that's a move to look with someone you love. Preferably in bed. <br /> <br /> I thought it deserved at least an 8.
