It saw the cable the other night on demand and thought, "This is the kind of movie Alec Guiness and Glynis Johns can die if it's made in the late 50's." A father in English tradition. Alfred Molina and Brenda Blethyn are very sweet and sincere in their portrayal. Naomi Watts simply struggled in a ditzy Jayne Mansfield ish (if she could have acted) way. The rest of the roll has some big turns and bits. The Welsh landscape is beautiful. An absurd point of view, indeed and not at all credible, but not in the way of enjoyment. Not a BIG movie, you think, but a very funny watch. And Walken is at his best. A joy to see!
