When I looked at L'Appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed: "How complicated!" And she's right, of course. If you're used to simple, one-linear sites, especially violent hero vs crook schemes, L'Appartement is hard to follow. A few negative reviewers here also missed one or more important points. Others shine over the confusing flashback. Come on! It's not the kind of movie you can go to visit the toilet, come back and get stuck in a few seconds. This one requires full concentration and a fine eye on details. Then it's really not that hard to figure out what's happening and when. The director left more than enough clues in all scenes. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the movie focuses on the question: why did Max and Lisa split? The movie, as my girlfriend noticed, starts out as a romantic love story, suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again. With experience with French movies I predicted that the story would soon get a sick turn and I was right. At the end of the first part, it became clear, after many twists and turns, that Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max didn't know what Lisa left and why. Lisa did not know why Max did not contact her in Rome and left her without a trace when she returned to Paris. Alice had all her own reasons to keep her mouth shut. <br /> <br /> After both Max and Lisa found out the truth, the question is of course: can Alice's manipulations be undone? Well, of course, the time has passed and things have changed. <br /> <br /> Many European films use a storytelling technique that I fully enjoy. There is no outline of the basic conflict at first, after which two (or more) interested parties decide for their own benefit. Instead, the spectator is gradually fed with pieces of the plot and knows almost more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. In the first half Alice looks like a silk character; slowly it becomes clear that she is a key figure. <br /> <br /> The action is simply great. Vincent Cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character who dares to live a safe life just to dream of the past. Monica Belucci is of course very nice, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey offers the necessary comic touch. Romane Bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman, troubled by guilt and regret. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is the somewhat unsatisfactory end. Of course, it was necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all the events, Max is exactly at the point where the movie started, just wiser and sad. Alice paid for her sins. But the small turn at the airport is a bit artificial. Max easily exchanges Lisa for Alice; Alice decides too easily to reject Max, who had been her dream for so long; Max comes back to his fiance too easily. But then I don't know how to achieve that without sacrificing the elegant symmetry. I think sometimes artists need to give realism to beauty.
