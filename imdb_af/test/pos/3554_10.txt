A strange police detective suspects a French duke of the infamous thief ARSÃˆNE LUPINE. <br /> <br /> For the first time, John & Lionel Barrymore teamed up in a film in this intriguing crime drama. The same and yet so different, they are the perfect counterpoint for each other. John plays his role with suave sophistication (when not in disguise) and Lionel is nice and generous in his portrayal. Of course, everyone has a wonderful time trying to figure out the others. Using a generous script, the outcome is pretty much a sign, with the viewer the clear winner. <br /> <br /> Although the two male stars rose, Karen Morley is intrigued because the mysterious woman John is naked in his bed. Tully Marshall gives a colorful performance as a stupid nobleman with a lot to lose to the master criminal. Henry Armetta & George Davis are very pleasant as two seriously unknown security guards. John Miljan offers a solid presence in his small role as the police prefect. <br /> <br /> Movie mavens acknowledge an unknown Mischa Auer as a guide in the Louvre during the climate that is attempting the Mona Lisa.
