Sean Connery is very good like the Great Raisuli, Lord of the Reef and Defender of the Faithful. It's an adventure movie with Arabs, Germans and the USMC that come in at some point. There is also a lot of humor in the interaction between the main and supporting characters. The story is based on the true incident in which a rich Greek-American businessman was abducted by the Raisuli in the early 1900s. Milius has replaced Candace Bergen and her two children as victims of the kidnapping, which opens the story to a very literary license. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film Milius gives the opportunity to view the viewer of two of the most famous (though mostly forgotten) political quotes of the TR era. Brian Keith (very good as TR) says: "Pedecaris alive or dead Raisuli!"; and John Huston (also good state secretary John Hay) asks the Japanese ambassador to a White House dinner, "You likee knifee, you likee forkee?"
