Don't hate Heather Graham because she's beautiful, hates her because she's fun watching this movie. Like the hip and funky environment, the actors in this movie work well together. Casey Affleck is hysterical and Heather Graham literally illuminates the screen. The minor characters - Goran Visnjic {sug} and Patricia Velazquez are like TALENTED as they are beautiful. Congratulations Miramax & Director Lisa Krueger!
