Chan is in New York and becomes involved in an attempt to sabotage a new aircraft design. <br /> <br /> The war was more than a year away from reaching America, but the second world war has already raged everywhere in the world and so it all colored, as most people probably realized that war comes. The War is not mentioned here, but the fact that the film deals with the production of aircraft, at least relates to it. The riddle itself is pretty good, the idea of ​​airplane sabotage lends itself to some pretty moments. To be sure, we're talking about Charlie Chan, so we can be sure he would live to fight another day, but there was no guarantee he would be, or anyone around him would survive. <br /> <br /> I love this movie a lot. It's not one of the nest and far from the worst. This is one of the really rare things, an enjoyable one. Definitely a can or six.
