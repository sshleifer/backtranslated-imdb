In the end, it is clear that the murderers are the murder weapon in Mrs. Planted Columbo's car and it was at the police ballistic laboratory. <br /> <br /> But where did the gun come under the hood used in the demonstration? Wouldn't the murderers take out the stuff under the hood? They had a whole week? Or did Columbo's police repeat the camera / gun under the hood used in the demonstration? How did they do this without breaking and getting in the car? Perhaps that is why the murders were in the end surprised. But how could Columbo repeat their camera / rifle device and calibrate to their key fob? Columbo had to get the gun back from ballistics and replenished it under the hood of the car and was very happy that the rest of the device with the camera was still there and then sent. <br /> <br /> It was a 10/10 show to this spectacular end of plot plot.
