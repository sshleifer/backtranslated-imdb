It's a good movie in Vienna about a taxi driver, Toni (Donald Buka), stealing a passenger's identity when the passenger is shot while sitting in the back of the taxi. It gives him an identity because he is an illegal immigrant, but he must spell out the role of the victim until he gets a flight to the US with a ticket in the victim's name. Mrs. Manelli (Joan Camden) scolded him, but she was accused of pianisting her husband Claude (Francis Lederer). As a result, Toni is left off the hook. Claude doesn't want to share his wife, but she walks away from him. There are several plot points and eventually both Toni and Mrs Manelli make a run for each other - they both try to escape their lives in Vienna. There is a tense, exciting build-up to the final. Will they get away .....? ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the picture quality is not great and there is some time in the middle of the picture. The role players are all very good at their roles, especially Francis Lederer's portrayal of Claude. Important to the story is Heinth (Manfred Inger) as owner of cabin company, Marie (Inge Konradi) and Toni's hometown friend and inspector (Hermann Erhardt). <br /> <br /> It's a good movie.
