As everyone knows, 15 Park Avenue is the story of a schizophrenic girl and her half-sister. <br /> <br /> The manifestation of schizophrenia is still perceived as a disease that people often feel can be ignored if ignored. There are also those who, who are far away, may appear to be shown in the film, thinking that the disease manifests itself because of some supernatural influence. I think Mrs. Sen deserves much praise for "15 Park Avenue". She made a good turn not only for the general public, but also for those who deal with schizophrenia ... family members, social workers, psycho-analysts. The movie actually helps to drive many myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder. I am told that the film is based mainly on her own personal experiences with a person who is very close to her, suffering from this spiritual misery. For this reason, I'm sure nothing of what is shown is blown out of proportion. On the contrary, this is a true representation of facts. <br /> <br /> The performances are good, on the whole, as can be expected. Konkona Sen Sharma, Shabana Azmi and of course Rahul Bose, are indeed very good. They come out as many "right" characters ... credible enough to sometimes identify with them. People may think me very awful, but I think there are moments when one can also identify with Meethi! I think all of us have a line of "madness" in us .... maybe more than others. These are the people who are singled out. After all, we don't all have our secret fantasies and dreams? Impossible, sometimes? Will we be called as "of our rockers" if people could slip into these areas of our minds? Should one be regarded with a low self-esteem as a schizophrenic because he / she shoots a company ... rather prefer to live in an own world because it is the only space where there is a sense of security is? <Br /> <br /> Konkona, as Meethi, is excellent !! Her performance is so effortless ... she lives her part. She has shown the ability to abandon the audience to forget about the division between reality and acting! A point in the point is the part where she is on the scene, shown on television, by Saddam Hussein's arrest. Her reaction seems so untouched and intense ... as if she's very sad in this tragedy! Her brand of Indian English is also so spontaneous and natural. <br /> <br /> That can't be said for at least some of the other actors. Kanwaljeet and Waheeda Rehman, great actors, look bad at ease when they deliver their dialogue in English. Their diction is less than perfect. Stilted and affected, the fact that they are doing a supreme effort, becomes more than clear. Their dial-up is broken and tends to break the smooth flow of the story's unfolding. <br /> <br /> The brutal rape of Meethi (Konkona) seems somewhat unnecessary. Any other incident would be just as good, I feel. The point here is that something comes from the extreme manifestation of the disease. As the psychiatrist explains, one cannot say with any conviction of conviction or certainty that the incident of the rape was instrumental in bringing the latent propensity to schizophrenia to the fore. Then why are we subjected to the scene where Meethi lies bleeding and unconscious. Was me. Sen is trying to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country, where the voice of the masses is silenced by a handful of people who use violence to stay in custody? If so, the scene of the rape is justified, but not strictly in the context of the main body of the film. <br /> <br /> The end looks a bit sudden. Is the audience expected to find a solution? Where does Meethi disappear? Wants Mrs. We feel that maybe the psychiatrist says about whose reality is more real and therefore credible. In other words, does she try to say that we are not without prejudice to judge who is on this side of the fine line between common sense and madness? I'm not very sure. <br /> <br /> An awesome movie overall and worth watching. However, if you are the kind of person who likes to be neat and tidy, cut and dry everything, with a waterproof solution for every problem that arises. This movie is not meant for you!
