1959 was a landmark in the world of film. Several major classical directors were the release of career classmates listed below their best. Just a look at the titles is instructive, Hitchcock's North At Northwest, Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot, Howard Hawks Rio Bravo, Douglas Sirk's Imitation of Life. Add some of the previous year, Orson Welles's Touch of Evil, Hitch's Vertigo, and Nick Ray's Wind over the Everglades, and you have a good summary of what's possible in the classic Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> At the same time, two films have appeared that predicted a whole new way of making movies. One was Jean-Luc Godard's Ademless, the other was John Cassavetes Shadows. The two films have some things in common, mostly improvised by non-stars, handheld cameras, low budgets and a certain youthful, jazzy swagger. However, in some ways, they cannot fall further apart. Godard was still a believer in the director as a stylist. He knew more about film than most Hollywood producers, and Breathless was filled with the iconography of classic crime film. Cassavetes, on the other hand, was an actor, and a refugee from New York's underground theater scene. His first film shows him a bit of awe at the theater, and a great believer in actors. Godard's film continually refers to his own artwork, while Shadows envisions some kind of naturalism. <br /> <br /> It doesn't achieve that, mainly because naturalism is a myth, especially in the cinema. But it feels powerful, kinetic, but lilting like the cool jazz on the score, certainly the main inspiration for the movie style here. It does not last, because Cassavetes actors here are amateurish beatniks, where Cassavetes style requires strong, imaginative actors. His later work with Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazarra, and Peter Falk blows it out of the water. Due to the technical inexperience of the director, some parts of the dialogue had to be reaffirmed later, defeating the freshness of the improvisation. Still, it is fascinating to watch, both for the great moments (such as the scene where Leila Goldoni talks about her dissapointment with her virginity lost) and to see a groundbreaking artist finding her way.
