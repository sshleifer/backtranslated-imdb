It's simply ridiculous how underestimated this movie is. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It never laughs, it never slows down, it's a movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot. This, along with the brilliant writing, makes it a fantastic movie. Aamir and Salman are disgraceful, even Raveena and Karishma are funny in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shakti deliver some good bad comedies, but Viju Khote and the Ajit wannabe are the best with their naughty bad guys intentions. If you want to laugh and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you won't regret it. Most Indian movies pull me out before the end because they are 3 hours long. This movie is just as long, but I wish there was more when it ended, because it's a wonderful movie.
