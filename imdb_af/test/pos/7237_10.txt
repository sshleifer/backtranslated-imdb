Yes !! They eventually got it to perfection. What a great idea, a refreshing exploitation epic for Generation-X, whether they know it or not. After disasters like Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD, crucified by Blockbuster, our hero, Lloyd Kaufman, just decided to go for, stop catering to distributors, and let Troma be the Troma. Lloyd would make this one the most unapologetic, outlandish and straightforward hilarious Troma movie. This time, Lloyd takes Shakespeare's love story, turns it inside, tromatizes it, and adds that the long, lost, entertainment value is always lacking. Entertainment value, such as Lemmy Kilmister (the narrator), Debbie Rochon (cook), Joe Fleishaker (the fat man), and of course, brutal mutilation and toilet humor. Tromeo and Juliet are the definitive edition of a rather slim story, and the crown jewel of the Troma universe. <br /> <br /> Years ago, in Tromaville, NJ's business partners, Monty Que and Cap Capulet, a movie company called Silky Films, started producing so-called tasteful, soft-core films. Monty sees Cap his friend, but Cap is unscrewing the poor bag from his part of the company. On paper and in books it seems that Monty released his life's work for free. Fast forward to mid-90s Manhattan, we have two families who are extremely dissatisfied with each other, it is to the point that they are just looking for a reason to take a limb or preferably a life. Monty has a son, Tromeo, cousin, Benny, they, with their friend, Murray Martini, who is just a little excited about all the massacre, waged war on the turbulent Capulets, except Monty, he is too drunk to care . As in the original, there is a confusing situation, which leads to Tromeo who falls to Cap's daughter, whom he has never met, or never knew. Unfortunately Cap is a sadistic pervert who, unlike Tromeo's father, has something for the bottle. This will, of course, cause Daddy's small Chenshaw melon to be physically and emotionally abused, molested and kept in a plexiglass cage. Occasionally, depending on how dirty a mood is Cap. Cap also forced his vegetarian daughter to marry London Arbuckle, a billionaire butcher, who would just make anyone uncomfortable, with or without the raisin bread. With all this inconvenience, the young lovers feel that uplifting would be the best decision, but how will that affect the great deal? It may or may not be something like the original, but finding out how this one ends will simply not happen, you will never see it. <br /> <br /> "The one with Leo" is straightforward sleep-inducing compared to Tromeo and Juliet, but if it's over, it's a great budget, Hollywood, Garbage, for which you're programmed to go. but if you're in the mood for something a little more colorful, something that really packs a punch, and doesn't follow the "normal" movie pattern, and if you have a pretty abnormal sense of humor, then you have to just don't hate this movie. Tromeo and Juliet give the finger to everything that is mainstream. Full blast exploitation with so much moderate humor than anything from a young John Waters. Along with some bad acting, Tromeo and Juliet have a thunderous score that includes the legendary chief, and not much of James Gunn's input, which really brought it together. For more awesomeness by James Gunn, look out from Lollilove, and for more excellence from Lloyd Kaufman, look at his next vision, Terror Firmer. Tromeo and Juliet are jaw-drop priceless exploits for the 90s brought to us by one, and only, the king of the B-movies. Thank you, Lloyd. 10/10
