For the 1980s, it's a very dark movie. At this stage, filmmakers have begun to work under the assumption that all movies require smearing comic enlightenment (which, of course, is taken to the limit today), flashing action scenes (even more exaggerated today) or steaming sex scenes. /> <br /> Hutton and Penn are great in their roles as childhood friends have changed Soviet spies. Penn is especially brilliant as an unfortunate drug dealer, Daulton Lee. <br /> <br /> What you have here is a real thriller / drama. There is no eyewitness to speak of, but the story is so compelling and the play is so wonderful that (hopefully) most people will not miss it. There are some amusing scenes, especially the one where Penn tries to involve his Soviet benefactors involved in a major drug licensing agreement. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
