I recently discovered this fantastic series and I just can't get enough of Garner's lazy PI. The shows constantly show excellent writing levels and exciting episodes. <br /> <br /> This episode, Sleight of Hand, is a little different. Loving humor in favor of a more serious turn for Rockford as he looks for his missing girl. <br /> <br /> The mystery is wonderful and it's unraveling enough. It is based on a book (can't remember the name) and it could easily be extended to an episode of the feature. Garner is performing here when Rockford is tough and really mean. It has a noir feel to it, the dark lighting and overall mood echoes the big dark exciters of the 40's and 50's. <br /> <br /> Really good episode in a Class A series. Enjoy 10 easy.
