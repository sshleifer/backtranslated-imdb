Around the end of the earth was carefully erected and played perfectly. It is a surprising journey from our reality and into another era. <br /> <br /> Based on William Golding's trilogy, these three 90 minute films twist the trip to both Australia and the experience of youthful aristocrat Edmund Talbot (Benedict Cumberbatch) aboard an older early war 19th century, as he heads a state position below. <br /> <br /> Among the crew and hopeful emigrants who share his passage is a stormy captain (Jared Harris), a politically radical philosopher (Sam Neill), a clear 1st lieutenant who left her (Jamie Sives) and briefly the first brush of love in the shape of a beautiful young woman (Joanne Page) whose ship literally passes by night. <br /> <br /> Aside from the astonishing degree of physical historical accuracy, director David Attwood and screenwriters Tony Basgallop and Leigh Jackson have a look and feel for the ways and solid labels of an earlier era. which produces a completely convincing microcosm of the Napoleonic era. <br /> <br /> The shipboard life is a brutal, monotonous round sea sickness, villain and danger to others and as Edmund is entangled in the love, hope and misery of his fellow passengers, he experiences a cruel swirl of the hardship of life, man's inhumanity and his noblest feelings. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy the Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World or Patrick O'Brian's series of novels based on it will love it? For everyone it is a whole new world to discover.
