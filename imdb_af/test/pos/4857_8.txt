I don't know if the directors were planning to make sure the air was almost always sunny and beautiful in this movie. Perhaps this is the romantic image many Americans have of the time this movie is set. As it is in the middle of the war, Macy returned from the war. (His neighbor asks, "Hey, is it true that you have a Fritz there?") And tries to continue with his life, but one day he gets new glasses (so the name) and sees it clearly , since the surrounding situation was itself a racial anti-Semitism and Macy and Dern could be wrapped up in it. No matter how Jewish in this movie, but the accusation is made. This too is historically accurate, as the trade union democrats of this time have wrapped themselves in the flags of America and God. Macy is constantly being harassed to come to the "meeting". His presence brings unexpected results. <br /> <br /> The application of this time frame to today is a contrast study. In 2005, a full turnaround has taken place, with average citizens supporting patriotism and religion as their unity to support the Republican Party and to view organized labor as part of left-wing "unpatriotic" America. <br /> <br /> A great picture to look at, if you care to see the friendly, mischievous and gentle Macy (beautifully played by him) in the mid-40's race and hatred in NYC. <br /> <br /> A hard, emotionally charged movie.
