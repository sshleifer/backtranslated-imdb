Boogie Nights was without a doubt the best film of 1997. I could watch this movie over and over and still like it. I'm in no hurry to see that remaining romance / disaster epic Titanic again. The fact that Boogie Nights did not even receive a Best Picture nomination just goes to prove how predictable and accurate the Academy is. Only Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Afterafter and Robert Zemecki's contact came close to Boogie Nights. No other filmmaker has even come close to making a movie as good as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in recent years. Until now. Paul Thomas Anderson came to the challenge and succeeded. Just like Tarantino John Travolta's career gave a kick, P.T. Anderson gave Burt Reynolds the kick that needed his career. Boogie Nights will undoubtedly make stars from Don Cheadle, Heather Graham and John Reilly. Overall, a wonderful movie. The best since Pulp Fiction. Maybe even better.
