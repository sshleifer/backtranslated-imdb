I have never been so surprised by a film that was so old. Only "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" holds this well, performance way. If someone who saw firsthand heroin addiction, I was shocked at how realistic this movie was. Frank Sinatra's performance is completely uncompromising, realistic and heartbreaking. The direction of Otto Preminger is perfect for the film, with long tasks and a very mobile camera. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's performance is good, as Eleanor Parker says. In fact, the whole supporting role works very well, with underestimated performances, as it suits the style of this movie. The documentary style is part of what keeps this movie up to date. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8.0 out of 10
