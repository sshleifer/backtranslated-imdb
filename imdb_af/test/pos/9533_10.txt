Edith Nesbitt's best book is adapted to a wonderful movie, I love it. The film itself has beautiful cinematography, and the deliberation of the subject. The end is enough to have you in tears because it's done so beautifully. Lionel really does have great movies, such as the Amazing Mr Blunden, but it's his best film as a director by a mile. The costumes were absolutely beautiful, in keeping with the beauty of the countryside, and the sparkling and comfortable writing helped. However, it is the quality of the play that holds this movie together because it is nothing short of incredible. Dinah Sheridan is sincerely sincere as the mother, a much needed character of the character, and Bernard Cribbins was hilarious as Perks. In fact, I prefer Perks to film because he is not so humorous in the book. The kids were perfect. Gary Warren and Sally Thomsett both played excited performances, but it is Jenny Agutter's captivating depiction of Bobbie who impressed me the most. Another special mention is the beautiful music of Johnny Douglas, the title music reminded me of Charlie Chaplin's Smile. In conclusion, a funny and gripping masterpiece, it's better than the book, I think. 10/10. Bethany Cox.
