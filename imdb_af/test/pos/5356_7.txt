What ho! This one is very good. I say very well, cute. Or should I say "ol" bean? My mastery of British terminology is a bit dusty. Anyway, my biker boots and I went into this show without any previous viewing experience of Wallace and Gromit. I'm glad to say that my boots and I walked out to make their knowledge known. <br /> <br /> While not as mature as Toy Story, W & G still cleverly manages the grown-ups with a bit of humor that will surely rise over the heads of the little ones who are too busy to throw at the Were rabbit's legs to know that something is wrong. I strongly suggest that you pay close attention when you see books or words on the screen because there are quick glances at words that you will miss if you do not pay attention. My favorite is a book of monsters that refers to the Loch Ness Monster as "tourist trap." If you were ever known to say, "I can really relate to Kevin Federline," or if you're just illiterate, you won't just miss these jokes, but you'll probably have to spend your time reading instead. . to go to movies. Consider a public service announcement. <br /> <br /> The most impressive aspect of W & G is its clay animation. Thanks to the boring process, it took FIVE years to complete the movie! According to the press notes, there were a few days when the optimal goal was to get just 10 seconds of finished film. People, I sometimes struggle to find the motivation to respond to a handful of emails or to add captions to photos for my reviews (a point proven by a lack of pictures in this review); so I can't even think that I have the necessary patience for it. <br /> <br /> I really like the rough, practical quality of the clay compliments. The fact that you can see fingerprints in the clay is a nice, personal touch. How can you not be impressed with clay characters that show more expression and emotion than Paul Walker and Keanu Reeves combined? The curse of the wax rabbit is, as director Nick Park calls it, the world's first vegetarian horror movie to entertain both children and adults. Rely on (and if a man who puts himself in his rugged, cool-gesture masculinity, I hesitate to use this word) cute and (oh man, I probably shouldn't use this word) lovely characters rather than outdated M.C. Hammer referrals, W & G, is proof that Dreamworks can create an entertaining animation when choosing smart joke.
