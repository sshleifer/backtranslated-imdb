Black Scorpio is a fun movie about a gruesome female super hero who wears teacher's clothes and drives a car that can morph into her messy, armored Scorpion Mobile. She struggles with the evil Breathtaker and all this is an excellent recipe for good IMHO. I loved her saying "Yo" to get the car's computer to take orders! Breathtaker is so angry he wants to give the whole city asthma! It's all so high and it's the beauty of it! The scene where the Black Scorpio attacks her partner "steals" the performance. You will know it when you see it. This DVD also has a fun interview with Joan Severance. She's a doll. Black Scorpio is a fun DVD. Love it!
