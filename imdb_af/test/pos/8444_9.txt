Reporter Kimberly Wells presents the small side of the news; puff pieces that do not have much news earnings. While shooting on alternative energy at a nuclear plant is being shot, an accident occurs. Friend and cameraman for Kimberly, Richard Adams movie illegally the men controlling the incident in the control room. Jack Godell, head of the control room, prevented the reactor from getting a disaster. After an investigation into the incident, nothing was wrong, Jack couldn't help but felt something was not right. To discover that the welding joints are cracked on the generator pump, try Jack and Kimberly and Richard to tell the public and shut down the unsafe plant. <br /> <br /> Nearly thirty years ago, The China Syndrome is a resounding drama that still holds so much relevance today. Nuclear power has always been a very debated topic, whether it is the safest source of alternative energy, radioactive waste, and nuclear power stations waiting to be the next Chernobyl. Just not about nuclear power, The China syndrome examines freedom of speech, right of press and big business. On Jack's findings of fake information, his knowledge ceases a massive investment on the construction of another nuclear plant, many of which men are trying to take advantage of. Kimberly, who desperately wants to get out of the news, sees the battle for truth as more important than promoting her career; constantly pressed by Richard, never wanted to be stopped and demanded the public be told of the accident. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas and Jack Lemmon are simply flawless. Fonda shows Kimberly as a fragile woman on her outside, but emotionally hard and determined to reveal this cover. Douglas brings a strong performance to Richard, who fights honestly and truthfully. Lemmon shines on everyone like Jack. His performance is highly charged drama. <br /> <br /> The China Syndrome is looking, but today it is still very important as it did when it was first released.
