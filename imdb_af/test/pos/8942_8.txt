Wales seems to be spreading some quirky movies recently. In fact, Wales seems to be developing its own small film industry. I recently saw many Annie Mary, what I thought was very good. But Plots with a view is not only odd, it is aloud, has a company of wonderfully talented actors (Brenda Blethyn is wonderful) and a plot that, although not quite original, is so cleverly written that one always has pleasure picking What can almost be discarded lines. It was the kind of movie I wanted to see again, it was over, and one of the ones I really wanted to own. Although many of the characters are caricatures, and you must have been to a Welsh town to appreciate it, they are also very human, and the report between Blethyn and Molina is a pleasure to see.
