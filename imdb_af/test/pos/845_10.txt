I'm sorry to see that it is lower by many. The series started very well and after the first season it was not so good. <br /> <br /> People tend to forget about the beginning of something and just look at the end. It's not good to do, you have to look at the total, not the end result. It is sad that many of the "ordinary" characters are dead, but sorry, we have very nice NEW characters. <br /> <br /> Don't stick to a few characters, but stick to the series, the storyline. Please understand that I did not like it when Boone died, when Augur died but well ... this must be done. Can you imagine that everyone will live the whole series when they have been in great danger all the time? Come on, face, if they don't die, they would be invincible. In this way you will always keep the tension, will he survive, will he die? I realize that people attach themselves to characters, I do. My favorite character was Augur, the one who could get in every computer he wanted. He was the one who was mysterious. He could do things with the computer nobody else could do. <br /> <br /> Do I want to make a statement to all the people who vote negatively, making a series that started so well deserving such a low rating? Should we look at the final season instead of the total? Shouldn't we see how good the series was when it started? Shouldn't we see how much we enjoyed it?
