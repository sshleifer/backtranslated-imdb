Being a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to watch the movie. I enjoyed every minute of it. It plays out in a very sincere way. Throughout the movie Natalie seemed to be the mother and Susan was the mother. Susan's character still made poor decisions and burned through it. <br /> <br /> I heard there should be a love village that includes Natalie and an old man (he is in Outside Providence), but Natalie will only accept the writing when that scene is removed. And I think it's wonderful. I think a love level would destroy the scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> Natalie should have a good thing about choosing good movies because she hasn't seen her in a bad movie yet. So, a movie that Natalie Portman has, will undoubtedly be seen by me. <br /> <br /> A good movie. 10/07
