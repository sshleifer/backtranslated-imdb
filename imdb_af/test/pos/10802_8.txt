Many American peas who worship and support the political half-truths of hucksters like Michael Moore will do well to sit through this movie more than once and see how hypnotic manipulators can frighten, intimidate and lead an underlying public and people get. Fear or murder killed, played and mutilated. Robespierre in this fine epic death makes the opposition by remote control, all in a passion of self-righteous dedication to its principles. We get the impression that Robes considers it justifiable to cut off his opponents' heads, even when he sent his followers to blame false and misleading charges against the state. Today, the captains of our institutions of rotting media are much more sensitive that Robes ... they just murder your character with innuendo and false charges laid down without foundation or resources. Witness Dan's efforts to kill W's character on the eve of the 2004 election, or the constant drumbeat that was stolen from the 2000 election, although constitutional scholars continue on such irresponsible drives.
