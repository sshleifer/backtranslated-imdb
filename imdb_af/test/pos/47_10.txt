Lackawanna Blues is an excellent film. The casting was perfect. Each actor and actress was perfectly suited to the role they played. Their chemistry together was wonderful. The acting was excellent. I felt like I knew the characters. I could almost feel them. They reminded me of people I knew as a child growing up in the 50's and 60's. Oh, the memories !! My personal belief is that this movie had to be on the big screen so everyone could see. I watched this movie so many times, that I could almost call the lines as the characters they say. I can't even list my favorite part because I have so many favorite parts. Thank you for bringing back some of my youth I have never seen before. And it's black people who love each other, look each other, respect each other, care for each other and do everything we do. can help each other. Gotta go now. I have to look again.
