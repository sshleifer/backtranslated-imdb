*** SPOILERS *** This movie shows the brutal massacre caused by Johnny Carson's retirement to determine who will succeed. The impersonations of David Letterman and Jay Leno were performed satisfactorily by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, although the performances were not great. Reni Santoni is the best performer of the execs (he plays NBC's John Agoglia), and Warren Littlefield (played by Bob Baliban) is a close second. I was shocked by the way Littlefield spoke eagerly to Johnny Carson. This was Johnny Carson! This scene is the vantage point, what-you-do-for-my-recent television world. Kathy Bates delivered the best performance of the movie as Jay's agent, Helen Kushnick. Another commentator claims that Leno is portrayed as a simpleton in the movie. I don't even respect. The relationship with Kushnick was on something similar to domestic violence. She commands him, and when he ends up rebelling against her, she tries to play the sympathy card (stating her dead husband and son); However, when Jay ends their relationship, she becomes violent again and shouts: "Don't leave me, your bisexual bastard!" before you hit a photo on the floor. Overall, the movie is hilarious, and I wish it was shown more often.
