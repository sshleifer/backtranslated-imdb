Now here's a movie that does something that hasn't been done long. It takes ten or so different elements we already know (Vampires, martial arts, techno beat, top-of-the-line special effects, etc.), and change it into something that is brand new. In what can easily be a combination of Mortal Kombat and Buffy: The Vampire Slayer, Wesley Snipes (no favorite of mine since and mostly due to "Passenger 57") has given a very good turn than the half-man / half-blood sugar. He acknowledges the internal conflict, but no longer likes it. He made Blade such a character as Michael Keaton made Batman. <br /> <br /> I would say that the only part of the movie that cut me a little was the ever-present horror movie cliche of that one person who happens to know who exactly knows how to to stop evil man. On the other hand, you have to put it in a movie as it is, so it's easily excusable. <br /> <br /> Well, Snipes are good. And Steven Dorff, who is being sunk in the preview, makes a more than bad, bad guy, to Snipes's hero. He has class, presence and enough control in his little pink to teach Al Pacino how to show it a little. Who would ever think that a cartoon movie would be a start for an actor? I hope this is. And who! where did Kris Kristofferson have dramatic talent? Don't get me wrong, but the productive actor has done nothing since the Millennium, done anything memorable, and how many of us just watched the cool video box? Well, here he is, people, in a very Obi-wanish turn, as Blade's mentor and dad figure. And also good work. <br /> <br /> The quality of the acting is consistent with the quality of the choreography and special effects. Guided by a pulsating techno beat, bring back the scenes and remind gold memories of Mortal Kombat. Hey! It also had a script! I wondered what happened to all the good writers out there. <br /> <br /> The two key indications that I saw a quality movie were this; I had no sense of regret about paying full price to come in, a last-mentioned Schumacher "Batman", "The Avengers", "MK: Annihilation," "Godzilla," or "Armageddon." (Wow, how many of them came out this year? Ugh) I also look forward to the inevitable follow-up, as per the end of the movie. Let's hope they work just as well as with the first one. <br /> <br />
