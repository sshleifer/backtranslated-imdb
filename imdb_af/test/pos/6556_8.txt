Uzumaki is a visually stunning movie, but I felt as if some of the story line could be sacrificed. There is hardly a character development that has personally detached me from the film, which is ironic because all words are set aside. This movie really pulls you with its very light spiral effects and beautiful scene transitions. Initially, overall cinematography threw me off, but if you get used to the overall look, you start to see the beauty in this twisted movie. It's a great movie if you're looking for a viewer with too much dust or deeper meaning. It's a big horror movie that's not really scary or exciting, but somehow ... eerie.
