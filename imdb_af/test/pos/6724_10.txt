I saw the Korean version of Daisy first. It came as a simple love story that flowed nicely from start to finish. I saw it 3 times while waiting for my copy of the director's cut to arrive. <br /> <br /> Then I got the GS and watched it. Wow! I think it's the first REAL director's cut I've ever seen. Amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions! The GS is laid out like a hardcore thriller, with the love story in the background. It moves at a slower rate than the Korean version. The variations between both versions are so drastic, it looks like two completely different movies. I thought I would be exhausted to watch the movie again, just looking out for the additional scenes. This was not the case. It really feels like I've watched a whole new movie. <br /> <br /> While the GS is 20 minutes longer than the Korean version, you'll find it difficult to determine where or what has changed. Cut off for 2 seconds. A second added there. A full scene added here. Another one erased there. In both versions, screens were added, deleted or snapped and reordered. In some scenes, whole rules of dialogue were replaced or re-ordered - while the scene itself was untouched. Even simple sound effects are added / omitted from each version - with a huge impact on the movie's sphere, and sometimes even changing the outcome of a scene. What a tender moment in the Korean version is is a sad, dreary one in the GS. The end of both versions leaves room for interpretation. As far as I can tell, both versions end a lot of others, and were so intended. <br /> <br /> I suppose most people will get the directors' cut of the movie and the movie will look decent, but a bit long and boring. If so, look for the Korean version. The same movie, but different feelings. I think there is a luxury 3-DVD version that contains both clips of the movie - not sure. <br /> <br /> The versions compliment each other so well that as a few Daisy I will see more often than I do any of my other favorite Korean movies. Only, I want to say the Korean version is a nice love story that I will watch once in a while. The director's cut, I might look once or twice, never again, because I find the pacing boring. But they go along as well! For what I consider best, I will first look at the Korean version. Then look at the director's track to fill in the gaps of the story you're curious about. <br /> <br /> Editing is the star of the movie.
