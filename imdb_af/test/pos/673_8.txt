I especially enjoy Delly's review of this movie and agree that Howard is not the only "damaged" character. Rather, Howard was mercilessly "drafted" by writing, but there is no evidence that his previous employer was actually dead or if she was, that he had killed her. Howard doesn't know and neither do we. In fright and confusion to see the woman lying there, he bolted. However, he never violates Helen Gordon, no matter how furious he is. In fact, he reacts horribly to Helen's poor spelling and the fact that he holds a pair of scissors ... then he resumes his clearance and greets the recovered Helen with the almost pathetic "I'm very tired now. I think I'll go home." go ". Frankly, I don't think he is a psychopath. A sick puppy, definitely, but not a psychopath. <br /> <br /> The problem with Howard is that he has no real male identity. He wanted to serve his country, but his mental state denied him a place in the army. He is single-rooted and isolated: no woman, no girl, no home (again, at least as far as we know). And he does a woman's job - "Floor's is my specialty". Helen's cousin is spreading this pride in his thoroughness by saying she wants a real job with a man. Also, although he attracts himself strongly to Helen, he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass. He is remarkably powerless - can't fight, can't work, can't make love. <br /> <br /> However, Helen is rightly afraid. She tries to join him, but to find that he has not responded (ie outside the comfort zone of her rosy memories of man Ned), unconsciously pushes all Howard's buttons by lying to him in her attempt to escape. <br /> <br /> Both characters trapped in the house, trapped by fear, neurosis, anger and memory, deserve sympathy. I know the sudden end has disappointed some reviewers, but I felt it was well-equipped, as it provided some kind of release to the characters. Helen was freed, I think, from the past. When Howard tries on her husband's coat of arms, Helen's disgusting reaction is highlighted. She undoubtedly feels that the "holiness" of Ned's possessions has been violated, but hopefully she must keep everything "untouched" in the reality of her own struggle with danger. Maybe she can continue. <br /> <br /> Howard is also liberated - from his endless cycle of anger, hurt, and violence. Whether moving to treatment or in prison, is debatable, but I hope it's the former. <br /> <br /> Great performances by Ryan and Lupino. I prefer "On Dangerous Ground", but it's also pretty good.
