Annie Rooney lives with her officer dad and brother Tim in the slums of New York, where she constantly engages in many battles with other neighborhood children. Annie secretly loved Joe Kelly (whose little brother Mickey is the head of the gang that Annie is constantly struggling with), who is in a gang that is having trouble, said officer Rooney. Kelly sponsors a dance, where Tony intends shooting Kelly to take him to him to make him look like a fool in front of his girlfriend, but Officer Kelly is fatally wounded. Tim (part of Kelly's gang) is told by Tony, and friend Spider, that Kelly shot his dad, so he went behind him in revenge. Annie learns about this and will stop her brother if she is on time. Very good mix of humor and heart in this movie, although the plot does not start until the 40 minutes of the movie. Pickford is nice (though she's 33 a girl no more than 12-13) and really gets her character. Haines doesn't play Kelly as hard as he should, but he can feel the audience emotionally. The screens where Annie tells her father's death and the end really put a lump in your throat. The mix of all kinds of kids throughout the movie is fun to watch. Evaluation, 8.
