Probably the best comedy in a long time. don't keep quiet! the acting is good and there are many hilarious cameos like Ben quieter than the guitar shop man. The plot was not as good as I had hoped, but the comedy provided for it. I can only hope for a sequel, as they seem to be able to do much more. Even though it was 1 hour and 40 minutes long, I wanted more at the end :) There is also a scene after the credits that are actually one of my favorite parts of the movie! I suggest it to anyone who loves a good comedy and definitely sets it up for fans of The D or Jack Black. You also have to buy the album, the songs are so damn catchy and hilarious, the music on it is also Top Notch.
