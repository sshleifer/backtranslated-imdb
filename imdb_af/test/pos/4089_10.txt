Why take a perfectly good original drama based on a perfectly good novel and repeat it as a quasi-musical? And throw it with actors missing exclusively in singing or dance talent? Something similar to "Showgirls" or the two most recent "Star Wars" movies, "Lost Horizon", is full of unintentional laughter. Who can forget Sir John Gielgud in his Dali Lhama outfit, conveying an interpretive dance to the Republican Party ("Family")? <br /> <br /> Whether Sally Kellerman is lovingly engaged to George Kennedy and does her best Cher impression. as she screams from one stone to another ("Every little thing you do")? And my favorite, Bobby Van, who embodies the power of America's education system ("Ask me an answer")? I can't wait for the DVD edition, because hopefully it will contain Liv Ullmann's remarks, which will eventually explain what she thinks when she agreed to do this movie!
