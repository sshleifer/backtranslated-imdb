I agree with Vince, this movie paved the way for Goodfellas. The scene where Pesci throws peanuts at the piano player reminds me of his "How am I funny?" routine in Goodfellas. It is a highly understated film and deserves attention. As with many other mobile movies, the theme of The Death Collector is true: Respect the Don.
