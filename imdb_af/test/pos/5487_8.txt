Back when I was a person, I remember having a very unpleasant customer to deal with who insisted on making everything on a personal basis. I told him things that my agency could do and couldn't do and he firmly believed that I was personally doing him what was fair to her. I swear but I thought to this man when I looked at John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood in their minds. <br /> <br /> In The Line Of Fire, Clint Eastwood throws as a veteran secretary at work in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was murdered. He had since had his doubts and was given to drink and his life was a real blow at once. He has now returned to the White House detail and when a possible killer's housewife rats on her tenant at the Secret Service, it is Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who pulls the case. <br /> <br /> But the killer is no ordinary crutch. case. He is a professional at his work, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a deserving Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost to Tommy Lee Jones that year for The Fugitive and I'm not sure, but I thought Malkovich was better. Perhaps Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent. in charge of his apartment while he was at work and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls Eastwood throughout the film and taps him. And after a while Malkovich says and does, Clint really gets personal. <br /> <br /> The presidential assassins we had in our history were happy amateurs, unless you believe in some of the conspiracy theories of some of the assassinations. A man like Malkovich, a professional with a real or imaginative resentment, is the most dangerous type of enemy. <br /> <br /> Other people in the movie are Fred Dalton Thompson as head of the White House (and would be president in real life), Rene Russo as another agent for the Eastwood male charming, John Mahoney as Secret Service Head, Gary Cole as Chief Secretary Diensman, White House Head, Gregory Alan Williams as Another Agent and Jim Curley. Sally Hughes as president and first lady. <br /> <br /> But when Malkovich is up, he owns In The Line Of Fire. The climax with him and Eastwood is unforgettable.
