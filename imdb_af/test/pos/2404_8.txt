I like this movie because it has a good approach to Buddhism, for example the way Buddhist use to care for all kinds of living things, combining fancy and real-life situations; In some areas, photography is very good and many messages about freedom, such as the hawk episode, are always focused in every moment, even in difficult situations. It also has funny situations like Swank's birthday and with these twice academic awards, her acting shows us how people who use to live in this kind of culture try to have a resistance behavior when Miyagi takes her to a Buddhist temple and how she slowly changed her mind. And of course, Pat Morita was always wonderful
