This movie is a joy to watch and should do well on DVD and video. I suppose you should actually be Irish to appreciate the subtleties such as accent, colloquialism and the clothing of some characters, but I can assure you that when Dylan Moran expands 'Barreler', imitation is most familiar to most people. from Dublin because we have many characters in our fine city who look, act and speak like this! The simple simple comedy in service and Michael Caines genius acting alone is worth the money, but in addition, the plot is awesome, the writing is fantastic and the dialogue is quick and exciting. A perfect light entertainment movie without the crazy mood of Jim Carrey.
