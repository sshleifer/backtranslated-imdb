This TV series is about a foolish and unconventional English man who comes up with all kinds of happy accidents. <br /> <br /> I remember my Mr Bean with my family back in 1990 when I was still a child. My family laughed so hard every episode, and its content is still in our daily conversation twenty years later. The memorable scenes still in my head are Mr. Bean trying to get out of his parking lot, shooting the lights, counting sheep and swimming in the pool. We've all bought Mr Bean videos on VHS, not how expensive they were. It was worth it because we watched them over and over! It's so rare to see a very funny TV series suitable for all ages.
