This is an excellent anime movie. It is well animated, has a good complex plot and very good music. I understand that some might think a little long, but I think it's a good length and the animation is a good traditional anime. <br /> <br /> THREE FEATURES: <br /> <br /> The way they use Tenkai is masterful. For example, the body doubling that appears in all these places adds to the ominous tone of the movie. The design of Tenkai is also good, how he looks like a monk and in the final scene the armor he wears. <br /> <br /> The old man Andou is on earth and a very nice character. When Jiro meets him, it's a turning point in the movie. <br /> <br /> Sanpei, the Satsuma Shinobi, who infiltrated the Tenkais clan, saves Jiros's life twice. However, he remains in the background most of the movie, but he is really one of the heroes of the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot: The plot is good. It is traditional without being original. The historic time it is worked out is interesting, The Meiji Restoration. The treasure is sought by Tenkai to repair the shogunates. When Jiro finds it, he uses it to help the anti-shogunate forces overthrow the shogunate. <br /> <br /> The way Tenkai tricks Jiro is interesting has a kind of "Hamlet" feel to it. There's also a sweet irony to the fact that if Tenkai didn't get Jiro to become a shinobi, I don't think he could finally kill him (maybe with firearm, but not with handguns). <br /> <br /> The plot with all the deaths makes it mostly dark, but there are a few light moments when we see Jiros's childhood memories. All in all, it's a good, dark, complicated plot. <br /> <br /> THE MUSIC: For example, the opening theme is very good with the electric guitar and drums. They occasionally use that piece I believe to be taiko drums, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There is very good music. Like the one played while traveling to the Iga shinobi. I believe the piece is called "Numatou" and has an incredible flute in it. The flute can be a pan flute, but more likely a shakuhachi. <br /> <br /> The end theme "Kamui no komoriuta" is calm and delicate. The choir is beautiful and so is the song in general. <br /> <br /> THE ANIMATION: <br /> <br /> The animation, while good, is not perfect and the blood that runs the characters sometimes looks orange. The transitions are interesting and I think some transitions are very nice. An example of a good transition is when Jiro and the Iga shinobi run, there is sunset in the background and the music is playing. The transition is simple but effective and also has a nice feeling. <br /> <br /> MY FINAL WORDS: I think the plot, the animation, the music and the characters make it one of the best anime movies I've ever seen.
