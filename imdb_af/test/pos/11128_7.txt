In New York, a group of gentlemen joined the High School of Performing Arts after successfully completing their audition. For four years their dreams, deception, success, love and personal dramas are unveiled by the uncertain Doris Finsecker (Maureen Teefy), the gay Montgomery (Payl McCrane), the aggressive Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray), the hopeful Coco (Irene Cara) , ambitious Ralph Garci (Barry Miller) and their friends at their graduation. <br /> <br /> Twenty-eight years ago, "Fame" was a great success, with the story of teenagers being a place in the show business, and I loved this movie and the soundtrack on CD. I just watched "Fame" on DVD, and currently I would say that it is just a great movie with great potential, but with too many erroneous subplots. The story follows too many characters and leaves many situations without answers. I don't know if Alan Parker had any issues to reduce the running time of this movie, but what happened to the ballerina going to a clinic for abortion? What happened to Leroy and his teacher, he failed because of his grammar problem? What happened to Coco after she pulled out her blouse in that shit's apartment? The musician playing synthesizer and his proud father is left in the subplot. Anyway, "Fame" is still a wonderful entertainment and a cult movie for me. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fama" ("Fame")
