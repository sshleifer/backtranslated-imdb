It was a good show ... I don't remember much about it, but remember to see it and love it. I remember the mother and the father. I really like the grandmother. She was like a grandmother you really couldn't appreciate until you became an adult. She was very knowledgeable and no nonsense. My favorite song on the show was Sardines in the morning. (which may not be the title) I remember after seeing that song and hearing that I went to Cleveland Ohio to visit my cousins ​​and I, and my sister sang so many songs that by the time we were all my cousins left, was singing too. I would also like to find it on DVD.
