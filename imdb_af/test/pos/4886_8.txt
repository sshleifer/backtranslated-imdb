Having only seen five episodes of the show before (I watched the repetitions on BBC Two), I didn't really have much experience of the League, but as an advanced fan as well as a massive fan of the British comedy, I can say this movie is hilarious. Since Herr Lipp, whom I didn't see on the screen before the movie, Briss and Geoff on the big screen was a great comedy experience. Being on the screen is something the League fully exploits, with heads blowing up (it will be surprised who it is) and gruesome murders with random medieval styles are totally fighting. <br /> <br /> Geoff is easily the funniest character of the three protagonists in this movie, as he has the best one liners and overall behavior, as in the series. One of my only disappointments with the movie was not Geoff's scream, even though there is a build-up in one part of the movie. "The movie itself is complete, to use the phrase everyone else does, Pythonesque and it is very reminiscent of movies like" Life of Brian. "Appearance of Tubbs and Edward was welcome, but Papa Lazarou's line" Hello Daves " crack me more than anything they said, (Lazarou is probably my favorite Vasey character after Tubbs and Edward.) It has a decent ending with one of the most important characters being dismissed and I just hope it's not the league The latest on-screen Vasey business, with Gatiss calling the possibility of another series or movie, is now very excited, a movie I will see again, partly because the projector is dead in the end and 10 minutes or so from the movie, but mainly because it is inventive and hilarious, I'm not really bothered if it's not as good as the TV series, because I loved it. <br /> <br / > One thing though, if you've never seen the league, you'll still love it, but Dave knows what You will think about the people who make these things. As Tubbs or Edward can put it, it's a local movie, for local people and a valuable thing. <br /> <br /> **** from ***** (4/5)
