I get very full of sitcoms; you feel you always know what's coming so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's very funny. I just bought the second set of the series, (Series 3 -4) and I'm surprised at how much I enjoy it all. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the very unseen crew members) because the entertainment they offer is worth it. The gems that came from this series and the respect that the actors have achieved through it speak for themselves. Croft and Perry created pure gold, some of which shine through Hi De Hi.
