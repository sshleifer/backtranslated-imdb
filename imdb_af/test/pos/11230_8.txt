"It all depends on how you look at it. We're either halfway to heaven or halfway to hell," says the Rev. Harlan in "Northfork." The Polish brothers' film is an ambitious one that will raise any intelligent viewer, provided he or she has patience and basic knowledge of Christianity. The film's entertainment levels take a viewer beyond the surrealistic and absurd imagery that is obvious to a less striking socio-political and theological commentary that a believing American should elicit to think about current social values. The movie's adoption of the surrealistic (coffins that come from the depths of man-made lakes to disturb and disturb the living house-father, who almost crucify their feet on the wooden floor of their homes, angels who need more glasses to read , etc.) and absurd images (of half of animals, half of the toys that are alive, of door bells that make the most of musical output from a harp, a blind angel writing illegible signs, etc.) can make a viewer unfamiliar with the surrealistic and absurd traditions of literature and the art of wondering what the film is like excitement and entertainment. Although the European film is better in this field, Hollywood has indeed made such a film in the past in "Cat Ballou", Lee Marvin and his horse leaned against the wall to take a lunch, decades ago. "Northfork," in one scene of the citizens who left the town in cars, was apparently paying tribute to driving cars in Citizen Kane to take Kane and his wife from Xanadu for a picnic. <br /> <br /> The movie is difficult for the unimpeded or impatient filmmaker? The most interesting epilogue (one of the best I can remember) can be heard as a voice until the end of the credits. The directors seem to give the best moments to those who can end up with film. If you have the patience, will you enjoy the layers of the movie? If you make an effort or swallow that drives out the Polish, you will enjoy a lot of taste. <br /> <br /> What is the movie about? ? At the most obvious layer, a town is evacuated to make way for a dam and hydroelectric project. Even cemeteries are excavated so that the deaths of the dead can be moved to a higher cemetery. Property promoters pick up the lake next to the more than 6 people who can exchange the townspeople. Of the 6, it is only one who has a conscience and can order chicken chicken soup, while others cannot serve them. <br /> <br /> At the next layer you have Christianity and its interaction with the townspeople. Most are religious Christians, but in many cases the instinct to survive is at the expense of true Christian principles, as suggested by the priest. Many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions. <br /> <br /> At the next layer you have the world of angels who interact with the nearby angels and with each other. You realize that the world of the unknown angel who holds a cartoon about Hercules and finds dreams of a mother finds one in an androgenic angel, Flower Hercules. While the filmmaker gives clues that Flower is an extension of the young angel's boring imagination, the following actions of Flower will believe this option. You are indeed in the world of angels - not gods, but the pure in spirit and therefore not in the world of the living. The soft focus of the camera is in these shots. <br /> <br /> At another layer, Irwin's toy airplane becomes a true plane carrying him and his angels to heaven 1,000 miles away from Norfolk. <br /> <br /> The final layer is the social comment ?? "The country is divided into two kinds of people. For people and Chevy people." Is there a difference? They think they are different, but both are consumers. <br /> <br /> For the religious, the film says, "Pray and you will receive" (words by Fr Harlan quoted by Angel Flower Hercules). For the consumer, the film says "it's what we do with our wings that separate us" (each of the 6 selectors also has wings: one duck / goose feather held in their hat straps, but their behavior often differs far from English as suggested through different responses to a scratch on a car.) <br /> <br /> The movie is definitely not the best American movie, but it is definitely a significant groundbreaking work - excellent visual, striking performances (especially Nick Nolte), and a loaded script offers several levels of entertainment for adult audiences.
