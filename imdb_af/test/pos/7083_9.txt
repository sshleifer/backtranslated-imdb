I loved one real thing since the first time I watched it in the theater and drove out my eyes. I bought it once it was available and lost all the times I watched it. <br /> <br /> For me, a real thing is the best family relationship movie. I like to look at the relationships in the family change and develop into what they eventually become. I can relate to the movie with a lot of details. My mother died of bone cancer, so it really touches me at home. Maybe that's why I love so much. <br /> <br /> I love the relationships between the children and their parents, and the relationship between brother and sister, but especially love the relationship between husband and wife. For me, it's really beautiful. <br /> <br /> I recommend this move to anyone who enjoys this kind of movie.
