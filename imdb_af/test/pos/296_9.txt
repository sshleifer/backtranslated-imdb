I've seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and I never get tired of it just because it's perfect. And it also has the best movie music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. I mean you should just like Robert Duval, Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne of this movie, but especially Duval. I can't believe Kramer vs Kramer won an Oscar instead of this wonderful war movie. So this is my conclusion if you are the director of the world's greatest film (The Godfather) and the best Hollywood actors, you can only succeed. Now I just have to write something to get this preview, don't read this except the last line. This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
