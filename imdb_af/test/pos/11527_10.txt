I have to admit it is one of Cameron Diaz's unheard-of films and I was also surprised that she had an important role, but she wasn't the head. I was very touched because I can identify the pain of losing a loved one, as I have experienced from close range. <br /> <br /> Both Camilla Belle and Jordana Brewster were really good at their portrayal of protagonist Phoebe and I also have to hand it over to the decisive people to find two actresses who looked like I really thought they were sisters (in real life). It's one of those movies Cameron did for acting and not for star billing. She saw the part of the beautiful, rebellious hippie that the world wants to change, but sometimes she comes off without a rebel. <Br /> <br /> From a dysfunctional family where her only stronger source is her great sister Faith, girl Phoebe is understandably upset when faith goes to Europe. As she grows up, she goes in search of her sister and is gradually disillusioned by the truth about her sister and falls to her sister's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Great story and equally good place to shoot European. I'll see it again.
