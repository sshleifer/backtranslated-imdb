Years ago, I didn't love and respect the movies of Jimmy Cagney, as much as I do now. I noticed that many of Cagney's films made with the Warner Brothers in the 1930s were lacking in realism and his acting style was far from subtle. The more I watched these movies, the more I found myself addicted despite these aspects. In fact, I love and love them! Fans of ancient Hollywood movies probably understand what I say - teenagers and other young candy buds do! Well, when it comes to entertainment, the MAYOR OR HELL never leaves from start to finish. While the idea of ​​a shady character like Cagney has played to take a reform school, is ridiculous, and although all the changes he made have also seemed far-fetched, it all worked out somehow and provided good entertainment . <br /> <br /> The gang of tough thugs was Pre-Dead End Kids and instead of leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall and Billy Hallop, the same roles are played by Frankie Darrow and Farina. Yes, I said "Farina". This black actor was already known for his roles in the Our Gang comedies and was, one or more, believed to be one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood. All he needed to give up was an undisputed name and has a good stereotypical Negro. Here he was pretty good and the usual black stereotypes are a little more muted than usual. However, some will go on the very funny, but terribly offensive court, involving Farina and his father, Fred 'Snowflake' Toones. With terrible names like "Farina" and "Snowflake", don't say I didn't warn you. <br /> <br /> Apart from this little complaint and a plot that is hard to believe, the movie is exceptional and fun. The kids do a good job, just like Cagney and Dudley Digges in a truly despicable but exciting role as the evil keeper. Also, as an added plus, you get the perennial Warner actor Allen Jenkins in his first role for the studio.
