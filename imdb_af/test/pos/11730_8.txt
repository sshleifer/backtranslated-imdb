So Burt Reynolds describes this film, which seems to be his best ever. He plays Tom Sharky, a deputy detective tracing an international killer (Vittorio Gassman) and the man he finances to be the next governor of Georgia (Earl Holliman). In the novel by William Diehl, the story is more complex because the man runs for president. It is a very long film that feels more than three hours instead of two. The filming in downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza hotel just puts the mood right for the story. Reynolds does not play much in this one compared to his comedy films. He is very serious here, especially in the beginning of the movie because he is muted for a dull breast that goes wrong. Sometimes the movie plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime movie with Burt trying to get close to the gang of the gang. Only at the end of the film is the violence brought on by the clap climax. Like the great jazz score in DIRTY HARRY by Lalo Schifrin, Sharky's Machine has an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many gas stars like Chet Baker, Julie London, Flora Purim and Buddy De Franco, The Manhattan Transfer, Doc Severinson, Sarah Vaughan and Joe. Williams. All Capps handle the score with magic. This movie is one of the best crime drama ever. Check it out. <br /> <br /> Score, 8 out of 10 stars
