One Dark Night is a staple food in the 1980's low budget horror genre. Filled with retro puns, clothes and scenery, "ODN" transports the viewer to a simpler time, when horror movies were just that ... Scare! <br /> <br /> Nothing so intense that you can't understand what's going on, the movie tells a dark fable of what's happening when you're wasted with the dead. Well acted upon by this is a stable screaming queen, and a fine direct work by Tom McLoughlin, who flames in time and makes you believe what he offers. There is no "who did this?" and certainly not a big turn at the end. It's straight forward and in your face, from start to finish, with many 80's humor being thrown in for extra spices. I just give it '8' simply because some of the special effects fall short of the end of the movie, but at least there's no CGI. Perfect movie for new fans until the 1980's horror genre or someone who wants to live a happy evening of classic horror happiness.
