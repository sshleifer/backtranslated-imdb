This is my favorite Renoir from the fifties. This is the story of how Henri Danglard built and started the Moulin Rouge nightclub. We see the workers being blown on the site to get construction started, and the training of the dancers. Finally, the slumber of opening night and the long drive cancan dance. Financial problems and the ego performances of the artists are described. <br /> <br /> Gabin is in good shape as the easy Danglard - sees him humorous with Nini's violent boyfriend. Gianni Esposito moves as the capricious prince who goes to Nini's court. Maria Felix, with the Amazon's body, sets up selfish Lola, Danglard's first lover. Finally, Françoise Arnoul as Nini, the washing girl dancing for Danglard and his girlfriend, is just stunning; A bonus: we get Edith Piaf, Patachou, André Claveau and other stars in cameos who played the stars of a century ago that ruled over the Moulin Rouge.
