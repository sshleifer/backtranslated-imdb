It's a pretty good thing for TV movie of the "what if" variety. As in, who, as terrorists, exploded a 'dirty bomb' into a big city, in this case, London. Many of the people who say, "We're all in case of an emergency," then reveal that they don't tell the full story. And is there someone who prepared such a thing? You can't bet. It shows the material for the bombs that are smuggled into the country, the making of the bombs, the secrecy and the double lives that people are leaving behind, etc. It also shows civil servants (ie firefighters) to save their people when they get no help, when government doesn't want to send anyone in the affected area. Also show how difficult insufficient preparations for such an incident are, as the government speaks everything, but then they open their mouths while the tragedy unfolds. And can this happen in the good old USA? Well, unless you've been living in caves for the past 20 years, something already has some extent and don't bet someone would be willing to make something of this nature. It's pretty realistic and yes, even scary. Well worth seeing, but just hope nothing like it ever really happens. 8 out of 10.
