It occurs "the ten commandments" "land of pharaohs", "Ben Hur" and it is overlooked today. How unfair! Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel, it is not made cheap! Waltari's novel was so large that only a miniseries could have Waltari, whose message is essentially Christian, remains intact (another of his books "the secret of the kingdom" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the holy land. <br /> <br /> "The Egyptian" is the rise of a monotheism near Christianity long before Christ. The Pharaoh (Wilding) is a kind of Messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the real kingdom is not in the material world: he asks to recover well for evil! And he has disciples, who eventually turn into martyrs (the scene when Simmons and the other worshipers of the Sun God are killed, is visually amazing, looks like a pagan ballet) priests, on the other hand, this new religion would mean the end of their influence on the population, and therefore they seek a strong man (Adult) who can lead the army against the Hittites as well as against their dangerous compatriots Another religion, or non-religion, we must say is S inouh√© (Purdom) who believes in nothing for two hours (the order of the sand grain is absolutely sensational and the whole movie rises well above the average peplum !!) <br /> <br /> There is another fascinating side: the movie looks like a flamboyant melodram. Not only for the script (especially Pharoah's sister (Tierney) final revelation preceding the two commandments over two years), but also the splendor of cinematography: Viviani, in his book on Curtiz, talks about a Baudelairian atmosphere, blue and gold. especially in the scenes involving the prostitute (Darvi) who considers her reflection in the water of her bath, highest narcissism. Around the hero, all the characters disappear, appear again, but when they reappear, they followed their path and all the subplots came with complete skill. Besides, as is often the case in the "modern" melodramas, the story is It's a wonderful sword and sandals, which had a strong influence, not only in America, but also in Europe, especially in Europe. in Poland where Jerzy Kawalerowicz regulates a spellbinding "pharaoh" (1966) owed much to Curtiz.
