Colombian terrorists host a military school in the US until their demands are met. The students decide to fight back. Will they be able to do this? <br /> <br /> Silly performance, but the movie actually works. The group of children who fought were up and down when this film came out in 1991: Sean Astin (look very cute); Wil Wheaton (look miserable); Keith Coogan; George Peres (the token Latino that is very attractive, very muscular and mostly shown only in clear underwear); TE Russell (the token black man) and Shawn Phelan. None of them are very good actors (except Astin), but who cares? It's a sensible action movie. The only other good performances are from Denholm Elliott (with a ball as head) and Louis Gossett Jr as dean. <br /> <br /> Unlike that - there is a lot of action, excitement, explosion and some brain. . In other words --- FUN! <br /> <br /> Only complaint (and it's minor) - it's a bit too long (there are THREE ends) and there is a lot of impatient bloody violence (the R score is well deserved). Yet I enjoyed it very much.
