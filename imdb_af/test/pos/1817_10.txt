I remember seeing this movie when I was 13 years old and I was in love with it and I was a big fan of the movie and the characters I worshiped. My favorite character was Stacey (Heidi Holicker) because she made me laugh when she had no interest in Fred (Cameron Dye), who really liked her and I hoped they would eventually come together as her boring boyfriend, Ralphie Christopher Murray) because he ignored her and hung up with his friends. I love the cast and the story. I always love the part when Fred tries to come with Stacey, and I always remember when he pursued her behind the car. But it was so good. I will always remember that this is in my teens. Now that I'm 33 years old and I picked up my copy on DVD and will look forward to it.
