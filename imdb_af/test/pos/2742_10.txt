This short, winning Oscar, won two successors and a TV cartoon program, with minimal animation, but adelightful script (by Theodore Geisel and Dr. Seuss) and a more memorable and enchanting main character. UPA brought an animated style that even influenced Disney in the mid-1950s and produced some of the best animated shorts made in the late 1940s and 1950s. It's at their best. God must have it in print. Highly recommended.
