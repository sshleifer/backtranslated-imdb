The trio is a pleasant, nostalgic journey to that first hint of desire - when it comes to the simple exploration of the unknown - before we grew up and added that the complexity of HIV status, emotional baggage and gotta run my-pager-just-gone in the emotional mix. <br /> <br /> The anxiety depicted is pure adolescent anxiety, but true to all three stories. Their sweetness and positivity make you feel gay. And kinds of movies are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Good news! Both Boys Life and Boys Life 2 is now available on DVD from September 1999.
