A recent survey of children in the United Kingdom applied the idea depicted by this film 27 years ago. It's more than anything else, young people want to grow up to be known to someone. They were doctors and firemen who wanted to be children. Now everyone wants to be known. Fame is a story of a group of children accepted into the New York City Performing Arts School. We saw their first audition, then took classes and learned about life for the next four years. The film has very good qualities, but finally makes you feel a bit dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Alan Parker's brave style fits the story well. The film is classified as musical, but more than anything, it is a drama. Music numbers and dance routines break out here and there, and Parker keeps them as close to realistic as they really could have been filmed. The acting is mostly top-loading with a few exceptions. The pacing is a bit off, especially at the end of the movie, but by that time the story has taken some wrong turns anyway. <br /> <br /> First, the auditions at the beginning of the movie had to take out some of the principles characters. It seems unlikely that anyone will arrive and audition for one department and then bump into another through their admissions. Some of these people don't look as talented or interested in getting started. As soon as the first year of classes begins, the film comes in a nice groove. The interaction between students and teachers is handled very well, and it makes you want more. The film later loses itself if we see more and more of the students' lives outside the school. Some of these people just don't mind. <br /> <br /> The movie's biggest mistake makes the Ralph Garcy character so prominent. This man is a drill; self-centered jerk. A "professional a-hole" he proudly declares on stage during his comedy routine. The audience should somehow feel this man and his tragic personal situation, but I just hoped they would throw his butt out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people you will care about when the film is over. Try as I please, I still can't develop like Anthony Ray in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is good. It's memorable, interesting and full of brave scenes and performances. It may be a bit too long, and maybe some of the wrong characters are fully developed, while other types of hover are in the background. The music numbers are wonderful, and there is even a surprise or two waiting to be discovered by the time the movie is over. Although not perfect, Fame will be a movie that will remain in some way in the future. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
