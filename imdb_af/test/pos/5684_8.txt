Well done, no CGI crap. Was anyone else on the "Dar Crocs" tour of Darwin's Adelaide River? Black Water was WAY realistic; Rogue was a bit cringeworthy. <br /> <br /> Think the blonde chick was great in it - hasn't really seen her yet. And the other chick is a babe, she is always excellent. <br /> <br /> Detecting V. - I will compare it to Jaws about any other man eating an animal. <br /> <br /> Without knocking the hole Aussie thing without you even going OTT with struths and crikeys. <br /> <br /> Love it!
