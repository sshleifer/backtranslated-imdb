In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other, both of them being strangers. Steven Spielberg watches ET, a John Carpenter see The Thing. Of them, ET was the one who won the hearts of people all over the world, although The Thing first debuted. Since people were so entranced with Spielberg's hot, fuzzy feel good alien fable, they kept away from The Thing in droves. <br /> <br /> It's not hard to see why. The two are diamond-shaped. One is an optimistic story designed to warm the chickens of the silent heart. The other is a hard, uncompromising movie that paints alien life as something purely resolute to destroy us. I think audiences felt ET was a much better prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime-like saliva! <br /> <br /> It's been time, but The Thing has won a significant cult audience. As it should. For the thing is that rare example of a superior remake. It takes all the best features of the 1951 classic, and revives them in surprising and imaginative ways. Indeed, Carpenter does his job so well he actually manages to make a movie that is equal in every inch to the genre's forerunner, Alien. And it's even worse! <br /> <br /> Carpenters' film follows its source material more faithfully than did the thing from another world. This keeps the antique antiquity waste as an environment, as it is the perfect backdrop when trying to establish an increased sense of isolation. But although a little thin on characterization, remake gets right within the minds of the actors, reinforcing the uncertainty and fear that surrounds them slowly. <br /> <br /> Regular Carpenter employee, Kurt Russell, returns with the success of New York's escape, throwing again as one of Carpenter's ongoing anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (who investigates them is anyone's guess). The trouble starts when a Norwegian helicopter from a nearby station flies over MacReady's and tries to shoot a Siberian Husky from the air. <br /> <br /> They die for their troubles and while the camp is trying to solve the problem of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own. Except that this Husky is not a Husky at all. But a shape-changing alien. The Norwegians found it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed, they killed their crew. Being able to absorb its victims in turn can duplicate a living being in the smallest detail. Soon the paranoia and suspicion are going through the 12-man crew until no one knows who man is and who is not. <br /> <br /> The thing is one of John Carpenter's best movies. In fact, I'm tempted to say she's the best movie he ever made. Even outdated classic like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason I put The Thing on the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last movie of her that can really be called a classic. All the others felt that Carpenter had slipped it. Movies that have not flowed with the cool sophistication and worn intensity so prevalent in its previous works. <br /> <br /> But The Thing had John Carpenter at the height of his powers. Never before has he raised such an unbearable degree. Not even in the brutal attack on territory 13. From the second side, the stranger makes his presence known, Carpenter cuts the tension level defenselessly. And when he delivered his bumps, they came with a disturbing push. <br /> <br /> The film is a mixture of pure atmospheric and visceral horror. An approach that is often in conflict with each other, but carpenter's hands are beautifully listed. He introduces Rob Bottin or The Howling, intending to wear some of the astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror movie. Amorphous shapes. Half-shaped human features, strongly contrast with gaping jaws, spiders and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed, the film's effects are so incredible and disturbing, the thing has come under fire because it's too realistic! <br /> <br /> That type of thinking completely misses the point. It only lowers the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter just steps an effect when he needs it. It is in the movie's more subtle moments where he looks, especially aimed at the story. The Thing is an often confusing story of shadows, whispers and implications. Characterization has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to its advantage in The Thing. Knowing nothing about the scroll hole just makes the current situation much more confusing. We are never sure, from one moment to the next who's who. And for that reason, the thing is very good and keeps its secret on the following views. <br /> <br /> A special mention should be made to the excellent film by Ennio Morricone. Every two seconds, a pulsating drop is plunged. It creates an exciting, haunting feeling that is very difficult to shake. The whole movie is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they test each other's blood to see who's human being is sustained by Carpenter with such agility. Perhaps you find yourself at your nails without first realizing. <br /> <br /> The thing is a purely unadulterated classic. Even the end, with the vague, suggests that everything is not resolved. An underrated movie, worth the revaluation it received. And so much better than ET!
