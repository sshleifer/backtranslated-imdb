I'm a big fan of Lonesome Dove and all the books in the series and I love the movie. I was glad to see that they were finished with Comanche moon. I was a long fan of Steve Zahn and was keen to see him in a serious role. Personally, I think Steve Zahn did a great job of re-creating Gus. I can't think of another actor who would have been better. He has the voice, the ways, the pronunciation of the word to a T. Granted, no one can ever hold a candle to Robert Duvall as Gus, but I think Steve Zahn did a good thing. Karl Urban does the same in all the movies he was in, and he made a good match for Woodrow Call. As for the movie itself, yes, it's a bit corny, but can you really beat Lonesome Dove? No, I do not think so.
