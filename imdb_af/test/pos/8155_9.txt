Hey old, these movies are all about choices. All the times in your life you have to choose something or just go by ... And this movie proves it! Of course, life is not like a beautiful picture like this movie shows. It does not show, but some can figure it out. I try to say it is full of pain, love and deep lessons of life. Aaron, the Mormon missionary, is the real shepherd who looks the thing beautifully deep inside Chisthian views, the skin man ... <br /> <br /> It's a good ending and you always believe in destiny because it will surprise you in turn or in others of your life like Last Days ... <br /> <br /> Big deal watch it !!!
