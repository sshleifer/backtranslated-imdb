I read the other comments here on this movie before I see it. If you've read them, you'll know they're almost all negative. I really don't understand it. I admit it is too long (it takes about half an hour to accelerate it). The music is often inappropriate. But, strong performances by Ford and Thomas are indeed enough to carry. With all his fame as a movie star, I've forgotten that Harrison Ford can really act! This role as a man who has defined himself on the basis of a lie is remarkable. I find it completely credible that he wants all the details he can get so he can see what was real and what was fraud. Thomas is always wonderful and it is no exception. Her initial denial that leads to confusion and then to inner calm is great. This movie never gets on someone's list of big flashes, but it's not that bad. I'm glad I waited to watch it on video, but it's worth $ 3 or $ 4.
