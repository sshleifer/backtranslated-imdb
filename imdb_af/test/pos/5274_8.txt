It's a confusing, absurdist short. A miller, dressed in white, makes a way to a windmill in a deserted landscape. Although the picture is delimited, there is a clear logic here. However, he is stopped by the whip, all in black because of his work. They didn't pummel for any specific reason - did the snooty miller insult the sooty whip? Is this class war? <br /> <br /> Whatever he does, he fights his opponent with bags of grain that fly all over the battle, making everything he did before the fight, and making the windmill redundant so everyone is as useless as the battle. . The mill's grain, in terms of the curse's blackness - later the Westerners would not be so subtle, heroes and villains were colored. Is there a racial hue here? <br /> <br /> If that wasn't great enough, the fighters were screened out by a crowd of people who came from nowhere, an appropriate Kafkaesque ending in a strange story (or is it just the social conscience that rises against a battle that denies order and purpose?), and very unusual in the days of early silence. This combination of comedy, surrealism and the Absurd is a preliminary precursor to BUster Keaton, while the windmill reminds us of one of the great thrillers, Hitchcock's 'Foreign Correspondant'.
