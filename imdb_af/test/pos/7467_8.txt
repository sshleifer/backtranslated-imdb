I had the pleasure of relinquishing these two chairs from (one of?) The Executive Producer at the Atlantic Film Festival, which was interesting because he laughed at many different times than the rest of us. <br /> <br /> Filmed In the Atlantic Ocean, the film is about three teenage girls who spend a lot of energy in one of their last summers of their youth to sleep with a married 30-year-old man, despite many protests. <br /> <This is definitely worth a watch, but the humor was a completely different demographic approach than the one I lived in (Male 18-25), so I shook my head on the character's antics rather than to laugh. In suspense, the story is strong enough to stop, making it entertaining, without much laughter.
