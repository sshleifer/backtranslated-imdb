I watched this series after watching the Naked Gun movies. I got it much better than the movies, and I thought the movies were great! This series literally sticks you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun, siggag, or a funny situation (the entire night scene, club flamingo). I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in a TV series in my life, even after I first saw the movies and knew about the jokes. I think it's a pity that only six episodes have been produced, but I agree that the authors will be very busy maintaining this level of comedy for any more episodes. Overall, the series is a must see for those who love puns, bad jokes, and slapstick sight-gags.
