The cast alone tells you it will be a notch above the usual Italian western. Veteran actors Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy acted alongside Alex Cord, who at the time looked at the edge of the stars. The result is a knock-and-knock movie, yet it will satisfy those who are looking for more of a Western than just a popular game. Especially interesting here is the character Alex Cord plays. One expects the "hero" in this Western to be quiet and introspective, but "Clay McCord" is an extreme example and surprisingly, he is often in a passive, even poor position. There is much talk of the fact that he is afraid of falling to the epileptic fit his father immobilized. And in these moments of helplessness he is either the grace of those who want him or those who want to help him. To emphasize his passivity, Clay McCord - don't you love that name? - is often shaved to the waist as if it were little more than an attractive toy displayed on the scene. There is even a strong masochistic streak in his nature, most in evidence when used by his enemies as a fur bag and then suspended by his wrists and hung to the left above the middle of a street. He does not fail to protect himself often, but McCord is equally ineffective in protecting those around him. Almost everyone who helps him is murdered. <br /> <br /> While a minute to pray, a second to die, it's not a complete success, it has a depth and a tone that sets it apart and puts it in the hanging reminder. It is also a good showcase for Alex Cord, whose career tended to fall to this point after some promising years in the mid-1960s. He had to be about 36 years old when he filmed it in his physical first - and the scene of his hanging at his wrists, banging and sweating, is a memorable piece of movie cookie.
