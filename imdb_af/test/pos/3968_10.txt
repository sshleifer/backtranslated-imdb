When I watched this movie, I expected it to be an American American movie on the cheap with scary actors. I was really surprised to find that I was completely wrong. The movie centers around Bartely or B, which has been rejected from all his colleges. The actor who plays B is very natural and makes his character really look and decide to create a preschool school so his parents don't harass him. But many people see his fake website and join. To feel their grief, B, they can't turn much to the shame of his best friend. The college is the ideal place to learn with you what you want or do nothing. The school is in contrast to the right college that eventually ends it. The movie ends at a high and I recommend watching it. She's got it wrong, but it's a good, cheerful movie with some unpredictable twists and turns.
