When I was engaged, my fiancee and I would visit the adult bookstores. He will look at his favorite mags, and sometimes a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with the media, there was never a video I really enjoyed. I only saw one other movie when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it had a private eye that unraveled a thing) that actually had a good plot and was nice. All the others were blowing and blowing and what not. There are so many times you can see how a blonde bimbo is "doing it". <br /> <br /> This movie caught my eye and I migrated from there so he could wander the shop. He noticed (how difficult was it? Grins. I was really interested in something, lol (!) In the video section!) And come over and buy the slightly used copy for me. We took it home and loved it. Here was a "Porn" with a plot. I wasn't sure that it was even classified as porn, but I used the word loosely. <br /> <br /> The librarian was a character I could identify with. Alice rejected her boyfriend's advances. She was not comfortable with her own sexuality and prudish in her comments. Bill left, and she continued to go into books. The white rabbit ran through the library (one book, if you see now, I believe (it's ten years since I saw the movie) was by Lewis C.) and Alice, for the same reason that teenagers are pushing into the forest run when a chain saw movement is behind them, rather than on populated areas. This is the best way to get the plot ahead. Alice finds her in Wonderland. <br /> <br /> I hardly remember all the details, but I clearly remember the swim in the lake and how she was dried out. I liked how they got Humpty Dumpty Up again, the Mad Hatter's member size was on his hat to wear it proudly, and the brother's sister team from Dum and Dee (who disturbed me a bit - they could man was woman, but I never could say how many times I watched it). Alice's wife on the knight goes away and finds your own knight (What is a pretty girl like you do on a knight like this?). <br /> <br /> The part that really caught my eye when I looked It was about a year or so later one of the cards (3 of my heart, I think) that looks exactly like my ex's current wife ! We can't help bothering her about being in the movie! The King of Hearts was interesting, and the Queen was even more. Because of the openness of the forum, I can't go into details, just say it's "orgy" and we'll leave it there! <br /> <br /> When we broke up, I could take the video - he knew I liked it - but in the time since it was lost to borrow. I'll find another copy someday. <br /> <br /> VAT, if anyone can tell me what scene of the Amazon version has been cut, I'd really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> I warmly recommend this movie for over 18 people. It was soft, sweet, and really 70's, but I liked it very well. <br /> <br /> ***** out of 5. D.
