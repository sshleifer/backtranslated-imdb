'Never Been Kissed' is a good, good movie. If you haven't seen it yet, rent it out. I'm going to buy it if it's released because I loved it. Drew Barrymore is great again, she plays her part well. I felt that I could relate to this movie because the school days I had were just as bad. I thought the plot was well written, there was comedy and romance that is the type of movies I love. I loved the end, because even if you know what is going to happen, it's still waiting for you to sit down!
