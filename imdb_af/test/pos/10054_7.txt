Nicole Finn (Madonna) has just been released from prison. Although she is ordered to go to Philadelphia, she wants to stay where she was arrested. This is because she claims she has information that will clear her record. Louden (Griffin Dunne) is assigned to accompany her by the coach of his future father-in-law. Louden will, in any case (in his future mother-in-law, Rolls Royce) walk around, pick up the wedding ring and a rare big, big cat for an eccentric collector. However, Nicki begins the subsequent chaos as soon as she jumps into the Rolls to take over the line. Between big cats, taxi drivers, men, bridesmaids and a wedding cake with guns, lawyer Louden knows he's no longer in Kansas. Is there a way out of madness? This movie is a wild journey down comedy avenue. Madonna and Dunneare perfectly mock each other, making their commitment restless, as they play their roles as an ex-con and a direct, button-down lawyer respectively. The writing is commendable in the ability to send the viewer in touch with hysteria, as one unquestionable scene for the next and the next place. Everything secondary, from the supporting actors to the scenery, is also very nice. If you know someone who needs a little joy, hire this movie for them. You will be both cheerio pronto.
