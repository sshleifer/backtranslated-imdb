GoldenEye 007 is not just the best movie-in-play of all time, but it is perhaps the most influential first person shooter ever to touch the game console market. If you are not aware of the plot of this game, it is not a problem, as it is the same as the popular James Bond movie, GoldenEye, released in 1995 - two years before the release of this game. <br /> <br /> This is a game filled with techniques and styles that will be simulated in many future games, giving the player a wide variety of goals and difficult challenges. The A.I. is smart (especially at higher difficulty settings) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment as well as problems for any gamer. <br /> <br /> Introducing logical hits to your enemies is a good feature. Even bosses in this game can be shot at the head with a well-motivated shot. It is this kind of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak, sneak, get rid of your henchmen, or get alarms and go through massive shooting. As a result, there are many ways to win the game, and unlimited possibilities for achieving your tasks. AKA: You can take easy ways or difficult ways to beat levels ... and if you don't have a strategy guide, find out those paths yourself (which I can add is incredibly fun if you want a day off to waste). <br /> <br /> It's one of those games, the more you play it, the more you can appreciate its contribution to the gaming industry. Every time I play it, I see aspects repeated in many FPS games. So if you have a Nintendo 64, and dust that struggles and orders a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because as a Bond fan and a casual gamer, I can say that this game is highly recommended for anyone who wants to. Step into James Bond's shoes, or just a wonderful, intense gaming experience. <br /> <br /> (Also make sure you look out for his sister game, Perfect Dark, who also uses the same control on the N64, and uses very similar weapons.)
