Every review I have read so far has missed an important point. Shakespeare wrote for the accent and the verdict just as he did for other Norwegians in other plays. The Scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and becomes thoroughly spoken and the way it is taken. So, listen again and notice the difference. The play is well done and the rhythm of the words is so much better than used by people receiving, polite, well-explained English. I'm reminded of the time a teacher at a school in Leicester, unknowingly, asked me, at age 14, to read a piece of Walter Scott written in the tone of the border. I came from the border and when I read it, it had to make the difference.
