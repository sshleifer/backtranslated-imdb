This movie was both entertaining and memorable. I recommend it to anyone who wants to move and be challenged. Great play, directed - and it's Canadian to get started! It is a movie that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The sites in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype being sold these days, it is good to see that someone can work back an independent movie. For any family that has risen to overcoming a challenge or obstacle - whether financial or ill - this movie becomes a sounding cord! It approaches the notion of the afterlife in a contemporary way - without capitalizing cheaply on all the "gohst" and supernatural themes cluttered in Hollywood and TV networks.
