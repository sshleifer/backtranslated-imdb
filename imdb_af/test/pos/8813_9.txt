I have a completely biased position, mainly because I live and enjoy the club culture style. As a DJ and regular club-rider I see the honesty within this movie and I love it. If you don't know the club / rave culture, it will be a great success in that culture for anyone who doesn't know it firsthand. The honest portrayal of human emotion and issues in the part of Jip I loved. The characters were well built and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I really don't enjoy the fact that you have to write ten lines on this site. I will write at least 6 or 7, but I feel that I can portray my point with less than ten. Here are some extra lines to make the IMDb gods happy.
