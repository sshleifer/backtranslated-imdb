This movie was fun! Especially if you are between 8 and 15. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes make a credible team of eight degrees to come back to an adult who really deserves it. Paul Giamatti makes a great adult you really want. My 13-year-old daughter and her friend loved it. Parents: No very bad words or any sex to worry about. Recommend it for the 'real' crowd. AP
