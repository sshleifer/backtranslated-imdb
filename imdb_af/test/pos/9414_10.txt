I use "Princess Bear" (to give the film its non-accurate English title) as a litmus test for my friends' sense of humor. It also leaves them cold and stunned - as many other commentators have done on this site - or leads to a doubled laugh, unbeatable big bounds and occasional admiration. <br /> <br /> The laugh comes from the movie's complete blend of parodies in contemporary style. Targets include a bouquet of Japanese and Western classical drama forms, from Kabuki to Late Shakespearian and Spanish renaissance Christian fantasy; the nude void of the modern American and European musical, which testifies to an army of random tap and rap songs and some very funny banal lyrics, all loved by an amateur cliché; Japanese anime and samurai live action clichés; spicy Buddhist ritual; and the overwhelming sweetness of Viennese operetta. I haven't laughed so hard at this type of movie since Ken Russell's outrageous musical deconstruction in "The Boyfriend". <br /> <br /> The grin comes from the clever textual subversion of the Japanese legend, telling in a traditional 5-day structure reminiscent of the plays of the 17th century master Chikamatsu. As in his work, the story is advanced in a mix of songs, recitative, high-flying poetry and low comedy relief - here is the pot broiling of the incompetent ninja, Ostrich, by farmers under the illusion that he is a tanuki raccoon is. human cover. All these things somehow hang together, and even more remarkably, it does not succeed in engaging the viewer's emotions with the well-being of cultural references. <br /> <br /> In fact, Princess Raccoon carries a pan-cultural robe with attractive lights, and that's where the surprise of surprise comes. Visually - as with Russell's masterpiece - the film is a surprise, a riot of color with its digitized backdrop of classic Japanese images of screens and prints, over-the-top costumes and enhanced sets, blended with some breathtaking live action ranges in summer fields and sea states. You will love or destroy it, but there is no point in destroying lime because it is cheese. and "Princess Raccoon" is first and foremost a bad, funny and pervasive break in our contemporary cultural vacuum in both East and West. Bravo!
