I saw this movie on a branch of the Duane Reed pharmacy in New York on vacation, and it was like a little silly fun. And sure enough, the whole premise is ridiculously out of words - but it also seems to be a very enjoyable action movie for kids and their parents. <br /> <br /> 10-year-old Ricky Bernard (Jordan Garrett) has his head in the clouds most of the time, much to his father's (Larry Miller) dismay. As a member of his school orchestra, Ricky and schoolmates fly to a concert show ... and again Ricky's thoughts start and suspect a criminal plot is taking place. <br /> <br /> Reluctantly supported by best friend Sashi, who is a fan of hot sauce (who was a strange plot device) and others trying to solve the puzzle. Oh, and Ricky's skills 1,000 hours flight simulator experience is helpful when he is encouraged to save the day in the exciting climax of the movie! It was good to see Eric Roberts and Mark Dacoscos playing in a family movie. And watching the DVD interviews, everyone seemed to have had lots of fun participating. <br /> <br /> I loved Junior Pilot; charming and good images, funny plot line and real; sense of pleasure and mere folly. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an entertaining family movie, you can do much worse than buying this one.
