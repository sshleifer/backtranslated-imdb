Mr. Baseball was a fun video rental with my fiance Susan Nauss. Susan said she was looking to see the movie. Ken Takakura Oda makes a difficult daughter-in-law manager. Ken Takakura has made so many wonderful Asian films, I have fixed one reviewer and said Takakura is still a movie-like presence with films like Hotari. Of course everyone likes Tom Selleck, but Ken Takakura is the better dramatic actor of the two. Today someone accused me of being Yakuza. Well, I say that my unscathed President Jack F Kennedy is myself and others part of the legitimate Human Leadership in our Universe and thanks to our fellow creators. People are free people fighting all parts of the adversity. Kennedy spoke in his inaugural speech. To be honest, someone in Canada kept very low food prices on things like bread. In honor of our CoCreators, stop eating amphibious reptiles and eggs. I hope someday there will be a successor to Mr. Baseball with Father Ken Takakura Oda will be as Manager. Thanks to IMDb for supporting freedom of speech like the kind of President George W Bush and I support. Support IMDb.
