I saw it at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival. There are some wonderful descriptions of this film from other commentators here and they really enjoyed it, so I won't be too far to give a movie summary, but you can see a little Woody Allen, and maybe a little bit by Federico Fellini in this movie collection of about 50 short sketches or vignettes merged with no real single plot. However, some of the vignettes are related in their character and plot lines, and a corner bar is often used as a central scene where they always give the last call. The start and end tones also have a common theme that judges the film. It took three years to film it and much of the time had to be spent finding the simplest and most homely people in the whole of Sweden to make the movie. This is Sweden's official presentation for the best foreign language film for the 2007 Academy Awards. It's a nice movie, but almost worthy of an official presentation for the best foreign film. Last year, Sweden's official presentation was the very poor Farväl Falkenberg and the year before it looked expensive, but dull ZoZo, so again Sweden will have no chance to pick up the Oscar. This movie has its moments and would have made a good 20-25 minutes short film, but it gets a bit old and cold for a full length feature film. Roy Andersson directed. Gustav Danielsson is the filmmaker. Editor Anna Märta Waern earns a lot of credit for the work she has to put into this. Benny Andersson of ABBA celebrity offers an entertaining music score. It's an interesting movie with a very dry humor and I liked it, but it's nothing really special and can only give a 7.0 out of 10.
