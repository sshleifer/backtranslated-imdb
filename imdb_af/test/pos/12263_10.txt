I'm sorry, because if you see this movie, you realize how low our media is. All the warning signs are in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, I think the last big James Brooks movie, but others may disagree. It has rich characters (which are also credible), great acting, great writing, and even though the music has become a little cheese, I even said it. <br /> <br /> William Hurt has never been better. Holly Hunter is stunning. And Albert Brooks walks away with every scene he is in this triangle of people, is beautifully drawn and compelling and makes the whole movie so important over the important and important subject of the News and how it is slowly compromised in our nation. <br /> <br /> Watch it at NETWORK for a great and adventurous evening.
