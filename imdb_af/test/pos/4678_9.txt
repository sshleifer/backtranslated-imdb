I wonder how many MINI Cooper cars were sold thanks to this movie? It can't help but adds to the sales of this car, which appears in this movie, along with an attractive role. <br /> <br /> It's a very entertaining hoist-and-ride movie. It features a "cool" movie featuring Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> The best chase scene is right at the start with a boat race in Venice, Italy. The movie does not overshadow the violence, has a pretty intelligent writing (with a few short exceptions). features interesting characters and is nicely tied. The cat-and-mouse game between Norton and Theron's characters is exciting and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Again, however, we are being manipulated for the criminals portrayed as "the good guys". How many times has it happened since the days of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" in the 1960s? It's turned Hollywood, for you. In it one of the criminals (Norton) stole and killed the leader and father figure (Donald Sutherland) of the gang, so he is the worst of the bunch and the movie's villain. Theron's character is also in the typically overblown feminist mode of Hollywood, where women can do all things (including a car) better than a man. A third slight annoyance is Seth Green's alley, smart-ass attitude that we also suppose to go with because it is hip and cool. <br /> <br /> Despite these obstacles, it is a very entertaining movie and it is not overboard about the curse or sex .... and yes, those little cars are cool. Everyone I talked to who watched this movie enjoyed it.
