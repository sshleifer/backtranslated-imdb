I saw the D's new movie tonight at a special show, and I was so blown away by his greatness that I felt I had to come to IMDb and get the word out. I was already a big fan of the D's work - I loved the HBO series and listened to their music every week (there is nothing better to sing together), but this appreciation made me more concerned I enrolled tonight's performance (for us One has been disappointed for some time by something we loved when trying to make the leap to the big screen). With Tenacious D's "The Pick of Destiny", that's not the case. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie is harder than anything I've seen and is funny and majestic than anything Peter Jackson, Pixar, and can produce Ferrell together. It tells the story of the D before getting to know them and drawing up intriguing history of Kage and Jables, joining them and how they were inspired to write songs about things like Lee, Sasquatch and Dio. Most importantly, they reveal the true inspiration for the Greatest Song in the World, "Tribute," and how it (unlike the HBO's version) is. After you have seen it, you probably will not remember it (so the tribute), but your mind forever changes through its genius. <br /> <br /> I don't go to movies very often because of the high ticket price and the hassle of getting parking, paying scandalous price concessions, etc., but I usually make exceptions when it comes to someone with whom I really love or like something of the same variety, stare. "The Pick of Destiny" was so good that I have no malice to see it again when it is announced nationwide, and I plan to convince all my friends to go too. Last week we saw "Borat" and loved it, but it is honest to goodness TEN TIMES Better. For everyone who really loves rock music and comic sheen, watch this movie. These guys' talent is so great that you should not be reluctant to support their cause. You won't be disappointed, and the Rock Lords will smile on you.
