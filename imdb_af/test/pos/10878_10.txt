Two years after its initial release, Goldeneye is still on the field of first-person shooters for the Nintendo 64. Even the Quake and Turok series did not have the combination of graphic detail, sound quality, enemy information, challenge and overall fun. I return to this game. The missions each have specific goals that force you to think of Bond, not just to shoot every bad thing on your screen, but also to avoid cameras, eliminate security systems, save hostages, the Bond girl. protected, and so on. Q gadgets abound in this game, including the well-known watch. The game is loosely based on the movie story, including all the main characters and the best screens of the movie, from the dam-bungee jump to the plug-in aircraft, which was staged by the St. Petersburg tournament escaped. Even the layout is preserved where possible, so you will recognize different situations when you have seen the movie. Other levels are added to challenge the player and put the screens a little more. With every difficulty level, the mission objectives are more difficult, the enemies smarter and the bullets more deadly. I haven't gotten the 00-Agent levels yet. Cheats can be opened, not by entering codes or pressing buttons, but by completing certain levels within a certain time frame, and opening additional characters for the multiplayer. The multiplayer is still the best among first-person shooters. It's not as sharp as Turok, but it doesn't slow much as much. Numerous options give your friends the reason to blow each other over, and once again just for kicks. There are better games for the N64, such as Zelda and all Star Wars, but Rare has continued their streak of outstanding matches with a first-person rider who won't and will not be surpassed until they finish themselves in 2000 with Perfect Dark.
