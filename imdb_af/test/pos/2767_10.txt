This movie is constantly being played on the Disney Channel when I was a little younger, and I really remember it. However, I didn't have good taste again (not to say I'm doing it now) so I can't approve of my nine-year-old self. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had good music, and I gave it an extra point. Well worth watching. I know some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she's in the car accident. The song is "Play a Love Song" by the Jaguars and it is VERY hard to find and find. In fact, this movie is too. I can't find it anywhere online or on DVD or on VHS. I want to see it again, so I can see if it was actually a good movie. Oh good.
