"The Chipmunk Adventure" is one of the greatest animated films of the 1980s. Alvin and the Chipmunks have always been important to me, as it really has me in rock and roll. None of the Chipmunks have any bad features. Alvin is really the star and has all the cool looks. Theodore is the lovely sensitive one. Then there is Simon (my personal favorite), the smart who is often a party pooper. I also love the Chipettes. There is Brittany, who, like Alvin, is one who has always been so popular. Then there is Eleanor, who, like Theodore, is sweet, sensitive and loves food. Janette is the only Chipette who is not much like her counterpart; she is very naive and really awkward. <br /> <br /> In the very first full-length movie of the Chipmunks, David goes on a business trip to Europe, and he leaves the boys with me. Miller while he's gone. While playing an arcade game, Alvin loses Britain and says that if he has the money, he will race Brittany around the world for real racing. Unknown to the kids, a man named Klaus Furschtien and his sister, Claudia, who tried to get an ugly way to swap diamonds all over the world in exchange for cash, heard this conversation and said they would let them race around the world for $ 100,000. Alvin and Brittany accept it and go on the race. <br /> <br /> This adventurous movie has very good songs. "Off to See the World" made for a suitable theme song for the movie. Then there is 'Lucky', one of my favorite songs in the movie. "My Mother" is probably the juiciest song in the movie, but it always makes me cry. "Wooly Bully" is the only movie used in the movie (the rest was completely original). Then there is of course 'The Boys and Girls of Rock and Roll', which in my opinion should be one of the best musical numbers in film history. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie. very often, until my recorded band died. However, I still look at the movie. It is actually a fun movie for people who go on holiday to a foreign country for the first time. This will give you an idea of ​​what kind of things you expect from world travel. Definitely one of my childhood movies, and one I would recommend to 80 fans and Alvin & the Chipmunks fans.
