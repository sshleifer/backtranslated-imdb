I have some of the older videos and DVDs from Dr. Who. I played them over and over. I worship each of the "doctors" for different reasons. But because of a man in the BBC hierarchy, dr. Who canceled, though still one of the main roles of the BBC series. With the departure of Sylvester McCoy, the doctor remains alive by the supporters. BBC has allowed fans to write books and cartoons. The momentum of dr. Who was still stable, even after 1989. Then they had a chance with Paul McGann. The movie was wrong, but it gave the BBC an idea of ​​what we wanted. In 1999, the "man" was gone and the newcomers to the BBC felt it was time to bring the doctor back. It was a complete success. Here in the US, the Sci-Fi Channel has gone a chance and it has also become a complete success, although the authors had to start and the Dr. Who explains mythology to new viewers. It's amazing to me that they did. In Season 1, Christopher Eccleston with Russell T. Davis as lead author, and Phil Collinson as producer, returned to us and in each episode we learn more about who the doctor is. The Doctor Who universe has always gone over "Choice", "Love" and "Sacrifice". That's what they provided. It makes me want more and it makes me sad that Mr. Eccleston chose to leave the show. My first doctor was doctor now. 3, Jon Pertwee's Doctor. Mr. Eccleston does not have to worry about his position in the Dr. Who universe does not. It's as solid as the rest. He is the 9th Doctor. I didn't know about Mr Eccleston before his performance in Dr. Who doesn't, but I do it now. I wish there was some way, he could know, there is a pressure in the Dr. Who-fan community to find and enjoy its other work. We have already seen him as a good actor.
