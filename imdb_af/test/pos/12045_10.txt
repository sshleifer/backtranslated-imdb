Look at this movie just to see Shahrukh Khan says, "I love you, K-k-Kiran ..." It's both heartbreaking and scary at the same time when he says it from the beginning to the end. This film made him famous and I totally recommend it: D It is very entertaining, the music is evil and you will laugh with Shahrukh here ... You will be really scared of the hero and heroine and strangely you will identify with at least one of the characters. You will feel sad and happy at the same time and be relieved and scared. Check out this classic Bollywood movie with your good friends and good food and spend a day. And after watching the movie, the songs and scenery should play forever in your mind.
