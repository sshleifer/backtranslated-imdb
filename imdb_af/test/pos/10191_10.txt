This movie is great. You will never laugh harder. This is a target. No, I think it's ... yes this is ... A BOOB! This movie becomes funny with the second, as Jackie Chan's character eventually dies in his last battle story. This movie is pretty much looking like treasha! Congratulations if you buy or rent it. You will never give it back. I didn't, and I didn't find it in a store. I watched this movie once and I was forever in love with Kung-Fu action flags. If you're looking for an amazing movie in the area of ​​great production value, good or even mediocre, and good special effects ... it's NOT that movie. If you are looking for laughter and timeless wonder, choose it for a dollar and you will never let it go. With friends, popcorn and drinks, it's the perfect evening.
