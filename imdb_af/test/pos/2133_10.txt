If this movie is directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick, it will be recognized for what it is: a movie masterpiece, telling with depth and subtlety and passion, a film that is not equal in the visual world. It is incredibly beautiful and also very brutal in portraying our great heritage of greed and extinction. And of course, what the judges couldn't obey, doesn't tell a simple narrative dick-and-jane story like 99% of Hollywood output. His characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions. They even seem to think, something your average film judges don't understand and can't stay, so they destroyed. See the original disabled wide screen version. It is beautiful.
