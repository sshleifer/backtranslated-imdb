Anyone looking for an episode of "Law and Order" or "CSI" will have to look elsewhere, as the most basic elements of police or forensic work in this case are completely ignored. <br /> <br /> A murder took place, and all the police did take a 15-year-old boy off the street and take him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - And this is the man who did it? Certainly, the old man thought the child should be guilty of the police car. No matter that he looks nothing like the real killer and was totally different. He must have shrunk, reversed his age by 5-10 years and changed clothes. <br /> <br /> The police did absolutely no effort - and they allowed it! They had no forensic evidence on any of the evidence, they did not question any other witnesses, and they beat a confession from a 15-year-old. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is happening right next to the road in Jacksonville, Florida. Now let everyone start talking about "Southern justice."
