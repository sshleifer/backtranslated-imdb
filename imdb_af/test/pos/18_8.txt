"The Dresser" may be the most refined feature film. The film is full of white and spirit, mainly due to the "energetic" character of Norman (Tom Courtenay). Although his character is clearly gay, and certainly has an appeal to the film (Albert Finney) he helps, the film never lives or does it more than it is. <br /> <br /> The eager style of Peter Yates who worked so well in "Bullitt" is getting underway again, giving the film a sense of realism and coherence. It is much appreciated in a story that could be so boring. Eventually, "The Dresser" will plunge many people, but it will be a real pleasure for those who love the British cinema. <br /> <br /> 7.7 out of 10
