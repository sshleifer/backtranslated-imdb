It's definitely a quality movie with a classic role. As far as movies about Carlos the Jackal go, this one Bruce Willis's poor efforts in "The Jackal" hit a bloody pulp and then spit on them. I'm a bit surprised that this movie didn't get any more votes, something of a 'sleeper' of course. Sorry, this movie is definitely worth a watch. It's smart and never boring. See it, 7/10
