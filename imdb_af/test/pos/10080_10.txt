It was a good movie! It was an enjoyable adolescent fantasy. So what makes a movie great? Technical details? I think if that were the only criteria, our culture would be poorer. So this movie is "The Godfather" as new golf music is to Mozart. The point is, this is one of the best movies of the type I've seen. The women are all beautiful (as seen only on the beaches of California when making movies). It has a bit of everything, a kind of battlestar gallactica meets bay watch, meets the Playboy Centerfold video, meets Wayne's World. There is a lot of charm and a reasonable (though predictable) storyline that interests you until the next piece of eye candy has known the screen. Joe Estevez may not have his brother's career, but does a good job of focusing the story as the eternal adolescent Oom Bud. Includes many expected absurdities such as female rock band play without the guitars plugged in. (Was it intentional?) If you're lured to the box, rent the video, you won't regret it. As promised, it's good, non-violent erotic fun!
