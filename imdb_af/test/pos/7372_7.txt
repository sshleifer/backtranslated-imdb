"Campfire Tales" consists mainly of three ghostly stories that a group of friends tell after arriving in a forest crash after a concert. The movie starts with the classic "Hook" story, and then we are introduced to the group of friends who drive home from the concert. They crash their car, light a few torches and start a fire in a small abandoned chapel and wait for someone to come and help themselves while warming themselves to the fire. To pass the time, they decide to tell classic horror stories, about terrorist grooms, a girl prey to an internet predator and a motorist who is housed in a haunted house. While telling the ominous stories, each story is becoming increasingly frightening, but the real shock they are waiting for is not yet to come. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the last story they tell is probably the scariest and has some real, frightening effects. The first story was good, and the caravan order near the end was a bit creepy. The second story built up a lot of tension, more than one of them did, but it was original. This is ruin. I remember remembering how I have seen this movie long ago when I was eight at HBO and the third story scared me crazy, although it is not scary for me now. You'll probably recognize the movie here, especially Amy Smart from the opening hook-up, and Christine Taylor as one of the most important actresses in the film. The turning end was also a bit interesting, I know I didn't see it, I thought it was all nicely nailed. <br /> <br /> Summarizing things, if you're looking for a horror movie that's worth it, rent it, you need to be happy. It is a great anthology of some classic urban legends, and the whole film is tied neatly. It's much better than you'd expect. 10/07.
