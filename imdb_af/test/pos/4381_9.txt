It started off oddly, the waist was strange, and the end was strange, but I really liked it. A modern version of Homer's Odyessy, but it's really irrelevant. Interesting story and decisive. Clooney was wonderful and I am delighted to play such an advertising role - as different from what he has ever done or will ever do again. Many surprise sites - why is Holly Hunter no longer. Do something else tonight and watch this many other and unexpected movie.
