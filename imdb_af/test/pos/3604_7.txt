A fun and pleasant movie full of mediterranean views (Cephallonia is a very beautiful Greek island) that holds many of the novel's features. I think Greek scenery adds something special and magic to a movie. One thing I didn't like at all is that the main characters, such as 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father, were not Greek actors, but foreigners. I think the actors tried to express the Greek way of life, but for me they did not succeed and it was very clear. Even their verdict when they wanted to use Greek words was terrible and it was bad for the movie's plot. Irene Papas was really wonderful in her role, a typical example of a mother who lived on an island in the 40's, who lost her husband and just tried to live a child. Pelagia's father John Hurt also did great dealings. He reminded me of Greek in many of his reactions.
