It should be one of the better post-Astaire musicals made by Columbia. Produced by Arthur Schwartz and director of veterinarian Charles Vidor, this photo really put Gene Kelly on the map and confirmed Rita Hayworth's reputation as the premier female dance partner of the film. She plays a dual role here as she performs contemporary 1940s with Gene and fellow student Phil Silvers, but also places her in the role of her grandmother, a nightclub artist in the late 19th Centry. <br /> <br /> The music must also be singled out because it was I believe the last project the legendary Jerome Kern (best known today for "Old Man River" and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes") worked on, and his lyrics were the equally legendary Ira Gershwin. They gave a score full of charm and characterization. The music for the historical series is especially noticeable because it is so perfectly styled in the early 20th century idiom that Cern's original period was. It's a bit like picking up a record of one of your favorite bands of the 1970s and hearing that they are doing a song in the original style of that time. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty inconspicuous, which is good to me because this film is so close to an approach you will ever see from the 1930s / 40's golden time of Broadway musical comedy style on film. Even the 1940s war propaganda aspects of the movie's music give it extra charm as the talented trio singing "make room for tomorrow" and even humorously make fun of America's enemies and use period snake as referred to as "gremlins". <br /> <Perhaps the most memorable performance in the movie is Kelly's dance to the Alter-Ego Dance, which has found itself and dancing with itself as a metaphorical image of the battle of conscience. It presents many of his later work and is also an effective and memorable scene in and of itself. <br /> <br /> Fans will want to find it for a variety of reasons - Kelly fans will see it as a rare chance to see him beyond the boundaries of MGM with another set of co-workers and music that is better than his usual MGM material. Hayworth fans will want to see Rita in glorious color at the height of her celebrity and skill. And fans of classic Broadway music will definitely want to hear Kern's final score and marvel at the quality of Gershwin's lyrics and the compatibility of their styles. It's a definite gem in the crown of Columbia's music program.
