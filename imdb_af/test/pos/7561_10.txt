Will some companies PLEASE make a (good +) DVD of this movie! ??? Apart from being a great movie about relationships and friendships, "Four Friends" is the only movie I've ever seen. And I literally spent * year * of my life watching movies! - which captures the essence of the 60's experience (and I was there!): idealism, hope, freedom, confusion, betrayal, and ultimately its exciting but bittersweet denial. And all this is accomplished without being a story about any of the many revolutions of that era, although many are only touched ... as part of the tapestry. But the story is mainly about the characters and their friendship in about 10 to 15 years ... and that they survived and deepened, despite the tragedies of that turbulent decade. Absolutely a joy and movie to watch ... even if you're not an old hippie !!!
