Two funeral directors in a Welsh town? English humor unlike those other things from across the Atlantic? How can I resist. My wife and I saw it on March 6 for our delayed Valentine's Day celebration and both of us enjoyed a good belly hole. We'll see another movie later, but have decided not to have the experience of this movie to stay with us for the night. <br /> <br /> The mortuary scene in the last 20 minutes of the movie is worth it. wait. This causes issues that are rarely spoken in the community, but I know three funeral directors, and the humor is right on the money. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended and congratulations to the authors. Without you there are no actors, directors and others.
