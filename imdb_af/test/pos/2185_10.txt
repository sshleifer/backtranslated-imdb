George Hearn really got out and on top, which in this case was great. I heard the Len Cariou version, but it was too tame. George was great in that character - very expressive. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury was perfect for sharing. She delivered a good performance. She has the Mrs. Lovett gave a great, boring and comical personality that balanced the dark story. <br /> <br /> I love the dark humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and the fierce emotions of George Hoor in his songs of anger, revenge and distress. <br /> <br /> I've seen this play 20 times since 1985 when I saw it on PBS. I bought it on video (after copying it myself in 1985) when it came out in 1990 and I definitely bought a copy of the DVD when it came out in 2004.
