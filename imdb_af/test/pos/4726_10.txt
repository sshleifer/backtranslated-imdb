It is one of the most underrated movies of the 1990s. If you allow yourself to identify with the Patricia Arquette character, you will find it a very moving story of a woman who has a sense of purpose for her life and a new will to live. <br /> <br /> Arquette's performance is brave because it is deliberately 'wood' - a way to define her character's spiritual death, her total lack of desire to be alive. She moves through life like a zombie, because her family is murdered and she cannot see the point of life. What is moving is how she is revived in the course of the story - through the Burmese landscape, by the beautiful quality of his people and landscapes, and by the primary choices she is forced to confront. <br /> <br /> Boorman visually supports it (and Hans Zimmer supports it with one of his most beautiful, haunting scores) with a regular static camera and with a tendency to be glass, windows, windshield, etc. Shoot. We look outside, just like Arquette .... until she finds herself deep in the jungle and is forced to choose whether or not to fight for her life. <br /> <br /> I recommend the 1954 film THE PURPLE PLAIN as well. It's a similar story in a similar environment, and makes a fascinating comparison.
