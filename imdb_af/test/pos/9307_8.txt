We watched this movie in my chemistry class, so of course it has educational value. I thought the film did a very good job relating to the subjects of science, moral issues and personal experiences of the manhattan project, but was not exactly focused on strong acting. I would recommend this movie to scientifically inclined people or those interested in the moral issues behind Fat Man and Little Boy, but if the subject of nuclear bombs is boring you, you shouldn't see it.
