Not for the sick, but the number of twists, inventive uses of situations using vampire phytology, beautiful visual extremes, along with interesting and peculiar characters, make this one of the most wonderful horror movies I've ever seen. It goes down in extreme madness with characters, but never looks exploitative or terrific without purpose. There are large amounts of blood loss associated with some nasty sucking and squishing sounds, but also subtle moments where you are laughing out loud. As he tends to do, Chan-wook Park keeps you from the center with leaps in time and the plot and situation you have to fill out for yourself, forcing your involvement in the story and characters. <br /> <br /> And there are many literal jumps. Keeping vampermite in the vein (pun intended), they have superhuman strength and can be almost tall buildings in a single bound shoot (to mint a phrase). The first time our heroine was worn by the turbulent vampire priest over the top buildings, it has all the magical novels of Lois Lane and Superman - but this romance is increasingly disturbing - but driven by a strange and confronted "love affair" not by mere horror. <br /> <br /> The play is wonderful, especially OK-vin Kim, the beautiful actress in the female lead, showing a remarkable series on 22. The character borders on a kind of black widow movie noir type. She cares about innocent caring to demonstrate the devil with full conviction. It's a very smooth and nervous performance. <br /> <br /> If you like real art in horror, or an Oldboy fan, don't wait for the video, see it right away.
