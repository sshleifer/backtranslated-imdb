one of my favorite lines in Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> * We haven't finished with you long * so Shylock not only gets his pound of meat, either the 3 000 or 6 000 or the 36 000 (each of the 6 parts was a ducat) ducats, in a matter of minutes he was destroyed by forfeiting all his possessions. and his daughter has long since left. <br /> <br /> Revenge is a dish that is best served cold. but Shylock's attempt at revenge goes back completely. <br /> <br /> I suspect this play was and is popular because it fits the desire we have for justice. but the harsh reality is that the world is being engulfed in injustice and most of it. Some big names are thrown into jail, gang gangsters lose their peat to the 'good guys', but most of the time it's the other way around. <br /> <br /> But not in this scene. The long cry of racism and anti-Semitism forgets that it could be another social publishing group getting the upcoming action. It's just that the lenders were Jews of the time and therefore the Shylock put the role of the Jew into the needs of the story. of villain. <br /> <br /> Venice's merchant is my 3rd favorite work by Shakespeare, 1 and 2 is Hamlet and Macbeth. This production gives excellent treatment of the morality of the story. The screens with the suitors alone are worth watching. Also, the discomfort of the new men who keep them busy decreases and reduces the fact that they make the rings fly so easily that they have sworn to stay forever. In real life, this trick is the thing that spouses use to remind their better half of those promises. MUST mean something and not be made unbecoming. There is much more meaning to this play than just the comedy / dramatic aspect. It's about loyalty, dedication and love. <br /> <br /> Worth looking over and over.
