As a SCUBA diver, I can appreciate the incredible physical tension that the cameras have to endure to get the shots under water. However, this series is much more than that. The narrative is perfect, the screens border on indisputable and captivating the subject. The day-to-day struggle for life that takes place in view of our earthly inhabitants is staggering. This DVD set opened my eyes on another planet here on Earth. I encourage everyone to watch this series.
