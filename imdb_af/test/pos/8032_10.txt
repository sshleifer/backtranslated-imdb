2002, Bourne Identity is one of my best favorite movies. However, many of the fans of the book complained that the movie had little to do with the book's plot. <br /> <br /> The Mission is the right deal. It's strange that nobody on the "Bourne Identity" wires mentioned this movie whatsoever. (Well, I did.) <br /> <br /> Apart from the excellent plot, I personally found this movie as good as any espionage movie I've ever seen, with the possible exception of The Bourne. > <br /> Identity itself. <br /> <br /> The action is all realistic. I especially liked the capitalization exercise program, which was very inventive. <br /> <br /> The feeling is dark and eager. There are some surprising plots. The acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> If you like this genre, I can't recommend this movie highly enough.
