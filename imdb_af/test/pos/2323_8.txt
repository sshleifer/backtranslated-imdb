I watched the movie in the theater when he was released, when the VHS band looked over the years, and as I walked through Target, this DVD along with "Pushing Tin" combined for the sum of $ 5.50. <br /> <br /> There is something about this comedy that really clicked me - how Kelsey Grammar, "with a tattoo on his thing", is an unorthodox commander who has a rusty diesel party and a crew of screw balls and misfits inherited. He is at the best of the fleet - a Los Angeles class's nuclear attack sub - and his old captain (WM Macy). <br /> <br /> Bruce Dern plays the bad man, Rip Torn the admiral performing the exercise. He does not trust hysterically during the "run quiet" segment with the cook. Well, you have a different kind of humor from me. <br /> <br /> At the end, the machine man "DBF" says without explanation - this is apparently inside knowledge of an old submarine consultant. Thanks to Google I learned that with the arrival of the core parts the old salt "DBF" pens - Diesel Boats Forever will carry. <br /> <br /> A naval friend said many technical issues were not correct, but cared - this is one of the funniest movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> I don't think it takes a clairvoyant to know who will win in this exercise!
