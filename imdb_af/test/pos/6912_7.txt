Dramatic license - some hate it, though it is necessary to tell any life story. In the case of "Lucy", the highlights of Lucille Ball's teens, early career and 20-year marriage to Desi Arnaz are all included, though in a trumped and reworked way. <br /> <br /> The main emotional points of Lucy's life are made clear: Lucille's struggle to find her niche as an actress, finally in the brilliant comedy that made Lucy Ricardo a legend in character; her turbulent, romantic and eventually impossible marriage to Desi Arnaz; Lucy & Desi creates the first television empire and assures their place in history as TV's most memorable sitcom couple. <br /> <br /> As Lucille Ball, Rachel York does a laudable job. Don't expect to see the same amazing transformation as one made by Judy Davis when Judy Garland played, but York makes Ball highly desirable but likeable and very funny in its own right. Even though her comedy timing is different from Lucy's, she's still credible. The film never goes into detail about her perfectionist actions on the set, and her abuse of Vivian Vance in the early "I Love Lucy" years but watch York Lucy rehearse is a good inclusion. <br /> <br /> Daniel Pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real Desi, but he has his own charm and does a very decent job with Desi's accent, especially in the opening scene. Madeline Zima was decent, if not too memorable, than teenage Lucy. <br /> <br /> Vivian Vance and William Frawley were not very happy, as Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman were not very convincing. . Not that they aren't good actors in their own right, they just weren't all that suited to the people they play. Most of the actors were from Austrailia and New Zeland, and the repressed accents are sometimes visible. <br /> <br /> Although the main structure of the film remains the historical fact, there are many deviations, some for seemingly inexplicable reasons. . Jess Oppenheimer, lead author of Lucy's radio program "My Favorite Husband", which started in 1948, was portrayed in 1951 in this film to help "I Love Lucy" in 1951, completely out of the fact that he was the lead creator ! This film also shows Marc Daniels as the lead director of "I Love Lucy" for his full run, ignoring the fact that he was replaced by William Asher after the first season! Although I see this because of budget constraints, it seems that Ricardo lives in the same apartment for their entire stay in New York, when they actually changed flats in 1953. The kitchen set is slightly larger and sloping away from the original. The Connecticut house looks pretty close to the original, except that the right and left sides of the house are condensed and restructured. <br /> <br /> Desi also talks about the purchase of RCO in 1953 during Lucy's red terror incident, although RCO did not hit the market until 1957. These changes could have been good for dramatic licensing and the film works to convey the key facts, but it would have hurt them to show a little more respect for Oppenheimer and Asher, two key figures in the history of "I Love Lucy "? The biggest gaff comes in the "I Love Lucy" recreational scenes, at least some of them. It's always risky to retrieve something trapped on film and is seen by billions of people, but even more when condemned. The scene with the huge bread loaf was cut off, and anyone familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences immediately! The number "We have a baby" has also been shortened, but otherwise it was virtually dead. By far the best was the "grape stump" scene, with Rachel York nailing Lucy's ways. The producers decided not to try to recreate the "Vitametavegamin" and candy factory bits directly, but show the actors to practice them. These screens were effective because of that approach. <br /> <br /> The main mistake of the movie is that it assumes the viewers already know a lot about Lucy's life, as much is overshadowed or omitted. Overall, however, it gives a decent portrait of Lucy & Desi's marriage, and factual errors can be overlooked if character development works effectively.
