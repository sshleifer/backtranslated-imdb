I watched a television movie about the destruction in Waco, Texas. It was obviously heavy in the direction of the claim that David Koresh was a murderous, child rapist cult leader who wanted to kill half the death of so much police as he wanted and took his people to heaven on a blood-colored staircase. <br /> <br /> The film was a little more than propaganda which further describes what we have already read in the newspapers. I've been more sure of this since I watched the great documentary Waco: The Rules of Involvement. Not that every statement in this film should be made as God's truth, but it tells the whole story rather than just declaring law enforcement. <br /> <br /> For those who have forgotten, Koresh was the spiritual leader of the religious movement called The Branch Davidians. Drug use charges, kidnapping, illegal possession of arms, and statutory rape (among others I am sure) raised the suspicions of the local police, then later the federal law enforcement. While trying to make a search warrant, the ATF (Bureau for Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) and the clan participated in a shooting that was killed and wounded on both sides. <br /> <br /> It was then that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) became involved. Communication between the two was enthusiastic but eventually broke down. The FBI prepared for an invasion by attacking the building with flash bombs and gas. When the building burned to the ground, including Koresh, the FBI refused to recognize the responsibility to say that the "cult" within it had to set itself on fire. It has listened images of Jim Jones and other violent religious organizations. <br /> <br /> The photo sits on many masks to tell his story. It starts with a sample of the congressional hearings, perhaps the "truth" as far as the record is concerned. What is eye-opening is how partisan politicians have remained even in a difficult and serious situation like this. The Democrats were concerned about nothing more than defending every act taken by law enforcement. It was the Republicans who looked up for the other side. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to relate all the new information and analysis provided by these documentaries. In addition, a list will take away from the movie opening as it goes. One example would be the heartbreaking fact that children died within the compound. The filmmakers are probably more with the Davidians in general, but remain relatively open on either side. In this case, the fund appears to be guilty of abusing a situation involving innocent children. But on the other hand, parents should also blame their children for leaving this harmful situation when they have released them to any number of local authorities. <br /> <br /> Probably the most damning new information comes late in the film and involves the FBI's claim that they haven't shot at the building. It is left for interpretation, and I will no longer reveal it as saying it is disturbing and shocking what can and cannot be told. <br /> <br /> The federal officials are not kept in critical or corrupt light more than Koresh. The biggest condemnation seems to be on the media, unwilling to tell both sides of a story. This element is common in recent documentaries, so I believe. It's time for the media to go back to news stories and leave this relentless pursuit that will draw the biggest audience and ratings. <br /> <br /> It's hard to waste a documentary. In most cases, a camera switches on and editing an interesting piece of life is common and tells a great story. What can do little is such a new light on a subject that the way you think about it is changing forever. Waco is that kind of movie. ***. 5 from ****
