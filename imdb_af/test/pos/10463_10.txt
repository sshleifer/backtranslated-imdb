Sometimes it's hard to see movies with subtitles (in this case Danish), but the look is worth it. As the story progresses, the reasoning for choosing two sisters to care for their father is doubtful, but their society is different. Their choice leaves them alone until a French woman arrives. There may be a question as to why the French woman came to their place to stay and it was never fully developed. The festival, which later happens as a result of unexpected funds from France, is a source of unusual pleasure for everyone attending and something they have not yet experienced. It gives a great thank you for the kindnesses that are given to the guest. Filmed with a dark aura and the display of poverty, this is a wonderful experience for the viewer.
