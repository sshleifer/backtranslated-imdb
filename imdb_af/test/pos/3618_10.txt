To be of the Cephalonic lineage, I was happily surprised when I watched the movie. I heard the true history of my family still living in Kefalonia, but when the movie was watched and the book read, the sketchy pieces of history were filled. It's all true, the Italians will sing, the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often. The earthquake in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both expressed the feeling of the era with great compassion. If you haven't seen the movie, watch it and read the book, it's not just a love story, and yes, many Italians fell in love with Cephallonian women Italy after the war, that's a true portrayal of history.
