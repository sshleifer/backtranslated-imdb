A movie, first, must be good narrative. It must be entertaining - and entertainment doesn't necessarily mean "laughing", and that doesn't necessarily mean "light". It basically means you're not bored while you look at it. <br /> <br /> As brilliant as 2001, it's a tough movie to watch, especially for the current (video game / iPod fumbling) generation. The slow pace and the sometimes unbearable amount of time it takes an actor to do a single action (eg, the effort to drive the crew into space) will stretch your patience. On the other hand, the cinematography is brilliant, the movie is clever, the ending thoughts and the score ... the score is cold, especially because the crew in the carrier is approaching the artifact on the moon. Boy, I had goose bumps, big time. It doesn't often happen when I watch movies, and is evidence of Kubrick's governmental skills. <br /> <br /> It is considered a classic, and many consider it the best science fiction movie of all time. This alone is a good reason to watch it if you haven't done it yet. But just because everyone else thinks it's a brilliant movie, doesn't mean you have to force yourself to keep it. You'll also (like it) or you won't. Perhaps the slow pace is not such a bad thing. To pay attention to something rather static and slow for 2 1/2 hours can teach you a lesson. It will definitely be another experience for all of these fast, fast images we've spent today (or commercial, music videos, or video games). <br /> <br /> I think it's a "memorable" movie. But not one, I'm eager to watch again (unless I'm in a special mood for slow-paced movies). <br /> <br /> So, 7 stars out of 10 of me.
