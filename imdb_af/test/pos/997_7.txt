Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron, well-known loved ones in their day? Even an actor, who usually crashed like Michael Redgrave, once gave a bit of charm to W.B. Yeats. Writers' lives are an endless source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> But of all poets, it was Dylan Thomas, the tranquil, liberal Welshman who enjoyed a pint or two (and at age 39), closest to the spirit of the film industry. . During World War II he produced scripts for British propaganda documentaries. He even wrote the script of a brief melodrama called The Three Weird Sisters, in which three old girls in a Welsh town reveal the murder of their rich half-brother. Everything that's forgiven now. <br /> <br /> In John Maybury's Edge of Love, Thomas is played by Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. It's not a full-blown biopsy. The film covers four years in the poet's life during World War II, when he was living with two women: his wife, Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and a former lover, Vera Phillips (Keira Knightley), whom he again during the war met by chance. He seems to have loved both of them. The relationship of these extraordinary women - Thomas and each other - is at the heart of Maybury's absorbing film. <br /> <br /> How it is made is a story that is almost as remarkable as that of the loved ones. themselves. Rebekah Gilbertson, the film's producer, is the granddaughter of Vera Phillips and William Killick. William, a war hero (played in the movie by Cillian Murphy), married Vera while still in love with the poet. Gilbertson was inspired to make the film when she discovered a book about her grandparents, Dylan Thomas, a farm, two men's homes and bungalows by David Thomas. Sharman Macdonald, who wrote the script, is Knightley's mother. The part required Knightley to sing, and her mother included songs for her specially. Certainly, no movie with such happy family connections deserves to do than to succeed. <br /> <br /> We start in London during the Blitz. Bombs fall, sirens cry, and Phillips sing to hide crowds in an underground subway station. In a bar, she met Thomas by chance and discovered for years that he had a wife and child. Phillips and Caitlin form a friendship that is not jealous or rancor and soon shares beds and bathrooms, listens to Thomas, reads his poems, exchanges intimate secrets and smokes their heads like everyone did in war. Caitlin seems to be more experienced in the ways of the world ("My first was August John, he seduced me when I was 15)". But it is the refined and soulful Phillips that generates Thomas's deepest responses and ultimately gives his charm. Meanwhile, she reluctantly married Killick, who saw her in the Tube station and was instantly captivated by her beauty (if not her singing). <br /> <br /> It's an intense and funny beautiful movie, though Thomas himself can be his least impressive character. He is best remembered for Under Milk Wood, whose radio plays a day in the life of the mythical Welsh town of Llareggub, whose name was spelled backwards, was not something polite English teachers. I once had a vinyl recording of Richard Burton who read the poem (he appeared in a movie of Under Milk Wood in 1971), and I never forgot the creamy, seductive quality of his voice. The legendary charisma, the magnetism of the man, is something I missed in Rhys' performance. Thomas comes across as a strange, low, even secondary figure compared to the women in his life. <br /> <br /> In his previous film, Love is the Devil, Maybury explores the turbulent life of painter Francis Bacon and his sadomasochistic relationship with his lover and model, George Dyer. The edge of love seems to me a richer and more satisfying movie. If you ask what insights it provides in the sources of Thomas's creative inspiration, I should say Llareggub. But as an insight into his egoism, his smoldering moods and his general indifference to the feelings of others, it is wonderfully sad and revealing. <br /> <br /> Thomas had a good war, polished and written while other men (including Killick) were traumatized by the horrors of battle. In one scene near the end, Thomas's behavior towards his friends seems unforgivable. But it's not Thomas's movie. Murphy gives us a wonderful study of doomed passion and the emotional weakening of the war. Miller is charming and pathetic like the woman. And Knightley looks almost too beautifully delicate to actually be (as she did in Pride and Prejudice). But it's probably her best performance. And in every respect the film is worthy of her.
