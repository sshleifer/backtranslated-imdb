It's easily the best movie version of William Faulkner's fiction I've ever seen, and I've seen several of the most prominent ones. Filmed in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, it's really the feel of Jefferson and Yoknapatawpha County. Intruder in the Dust is not one of Faulkner's best novels, but even if it is a clich√© to say so, it will be the crown jeweler in anyone's career. It beats Harper Lee's good but simplistic to kill a Mockingbird, fifty feet in the ground (I read the one in ninth grade, and that's exactly where it belongs). Two of Faulkner's most prominent characters play big parts in the film, Gavin Stevens and Lucas Beauchamp. Stevens is probably the most common character in Faulkner's fiction. He is a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator, because, unlike many of his other characters, Stevens is a man of logic, not emotion (at least when he is older). Lucas Beauchamp may be the most prominent of all Faulkner's black characters (he plays a major role in one of Faulkner's out-and-out masterpieces, Go Down, Moses); Unlike all the other black people in Yoknapatawpha, he refuses to bow to any white man. He is proud, and many in the white population find it invaluable in a black man. One day Lucas was found in possession of a dead white man with a recent firearm. Most of Jefferson and the surrounding areas do not see the need for a trial, and everyone is pretty sure that Beauchamp will be laughed before the night, or at least the next day, because the murder and arrest took place on a Sunday. has. Beauchamp, on the other hand, explains his innocence and tries to help Stevens help him. Stevens refuses; The case looks open and closed. But his young cousin, Chick Mallison, because Lucas helped him in the past, is willing to help him. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, no Hollywood movie of this period deals with racism as openly as this one. Hollywood movies rarely pursue the black population, but prefer to reject them to servants. If you are an African American actor, you can go up so well and take on the role of the mummy, the maid, the servant or the porter, because that is the only way you will work. In the intruder of the dust, there is one of the most memorable non-porter roles a black actor ever had, Lucas Beauchamp. And Beauchamp, as I described above, is not a stereotypical character, and can be heard by the audience. Even today, black characters are usually simple, magical and kind. The recent arthouse hit far from Heaven is a good example of this. Beauchamp is kind of a push, and he is very stubborn. Although he may be a bit less here than he is in the novel, he is not a kind of stereotype. He is a complex man. Juano Hernandez plays Beauchamp extremely well. I didn't see the movie, but he also appears in Robert Aldrich's 1955 movie, Kiss Me Deadly, as well as the film adaptation of Faulkner's latest novel, The Reivers. <br /> <br /> All the actors are big in the movie. I must also quickly praise Claude Jarman Jr., who has the great role of Chick Mallison. The novel takes its point of view and is the conventional hero of the picture. Jarman is quite an actor; he captures the character (which also appears elsewhere in Faulkner's fiction, such as events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel The Town). He will appear in another major role next year in the underrated John Ford movie Rio Grande. The only other movie by Clarence Brown's that I saw is National Velvet, quite a different picture from the intruder in the dust. His work here is exceptional; I really need to give him credit to get Faulkner right. Other well-known Faulkner adaptations are too melodramatic (The Long Hot Summer, filmed in 1958, which I really liked) or too cold (Tomorrow, filmed in 1972, which I dislike; the cold is a complete misunderstanding of Faulkner) . The only one that really works well with its source material is Douglas Sirk's great 1958 filming of Pylon (really another kind of Faulkner novel entirely), Tarnished Angels. 10/10.
