I didn't see this movie until it appeared on television, because I was questionable about comic movie. Since the Batman series, "Spawn", "Judge Dredd" and many other pitiful 13-bombs, I have all at all costs plunged. I will question in my mind, "why can't someone make a movie classified R and stay the story where, how difficult is it?" And finally, my prayers were answered with Blade. This movie appears straight from the pages on the screen with mere violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, good against evil, etc. Yes, many action slips contain all these things, and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the movie is just filmed, not overboard, good length and never a dull moment. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first. Sheets are indeed one of the best real-life comics I've seen long ago.
