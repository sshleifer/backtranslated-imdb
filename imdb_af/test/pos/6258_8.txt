This little movie reminds of several other movies, but manages its own style and mood. "Troll" & "Do not Beraid of the Dark" come to mind. The tension builders were good, and just across the line from G to PG. I especially liked the non-clich√© choices with the parents; In other movies, I could predict the verbatim dialogue, but the writing in this movie made better choices. If you want a movie that is not gross but you give a few chills, it's a good choice.
