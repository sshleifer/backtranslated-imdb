How on earth this film is no longer widely regarded, it is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I picked it up for Â£ 1, and I'm not exaggerating if I say it's the best pound I've ever spent on a movie. <br /> <br /> The thing that usually drops movies over the club scene is either the music or the real scenes filmed in the clubland. <br /> <br /> Here, the music and club scene is completely credible, using some great songs of the time, and filmed in real clubs, with people who actually look like they want to be there. <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are of high quality, though, although Jason Donovan is particularly up to me (playing Frank N Furter in the Rocky Horror Show in London at about the time It had to be filmed, so its dragging phase was in full flow!), and of course Tim Curry whose eloquent drug country boss is convincing. <br /> <br /> Simply put, if you're a fan of the British movie, you should see it, no matter if you are in the club, because the movie is strong eno ugh as a story anyway. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
