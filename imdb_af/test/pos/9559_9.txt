In a previous comment I mentioned how much I enjoyed this movie - better the second time. I don't take that opinion off. Oddly enough, I can't find anyone else who liked it so much. <br /> <br /> My mom will see it, but several friends have said her "No way". My sister and her family saw it and half of the theater went halfway through. <br /> <br /> My wife's suggestion is that Australians regard the characters as just ordinary, everyday Americans and that's why it's not funny. But hey, most Americans think all Australians are like Crocodile Dundee, so it's nice to have the shoe on the other side for a change.
