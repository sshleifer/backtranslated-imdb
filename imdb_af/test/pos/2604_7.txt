After the attack of the Fifty Wife with Alison Hayes, the doors for women opened just as dangerously as men. There was, of course, an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch, and more of a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine of "It's a crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy world" to play the role . The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine might just be too sweet and innocent to look at Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with a number of smoldering sex appeals; Provine is more the girl next door. She may have taken this role and done to prove she can be sexy, but the material allows her. However, Lou Costello proves he can do a movie without Bud Abbott giving him lines and even playing a dramatic role in some of his screens if he doesn't turn to Gale Gordon as his foreman for gags. Gordon states, however, that everything he can do is fleeting, confused and intrusive, much the same character he later created on "The Lucy Show". Charles Lane also plays the same role in everything he does: a straight man, and his screen time is limited. The special effects are convincing for the time being, but I would have liked Dorothy to be a little more than cheesecake and dress and at least to be dangerous. As the film's main character takes his second costing to Costello, which in all the movie with Dorothy disappears several times like a sub-plot. The whole movie compiled just can't decide if it's science fiction, a comedy or just a parody of the Allison Hayes classic. There are many good scenes, some very funny humor and some very ridiculous camps that touch the rest of the movie. Yet I like this movie for empowering women; there aren't enough movies out there like this one. If this movie had the opportunity to be recreated today, I would highly recommend Hofney Cox and Jason Alexander and let me write the original script completely again. Courtney tops my list of actresses that I believe can and should play good enough giants; Although I have to admit that if one of the titanic beauty Allison or Dorothy came to me, I was going to be silent!
