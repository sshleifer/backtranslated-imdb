Much of this movie was beautiful. The play, the scenery, and no doubt, showed Aaron's kinematic backdrop to the beautiful shots. Definitely worth watching, because your attention will be captivated all the time, and it just ends on the right note. <br /> <br /> The acting of newcomer Jonathan Furr was wonderful, as one would think he was a pro-actress since he was born. He acted in other feature films, but this lead will always be remembered. <br /> <br /> The film does have that academy award, sometimes it is slow and beautiful and quiet. It is not a movie that does not add children. However, the rustic feel of East Bend and Yadkinville played well as a 1940s movie.
