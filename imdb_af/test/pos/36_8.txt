LACKAWANNA BLUES is an entertaining, exciting, emotionally charged HBO TV movie based on the childhood memories of actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson (also appearing in a small role). This joyous film experience is centered on the childhood of Santiago-Hudson, Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a strong, grieving woman who rented a New York boarding house in the 1950s. Nanny was a one-woman social service organization whose residence was full of drunkenness, drugs, cripples, drug addicts, misfits and everyone in town who needed a hand instead of a handout. The essence of the story revolves around the relationship between Nanny and Young Ruben (beautifully played by Marcus Franklin), a boy whose divorced parents could not properly deliver the boy, so Nanny entered him. S. Epatha Brandonon, which has been wasted for years The resigned role of Lieutenant Van Buren on NBC's law and order, becomes, in a performance performance such as Nanny, the neighborhood mother, whose boarding house has become a symbol for the black people in the city. Brandon is nothing short of beautiful, in a show that earned her a Golden Globe and an Emmy award. Brandonon is backed by an impressive all-star cast that includes Terrance Howard (Brilliant and heartbreaking as Nanny's husband), Louis Gossett Jr., Rosie Perez, Jimmy Smits, Delroy Lindo, Macy Gray, Michael K. Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Henry Simmons, Patricia Wettig, Ernie Hudson, Mos Def, and Hill Harper as the Ruben adult. Colorful and exciting, beautifully photographed and beautifully crafted, this is one of a kind of movie experience working at all levels, but if for no other reason is it worth seeing for the electric head performance by S. Epatha Brandonon, the Role of a lifetime and make the most of it.
