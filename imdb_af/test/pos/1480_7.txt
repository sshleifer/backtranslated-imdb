All the judges made a big mistake. This movie is not supposed to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It's made for kids and teens from the late 80's or early 90's and as such it was truly a movie of his time. If you hated that period, or the first movie loves so much that you can't even joke, then it's garbage, but just because it wasn't meant for you. The low budget here and the failure of the Beastmaster 1 at the box office (amounting to less than four million with a nine million budget) were, of course, the reasons for dropping and setting the severity of the original. You can complain about the story, dialogue or logic, but again it's made to run, not to win races. If the film itself were trying to be serious, it would be a total failure, but it doesn't do it for a moment. Seeing a movie advertising the Beastmaster 2 says enough. To Paraphrase Clint Eastwood from Dirty Harry Movies: This movie knows it's limitations. It's more of a comedy / parody than ordinary adventure. Soundtrack (for the time) was also wonderful. Actors don't take themselves so seriously, or even the usually annoying "spoiled rich brat" role (played very well by young Kari Wuhrer) is good. <br /> <br /> So, if you're nostalgic for the 80's / 90's (cheese) culture, or you like the first part, and don't mind going out on a cheese limb, you'll find plenty have fun with this attempt to revive (literary) Dar in the 1990s. It is not really the successor to the first, and does not see if it is what you want. It's more of a "what if" fantasy successor. <br /> <br /> What about "why different dimension and not just another time" question: When in history do we have the long winged humanoid creatures that flash the bones (from the end of part 1)? By the way, the movie ends up in the zoo due to an attempt at a cheap (cash) big final. This is the best place for Dar to show all his movements (he is the animal manipulator).
