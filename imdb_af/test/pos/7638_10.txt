I watched this movie and thought it would be absolutely horrible and ready for all the wheat, bad special effects, etc. But I was pleasantly surprised. Not to say it's the best vampire movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely not the worst. I like the whole alternative reality / dream state that played in the movie. The graphics were pretty good for a straightforward DVD movie and I like the overall look of the movie. I enjoyed the main character Sai. I usually end up with the women leaders, but there was something about her that kept me interested. Yes, she made bad decisions, but it was to be expected. Yes, the other characters were stereotypical, but I also expected it. I don't know if I highly recommend this movie, but give it a chance and you will be pleasantly surprised. I put this one on my guilty pleasure list.
