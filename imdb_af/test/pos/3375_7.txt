I'm not going to lie. To say that this movie is confusing is to say the sun is hot, but not really. And if you saw cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, "Donnie Darko" and "Southland Tales", you know it should mean something. When I watched this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. About an hour in the movie, about half of the audience has already walked out. By the end there were only 15 people wondering what in hell they just saw. I can only understand about 40% of what I've seen on the screen and even then it can only be called interpretation. So why did I give this movie a big seven stars? Because we get some spectacular performances (Marsden's big and Langella return as a familiar, scary character), and above all two, because it's totally original and Richard Kelly, undoubtedly one of the bravest directors living, uses his creative vision of a story that dares to be different. Honestly, this is the only way - just through Kelly's unique style this story can be told as intended. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, if you're not willing to spend a serious thought in an intelligent movie (and even then it can't make anything), stay far away from this one. But if you want to see a deep, rich, complex and exciting piece about spirituality, existentialism, and the predictability of human nature, it will see. However, be prepared for long conversations with your partner. <br /> <br /> * Note: If you've accidentally read this review, taken my recommendation, actually watched the movie and believe you still have 2 hours of your life, I'd love to think about the whole meaning and plot of share the movie. Look, that's why I loved it so much - it promotes discussion! As hard as it is, I'll try to summarize it by a relatively depressing quote by Langella's character, explaining the meaning of the simple box to an employee: "Your home is a box in which you live. The car you drove to work, a box, on the wheels. When you get home from work, you sit in front of a box of moving images. You watch until the mind and soul roots and the box that exacerbates your body when you are finally placed in the ultimate box ... to rest under the ground and the earth. "
