The happiest days of your life show some of Britain's biggest comedy talents of its time in a traditional farcical and upper class twit like fashion. Generally, it's a whistle-stop tour of brilliant English behavior with the girls-only school, offering a good environment for the dotty goings-on. Margaret Rutherford, Alastair Sim and - especially! - Joyce Grenfell are all fantastic, who laughed us a lot, expressing their total horror about what they should handle. As the film is underway, things are becoming softer and softer with the tour around the school, because the parents are a suitable college college. <br /> <br /> At this stage, I will again give a special mention to Joyce Grenfell and her wonderful character, Miss Gossage. She is so extraordinarily innocent, stupid, apologetic and ineffective that she looks the whole movie. She gives the biggest laugh of the movie when she flirts with a male teacher ("Call me sausage!"). <br /> <br /> While some of the movie is slow or dated and not always very involved, it still preserves most of its sparkle and rare breaks for romance. Good for a stupid, harmless giggle. <br /> <br /> 7/10
