A Tale of Tale with Tenderness: Uncomfortable young Jewish girl in World War II befriended an escaped German POW hiding in her clubhouse. They discuss their lives and beliefs (he is anti-Hitler), she sneaks at him, he becomes her only friend and ally. All of this reminds me of the much better movie movie "Whistle Down The Wind", where Hayley Mills is befriended by Alan Bates, but you certainly can't fault the direction here, which is smooth or the best performances. Adult in her teens, Kristy McNichol carries most of the photo and never touches a fake note. Suddenly, when the prisoner is discovered (and Kristy is also invented), the movie becomes very difficult. Her father, shocked and embarrassed that his child agrees with "that Nazi", lies in her with a silent rage that I have rarely seen before (he tells her, "You're dead to me," for a little girl must be devastating to Hear). The final scenes don't matter; There are no big reunions, no handy climbs. The girl must face the world and learn such a bitter lesson about neighbors, friends and family. A surprising movie.
