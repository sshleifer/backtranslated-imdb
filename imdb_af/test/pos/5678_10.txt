Went with my friends and saw this movie here in London last weekend. We didn't know what to expect, the poster chased it off and I will no longer say I shouldn't spoil the plot, but we found it to be a great movie with a big play, convincing plot and scary like hell! After doing some research on making the movie, I have to give it to the guys, the filmmakers, actors, writers, etc. Hand over because they compiled such a film with such limited resources. After-production done very well too. For all this, I give them 10 out of 10, and I hope they will continue their good work. Keep it up, guys. You rock!
