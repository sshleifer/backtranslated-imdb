What can I say about this movie that hasn't been told hundreds of times before? It's an American Classic. It produced dozens of imitators. Or not. Midnight Madness is one of those kinds. From the ridiculous opening montage / music to the Bonaventure HOtel, I was addicted. Leon made us all feel so young and careless. One question, however, how did he have those two hot hackers with him? And how did the time / money have to arrange such an opportunity? The throw is top. David Naughton is here at his best. His tight yellow jersey is disturbing. His little brother, Michael J Fox (in his first lead), is a real brat. There is also Naughton's love interest and a dork and the mandatory black man in a fisherman's hat on the yellow team. Michael J Fox does bad things like stealing beer at the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery and driving off to Flounder's van. Flounder's team gives us the most comedy. What's the deal with the blonde on that team? Do they think Flounder? Or Melio? Or Blade? Yes, the Mexican gentleman's name is blade. The other man on the Flounder team has the best rules of the movie, I won't pump them here. The meat machine team is a bunch of drunk. My personal favorite is armpit. But the silent black man is also good. The other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians (two 450 lb twins). <br /> <br /> You know the end from the beginning. But it does not matter. This is the 80's genre at its best. Don't rent this one, BUY IT. and buy it now.
