This film had my interest enough to watch it several times. The plot has holes, but the main performers make it work. <br /> <br /> Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge) does a good job as a 37-year-old woman who has sacrificed everything else to become a doctor. She spent years earning the money to go to the medical school. She is going brilliantly into her residence and is just about to take her advice and realize her dream. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Julia's sister and brother-in-law are being murdered and as the closest living family member she is forced to take her cousin Amanda (Arlen Aguayo-Stewart) to prevent her from becoming a state hall has. Amanda is about 7 years old of her appearance. Amanda is so traumatized from her parent's murder that she has become dumb. Needless to say, Julia's 16-hour days get Amanda more caring. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney, a beautiful neighbor in their apartment building working his way into Julia and Amanda's lives. He is always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda with her distress. Amanda really starts to warm Kevin as the movie progresses, perhaps more than her aunt. Julia begins to rely on Kevin to take care of Amanda's cargo, as she seeks to handle and prepare for her charge. Kevin is always there when a crisis breaks out for Julia. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was wonderful. You keep seeing them coming together before the end of the movie. That chemistry between Rob and Arlen was also good. Arlen managed to carry quite a lot without the benefit of words. The plot gradually warmed Julia and Amanda together. You can see how they work out when the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> We discover that Julia's sister and brother-in-law (the Meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. They stole a very valuable prototype microchip from their employer. They had three associates who wanted to share the proceeds of the theft. Julia discovers that the Meyers were planning to overthrow the land under supposed identities. The plot is unclear whether the Meyers intended to double their associates or double crossed themselves. <br /> <br /> In any case, 2 of their former associates murder Meyers in their home. The murderers make no attempt to withdraw the location of the Meyers' microchip before being killed. The murderers are looking for the house and do not get their price. They leave a living witness of their crime, Amanda. The murderers then spend the rest of the film and make clumsy attempts to extract Julia's and Amanda's microchip. They have no idea where the price is. Eventually, the murderers kidnap Amanda in the hope that she knows something about the location of the microchip. <br /> <br /> Finally, Julia discovers the truth about Kevin. He is an investigator hired to repair the stolen microchip. After a few rough moments in the relationship, they succeed in saving Amanda and sending the bad guys. The predictable end has the three that form a family, and together in a future happiness. <br /> <br /> What struck me about the plot was big holes. Kevin moved the day after the murder of the Meyers in the same apartment building as Julia and Amanda. How does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers? The killers leave greasy fingerprints on the murder scene, without hiding their identity. The murderer pretending to be a psychiatrist is revealed to Amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe sole. He was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film. There are also other weaknesses that are too much to mention. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been much better if the script is more refined for filming. By filling in the plot holes, there would have been little money and the effort significantly improved.
