I do not understand why critics would rely on this movie. It's a teenage movie that's really serious, which is a rarity. I will admit that there are moments that are juicy, but it's about young love, it must be juicy to be valid. My biggest complaint is Chris Klein. While he was funny in American Pie, he was apparently not ready for the switch in a more dramatic ride, he was very uncomfortable looking at some of his "mama stuff". Hartnett and Sobieski, on the other hand, show a remarkable amount of depth and credibility, just as the parent says. Although the screenplay is strongly clicked on by the lovers of poetry, the actor does it. Directing sports a few powerful images on the screen. Beautiful cinematography, nice music, great young actors, I was impressed and I am a criticized critic when it comes to teenage movies.
