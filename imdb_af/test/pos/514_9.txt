Blade is a fantastic action / thriller that will keep you up to date and deliver Wesley Snipes what I would say to be his best performance. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything you want in action / thriller, it has a lot of blood, guts and gore, a twisted, disturbed buy, moments of humor, but most important is a very good story line with many twists. They are constant action throughout the movie with breathtaking stunts and effects, Wesley Snipes fighting is fantastic. <br /> <br /> In my opinion this movie is a must see, Wesley Snipes cool, solid look makes this movie and I can't wait for the sequel to release "BLADE 2" next year. <br /> <br /> My IMDB score - 9 out of 10
