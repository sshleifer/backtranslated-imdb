This film works on different levels. It is a profile of a very cool couple, a social commentary on aging and nursing homes, a love story, a musical. I've seen Uncle Frank several times, and every time I see it, I'm not sure who to call first - my parents, my wife, a friend I lost contact with. . But it has a way of reminding you of the most important relationships in your life - and wants to confirm those who keep up. Expect lots of laughter, and probably tears as any of the live characters hit a chord here. I'm pretty sure they will.
