/ * can contain SPOILERS, but of course it doesn't matter :) * / <br /> <br /> Battleship Potemkin is one beautiful spectacle of ghostly images. The visual direction is (and is) inspiring, the scale of the film is impressive, and the technique is definitely a pioneer. What I really enjoy is in my mind the depth and efficiency of a movie, without proper literary writing, sound (except the soundtrack), decent image quality, the faux-profound (self) references of today, extraordinary acting , pretense, etc. What you get is a pure visual experience to be remembered. BTW, the previous poster noted: "Eisenstien felt after much suffering to give the heroes what they wanted you to think Eisenstein was building up to a great final battle and then he pushed you. That is a bit cheap. rather a big final action scene. "<br /> <br /> I have to warn you The end is not cheap, and Eisenstein was not generous to the heroes. However, history was. Potemkin really went through the squadron, as shown in the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, I strongly recommend seeing Battleship Potemkin to someone who is more or less interested in the movie. Seeing this with a fellow movie buff, it talked me for hours. However, if you consider movies that are commonly considered "big" or "classic", to be "slow" or "boring", this movie may not be for you. Not much cheap entertainment here. <br /> <br /> For me, however, it is a complete 10/10.
