There are two ways to view 'Head'. Or it is a brilliant, ingenious collage of music, old film clips, psychedelia and T.V. sitcom style comedy, or a plot less, pretentious, rattling mess. The truth is probably somewhere in between. It is also one of the best movies of all time. <br /> <br /> "The Monkees" - Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Mike Nesmith - have just finished their hit series and wanted a Movie. In collaboration with author Jack Nicholson and director Bob Rafelson, they made 'Head'. <br /> <br /> It starts at a bridge ceremony in San Francisco, where the Monkeeshek collapses. Mickey jumps over the safety rail and puts hundreds of feet in the water. Mermaids save him the accompaniment of a beautiful Jerry Goffin & Carole King composition called The Porpoise Song and visual sources that make the Stargate final of 2001 look like. By this time you will also be turned into astonished horror or completely enchanted. <br /> <br /> More bizarre events unfold; Mickey uses a tank to destroy a Coca-Cola machine in the middle of the desert; the whole Italian army handed him over; The group is hired to play the rose in Victor Adult's hair for a television commercial; an overweight waitress insults the group, describing them as "God's gift to the eight-year-olds"; a surprise birthday party for Mike goes wrong; The group is sucked into a vacuum cleaner, and to tie it all in, a huge tank is driven. <br /> <br /> You will also hate or love it. I found it a refreshing change of thoughtless pop music from the 'Let's do the show right here' variety. The songs are good too; "Daddy's Song" is beautifully choreographed by Toni Basil (later in Rafelson's "Easy Rider") and boasts wonderful editing, with Davy's changing color at lightning speed. "As we go along" is a beautiful Goffin & King number whose accompanying images carry a strong environmental message. <br /> <br /> Annette Funicello, Frank Zappa, is just two of the gas stars to eat. Did Victor Adult read the script before agreeing to do so, wondering? However, he is hilarious. <br /> <br /> So angry there should just be real genius behind it, 'Head' is a little 60's jewel and one is worth repeating time and time again. Shame it then did not find an audience. If only "Spiceworld" were so!
