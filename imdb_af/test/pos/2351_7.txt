"Hollywood Cavalcade" is a spectacular 1939 movie featuring two staples of the 20th Century Fox Grid Don Ameche and Alice Faye. It contains a few jokes. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a Max Sennett type, Michael Connors (Ameche) who brings an actress to Hollywood, Molly Adair (Faye) and makes her a big quiet comedian, eventually bringing her into move more dramatic roles. He becomes very successful with her as his star. Obsessed with his work, he was absolutely shocked when she and her leading husband (Alan Curtis) ran off and married. He was so shocked, he showered her. She and her husband go down and stay more popular as Connors' studio starts losing money at an alarming rate. Before you know it, he's gone. Molly wants to help, and asks Connors to direct her next film. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of Keystone head-type stuff, quite funny, and a great slapstick by Buster Keaton, which is great. The movie also features a play of "The Jazz Singer" when the talks take over. The in-joke has to do with Rin Tin-Tin, for whom Zanuck used to write. In one scene, Rinny's coach brings him a potential contract player for Connors' studio. Connors both threw them out of his office. A few scenes later, Rin-Tin-Tin was shown to be the # 1 box office. The role of the famous German shepherd in this film is played by Rin Tin-Tin, Jr. Dad succeeded in 1932 in Jean Harlow's arms, one month ashamed of his 14th birthday. Fortune even smiled at the end. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye is very beautiful and does a good job, just like Ameche, who turns into an energetic show. J. Edward Bromberg and Stuart Erwin offer very good support. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie isn't quite sure what it is - history, comedy, romance or drama. But, "Hollywood Cavalcade" is still quite viewable.
