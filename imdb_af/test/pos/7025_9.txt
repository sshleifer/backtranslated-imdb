I didn't understand what that line meant ... I do now. I also didn't want to see Dirty Dancing. I rented it but never looked at it - and today I did it. And I thought it was a very nice, fantastic movie that made you want to get up and dance. Well, it was sometimes cheesy ... but it's still a good movie. I can't believe Jennifer Gray was 27 in this movie - my friend and I thought she looked about 18 or 19-20. I think it's attributed to her acting talent. And sometimes she sometimes looked uncomfortable. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can say he is in his thirties and looks a bit old. Nevertheless, still very good. I love 80's songs, so it really struck me a chord and the love story (yes, I'm a romantic one) was done so wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Exceed my expectations!
