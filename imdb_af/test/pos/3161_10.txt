A lot about the US The movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood falsity that glorifies things that should not be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's recent events (although I don't always always know exactly where he stands), but I admire the unusual and artistic way to make the point. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. Play a big role here as visual. Most of the time, the footage of the story is accompanied by these sound elements to good effect. I'm kind of a radio buff, so it was satisfying to hear how the radio is embedded in the fit of the movie. In fact, most of the dialogue takes place over the story rather than talking to characters. It is not to say that there are no characters, but except for Jim, the main character (some sort of '60s falling out with a volatile state of mind), the others come very quickly. A few make a very powerful impression, especially a guru-like taxi driver who looks the voice of wisdom himself. When he goes out in a spontaneous song of prayer while driving Jim to the subway, it's a very powerful moment. On the cover of the DVD is the quote "The danger is clear", taken from President Bush's speech that paved the way to our invasion of Iraq. Due to the speech on a climate in the film, we looked back on how we live in a historically charged time that will always be remembered.
