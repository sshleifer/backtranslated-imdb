This movie was great, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughs then it's right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it enjoy the whole family and get a good laugh. I first saw the movie when I was about 10 and got the most of it. This movie is also nice because it makes fun of everything involved, "At the order of the Kings' financial secretary H and R Blockhead?" <br /> <br /> Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes (Robin Hood) in life, or not his Liar Liar with the "Claw" or Saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth watching
