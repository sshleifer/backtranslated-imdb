It was recommended to me by a friend who said it was cute and hug for a "lesbian sexuality Flick". Boy was wrong. I think he just didn't get it. Not to understand and to discover yourself through trial and tribulation is more like that. <br /> <br /> The characters are full and lively and the story has enough fun to be thrown by the theater shows to anyone interested. /> <br /> Rachael Stirling as "Nan" goes through so many tries to find the love she just wants to find it was the one person she was afraid to reveal and run out of. Johdi May as "Flo" was remarkable. spent a few hours remembering where I had seen her before, just to discover she was the quiet sister "Alice" in "Last of the Mohicans". Fortunately, I was raised in a liberal family and I had no problem with a movie. like this. So many people are missing out on such movies. I'm glad I took my friend's advice and tried it. But I'm sure I enjoyed it more.
