From all the parodies of Star Wars I saw, it's probably the funniest. Not because of the premise, Star Wars with simple electronics instead of spacecraft, but because of how poor it behaved. It is deliberately overhauled and it makes it hilarious, and because everyone knows it's deliberately exaggerated, nobody complains. The special effects were also deliberately as horrible as it could be, and include a toaster on a visible rope that toasts, and an egg cup on a rope. This card is funny for any Star Wars fan (which I am not) or someone who has 15 minutes to kill. Great card !! <br /> <br /> My rating: *** from ****. 13 minutes. Not rated.
