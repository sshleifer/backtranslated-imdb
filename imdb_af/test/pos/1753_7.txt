Hoppity is a beautiful as a slight filadelfische animation film, which took it into account in 1941, the test of time stood incredibly well. Now I have to admit I have looked at a soft spot for 'HoppityGoes To Town' (as it is called in the UK) looking at a VHS version that our parents have often packed with our siblings. up this morning just in time to catch it on Channel Four (by 0615, never less!) The movie was just as wonderful as I remembered with the animation that was the test of time and a beautiful moral story on parents and children would have to appeal. equal. Maybe someday I will share this forgotten classic with my own children. With a nice running time for kids (88 Min's) and a simple story involved, there is really something for everyone in this story of the little guy who comes along well. I really could see that it was successfully restored in CGI. Watch Pixar.
