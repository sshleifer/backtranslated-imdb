It is one of the best "Blocks" movies from the early 90's and although slightly dated, it is one of those movies that will never be made today. It makes it very special! In fact, a very similar movie was made in the '90s called "Masterminds" and it was a PG variation on the same theme, but it was not so fun or realistic anywhere. <br /> <br /> So what's so special about this movie? This is the comrare between the main characters and the anti-chance theme of the film. Sean Astin is very nice and has died in some of the most memorable films of the 80's, especially "The Goonies". He also went on bigger things with the "Rudy" and "The Lord of the Rings" Trilogy, but "Encino Man" is a great trip to the memory lane. Will Wheaton from "Stand by Me" provide support to the movie and Andrew Divoff is a terrific villain. Louis Gossett Jr. walks in his role, but he adds some shortness to the film, especially his relationship with Astin's rebellious nature. <br /> <br /> So how's the action? Against today's standards, it's pretty boring and cheap, almost like a TV movie, but the production values ​​are good and the violence is pretty nasty to a movie with school students. However, the director provided for the limited budget for some exciting moments and well-placed humor. <br /> <br /> So keep your brain at the door and enjoy this ingenious action movie, but don't expect Oscar stuff. !
