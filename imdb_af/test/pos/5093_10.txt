Peter O'Toole gives a brilliant performance in this movie. I saw the original version with Robert Donat, and I prefer Peter O'Toole's performance and the movie in general, even though it is a musical. I have never seen anything that Mr O'Toole is in which I do not like. He is a brilliant actor, talented, offering performances full of passion and depth. Petula Clark also delivered a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for the show. It's an all-encompassing heart-warming movie, full of softness and bittersweet fun. I will always remember (in para-phrase) the line where Mr. Chips regrets that he has never given her children, and she replies, "Of course you have hundreds of them - all boys." Thank you for the opportunity to vote for this movie and vote for my opinion.
