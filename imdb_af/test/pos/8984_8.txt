This movie stars Peter Lorre as an extremely nice guy who immigrates to America. Unfortunately, shortly after his arrival, he was in a terrible fire and his face was terribly burned. Being so horrible, no one wants to help him and out of despair, he overcame a crime to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his uglyness. Where exactly the movie goes from there, you just have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I recorded this movie an 8 because the money spent making it is a good movie with very good twists in the plot to keep it interesting. The movie may turn into a simple horror or crime movie, but it goes far beyond these a few surprises. In addition, Lorre's excellent play shows that he was able to support more than just roles. It is an excellent film and delivers more than most A-pictures of the day.
