When I was in the 10th grade, my friend and I were late in his house and sat around the cable and watched this movie. We watched it because it looked so funny and because it had boobs. But then came the end and we just sat there completely speechless. I think after a minute to look at the credits roll, he just calved. "Oh dude ....." It goes from dumb 80's teen sex comedy to nihilistic realism so fast it captures you. I've been trying to rent this movie for years and couldn't find it - and no one ever saw it except for me and my friend - so it looks. But now it's available! I strongly suggest renting it and strengthening yourself.
