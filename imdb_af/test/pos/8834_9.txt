Clearly, the responses have been written here many years after the movie was released and cannot be taken in context. Back in 1980 in post-work England, this movie was bloody funny. We were delighted with something to laugh about and Rising Damp, with its sympathetic mockery of full social strata, was one of the best British sitcoms of its time, if not ever. In almost everyone it hit a chord and in true British fashion we laughed at the Rigsby in ourselves. America had nothing to do with this kind of humor, because self-loss was not amusing to our overseas cousins. Leonard Rossiter was one of England's best actors, on stage, on television and in movies. His dedication and professionalism were unmatched. Richard Beckinsale, though young, was a perfect comic foil for Rossiter and should, by all rights, be considered a great time. If he is not that young, I am sure he will now be classified as one of Britain's greatest comedy actors. Frances De la Tour found her best television moment in Rising Damp, and she never quantified her undisputed ability with further roles. If you didn't see the movie at the time of its release, you can't comment, just because you can't understand why it was funny, the humor of the moment.
