This movie is sweet - not cloying, just hot and enthusiastic. I just found it a little funny, and the point of departure is * very unlikely, but the characters are so charming (especially Minnie Driver's) that they have received my full attention from the start. <br /> <br /> Bonnie Hunt did a good job in her reigning debut, and also a good job of writing. I recommend this movie and will see it again, I'm sure.
