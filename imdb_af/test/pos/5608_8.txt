This 1-hour 30-minute joke is best understood by Catholics, the number one religion of self-healing comedians around the world. That's not to say it can't stand on its own, it doesn't mean it's not without its flaws. Technical problems, mostly: Believe that digital digital was the answer in 1998 when it was actually in its infancy - a Beta of a Beta if you like, and it will never be improved. For the love of God, Hal ... get yourself a red one. Or three. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you like Hartley movies, you'll love it. I liked it because I liked Grim / Fool, and there were additional benefits of retrospective: I couldn't help finding a disturbing self-prophecy, a plane that ran in the 1998 movie. It was as if Cheney got the whole idea of ​​Hal. It's true - Hartley moves his players around in the camera because it's the House of Commons, just one piece of the gym that needs a rest. After all, we have been paying attention to the actors, and the writing is alive. Not great writing, but ... fiery. Can I use the word fervently? Intentional, intelligent, not condescending. <br /> <br /> Absolutely love PJ Harvey in this course, I will love her everywhere. Strange, if Helen Mirren needs a younger self, she needs to look up Harvey and bring a bottle of blond.
