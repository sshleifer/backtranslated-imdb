Author-director Dean Bell presented many surprises and engaging moments in this modest, compelling road movie. His dialogue was funny and his use of very short flashback sequence was especially effective in the film's narrative structure. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the movie is the character of Alice, running away from her New England past in a desperate attempt to come to Florida. Along the way she travels with some eccentric, Bill and Sandra, who are incredibly trying to produce Alice as a prostitute earning money at truck stop. <br /> <br /> As newcomer to her first screen role, Emily Grace as Alice is sensational. There is no false note in her character choices. But the film is especially worth watching for the clever but sensitive character of Sandra, as masterfully created by Judith Ivey. There is a particularly clever subtext on virtually every moment Ivey is on camera. As a viewer I found myself stopping the tape, rewinding, and reviewing her scenes to try to discern the psychological subtleties. <br /> <br /> The movie asks the following question about the characters: Is Bill and Sandra good Samaritans, or are they some evil Dickensian predators preaching on the youthful Alice? One of the strengths of the film is that it never completely answers the question. Alice looks more confident than she started because of her experiences with Bill and Sandra. But is she really a better person? <br /> <br /> Part Comedy, Partial Photo, and a Part of the Age Drama, this carefully crafted film succeeds in engaging us on many levels.
