OK ... the movie (like Segal's last few movies) goes beyond the "beat", kicks them in the groin, shoots them in the face, gets revenge against the bad guys for the hurt of my sister's cousin's cousin "things Seagal had been in for a while. Geepers, Steven started thinking and using his money to make movies with real ideas in them. Care .... there is a lot of action in this movie, but also a little thought and heart, it's not an Oscar movie, but worth the effort, unless the viewer is so brave that it should be hurt for more than a second. Or two!
