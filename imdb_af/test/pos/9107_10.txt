I've been waiting for this movie for so many years! The best part is that it lives on my faces! This is a MUST SEE for any Tenacious D or True Jack Black fan. It's just as good to see JB, KG and Lee on the big screen! It is not a true story, but it cares. The D is the greatest bond on earth! Last week I listened to the soundtrack to the movie and listened. To see the movie was pure bliss for me and my husband. We both met Jack and Kyle after two different Tenacious D concerts and also saw them as they toured with Weezer. We left the concert after D finished playing. Nobody can put their performance on top! Long live the D !!! : D
