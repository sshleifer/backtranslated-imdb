It's a powerful movie that has never re-emerged after the Joe McCarthy censorship period. It influenced me as a Jewish teenager who had friends of different colors and whose family suffered from fascist regimes in Europe in the second quarter of the twentieth century. Contrary to the later rip-off, "On The Waterfront", which looked like some themes and turned around to match the forced Hollywood political correctness of time, it has its story directly and with respect for the characters and the tell reality. it reflected fiction. It was an antidote to "Gone With the Wind," "Birth of a Nation," "Triumph of the Will," and so many other glorifiers of hatred and violence. I will place it next to the recent German movie (also virtually hidden in the US), "Rosenstrasse". <br /> <br /> I remember that the TV version, also black and white in format as well as story, was black from some stations because the black hero's wife appeared white. As a young civil rights worker, it caused me a conflict because I was on the one hand smoking cigarettes, and on the other hand, the boycott in Georgia from a sponsor of the TV show, a big tobacco company, opposed (I no longer remember which one - does anyone else?). <br /> <br /> I would like to find a CD of the film or TV show to show my sons what my opposition to racism has universally informed (as opposed to fighting only against racism against Jews) and Recognizing the inherent link between racism and militaryism.
