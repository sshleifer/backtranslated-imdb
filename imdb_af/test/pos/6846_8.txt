Love this movie !! Great play by Carla Gugino. Interesting story about a horrific kidnapping (not all?). Some surprising twists in the film and the plot were easy to follow without being so overwhelmed that it was totally incomprehensible. It was a totally unexpected joy. More "Quentin-ish" than most movies are trying to be.
