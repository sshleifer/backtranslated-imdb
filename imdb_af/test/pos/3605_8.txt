Captain Corelli's Mandolin is not an Oscar contender, but it was pretty good. I have to admit that Ms Cruz can really act. She puts a very good performance. In fact, we do her boyfriend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to have enjoyed himself. I bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an Italian. However, I learned something. Another chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany surrendered to the allies and the eventual surrender of Germany the numerous Italian solidarians killed during that period.
