An obsessive love story, where the characters were extremely convincing. I think this film highlights the talent of professional actors. Especially for Vincent Cassel who would not (at the moment it was filmed) be the first character you think of. And yes, he managed to deceive the beautiful Monica Belluci, beyond the film, during this creation. I can only say that this film had to be released because it was in the US, rather than thinking it was a remake. It is just as French, almost distorted .... and yet so true ... this film must remain untouched ... <br /> <br /> A director who definitely needs more projects than this kind of subject requires the right amount of ingredients not to make it a flop.
