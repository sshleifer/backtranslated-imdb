"Here on Earth" is a surprisingly beautiful romantic story about Samantha that has both boy problems and health problems. Since her love for her current boyfriend, Jasper disappears, her love for Kelley flowers like a new spring flower. <br /> <br /> I touched this movie very much, very hot, very romantic, and touching. I enjoy every piece of this movie ... and it's pretty scarce! I recommend this movie to all movie lovers! This is a movie you don't want to miss !!! : D <br /> <br /> By the way ... if you are a very sentimental person who easily cries while watching movies, BE BEING !!! On the other hand, it was a very good movie! Very romantic ... and surprisingly good !!! : D <br /> <br />
