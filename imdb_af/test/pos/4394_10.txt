The first time I saw this movie didn't look at all. However, when I looked at it a second time, it made a lot more sense. Give it a chance, watch it more than once. There are many key elements that shape the story that can be seen first and even the second time, which can be missed. The Cohen brothers boast brilliant real events of the early 20th century in this story to make a credible environment and story. The combination of Clooney's leading role combines well with Turturro and Nelson's supporting deeds. John Goodman's appearance in the movie is hilarious. The soundtrack is also good. This movie has become a household favorite for my family. 10/10, for sure.
