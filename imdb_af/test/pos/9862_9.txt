After reading some of the earlier nasty comments, I had to bring in two cents. This show was NOT, despite what it thinks in Essex, the worst thing ever broadcast on TV. I think most of today's TV is much worse (when is this stupid "reality" gig ever ending?) And there's not a current show I can stand to watch. Gimme the things I grew up with. I am a baby of 1965 and am not ashamed to admit it. <br /> <br /> For nearly 30 years, this show has been my favorite. I was at high school when it was originally broadcast and I think it helped me to hang out through these unfortunate days. I was such a mistake at that time, and 'Fantasy Island' addressed my imagination. Since I was an emerging writer at the time, it provided incredible opportunities for me to practice the vessel. What a wonderful starting point! I won't say it didn't have its faults. Sometimes the scripts were pretty bad, and some of the problems were trivial; but it can also be good, and it was an explosion to watch and is still. Regarding the cheesiness factor, I think it's unfair to label every 70-year-old product as cheese. There were many good things and then it was among the ranks. (VAT, most seasons broadcast in the 80's!) My favorite episodes mostly come from seasons 2, 3 and 4. <br /> <br /> For those who deviate from Herv√© Villechaize for his heavy French accent and his short stature: GROW UP AND LEARN ANYONE! It's so easy to have fun when you're "normal" and "perfect". That man made the best of what he was treated in life, and if you don't like it, it's just hard. Be merciful. He died for 15 years, and how easy it is to cut down someone who can't defend himself. There is no more shame. <br /> <br /> I love this show. So it looks dated. Hate to tell you, but we did not have splendid special effects and Blu-Ray discs. We were happy to have videos. Live with it Accept it for what it is, and it's just fun. "Escapist TV" describes it perfectly, and that's what it was to me - an escape from my rotten real life. And it's still fun to watch.
