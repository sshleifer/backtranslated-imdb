Yul Brynner is Major Surov, a singing, dancing, vodka-drinking Russian officer stationed near the Austrian-Hungarian border during the Hungarian Revolt of 1956 in Anatole Litvak's The Journey. Although the movie still has to be released on video or DVD, it remains one of Brynner's most compelling performances. Due to political turmoil, a group of travelers cannot fly from Budapest, but are taken to Vienna. However, before reaching the border, their passports are taken and they are being held for questioning by the Russians under the leadership of Major Surov. <br /> <br /> The master has reason to suspect that a Hungarian freedom fighter has been smuggled from the country. Indeed, Lady Ashmore conceals a mysterious passenger, Paul Fleming (Jason Robards, Jr.) who pretends to be an American, but no one is foolish. She mainly helps Fleming pay a debt she owes due to the problems her previous association caused. Among the other passengers is a British journalist played by Robert Morley, an American family played by E.G. Marshall, his wife, Anne Jackson and their two children, one of whom is Ron Howard's screen debut. <br /> <br /> Major Surov takes a romantic interest in Lady Diana Ashmore (Deborah Kerr), and develops a romance of sorts among them. She offers him nothing but contempt and a stiff upper lip, although we suspect there is still beating under her heart. The Cold War plot and the powerful acting carry the story, but the romance is never quite convincing. However, it remains one of my favorite Yul Brynner films and deserves to see if it's just for his passionate achievement.
