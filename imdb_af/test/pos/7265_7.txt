This movie, no doubt, is the best I've seen, and really shows what British talent can do. The effects are very good, as the movie was introduced in the mid-18th century, and all the greed and disgusting filth of England at that time was very well captured. The character has evolved from MaCleane's fornications up to its development in the highway man and the exhibition 'The Gentleman Highwayman'. It's good with Robert Carlyle, whose cynicism and honor prove that you can love a thief and a criminal. I mention, 'He's got more honor in his little finger than any of your thick bastards! '<br /> <br /> Not of course referring to you! But it's probably the most agitated and emotionally charged scene ever seen in a movie, but you just have to see it to find out, enough to say it involves your rope around your neck. <br /> <br />
