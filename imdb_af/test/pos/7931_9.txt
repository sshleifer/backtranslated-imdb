Watch some of the sequels (bugs, the whole 1/3 of the film devoted to the battle on the ice) in Alexander Nevsy, a film by Russian legend Sergei M. Eisenstein (co-directed by Dmitry Vasilyev in his only significant credit), made me realize how much should really be going, at least on a scale like this. If I was a member of an award group at the time of the release of this film, I would probably award Eisenstein with the director's award this year, posthumously. It is such a bad stroke of movie-like genius to pull off some of the stuff taken out in the film, but for someone like this director after getting his best work - Battleship Potemkin and October - it could have been something he gained. first. But amidst a film that is sometimes a bit frustrating with how little gray comes in the black and white subject, it is almost a miracle of celluloid nearly 70 years later. Lord of the Rings fans, meet the movies' grandfather, to say so. <br /> <br /> To say something is a propaganda piece, it already puts a connotation, and often a bad one. This is something that has a complete message about it, and a standpoint. It is still a hot issue (see the arguments about Moore's films to prove), or there is great art from a point that is explicitly meant to exchange the audience in a specific way. In this particular case, the Russians against the Germans. By then, it was the second time in World War II, and Russia again confronted the "German invaders". It is interesting to note that Eisenstein was actually commissioned to make this film, as a call to never forget the Russians an important part of their history. The end result comes from something that is actually a bit common to see Battleship and October; If nothing else comes through the movies, Eisenstein is most concerned about how the image and content for the viewer can finally come together. The style can completely envelop the viewer. In these terms, Alexander Nevsky is fearless. <br /> <br /> But even with the whole idea of ​​'Great Russia, Germans bad', there are a few small moments where things are made slightly less strict, a little less strict for these ideals. For example, once we see the Germans in Privka, they are not a sightless blob that is totally barbaric and has a blind conquering purpose (not that they can't do everything). They also have their own national pride, and it will be no less for them to continue with what their Christian-led masters tell them. At least, the picture of the picture has a face, but it is kept at a low minimum for the more common side to kick in. There is also a short scene in front of the ice-battle where the Russian troop has joked and laughed, adding a little extra depth where else there might be little value. As Nikolai Cherkasov, who is more often not in Alexander Nevsky, loaded with battle songs with a pride in warfare, there are no complexities for characters, especially Nevsky himself (played in ultra-temperate fashion). ) that might be so in Eisenstein's intention to have him as the one infallible force to be reckoned with in the story. Of course, looking for an Eisenstein movie is trying to find non-Kosher pig's feet at a deli. <br /> <br /> But the real reason for seeing the picture is not the play, but the appearance of the movie, how it moves and taking in such a vast environment that Eisenstein highlights. On the epic scale, it is just as ambitious as its 20s, with a number of extras, not only in the main battle, but also in the scenes in the cities, of the hundreds of people going through. In fact, I want to say that any director working in Hollywood or elsewhere thinks they are doing a great epic, especially war, will do well to watch this movie, even if it is just the sound. It's even better if you thought of a silent movie, with the visual strokes at times fantastic. One can spend a whole month analyzing the battle on the ice, how it starts with the German soldiers, and then bugs ahead, and how Eisenstein fights between the close-ups of the actors and then wide shots and speed-up editing. And of course, one can also not discount the power of the music, Sergei Prokofiev is one of the great thrills of any epic work. All in all, the directors' editing keeps our eyes together with this furious action at break speed. If it were just a short movie, it would surely be the size of the Odessa staircase. <br /> <br /> If I found it a little less than absolutely beautiful, it would be due to the bugs coming from a director that is much more suited to the quiet medium than to sound. While I haven't seen Ivan the Terrible yet, I would be one negative criticism of his direction of actors, which is actually as wide as it can be, with the melodrama at such a height his staggering (the sub-graph of the two soldiers fighting for the Olga are the best example I can think of. But even if it is considered, Alexander Nevsky is generally too extraordinary to ignore, and a fiancee in action and the film is making a level that still sets a benchmark for movies to try.
