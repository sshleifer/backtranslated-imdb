Every time I watch this movie, it really makes me a good night out! My partner used "the weekend landed" speech to the psyche himself before going out! and so do I ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great debut for the writer / director - well done! <br /> <br /> The acting is great, all the characters are credible and bigger than life! The 'strange' scenes are a joy to watch, Jip's running Mr floppy flashbacks / explanations / visualizations are all great! The scene in the huuuuuuuge pub when everyone gets up and starts singing from the song song anthem, is also a laugh. There is a lot of comedy here - Howard Marks' speech politics is hilarious! <br /> <br /> Oh, God, you just have to see it. Note, I felt the movie glorified the use of ecstasy, but hey, that's the truth of the matter? At least the film doesn't shy away from this fact. I suppose the movie also carries a decent message on it. Don't take life too seriously, you sometimes have to lower your hair. And of course, the conversation in the bar, when Moff tries to explain to his friends that he's coming from the drug, is a reminder that when the good times come from outside, you know the party is over! <br /> <br /> It is sometimes a very clever film in using the camera, lighting, etc. It was an exceptional piece of cinema, and a good feeling of good friends, love, clubs and drugs. <br /> <br /> Get out of the 'gear race' people !!! <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> Enjoy!
