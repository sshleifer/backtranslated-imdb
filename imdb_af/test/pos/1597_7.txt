A movie to split his viewers. Only criticism at his funeral pace, over-exploited snap-zoom and persistent, twisting look among the lead actors. Advocates point to Dirk Bogarde's powerful display and Pasqualino De Santis's standard photography of Venice. <br /> <br /> It could represent an impressive, romantic elegance for the nobility of homosexual love (in 1971, when it was mutually legitimate). In fact, Visconti managed to make a richer, more complex movie than such a single-issue vehicle. He knit his ideas - decent and everything - in a meticulous pace arc. <br /> <br /> Inside, it is indeed the central display of Bogarde's Aschenbach. Instead of a sympathy, Johnny-kom-the-day-gay, he manages to give a pathetic composer struck by a tragedy and misunderstood integrity that sees the redemption in Tadzio. His enchanting to an increasingly bright Venice after the boy is a straightforward metaphor for the artist's determination for the truth in the teeth of the dilettante gang (and this is explicitly cut with such a flashback). <br /> <br /> Mahler's music may be a bit overused, though well-assigned. The Italian overlay is an anachronism that carries, but fortunately the play does not suffer too much. 10/07
