Contains spoils I've been recording some time ago when it was on PBS but never got a chance to watch it (probably due to bias to sit 5-6 hours of Masterpiece Theater, with his BBC for TV production style made music, settings all in one room, no outside screens watching TV ...)) But after I watched the movie Traffic (which I thought was pretty good at that time), I couldn't help the traffic tire to see what else they could have built in with the extra 2 1/2 hours. <br /> <br /> Boy, my preconceptions were wrong about this TV series. It is so much more involved than traffic. The characters fall out better so their actions are more credible. And the whole subplot in which Pakistan is involved completes the entire stance of everyone in the entire supply chain, from the farmer to the end user. In traffic, the Pakistani story was rewritten and reduced to a good policeman against a bad policeman. <br /> <br /> There were many more meaningful discussions and debates about alcohol and other forms of drug, while in Traffic they mostly became transient references of no meaning. The same with social issues, which were realistically conveyed in Traffik without the sermon. While in Traffic the characters exited it as a statement like the way they do it in those made for the TV release of the week movies. <br /> <br /> There was no bad guy vs good guy in Traffik, even the dealer is portrayed as a junkie who sells to support his habit rather than the "no one's wrong with my" type person in Traffic. <br /> <br /> The only part is that I've seen Traffic. Many before it was watched, it was difficult not to compare the scene to the scene, and although the scenes were not the same, I knew what the outcome would be. Thanks for the Pakistani story, which is different enough that I can fully enjoy it without thinking about what scene it compares to. Although I was thrown away, the drugs were in the ceramics of the statues in which Helen brought back to Germany (as in the story of Traffic.), Thanks. Traffic was not so hopeful and far-fetched.
