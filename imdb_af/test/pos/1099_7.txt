It was a nice movie. It had an interesting storyline, which was performed fairly well in the later part of the movie. The storyline reminded me of the city of God. But this one is done in a more beautiful way in comparison. It has what I really loved: a part of surrealism. A bit of interesting cinematography (through the wooden camera) I don't know if it is culturally correct, but it certainly increases your view of South Africa. The actors were good (for the 1st rally, most of them anyway), I especially liked Estelle's character, which made this movie quite enjoyable. What is interesting though is that it asks you about your own life. Do you really do what you really love? Or you agree to the norm, the convention around you. Worth a watch.
