I watched the movie and am delighted to see a film so different in character and story from the stupid, mainstream American main productions. It is a movie with a background that is interesting for young as much as all age groups. Unlike some reviews, the audience seems to be sharing my evaluation, as the film is very successful where it is exploited worldwide. For example, in the Netherlands, number 3 was chosen. Negative statements must be respected, but one should expect to be guided on a factual basis. If you get the chance, watch the movie and enjoy it.
