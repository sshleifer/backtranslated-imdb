1 let us suspend faith for a moment and let us stop pretending that we can know, may or should know "how it is" or "should". Human knowledge in that area is probably primitive, as medieval maps are compared to today's satellite maps, so we really have no idea. 2 consideration is "just" a BBC TV documentation simulation, it gets much better than very big budget blockbusters, and it's just incredible. All in all, a worthwhile show, as the CGI's improved and fictitious version of what we know about the solar system. 4 probably fictionalization and CGI ing is the whole thing the only way to make it taste great to a large public. Have you ever watched cuts of REAL space missions and REAL space probes? The quality is generally average to poor and the comparison will be to look at a chest x-ray (and tell it from the human body) and compare it to a CGI ed cyborg film ... Which one would be most entertaining? However, the x-ray of the breast is actually while the cyborg movie is just SFX-fictional. 5 actors do a good job. No one will tell my grandchildren, but very fair because it is a BBC docu simulation.
