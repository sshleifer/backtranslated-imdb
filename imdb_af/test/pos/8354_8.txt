Another great animation from Disney. Sequels are not always so large and tend to follow the same plot as the original. However, Tramp's son is trying to enjoy the home and family of the world, and he knows and learns where he actually belongs. Being a junkyard dog is not for everyone, there is a dog, but Scamp overcomes adversity. The voices of the various characters were excellent and provided by several well-known actors such as Scott Wolf, Alyssa Milano and Mickey Rooney. Entertainment and a well-made family movie.
