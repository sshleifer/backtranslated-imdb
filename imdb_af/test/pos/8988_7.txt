Young Warriors (1983) <br /> <br /> While being a deeply flawed (and somehow idiotic) movie, the way it continually ignores expectations is a decent look for the adventurous sleaze fan. <br /> <br /> Meet yuppie college student Kevin and his gang of lovely frat boy friends. In what starts out as a particularly strange teen sex comedy, we follow this bunch of jerk offs and their antics, which relate, among other things, to making promising bricks on their genitals. Suddenly the movie moves to gears when Kevin's high school sister is brutally raped and hit in a coma by a gang of bikers who seem to have nothing better to do. When she dies in hospital, Kevin promises revenge, much to the chagrin of his detective. <br /> <br /> So far, Porky's-lite, through Last House On The Left territory, has gone to what is apparently making your typical urban vigilante revenge. However, Kevin and his gang's portrayal goes out vaguely sympathetically until they become deadly lunatics. It is for the film's credit that it does not emphasize the fascist anti-crime rhetoric that Kevin constantly emits while still understandable that he will feel the way he does. <br /> <br /> The mood goes from light hearts to Grim and downbeat very quickly, and in the end it's so top and extreme that it will leave you incredible. And this is the power of this movie. You never know what to expect. <br /> <br /> For more than 100 minutes this kind of food is a bit long, but you won't get bored. Poorly performing for the most part, with cardboard cuttings for characters and some particularly difficult situations and rather stupid dialogue, will soon leave anyone's list of forgotten classic players. However, I have a kick out of it, and I'm sure someone reading it knows if it's for it.
