ROCK STAR is a well-known Hollywood version of the story based on the fact of how Ripper Rob became Halford's replacement for Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg poured on his beloved son-ish charm and performed with credible admiration, something he has revealed since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS. <br /> <br /> Stephen Herek, no stranger to musical-themed movies, is hearing the wonders of the breakthrough lifestyle of an extinct species, Hair-Metal Rock God. Wahlberg's "Izzy" acts as the movie's host playing the allman who gets to see his wish come true. His beloved character quickly wins the heart of the viewer, who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him a signature of the metal horn several times. <br /> <br /> The only true complaint with the story is that the supporting role, namely the other members of the group, is not properly spread or even imported. More interaction with these lifelong rock musicians would strengthen and strengthen Izzy's new environment. <br /> <br /> Of course, ROCK STAR is full of great music. Rabin's score, the original work of the Steel Dragon and numerous 80-year-old Metal hits, make this soundtrack a must-have! Let's hope that movies like Rock Star not only give credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation, but also create an essential revival.
