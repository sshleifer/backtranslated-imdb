On June 22, 1941, the city of Przemysl, Poland, was divided between German and Russian. When the German enters the city, the Nazis send the Jews to a ghetto. The young Catholic Fusia Podgorska (Kellie Martin), alone with her young sister, has put many Jews in the attic of her house for two and a half years until the end of the war. "Hide in silence" is another good story of human sympathy in World War II. This movie resembles "Rescuers: Stories of Courage", and is also based on a true story. Unfortunately, actress Kellie Martin exerts a strong and powerful main character, but she is very poor for such a role. In many dramatic situations, the expression of her face is not convincing. I noticed that many IMDb users like her performance, but I don't know if they really like her wonderful character or her performance. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ocultos no Medo" ("Hide in fear")
