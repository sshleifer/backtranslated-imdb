Hilary was wonderful like Julie, and Pat was wonderful again. Miyagi, but there had to be more references to the other three movies! I mean, come on! First, where is Daniel? Miyagi makes a very brief mention of him and that's it. Daniel was his best friend and had at least made an appearance in the movie. He could have helped Miyagi train Julie-San! On the other hand, the music remains true to the movie, but with a little more instrumentation (Fretless Bass) to accompany the wonderfully played Pan Flute! It doesn't feel like a Karate Kid movie unless you hear that Pan Flute! Thanks Zamfir! Overall, a decent movie though! We miss you Noriyuki!
