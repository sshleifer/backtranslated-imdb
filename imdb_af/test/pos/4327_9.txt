What is the point of these messages if you don't have to discuss and discuss thoughts over the next season? Here's my prediction: 1. The hatch is indeed blown, but somehow everyone has survived. Buts can see it. 2. The episode at the end of the tent is an observation team that monitors the detection device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island has been lifted, the signal is picked up by the observation station and they are sending a rescue mission. 3. After the destruction of the hatch, the island is no longer isolated and other ships / aircraft will arrive. 4. The others will eventually share their secret with our poor observers. <br /> <br /> Was it actually confirming that there will be 4 seasons lost? <br /> <br /> Cheers Mike
