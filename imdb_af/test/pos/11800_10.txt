Such an amazing movie - I have been transferring all the time and finally getting emotionally over! The two young male actors in the film were more than compelling in their performance as their friendship and support from each other was reasonably credible and I thought the comparison / contrast between their respective households against health situations was so much made between them. Of course, the success of bringing this movie to life was a team effort, so to actors, EP's, producers, writers, directors and all the production I say, "WELL PLAYED!" After I missed the credits at the beginning of the movie (it was shown on HBO), I was so surprised that I actually had to investigate the internet (though briefly) to find the title of this movie - something that was so good to me - a clear indication that this movie should be released again!
