I rented this movie because it was a documentary and highly rated. It is more a study of a bastard boy who is trying to find out who his biological father was than anything about architecture. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, the underlying theme of the movie is that we are an eccentric, highly-acclaimed, possibly genius architect who takes little or nothing into consideration if someone is outside. <br /> <br /> The tragedy of the movie is the broken families he left. His baby mothers received more than weakened fans than irresponsible women, who can only have negative results on the children. <br /> <br /> It said Louis Khan's film and son producer, Nathaniel, is over quite stable and curious, if not bitter. The people he questioned were, of course, more interested in talking about Louis Khan's buildings than his personal problems, but I find the mix of themes made the movie interesting. <br /> <br /> As far as its buildings are concerned, I have appreciated them as an abstract art - strange, non-practical, and usually only by so-called critics.
