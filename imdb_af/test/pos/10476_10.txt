This film says everything about religion. I wish it was necessary to look for all bigots and wills. <br /> <br /> The story of the Danish Danish towns is about two very religious sisters whose late father was a stiff priest who discouraged all their dreams of love and the world and she explored a lot of beauty. They are now old and spending their lives and beauty. Their quiet new help - which they learn to cook - is Babette (played by beautiful Stephane Audran who has so much blessed her husband Claude Chabrol's films). Life in the village is simple and the sharp direction reflects it. <br /> <br /> When she wins the lottery, Babette requests the opportunity to prepare a feast - a true love of love. The course of the festival and its main guests reveal messages of love and spirituality and how there are many ways to love God and life. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for the dedication Babette is preparing for the festival and for the speech that the General is giving. Perhaps the best international film of the 1980s.
