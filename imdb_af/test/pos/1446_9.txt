Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict returning to his Chicago area after an extensive visit to a clinic. He plans to stay off the drug and work as a drummer, but he can't avoid running into his old friends. He was originally arrested for no drug-related charge, but because he was caught in an illegal poker game. His skill at poker earned him the nickname of The Man at the Golden Arm, and the men who run the match, one of them is his former heroin compound, want to deal with him again. Meanwhile, Frank has to take care of a woman he injured in a car accident, Zosch (Eleanor Parker), and with his old friend, Molly (Kim Novak). The movie is great to put us in Sinatra's spiritual state. When he felt sure of himself at the beginning of the film, I felt good to him. But when a promised call doesn't come one day, he falls into depression and goes back to the blow. Later, when he finally comes to audition, he comes out completely. His embarrassment when he can't play the right mate is devastating. He had such big dreams, and the other musicians didn't even pay him any attention because he jumped out of the room. The film is moving fast and it shows Frank's drug problem in a realistic light without making a social message photo. Those actors are uniformly good. Elmer Bernstein's score is one of the best of his time. The only thing I don't like about the movie is the end. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although I really like the character of Zosch and Parker, it's great in the movie. could have done a little more to fill in her back story. The end is a bit to complain about. Although there are certainly pathos that will stay with the characters after the movie is closed, Zosch's death closes all the loose points a little too neatly. Frank is free to love Molly and will not go to jail. His dealer is also dead, so at least the immediate threat is gone. Well, I think in Hollywood there is always a desire to put everything in a neat little package. It does harm the movie a bit, but as it stands, it's still one of the best and most mature movies about drug addiction I can think of. 9/10.
