This movie is not your typical Hollywood prize, though the stickers are so bad, I tend to stay away from movies rather than be disappointed. However, this small low-budget jewel is thoroughly loving and pleasant and definitely a custodian. The actors are as varied as the characters they portray, the Buffalo area is charming (which is a beautiful city), and the story flashes. The lack of free violence, sex and the "f" word doesn't diminish the least! Take the kids, take grandma, take a break from Hollywood! I give it a 11 out of 10!
