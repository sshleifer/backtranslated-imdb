Occupational criminals and crime boss, Abel Davos (Lino Ventura) has been hiding for over 10 years, in Milan, Italy. In his absence, he was sentenced to death in his country from France for his crimes. Disillusioned with his life in Italy, and with the police there, he decides to return to his old blunt ground in Paris. He sends his wife Therese and two young boys before Nice, Abel and his next in charge, Raymond Naldi, a final call to fund their new lives in France. The heist proffs a slim half million francs, way less than their sources suggested, despite this and with police in custody they both make it to Nice, where they briefly hide. After stealing a pleasure boat from a local village, they aim to make it a tourist spot for San Remo where they will mix easier, but they are stopped by armed customs officers on a deserted beach, a shootout come out and Therese and Naldi are both killed. A now-injured Davos with two kids in the trailer will easily be spotted by the police, and he calls his old friends in Paris to send help, but they continued because their old friend hid and was not too inclined to take not a risk itself, so they send small times, Eric Stark (Jean Paul Belmondo) to save him. Davos is disgusting that such a low thief is sent to his aid, despite the fact that he immediately comes down to the beautiful Stark, he goes out to find out why he has been killed, but their betrayal does not stop there. /> <br /> Classe Tous Risques (also known as the Great Risk) was written by ex-prisoner and crime writer Jose Giovanni (Le Trou, Le Clan des Siciliens), with Ventura already on board for the project, Giovanniwanted someone unique is to guide the project, Ventura suggested an assistant director who announced on a previous project, one Claude Sautet, which Georges Franju was at Les Yeux sans Visage. Sautet immediately agreed and the rest, as they say, is history. Sautet produces a fine gangster movie, which plays a lot on characters and relationships. Davos is constantly hiding enough time to reflect on his life, past, present and future, his friendships that no longer seem to believe they were, his now deceased wife and his two young boys. Ventura as a character actor has always surprised me, both comfortable and convincing in both the police and the criminal fraternity. Here, his world's weary performance is sublime and powerful as his world crumbles as the loneliness and loneliness of a man on the run kicks in. Ventura's former profession as a pro wrestler is widely used when he throws Parisian hoodlums with complete ease. Belmondo and Stark entertain the other storyline in the film, that of his emerging relationship with a girl he meets on the road trip. With his sincere charm, his arrival is clear to this woman in danger of being a "Fuller" and that the only good thing about me is my remaining, as he knocks out her aggressor is also a joy to watch . fall for him anyway. Belmondo's performance was overlooked at the time. Godard's A bout de Souffle was released only three weeks earlier. Godard got the credit to discover the new kid on the block, his versatility within these two films, which everyone sees and admires. Sautet's film is a pleasant affair, with many attractive places, the film also has a very sparse dialogue. Sautet prefers the actors to do the job with the mare of look or look to improve the story, needles to say this Noir fan See more of Sautet's work in the future.
