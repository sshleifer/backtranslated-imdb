I have read many different opinions and reviews of this movie, and I understand why many people get mixed feelings about Ponyo, whether it's the story line, animation, dialogue and so on. And I believe the simplest way I can answer is that it is a movie for a very, very younger age bracket. An old age, much younger than that of Tonarino Totoro. <br /> <br /> As a Miyazaki fan like the majority of surfers on this site, I expected the wonderful animation, music composition, complex story telling, the great steady development of characters, how the story goes on today society, etc. etc. etc. related to a typical Miyazaki movie we grew up with. And to tell the truth, I didn't understand how hell this story was supposed to go on or what the hell was going on up to an hour and twenty minutes (with twenty minutes in the movie) that this movie was not for the deep thinkers and hard core Ghibli ore, but for the toddlers and young people. And fortunately, happy Japanese people go. I also believe this movie is based on simplicity and creative animation; upright grass roots Ghibli Studios style. <br /> <br /> The fact that a villain is not present really surprised me, except the dad and maybe that crazy ass typhoon. But otherwise, this movie is just fun; stimulate a young person's mind and make happy good time feel. That's all. <br /> <br /> The animation goes back to the old-school mid-80s early 90's of Miyazaki's films, where very specific details were not a major focus, unlike Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) and the latter. I admire the simplicity that created a little nostalgia when I first watched Ghibli movies like Tonarino Totoro when I was a child. The reaction and movement of the children are all very similar to those of children, and many Studio Ghibli's body language is very striking. Studio Ghibli has added some creative moments and scenery that they can only do with his wonderful animators, but it will probably not take the ghibli-ist ritual into awe. <br /> <br /> The Japanese dialogue also sounds very child-friendly and many scenes and dialogues are very, very relative to what Japanese children and mothers would say and act. The music as very hopeful and "fluffy", I think you can say from start to finish (similar to Totoro). Even the darker plays didn't look self-assured. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is one of a kind. Almost every aspect of this movie is for kids. And I waited a whole 80 minutes to realize it. Honestly, I've never seen a movie or show it like Miyazaki did. It is refreshing to see Studio Ghibli still be able to tell a story for a wider, very different scale of audience, and still hold the Ghibli brand.
