Although I am not a golf fan, I attended a sneak preview of this movie and absolutely loved it. The historic institutions, the blatant class investigations and the good and the bad on both sides of the dividing line kept my attention throughout. The actors and their characteristics were all enchanting. And I was on the edge of my seat during the golf segments, which were not only dramatic and exciting, but easy to follow. By the end of this movie, "Seabiscuit" has come to mind, though "The Greatest Game Ever Played" is much less complex than a story. In both cases, the fact that the events really happened, deepens my interest.
