OK, Anatomy is not a rediscovery of the Horrormovie genre, yet it is well done. Good actors (Potent and FÃ¼hrmann first) and some good ideas made me happy. Maybe I would not have been so positive if it wasn't a German movie, but caring. It is good to see familiar faces in a good, exciting story, with a few gore and some good jokes in it. All of you are complaining about dubbing: I haven't seen a print version (of course), but I don't think it's easy to watch doped movies. We (Germans) are used to watching movies, so it's not a big problem. But try to look in German with subtitles. The actors are really good!
