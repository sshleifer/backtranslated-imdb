As a 90-year-old child, I really enjoyed this show and I can proudly say I enjoyed it and even more than the classic WB cartoons. <br /> <br /> I don't know why; early 90's cartoons had something special; I don't know if it's the uncertainty atmosphere, a generation change, whatever. But "Tiny Toons" retained the 90's and delivered one of the most popular, funniest and underlined cartoons ever created. <br /> <br /> The memories are dark but I can only say that I enjoyed every episode and product. related to the show. Easy, no other cartoon made me laugh softly (before I was oriented to teenagers in the dark sitcoms). <br /> <br /> The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true main character. Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.
