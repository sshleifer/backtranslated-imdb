The plot of "Sally of the Sawdust" is the usual melodramatic stuff - an orphan, rags-to-wealth - but the movie rises above most silence thanks to three people: <br /> <br /> That's not, of course , DW Griffith's masterpiece, but it shows his filmmaking in full maturity. He uses all his innovations, which are techniques that we now take for granted: close-ups, cross-magnification, a mobile camera and the ability to act from theatrical exaggeration to cinematic subtlety. <br /> <br /> W. C. Fields also shows his skills - not his signature gruff delivery, but his remarkable skill as a physical comedian. He does some inventive juggling acts, cuts short to be fully appreciated, and some very fine pickpocketing, but every stride that comes in reach seems to be manipulated for comic effect: hat, reed, car roof , dog, cash. He is a joy to see. <br /> <br /> Finally there is Carol Dempster. Much has been said against this actress, but her performance here is also richly comical. She was then 22, a teenager, and her approach to the role is a combination of grace and discomfort that is not entirely convincing, but she really gets in the eye when she is on the screen - especially when she is dancing. She is not a beauty - although she is positively lying in one scene where she is being refurbished like a Talmadge sister - but her lips just add to Sally's character, especially in the many moments when she has a clear love shows Fields as her guardian / "father." Few, if any, Hollywood artists can compete with Fields when it comes to comedy, but Griffith gives his top lady every opportunity to match her co-star, and Dempster holds her own.
