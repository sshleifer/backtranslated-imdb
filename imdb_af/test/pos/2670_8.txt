This brief topic collected kudos of all kinds for his plea for religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> After a session at a recording studio, Frank Sinatra leaves and comes across a group of children knocking at another because he was Jewish. He read them because only an American icon could know about the meaning of prejudice and what we just fought against the Nazis. The meaning cannot be clearer. <br /> <br /> Both songs from this short box are recorded and sold great for Columbia records. If you're just a dream and the song written for the movie, The House I Live In. The latter is one of the best songs about an idealized version of America, after which we all want to strive. <br /> <br /> Sinatra recorded a collaborative album for the Home I played in the home of the sixties. did his Reprise record label. The album is now a rarity and it shouldn't be. His co-workers were Bing Crosby and Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians with the orchestra performed by Nelson Riddle. <br /> <br /> Axel Stordahl was Sinatra's primary music conductor and organizer during the forties. When he died, this position eventually fell on Nelson Riddle. Stordahl does the orchestra for the short and the Columbia record, Riddle for the Reprise record. <br /> <br /> Sinatra aficionados and others must listen back and forth. And capture this valuable movie when it is shown.
