Iron Eagle may not be the most credible movie, but the characters are well written and performed very well. If you can't believe the characters, the flop is a flop. <br /> <br /> I believe photography, especially aerial photography, is wonderful. I believe it is much better than Top Gun, which it compares endlessly. This is one of the best pieces of aerial photography I've seen. The soundtrack by Basil Paledouros (forgive the spelling) is wonderful, and fits well with the rockstyle. I wish that part of the soundtrack was available. <br /> <br /> Jason Gedrick does well as a teenager who suddenly needs to grow in speed and the realities of life, death and responsibilities. Lou Gossett is fantastic as Chappy, both hardbits and yet human, because he reminds of flying deaths. <br /> <br /> There are many movies out there that you can watch once and don't mind watching again. Then there are those movies that get you some aspect and you can watch it again and again! Iron Eagle is that kind of movie!
