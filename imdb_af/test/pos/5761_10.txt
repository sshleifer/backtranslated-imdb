This movie has some very funny moments. The aforementioned feeb sketch for starters. <br /> <br /> The parts where Rik tries to treat his guests dearly look through them. Very subtle, especially since the guest was a slipper. <br /> <br /> The scene where Rik finds out that Gina has a fiance, "Ahhh. She tied me all the time, the buyer." with his 2 candle eyes. As if she really loved him. But he believed it. That's why it was so funny. Great moment. <br /> <br /> Gino was also excellent. He had to be used more than the bad man. "Where are the whores I ordered!" he blows. Brilliant things.
