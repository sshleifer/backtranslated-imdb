I waited for the ages to comment on this program and felt it was time to do justice to it. It is one of Christie's darker, more sinister and engaging works, and not just someone who is being murdered for money, it is a dark and thoroughly engaging story of mystery, plot, love and murder, all made better by the changes that the adapter fitted. The level of acting is absolutely great, Joan Hickson is sublime in the part, as always! The rest of the movie, like Liz Fraser, Anna Cropper and Helen Cherry, all play beautifully, but it is my opinion that the performance by Margaret Tyzack is stolen. The closing tone between her and Joan Hickson is just magical, the acting is as good as it gets, cool, moving and completely brilliant. <br /> <br /> Please let me know if you agree with my words. I'm really looking forward to the remake to see how good Geraldine McEwan's version is. Watch and enjoy.
