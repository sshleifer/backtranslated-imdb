There is only one racist joke in this Daffy Duck card, which, when Daffy Black Beauty drives, is a black woman. I can partly understand why this joke was included because at that time few people knew how rude it was to be racist and it was not even illegal to discriminate against black people. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, "A Coy Decoy" is basically a fun, interesting short where Daffy meets characters in books and does things in books. I like this short lot (despite the other reviewers here). The way in which Daffy fell in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing, yet very amusing at the same time. Porky is a good edition of the episode, but it wasn't necessary to be there. The wolf is an example of how people in those days also thought of wolves, bloodthirsty, terrible animals, which of course were never really (unless they were very hungry). I also liked the style of animation used - and the theme of the episode. <br /> <br /> For people who are totally in Daffy Duck and for people who don't use the opportunity of joking in cartoons, enjoy "A Coy Dekoy"! <br /> <br /> Available on YouTube.
