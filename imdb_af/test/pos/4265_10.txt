Sometimes the mainstream news media seems to be driven by a bunch of no brain reporters. They just listen to each other and report what others are reporting. <br /> <br /> This documentary document shows what can be found if more effort is made to report something. <br /> <br /> True journalism is about providing people with different perspectives on things that happen to have a fair chance to create their own opinion. <br /> <br /> This documentary document, along with mainstream media reports, will help you with this. At least for me it provided very relevant information on the purpose / motivation behind the current global protests at various political summits.
