The Child's Play series is not a favorite of mine, but Bride Of Chucky is actually a great movie. This time we had two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together, they travel to find an object. There are some interesting scenes by the movie like the man hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the end that makes it possible for another successor. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a kind of spoof of the horror genre. This made the movie better like comedy with lots of horror movies. All in all, if you're not a Child's Play fan, give this one a spin.
