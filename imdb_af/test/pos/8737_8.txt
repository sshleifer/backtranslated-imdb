Walter Matthau is wonderful as the "philandering" dentist dr. Julian Winston, whose regular fibs for friend Goldie handbook prove the dangers of lies. Goldie Hawn's touch Toni Simmons definitely earns her Oscar. Ingrid Bergman's work as the stiff-as-star nurse Stephanie also gets to look while she's slowly and nervously coming out of her shell. It's a good movie to watch in the spring, or anytime for that matter. It is much understated; I never heard of it until I found it in the video store and what a find!
