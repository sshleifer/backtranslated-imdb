Again, I am surprised that Thomas Gibson did not come to work earlier in his career. In this film, Gibson again shows his ability to understand a character, regardless of sexuality, social status or nationality. Gibson plays a very convincing gay man of the late 20th century. Tender not yet averse, afraid of the basics of love, Gibson's character touches a variety of emotions. Also worthy of praise is Cameron Bancroft's performance. His need to be the heterosexual conqueror, unlike his best friend's "homosexual conquests", provides dynamism for the relationship that is unexpected in many ways. Bancroft and Gibson's chemistry is evident from the first scene in which they appear together. There are many "panels" in this quilt. From gay relationships to straight relationships; from heterosexual relationships to exploring lesbian love; this film travels across the broad spectrum of sexuality while the story of a serial killer is at its core. My only regret is that it took six years since its release before discovering this movie! I look forward to seeing it again and recommending it to any fan of Bancroft, Gibson or Director Denys Arcand.
