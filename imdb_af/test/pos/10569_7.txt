Historical drama is one of the areas where the British cannot be beaten. So while I'm not a big fan of the genre, I can usually be persuaded to see something, if it's British and decent actors. <br /> <br /> I've never read anything from Sarah Waters, which is something I should of course do. That's why I didn't really know what to expect from this. I heard there would be a lesbian love story, but not much more. Looking at it, I found it to be much more interesting than I expected. Without saying too much, the twists of the plot are unexpectedly made as well. Although there was almost a twist, it took me a moment to get everything straight. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are good, the actors are very solid and the pace is decent, although I found it a bit slow in the last half hour. It may just be me, but I usually have a problem with movies that drag after the plot is more or less completed. All in all, it's a pretty pleasant three hours. I recommend it to anyone interested in historical plays.
