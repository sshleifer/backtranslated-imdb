'Oppenheimer' with Sam Waterston in the title role and with David Suchet as Evard Teller is an example of the docudrama at its best. Well written, well acted by actors who have a credible deal with their historical characters, highly informative and very entertaining. The set of designs and costumes captures the US feeling during World War II. The plot and dialogue made the viewer feel like he was really present in Los Alamos and caught up in the excitement of the Manhattan project. The only downside is that it is a British production, and some of the actors do not have the ability to influence a convincing American accent. (The skill of contemporary Australian and Irish actors who adopt non-native dialects is incredible.) The storyline is fully in line with Richard Rhodes' definite history of atomic bomb development. Unfortunately, the mini-series was shown only a few times at PBS at the beginning of the 1980s and apparently disappeared into oblivion. <br /> <br /> 'Oppenheimer' compares favorably to the more recent 'Fat Man & Little' Boy's feature film with Paul Newman as well as Leslie Groves (the chronically overweight and rather homely general will be flattered) and Dwight Schultz (alumnus from TV's A-team) as Oppenheimer. As a mini-series, 'Oppenheimer' is about 4x as long as the Newman feature, but uses the entire additional time to its full advantage.
