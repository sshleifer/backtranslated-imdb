This is one of those movies that the critics really missed. This movie is virtually McHale's fleet for the 90's or Sea Police Academy. Grammer proves that he can play other roles than Frasier, as he overwhelms and leaves the fleet to get his own sub. Rob Schneider is as worm as usual, the same in every role he plays, and Lauren Holly is the local sex pot, though with a brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line catching up. The movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non-predictable writing that always surprise me every time I see it. Much of the fleet's phrases and terms go over my head, but it is a small stumbling block to the sheer accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters.
