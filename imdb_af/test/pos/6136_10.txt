I searched this mini series for a long time. I saw this movie when I was back in Russia many years ago. I'm curious if someone who has the recorded copy of this movie can send me the copy. I am willing to cover all the expenses and pay for the extra tires or DVDs. This is one of the best TV shows I've ever watched. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Israel's history and world history after World War II. I also try to find a book (I heard that it is even better than the movie), but the new one costs about $ 50 per Amazon and I have never bought a used copy. My e-mail address is yurets777@hotmail.com Thank you for your help.
