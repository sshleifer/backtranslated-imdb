Little would argue that master animation director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few to retain this ability. <br /> <br /> (Too much has been focused on John Lassiter's "incredible" ability to steal other movie plots, nice puppet show and then be reckoned as a genius ... but I'm pulling out.) Miyazaki has given our movie to movie dealing with major adult issues (usually ecological themes) and has an intelligent script that even the most calved viewer who would normally despise any animated movie, can thoroughly enjoy when given the opportunity. Yet, Miyazaki never forgets what will undoubtedly be in the hearing of these movie children. <br /> <br /> It is said, I have a loss to think of another movie maker with this ability. Where else will you have a movie where a three-year-old (my cousin Link) will remain silent, a 7-year-old (my cousin Amber), who loves everything of her own (and the star power) of Frankie Jonas and Noag Cyrus , a 12-year-old (my nephew Aaron) whose review was "of course, it was good! Everything Miyazaki-san does is good!", a 32-year-old animation fan by the powerful director and beautiful animation ( and it will be me) and a 58-year-old woman (my mother) can be connected to the mother characters (and I also bet the older charas) and love the "crap" of the child characters. <br /> <br /> And this is what I respect most about Miyazaki-san, he seems to be speaking in a completely different way to his average filmmaker, and on the surface "Ponyo" can be seen as a simple story about a little fish girl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to connect with it and the friend she makes there a little boy, so (somewhat like "The Little Mermaid"), but here is a very different level. azaki is true to form, its film with strong female characters. Ponyo's Mother, Soske's mother, the older ladies in a nursing home are all true characters with their own and extremely strong will. <br /> <br /> But the girl who takes the cake is Ponyo herself. As soon as she decides that she loves the human world, she uses her own will to reach her dreams. Her father tries to keep her innocent, and keeps her a magical fish, but young Ponyo knows what she wants and just gets out of her own determination. <br /> <br /> Once, she boasts with her friend, Soske, who loves her a lot (though perhaps not as much as ham). Soske is asked to be the man of the house (at the age of five) when his mother, Lisa, decides to help the rest of the house where she works during a typhoon accidentally caused by Ponyo on her. search for man. Frankie Jonas (yes, he is related to the Jonas brothers. Can we just be over?) Maybe give the best performance in the movie as young Soske (which is good as he has the most lines). His character is also strong will, but also a lot of respect and kindness that you probably won't find in a child's character on this side of the Pacific. <br /> <br /> In the end, Ponyo's father, Fujimoto, has to deal with his daughter's decision and his alienations are the woman's desire to allow her to be human. He hopes Ponyo and Soske will remember him with love. "And again, Miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical" bad man. "Although Miyazaki (for some reason) has been criticized for this, it is honest, which makes his movies magical and yet tolerant. in real life is quite a bad person. "All people are different shades of gray. And that's exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. <br /> <br /> And then there's the animation itself. a time when CGI could certainly be helped with the large amounts of effect shots in this movie, especially the water, Miyazaki chose NOT to include any CGI whatsoever, but the hand-drawn animation was colored by digital means, but every movie in this was handwritten and I was very grateful for that, the character animation was extremely fluid, and there was even some lip sync in progress (rather unusual for an anime movie). had an effect on his audience . That's how the animation looks and what it looks like. <br /> <br /> In the end, I found Ponyo to be very pleasant. Certainly not Miyazaki's best (in my opinion the honor is still held by Kiki's Delivery Service), but still a 10-star movie for the whole family.
