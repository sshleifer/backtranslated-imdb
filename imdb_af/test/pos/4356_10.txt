What attracts a man to military service? What is preparing a man to survive brutal torture as a prisoner of war? What despair leads to the planning and execution of an escape into the jungles of Southeast Asia? How does he handle the ghosts and memories he goes back home? Herzog tries to answer these questions in his documentary document by Dieter Dengler, German emigrants and the US naval pilot who was defeated over Laos in 1966. He was imprisoned, tortured and starved, but eventually escaped to haunt the experience for the rest of his life. . A powerful and personal first-hand account of the man, his life and experience is told by the apparent integration of interviews, archival material and new footage. You will never forget this story - or this man.
