No, it's not an Ed Wood movie. "Angora Love" is Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's last silent movie. The end of an era! In the '20s, Laurel & Hardy has left a true mark on the silent movie genre with films that are still popular and regularly watched and broadcast. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not among their best. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie sounds good and is good. This time, the boys are playing with a goat, which of course leads them to trouble and gives us some hilarious situations to watch. However, it is at the same time extremely stupid and just totally amazing to watch the boys make comedy stuff with a goat. Most of the jokes in the movie still work well, but the movie never gets completely hilarious or memorable. The comedy and story really feel lacking and are mostly too simple and predictable. <br /> <br /> Of course still good and fun enough to watch for fans, but still a slightly disappointing last quiet Laurel & Hardy entry. <br /> <br /> 7/10
