People who compare this movie to big block busters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it is lacking in the large special effects section and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is another masterful merger of two old folks here. The acting talent, though not A-list, is still great and the interaction between characters may be more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My particular favorite of this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen moved herself well, largely assisted by a wonderful wardrobe and makeup. She injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season, which was damaged by the devil's evil magic. Fonda aside from the acting was not what we expected from Hollywood. I think it's a good thing, as Hollywood has roles in how to play his plays, so they became obsolete and dependent on CGI and other special effects to take us away from the actors who all the same tricks on our use. Instead, new ideas show some real thinking about the role of the actors on how to find new variations on the old themes of love and danger.
