Now that I've seen it, it wasn't what I expected, at least not to the end. I read some of the other reviews before uploading a used copy of this from Amazon and was glad I did. When I first introduced Park's work via Oldboy, I was curious how he would handle the genre and was quite satisfied with the clever way he did it. I think Park has declined in terms of presentation, because while Oldboy and some of his other work have very nice and deliberate camera work, he has some good innovations in Bakjwi that I haven't seen in other vamp films. For example, the scene where Father Hyeon realizes that the "animal" grows inside him when he gives his shoes to the always barefoot Tae-ju and he can see that the blood is pumped through Tae-ju's skin and that his eye is in bloodlust is widened. For that. It was a good effect. I was also pleased that Park was not CG the shit from the movie and it is actually very little CG. I got away from Bakjwi who was completely set to think that one thing would happen and be taken for a ride in true Park fashion. In addition, I liked the fact that the Park played a bit of symbolism and reversal, while we usually didn't get this Asia cinema. At the start of the movie, we see that the plot is developing slowly and getting to know the characters and you feel like an invisible observer to the thing that transpires. Park treats you a bit like Ghost or Christmas future to show you, even if it's a bit annoying, how life is outside your world. Oh, but then we start to feel a little relationship with the Father and his budding desire for Tae-Ju and contrary to service as a priest. We almost start rooting for them, even to Park not so beautifully dropping us into reality and we really see that Bakjwi is finally a film about moral dilemma, right and wrong. It won't spoil it if I tell you to watch Bakjwi out of the mind of a priest and I think you will get away with what Park wants you to get away with. Don't expect Oldboy and styling, because that's not what you get here. Indeed, a very interesting take on the genre. Those who missed the many literary elements and religious conversations looked at another movie, not Bakjwi. After Bakjwi, look at the right one, which is not what you would expect either.
