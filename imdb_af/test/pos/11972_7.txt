I love dogs, and the most interesting character in this movie is a Golden Retriever. He is smarter, looks better and more interesting than any of the human characters. Like many other contributors, I didn't read the book, but I doubt it would change my opinion of the movie. It is predictable from the first five minutes. No surprises. Mad scientists create a monster that gets loose and a teenage boy and his wonder dog work together to destroy it. All in all, the movie is a dog. But as I said, I love dogs and will give this movie a 7/10 score. See if it comes on TV, rent it if you're bored and nothing else gets your eye on it, but don't buy it if it's not special.
