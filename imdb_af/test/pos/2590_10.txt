Strangely, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is hilarious. Watch lots of peculiar humor. Dated and childish to show naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They knew that cartoons were not just for children. The art in this is probably the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950s Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to get anything better than the art in "The Great Piggy Bank Robbery", though nothing ever will. This probability ends in 3rd or 2nd. Shorts like this one may have been given an unashamed LT rip-offs such as Tiny Toons Adventures to try and express all the old comedy over and over, like how big movies like Scream bought as I know ... just released Express all the old horror from Scream, but like Scream, it's good alone. Chuck Jones had his mistakes with shorts, but he did well. Take Hopper for example. Few people like Hopper, but it never ruined the LT reputation, but I'm sure it's building up on things as such. Bottom line: It's not as good as "Duck! Rabbit! Duck!" But close. Catch it regularly on Cartoon Network.
