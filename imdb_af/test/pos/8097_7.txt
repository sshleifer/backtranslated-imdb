It must have been one of Chaplin's most ambitious projects; He throws in almost everything from visual gags and blackout comedy sketches to social relevance, romance, even some violence. The mix is ​​challenging and intriguing, and the film has many entertaining and clever sequences (such as the one Chaplin and four other guys try to avoid finding a coin that will order their self-sacrifice), but the ingredients don't always click together. and the mixture (and tone) looks kind of disharmonious. As far as the famous final speech is concerned, it is also a bit naive today, with a better world where man will overcome his hatred and brutality and fly his soul. Great perforances by Jack Oakie and the beautiful Paulette Goddard. (***)
