It was unusual: a contemporary movie that was cute. In fact, it was so nice that it was too difficult to believe in parts. While I saw this focused story, I thought, "No one is so nice, this tolerant." Mainly, I referred to Ed Harris's role as "Coach Jones." I think they've gone a little overboard about his character, but it's better than the reverse: show him worse than he was in real life. Strange to see that Harris also plays the role, as he has a long resumption of playing nasty, ominous characters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I never complain about a nice, good movie, and it's nice to see a lot of well-meaning, friendly people. These people direct their friendship, love and compassion to "James Kennedy," better known as "Radio", a spiritually slow high school child played by Cuba Gooding Jr. The story takes place in the mid-1970s in South Carolina. Gooding also does a good job with the role. But, like Sean Penn's role of a mentally challenged man in "I Am Sam," an hour and a half is a character like this. After that, the hardness of the guys becomes annoying to hear. Note: It was interesting to find in one of the documentaries on this DVD that it took years for "Radio" to make his transformation, not months as shown in the film.
