DO NOT HAVE A DUCKLING TORTURE is one of Fulci's earlier (and fairest, in terms of story line, better ...) movies - and although not the typical "massacre" for which Fulci is known, it's still a very unique and enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds a small town where a range of child murders occur. Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations, either as suspects or who help investigate (or in some cases both) include the police force of the cities, a small time reporter, a beautiful and rich former drug addict, a young priest and his mother, an old man using witchcraft and his female protégé, a mentally handicapped village man and a deaf / dumb girl. All these people are intertwined in the plot to create multiple twists and turns until the actual killer is revealed. <br /> <br /> DO NOT TORTURE A DUCKLING BE A "classic" giallo or a typical Fulci gore movie. Although it contains both elements - it is more of an old-fashioned murder mystery, with a darker subject and some scenes of graphic violence (though nothing as nearly as strong as some of Fulci's work). It's a well-written movie with lots of twists that makes me guess to the end. Recommended for giallo / murder mystery fans, or anyone who wants to watch some of Fulci's non-splatter movies - but don't lose heart. Don't torture even more than it is an honest part of violence and slipping. Some may be turned off by the subject of child murders, and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting many young boys, who are also a bit disturbing - but if that type of material doesn't bother you, definitely give up this one a look. 8.5 / 10
