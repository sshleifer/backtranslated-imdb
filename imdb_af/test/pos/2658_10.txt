I am always amazed, since the well-known title track of 2001 is also called 'Zarathustra', that no one (no one I have already read) also saw the parallels between the film and Nietzsche's famous work, "Speak Zarathustra",. The idea of ​​man's rebirth in a stronghold; an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of N.'s "Zarathustra"; There is a prominent section called: "How a camel becomes a lion, and a lion becomes a child", in which N. describes the first incarnation of the grandmother as a child, both of which are the acetic, altruistic side of man (the camel, always asking for more weight) and the rapacious, brutish, will-to-power side of man (the lion). The fact that the song plays during the star-child series cannot be coincidental. And, too, Zarathustra said a man was tied a rope between the animals and the upper man. "The structure of the movie fits in with the description: a short history of man as an animal, until we really become man by mastering weapons and reasoning, then a long row over man (the rope, as it were ) and then a brief look at the old man. The insecurity of how these transformations occurred, and the suggestion that an external force caused them, is also Nietzschean; in "Zarathustra" he makes it clear that he has no idea how people will be able to tackle these changes themselves and suggest that we should depend on an outsider (Zarathustra) to show us how to "go under". Bowman's end-of-life psychic drive can be seen as Kubrick's best 1960s-style attempt to portray the mystical "underneath". <br /> <br /> I know these parallels are pretty broad and almost certainly have been noticed elsewhere despite the fact that I haven't seen it personally. But I just wanted to call them, than for no other reason than trying to drive the myth that Nietzsche was finally a somber philosopher. Few people find the end of 2001 gloomy, and in my opinion that is explicitly and undeniably Nietzschean. The case can certainly be made that 2001, especially a dramatization of "Zarathustra" has been updated for the modern era. Feel free to ignore the direct snob of my connection to Nietzsche.
