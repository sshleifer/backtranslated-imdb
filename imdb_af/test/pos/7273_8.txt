** HERE'S SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Review: Macleane (Miller) witnessed a plunder by Plunkett (Carlyle) who goes wrong. Plunkett's partner is shot (and killed), but not even after swallowing a large ruby. Plunkett and Macleane then meet at the cemetery when both try to get hold of the ruby. Unfortunately, they were caught as diggers and sent to jail, but not until Plunkett swallowed the ruby. The ruby ​​is their key to freedom, and once they are free, they form a partnership in robbery. Macleane is to set as a man and find out who is worth robbing, and then rob him (and rob them in style). But Macleane falls in love with the cousin / daughter (?) Of their first victim, Ms. Rebecca Gibson (Tyler). And a Mr. Chance (Stott) is catching them, and his methods are not very nice. <br /> <br /> Comment: A good action scented by comedy and adventure. Carlyle and Miller are a good team, with lots of friction and friendship. And then there's the relationship between Macleane and Rebecca Gibson. The scene with the ball is very good, especially the (anachronistic) use of the music. In addition to these interesting characters, Cumming plays the best of them all, Lord Rochester. Both the character and the acting are star and among the best in the movie. Overall, the film works very well, a good balance between story and special effects, action and comedy. Very entertaining. <br /> <br /> 8/10
