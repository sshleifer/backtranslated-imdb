There are a few scenes in this movie that seem a bit unrealistic. The surprising woman first panic and then, just a few minutes later, she started kissing the young boy while the old man was right next to her. But as the movie goes, we learn that she is a bit of a volatile girl (or slut) and that explains her behavior in part. The movie of this movie is well done. We get the lift from almost every angle and perspective, and some of the images and scenes really increase the tension. GÃ¶tz George plays his character well, a wannabe hot-shot gets old and is overwhelmed by young men like the Jaennicke character. Wolfgang Kieling, who I admired in Hitchcock's THE TORN CURTAIN, is a great show that he is by far the best actor in this play, although he doesn't say much. One critic complained about how unrealistic the film was and that in a real case of distress nothing would really happen. But then again, how realistic are movies like Mission impossible or Phone Booth. Given the fact that we are talking about a movie here and that you are always dealing with some scenes that are unlikely to happen in real life, you can still enjoy this movie. It's much better than many things I see on German TV today and I think the style of vintage 80 added something to this movie.
