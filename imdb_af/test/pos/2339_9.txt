All emerging filmmakers need to see this movie - it's like a master class in digital film making in itself. Some of the screens seem to be shot at much higher production value than they really were. It is very encouraging that such a well-crafted piece can be made on a low budget. The acting is very good, and the characters are very interesting, especially those of the head boy (John Kielty), who has managed to experience a teenager who is having trouble while being really nice. His beautiful but fading mother was also very well portrayed, and the relationship between her and her boss was very interesting. It is a very strange, interesting piece and I will be looking for anything else made by the same team. The director is definitely one to look at.
