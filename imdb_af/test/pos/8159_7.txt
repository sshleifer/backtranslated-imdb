Opponents lure when Aaron and Christian meet, and sparks start flying. <br /> <br /> "With two stars performances of Sandvoss and Ramsey, the film also features a tremendous supportive role, including Mary Kay Place, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and international screen legend Jacqueline Bisset, according to the DVD description of the sleeve.
