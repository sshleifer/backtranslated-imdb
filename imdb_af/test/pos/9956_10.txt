I have never seen anything of this lover's beloved, let alone a production by the Venice merchant. I can't comment on how faithful it is to make previous adjustments to the play, so I'll treat it as just another movie that tries more than Novocaine for the eye MoV is an instant movie about a young lover bassanio (fiennes) and his trading friend antonio (iron) and a jewish money lender shylock (pacino) <br /> <br /> plot summary <br /> <br /> Bassiano is broken and needs money for the beautiful portia (collins) waving, he goes to his friend antonio, who makes his footsteps with his friends, so money from shylock <br /> <br /> now antonio doesn't do like jewish in general and especially shylock and shylock bitter and bothered by the abuse he suffered from antonio in particular, and Christians generally agree to borrow antonio the money provided that iftonio does not repay the loan within the agreed deadline, shylock will cut a pound of antonis body meat < br /> <br /> comment <br /> <br /> the movie is amazingly beautiful and o acted and spoken in such a way that you force to think about what each line means, which in turn causes the viewer to gain insight into the characters and their motivation <br /> <br /> It seems to me that a movie is about the choices that shylock makes, and how to make wrong choices, leading to the damaging of shylocks <br /> <br /> the moment shylock demands its pound of meat, he is doomed because the rest of the world is against him and connects to cause his downfall. <br /> <br /> It disturbed me a lot, usually in a movie when a victim gets a chance to revenge against those who have harmed him or the victim or let the villain see the error of his ways that to a big hug leads <br /> <br /> not in case the victim is quickly seen as the villain is not happy and faith <br /> <br /> This movie is a powerful and subtle representation of chance anti-Semitism showing how a whole society is a minority and making it seem like the victim is really the offender <br /> <br /> I was blown away by this movie 10/10
