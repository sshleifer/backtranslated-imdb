I watched this movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2005. I went on the assumption that if it were Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank, it had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was very happy with the final product. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the Afrikaner and Xhosa (?) accented English of some of the actors, was difficult to understand, but like to see "Waking Ned Devine", "Trainspotting" or any another movie with heavy accent actors that I adjusted after about 15 minutes. And I tried to find out why Hilary Swank would be South African and sounded as though she wanted an accent, but sounded very American ... as if she had made a bad effort to put the emphasis. But later in the film, as more revealing about her character and how she moved to the US as a teenager, you begin to understand how she lost most or her accent. So it made sense that only certain words could have an Afrikaners for them. <br /> <br /> I know it's a little bad for one to use film as education, but one of the great things about this movie is that It was interesting to have a dramatization of truth and reconciliation to see trial. I heard about the T and R process in South Africa after the fall of apartheid, but I didn't really know how it worked. <br /> <br /> The final verdict is that although some of the screens felt a bit confronted, it was generally a very strong movie. The closing sequence where the truth comes out was the strong finish that every film hopes. A certain must see for everyone who cares about what happens outside their borders.
