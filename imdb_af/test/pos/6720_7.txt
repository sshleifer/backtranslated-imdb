Like several other reviewers here, I'm surprised to see many negative reviews on this movie. Dan O'Bannon's previous attempt was the groundbreaking 'Alien' of 1979. Because it and 'Star Wars' launched the stylistic approach of 'Used' or 'Dirty Space' in artistic style for these kinds of features, it doesn't mean that this was the only way to produce it. <br /> <br /> Instead of dismissing "Power of Life" as a kind of shock and primitive exploitation feature, it is important to admit that the film is the "valued" traditions of British horror and science fiction - specifically Hammer and American International features such as Quatermass (specifically Quatermass and the Pit, 1967), Doctor Who and "The Day of the Triffids" (1963), if not the works of Gerry Anderson ("UFO", "Space: 1999" and "Thunderbirds"). But none of these influences will be a surprise to other reviewers, the author O'Bannon's genre-scientific appreciation for 'Queen of Blood' (1966) and 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958) - the immediate source for 'Alien' (1979). <br /> <br /> Allowed this movie has some "legacy" elements, but maybe it's worth comparing this movie peers - 1981 '' American Werewolf in London '' and 'The Company of Wolves' (1984) - other 80 movies that share a 'look back' while adapting the stories to the 80s. All three films have gone the same on earlier incarnations, but their themes have mainly separated (because they could), and at the same time they recognize the tongue-in-the-cheek, humorous aspects of their projects. <br /> <Neil Jordan's Wolves played on many of the psychoanalytical memes that fluttered in the 80's, while American Werewolf narrowed his theme as an "upcoming year" movie. This is called artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latter drama inherent in the 'Scream' franchise, 'I Know What You Last Summer' and 'Final Destination'. But these teenage films seem to be part of a box-office trend, while the 80's movies such as "Lifeforce" belong to a British sci-fi gun, even though this one is written by an American. <br /> <In many ways, this movie is much better than the latter disaster and "Independence Day", "Armageddon," "Deep Impact," because the "solutions" are not in gunfights, weaponized payloads, and testosterone . On the other side of the pole, it is a pity that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron did not investigate Tarkowski and Lem until they made 'Solaris'. <br /> <br /> The purpose of this movie was fun, not ponderousness or stupidity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
