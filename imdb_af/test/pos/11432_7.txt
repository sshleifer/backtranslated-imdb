Vincenzo Buonavolunta, a man who has worked at a steel mill for many years, as a maintenance man who sells the Italian owners to the Chinese, comes to the end of the meeting where the purchase is arranged because he is the new buyer of a mistake he discovered and he thinks he has the solution. He doesn't do the Italian old management, or the new Chinese owners. He even fights with the translator about the exact term he wants to use to express his concern. <br /> <br /> The next thing we see is Vincenzo arriving in China to contact the new owners. To his surprise, there is someone in charge, since Mr. Chong, the man he tried to warn in Italy, was dismissed. His next quest goes to the woman who was the translator, Liu Hua. He finds her work in a library, but she tells him, in no doubt, she blames him for being discharged from her position. Liu, who sees Vincenzo's despair, agrees with him to find his steel factory. <br /> <br /> So start Vincenzo and Liu through some of the dark landscapes that travel by train, steamship, bus and truck, to remote parts of the giant land. Finding the right factory seems to be elusive anyway, but Vincenzo discovers a life that is totally exhilarating, as well as finding a kind of soul that doesn't hesitate to help the Italian man, despite her initial dislike him. <br /> <br /> Gianni Amelio's movie is a kind of travel report. He takes the viewer into unknown territory. Some comments compare Vincenzo to Italian traveler Marco Polo, although the agreements are not very tangible. The film takes us in the early stages of the journey, but it gets a little less enjoyable, as Vincenzo is stranded after he left Liu. Mr. Amelio is an interesting director, as he clearly demonstrates with this film he worked on adapting Ermano Rea's novel, which we didn't read. <br /> <br /> Sergio Castellitto is the only reason to watch the movie. This versatile actor brings a lot to the movie, which in a way is a tour for him, as he is seen in almost every frame of the picture. The combination of Amelio and Castellitto seems to be a winning combination. Ling Tai, who makes her debut as Liu Hua, has some beautiful moments and shows good chemistry with her fellow. <br /> <br /> Luca Bigazzi photographed the Chinese landscape in all its paleness. We see a China that is not picture cards beautiful. Mr. Bigazzi catches all the greed, so typical of the areas where the movie is set. Franco Piersanti's musical score serves the film well.
