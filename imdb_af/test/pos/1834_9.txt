There are so many positive reviews about Back to me that my opinion is not needed to encourage you to watch this movie. However, I feel the need to express my admiration for this unique movie. Bonnie Hunt proved that she was not only an exceptional actress, but also a wonderful director and screenwriter. This movie has everything and is full of humanity, gentleness, sense of humor ... Don't miss it, don't wait any longer. And, regarding poor reviews, pay no attention. Some viewers forget that these types of movies should be watched with your heart, not just with your eyes. If some viewers prefer Notting Hill or you have Mail, it's their mistake. To me, Back to me is a real gem, a memorable movie.
