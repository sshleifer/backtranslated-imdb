The third and last female prisoner Scorpion movie directed by Shunya Ito. The series star, Meiko Kaji, will host the fourth installment, Grudge Song, directed by skilled Yasuhara Hasebe (who also has Kaji in the excellent Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). The Original Female Prisoner # 701: Scorpio is one of my all-time favorites. The successor, Jailhouse 41, is almost as good. It's widely regarded as the best of the series, and I may agree, I think, if it ever gets a better version on DVD (the original, by Image, is very poor). Beast Stable, in my opinion, is almost as good as FP701. It is much slower, much more contemplative. It has its share of violence and nastiness, but there is more focus on the story and the characters. Sasori (Kaji) evokes detectives in the first scene (she is handcuffed to one and his arms cut off and escapes with it in drag, to be seen to be believed!) And hangs with a freelance prostitute, Yuki. Yuki is shrouded by a local prostitution ring, which includes a goofy-looking madame with a cage full of pet crows. What really surprised me is how sad the movie is. Yuki's story, which is never resolved, is heartbreaking. The images are frightening, and Ito's direction is masterful. It's too bad he never went after leaving the FP701 series. It's a great movie.
