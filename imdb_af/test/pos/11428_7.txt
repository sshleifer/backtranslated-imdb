If you want to see a movie with Stan Laurel from the Laurel & Hardy comedies, this is not the movie for you. Stan won't find the character and rhythms of those movies for another two years. However, if you want a good travesty of the Rudolph Valentino BLOOD AND SAND, which was made the previous year, it's the movie for you. All the ends are pulled out, both in physical comedy and on the title cards. If the movie is not kept by character, the plot of Valentino's movie is used.
