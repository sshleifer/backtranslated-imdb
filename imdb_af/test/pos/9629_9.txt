The Patriot is a well thought out, well-produced film that will draw the viewer directly into the story and keep it to the end. Granted, it's not in the same bait as under siege, et. Al, but it's definitely the brand movie of what can be described as Seagal's second era of movies. Not so much. Action flicks with a wink to a story that is well thrown in, but a good story that matches a point and is injected with some Seagal's unbeatable action sequences. Is this the kind of movie that hardcore action junkies will enjoy? Probably not. But for those of us who don't just love our action but also appreciate a good story, it's a big step forward for Seagal. It's almost like the transformation that Clint Eastwood made when he was under the shadow of his "Dirty Harry" series. Either man, he continued in the simple direction they were heading for, would forever be in a specific role and guaranteed the shortness of their careers ...
