"Haggard: The Movie" is well written, well directed and well done. There are many laughter aloud moments and some fantastic skateboarding scenes with Margera. The scenes of West Chester, PA are beautifully filmed and the writing is just really funny. What I like about the movie is that it is not another juicy love story or other version of Jackass, but it takes a dark funny look at break from a different perspective. Most breaking films have a na√Øve woman chased by a cheat man. She then goes to Mr. Get right right and get her fake to tell you to get lost. This movie looks at the emotional roller coaster of a swollen man ... without taking himself too seriously. Ryan Dunn does an excellent job as the swollen man and with Bam Margera and Brandon Dicamillo as your best friends to help you through this difficult time, how can you take anything too seriously? Clearly, Margera and Co. incredibly talented as well as behind the camera. I look forward to their future films and efforts.
