This movie is without a doubt the best I have seen in my whole life. The star star cast is just an added bonus over the amazing special effects, and the in-depth story and sublime choreography. The movie is about an old love affair folding in the modern world. Two loved ones in heaven do the wrath of great salvation and are cursed. Then the woman is born again on earth. While at university, she is raped and commits suicide. The rest of the movie focuses mainly on the hunting of the people associated with the rape, by her lover who possesses superior strength and mastery of various languages. Sonu Nigam performs a very mature and deep performance in this movie, and all the other actors are doing almost as well. Action scenes with Akshay Kumar are blowing, and should not be missed. You just have to watch this movie !!!
