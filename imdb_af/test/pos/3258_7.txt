"Two Hands" is a hilarious Australian gangster movie set across Sydney. I'm sure tourists never expect Sydney and Bondi to look like this in this movie: all sweaty bodies, oppressive night and gangsters in nylon pants and jandals. Heath Ledger plays an amateur boxer with a view to joining the local King's Cross boss's gang. He looks pretty beautiful in his green womens dresser and blue pattern smuggler. A sweaty tattooed bid becomes him. I always had him as a 'Home & Away' boy, and he's in that soap, which is a bit nicer than the Weetbix insipid "Neighbors". The movie is really worth watching for its combination of sardonic humor and nasty violence - the drowning scene is expected to give nightmares soon. Totty Awards: Country girl love interest brother and tattooed streetkid.
