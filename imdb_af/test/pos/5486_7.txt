"In The Line Of Fire" tells the story of the game between an old presidential bodyguard and a former murderer became psychologist. The secret service agent / guardian (Eastwood) is on defense and the murderer (Malkovich) is offensive. The game? The president's life. I really like this movie ... I've seen it on TV many times and recently bought it on DVD. Yet it is not an excellent movie. The plot is too thin and the attempts to thicken it are really ridiculous. The whole love story is not very acceptable and the way they have an extra character in the story just to kill it is kind of insult to the more or less intelligent viewer. Although I feel that these errors cannot be forgiven, I can easily overtake them to Mr. Malkovich, excellent performance. I always regarded him as a good actor, but in this movie he's really on fire. There is a reason why he received an Oscar nomination. Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood were okay, but I don't see their performance as memorable. They are never to the best of their abilities. <br /> <br /> If you don't expect too much, you'll definitely like this movie. It's not a masterpiece, but John Malkovich is really extraordinary and I don't think anyone can enjoy his performance. Really worth the watch ...
