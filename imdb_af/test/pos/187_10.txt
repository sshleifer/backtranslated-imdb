I'm out of words to describe the beauty of "The Cranes Flying", but I will try to write about it anyway. It is a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in World War II. This is the classic story of lovers (Boris & Veronika) separated by war and from what comes between them. The movie's images are so beautiful that you will be taken away. The movie technique is perfectly in harmony with the emotion. <br /> <br /> There are few scenes depicting the war directly: a bombing - wind, lightning, explosions - this will have a major impact on the life of the main character, Veronika, waiting for Boris's return; and there is another scene in front, where we are confronted by an emotional / visual hurricane that displays the images played in Boris's face. Another scene works as the search motif of the movie and offers its title - the taps fly in the air. This image stands as the symbol of nature and the seasons and underlines the final message of the movie: not giving up hope and fighting for a better future. <br /> <br /> Kalatozov is a good director, this film is visually stunning and it has also deeply affected me. It's not just pure technique. <br /> <br /> Tatyana Samojlova is perfect like Veronika. What else can I say? The film overtook the time it was made - the action took place during World War II. But it could have happened anytime, anywhere. So long there are wars (big or small), and the message remains relevant.
