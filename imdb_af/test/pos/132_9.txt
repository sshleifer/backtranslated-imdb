This film shows powerfully the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply rooted in ritual and tradition. All this against a background of an India that is struggling for freedom of the same values. This film is both political and personal and never preaching or idealistic in the front. It's easy to see why "Fire" caused riots in India, yet tragic. A real movie like this one must be earned by all people of the world, not just privileged Westerners.
