This series goes a long way with beautiful footage of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being in the game for five years will be hard to expect. I got the impression that some scenes of the first episode are repeated in the latter, which is of course only a minor gripe. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough is wonderful as a narrator and commentary is insightful, leaving plenty of space for your imagination, and well spaced so the viewers get enough time to reflect on the stunning images. If you get the chance, try not to look at a translated version of this series. <br /> <br /> Someone interested in the complexities of our blue continents and easily the best documentary on this subject. ever seen.
