The three-party series ended on PBS last night, which I believe was its first wide exposure to an American audience. The richness of his text and the unique quality of his filming are high marks. It seems very novel to see and hear an action game that uses the English language of Georgia-England. Jane Austen's filmed consulting rooms are the primary example of the form of speech. Yet it is the scale of drama that overwhelms the senses, which fits a wonderful language perfectly into every scene. Such brave exposure to an old reality is tempting for literary giants such as Tolstoy or Shakespeare, while at the same time entertaining in the way of a C. S. Forester or Patrick O'Brian seesaga. The universality of the basic human condition lies in its center. <br /> <br /> Narrator Talbot as played by an actor with the almost perfect name Benedict Cumberbatch (certainly not Dickens could beat that one!) Substitute between stodgy jingoism and extreme vulnerability, an acting tour the power. Indeed, I cannot remember under this very good throw any misconception. It is a tribute not only to the actors themselves, but also to the director. <br /> <br /> However, the impressive element is how perfectly aboard a war warrior on the way to Australia in the early 1800s is offered. This is especially true of how the ship's movement becomes almost a character, something that seldom takes into account, except as background. Anyone who has personally experienced the mer will immediately recognize and appreciate the difficulty of having to recreate within the context of filming. <br /> <br /> This is not a fantasy Pirates of the Caribbean. There must be a lot of effort to get an understanding of his nuances.
