www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html An excellent TV series to be taken on DVD. It was a show I rarely missed. I got a petition to bring it back to DVD. I remember one show where this obese lady wore glasses talking to her. Needless to say she couldn't eat her friends so she was hungry. Another episode had an accountant who visited an underground sewer and metro security department. The accountant wanted to close the funding for the project. As it turns out, the security branch is underground to fight the cannibalistic creatures living in the dark. www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html
