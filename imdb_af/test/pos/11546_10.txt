When I first watched this movie, I thought it was a very funny movie. But I know that the director almost always has a goal when making a movie. So I decided to look at it again. The second time I watched it, I realized that Albert Puyn was a very talented and very original filmmaker. In the beginning, the viewer was told that the movie took place a decade after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. But they had clothes and cars with a design typical of the 1950s. They had plutonium which I think is a symbol of futuristic trading. I think that means the movie's real time is not specified. The music in the movie makes a long music video that tells parts of the real story in the lyrics, especially for the intro and the outro. <br /> <br /> Albert Puyn uses red and blue back colors when he shows the symbols of communism (red) and capitalism and western world (blue). One can see that Ice-T, the name Mao (communism), and when in focus, is the back color red. The American policeman, starring Burt Reynolds, is always filmed with blue back. The club where Mao and his gang hang around is also red in color. Crazy six hangs between the red and the blue color. <br /> <br /> I think the white puppy that Mao symbolizes in the beginning is the controlling power. Mao had the dog in the beginning, but the police eventually took it. It symbolizes, I think, the fall of communism and the replacement of the capitalist mindset of the Western world in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I think Crazy Six is ​​a very well made movie. Albert Puyn creates a sci-fi / action film with a political depth. This is another, but a very special film about communism in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to watching another spectacular film by Albert Puyn.
