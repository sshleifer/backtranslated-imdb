I couldn't stop watching this movie, though it was far beyond my bedtime. <br /> <br /> Equations with Hitchcock are earned - this thing really plays with you. It runs a wonderful line between real, immediate tension and a dark, distant humor. Like many of Hitch's heroes, our seemingly naughty witness knocked innocently into something that is truly horrific - and we are taken on a fairly ride with her, on twists that completely identify and feel her fear, while watching turns in exciting excitement as she is <br /> <br /> The film makers have put a lot of tender care into this effect. Of the opening shots, they involve you and challenge you to determine what is real and what is manufacturing; who should be trusted and who is a monster. The plot turns and turns unpredictably. Suspens are created with a combination of carefully selected camera work, images, music - but mostly the eyes of the characters who send raw fear right into you. <br /> <br /> A warning: there are some scary real gores, as well as some nudity. The horror scenes are done in an emotional way that makes them much more frightening and disturbing than in any teenage spy. <br /> <br /> And a teenager's trick is not. The characters are peculiar and feel like real people, for one thing - a couple (including the heroine), you may even find endearing as I did. There will be no mistake, you are watching an adult movie. I mean, Alec Guinness is in it, short and you know he doesn't need the job! <br /> <br /> Pop it into the VCR at night when you can't sleep. . . and don't want to, yet.
