In a minute of praying, a second to die, Clay McCord (Alex Cord) is an unfortunate ban with a ten thousand dollar bounty on his head and degenerative epilepsy. <br /> <br /> The realization of his days as a ban is numbered, he desperately wants (though somewhat unwillingly) to benefit from an amnesty granted by rough and tumbled territorial governor Robert Ryan (which is excellent performance), which badly refuses to allow McCord to deny his ways and accept the amnesty as an example to others, while banning Escondito's bandit hub, Mario Brega forbids plans to kill McCord to stop it. <br /> <br /> Also with Arthur Kennedy, Aldo Sambrell and a lot of other well-known European faces, it is co-written and produced by (American) spaghetti western pioneer Albert Band, also responsible for the pre-Leone movie Gunfight That Red Sands. <br /> <br /> Although the solution to the main character's epilepsy goes straight from Howard Hawks El Dorado, the writing is solid, fairly fresh and unpretentious. It has a good balance of action and story and Alex Cord is great in it. He really had to be a bigger star. <br /> <br /> In defense of the shorter (well-baptized) English version: personally, I am beyond that age where the longer version is always the better version and the end where McCord is ironic by grim bounty hunters, after his pardon is unnecessarily nihilistic and destroys the film's message of hope and redemption. <br /> <br /> Call me old-fashioned but I rooted for McCord and feel he deserved it happy ending!
