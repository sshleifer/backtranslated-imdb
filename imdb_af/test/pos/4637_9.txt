I will see this movie every time it was on the cable and it never got old. Who can forget some of the best lines in movie history? --- JOHNNY'S GUARD BOY CITIZENS !! JOHNNY'S VET-BOY CITIZENS !! and look among the happy melons! I wished I could run across the city in a treasure hunt, just as fun. It's an all-time fave and I'm happy to hear it's on video! I am positive that it has MTV's original premise for the Road Series series.
