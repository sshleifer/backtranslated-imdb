You Are Alone is a beautiful, almost delicate movie, cleverly crafted, critically written, with two complex and sounding performances, and an end to an end that no one sees coming, but will show you that the movie is a second time is to see. go back and get all the clues you've read incorrectly. <br /> <br /> The story, about a high school girl who drowns her depression and discomfort by working a few hours a week as a $ 500 a-hour schoolgirl, and the depressed neighbor neighbor who discovers her secret and Receiving her for an afternoon call in a New Haven hotel center, offers stunning performances by both Jessica Bohl and the girl and Richard Brundage as her neighbor. <br /> <br /> Bohl as Daphne gives a breakthrough performance on equal terms with Maggie Gyllenhaal in Secretary. She takes such a teenager's fear of growing into her own skin and when she speaks that she is always in control, she realizes she is not in control, but in danger of going over the deep end, what I in a way she guesses. <br /> <br /> Pants like Buddy are depressed, angry, heart broken, one's shell. But it is not to the film's disturbing conclusion that you understand a full understanding of his pain. <br /> <br /> After a very short opening segment, which will hook most independent film lovers and keep the religious right going The exits, we are brought into the hotel room. Initially, you are not sure about these people or the movie style. Shaky, annoying ... like the characters. Until you realized your story, you briefly flashed back. They are first confrontational for a reason, and so is the camera. But as they open, as the story goes, so does the camera. And I don't know, 20 minutes in, giving or taking, you can't find yourself taking your eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> After just seeing the world premiere at the Brooklyn Film Fest - where the director asked the audience if someone expected the end and not one person answered yes? I almost wish the movie was already on video so I could see it again. Thinking about some of the talks in the movie, especially a very open-minded dialogue about fantasy and climax, I really thought things were going in a very different direction. But I realize so much of their conversation means something completely different from what I thought. I have to see it again !!! But so dark and sexual, so much of the talk is, to say the least, I laughed myself more than I expected on some of his fever, which definitely falls into the "things we think but not the nerve. not to say aloud "category. It's very blunt, especially if you realize that so much of it has a completely different meaning. Some of this makes you uncomfortable, especially when you look, you are alone with a partner. You will definitely have something to talk about? Maybe argue about ?? then. Perhaps it should come with a warning: You should be alone when you look! The music is wonderful. I would have come home and bought the soundtrack from my favorite online music store if I could. The movie looks as good as anything shot on film. After screening director Gorman Bechard, asked what kind of process he used to look the digital footage as well. She replies: nothing. They couldn't afford it. <br /> <br /> I need to give Bechard credit. I'm a big fan of his two pants, The Pretty Girl and Objects in the Mirror, but even they couldn't prepare me for the complexity and surprises of this movie. <br /> <br /> For everyone involved: bravo.
