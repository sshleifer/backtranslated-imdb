or any stories reminiscent of the Leopold and Loeb case, you can entertain this movie. The film includes Robert Culp, Stephen Caffrey and Garrison Hershberger as university students. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is his usual self, as if he's being deceived by the preliminary students. Caffrey ("Longtime Companion", "Buried Alive") is excellent and needs more of these threatening roles. Basically, the two older friends get tired of their demanding parents, who expect nothing less than academic perfection. Attendance at the best schools will only be financed if they meet. There is an excellent scene in which Culp Caffrey drops over the coals after getting low grade, threatening to cut off his trust funds and Caffrey later tells his friend: "I hate him, I want to kill him" ... <br /> <br /> Everything is not good in Beverly Hills. It is always an excellent theme. I believe this film came out in 1990 after the Menendez murders. If you look at "Menedez, a Killing in Beverly Hills" and then compare it to this movie, you can find interesting parallels.
