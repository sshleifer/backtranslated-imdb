This is by far one of the best movies I've seen in many years. Top 20 of my lifetime. I laughed more than I had since the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and cried more than I saw since the Notebook. If you are looking for a touch movie without the juicy edge ... this is the one. It is real and powerful. See it and you won't regret it. I was initially hesitant and I just looked at it because I had to do a school project on speech disabilities. But this movie is so much more than that. It's about life, free and independent of the way the world would keep you. It's about the disabilities each of us has, so we see ourselves and what we miss, but let everything else get in the way.
