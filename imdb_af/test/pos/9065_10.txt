I really loved this original script and the different places it made me, emotionally, spiritually, and just stupid. I didn't catch in the believability in the screenplay or the actors and didn't even think about it until I read the reviews in IMDb for the movie. Listen to Michael Parness speaking at the Q&A about his idea of ​​the film, seeing how crazy people, or "f'ed" people, as he put it, fall in love, is really interesting. I identified with the fact that I didn't have a storybook romance and liked to see dysfunction. I like to look at David Krumholtz for everything he does and has been following his career for a few years now. I believe it's some of his best work and tell anyone, just watch this movie watching a wonderful young actor. I agree that Guillermo Díaz was really a playmaker, and what he did with his character is really a great acting lesson in dedication. I laughed and cried both in this movie and was disappointed that it won no awards at the festival. I question why this did not happen. I gave Max and Grace a ten because these interesting, unique, creative Indie movies deserve an audience. Technically watching this movie, it's really done nicely? the colors are great and lastly it is one of the best soundtracks I heard in a movie in a while.
