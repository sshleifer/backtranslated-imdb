This movie is a very enjoyable tribute to the Bogart and other detective films of old. Robert Sacchi nails it as Bogie and Michelle Phillips is a real timeless beauty than Gena Anastas. <br /> <br /> The most notable part of this movie, however, is the longest belly dance scene ever produced in a Hollywood movie. One well-known professional instructor noticed that nothing else in the cinema comes close to dance excitement. <br /> <br /> The scene, which is ultimately an important part of the plot, takes place in a delightfully beautiful Middle Eastern nightclub and enchanting by all accounts. The pulsating music, the tortuous veils and ring-fingered, free-flowing waves and beautiful costumes - and a surprise twist with the seductive Sybil Danning - build tension and excitement to the end. <br /> <br /> The three talented and beautiful professional nightclub dancers are led by exotic dark-colored beauty Kamala Almanzar, one of the leading belly dancers in the US since the mid-1970s. She was chosen by famous Armenian musician Guy Chookoorian to travel with his band on the road. Guy's ensemble is the live band that the dancers perform in the scene. If you look at the trailer on this site, you will see a look at Kamala (playing the finger gym balls behind Sybil Danning). <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of belly dancing yet, you will be in this movie, and if you are an aficionado, keep it very good at repeated watching.
