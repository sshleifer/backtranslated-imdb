Like much of a child born in the 1980s, I grew up on the Mel Brooks films that were not necessarily the "racer" like Blazing Saddles and History of the World part 1 (of course I saw it, but not so often not now), but the one for the "whole family", space balls and this movie. I knew when I didn't see good art, but just a camping, goofy, but always laughing, taking Robin Hood and / or adventure movies. But it calls it a family movie in quotes. This means that a) adults can really enjoy it as much as children, if not because of the small jokes and folly, and b) once a child sees it when he repeats it, as I have several times, it is still so fresh, but with some things it didn't quite understand the first time. It is a comedy not only filled with jokes on Robin Hood movies and other movies (Godfather of course, as well as little reports for other movies of modern times), but one that also refers to Brooks' own movies. It's a movie maker who doesn't even put his own style at risk. <br /> <br /> Basic story - Robin Hood (Cary Elwes in one of his best turns) returns to the crusades to see that things are in. Danger with King Richard, and so continue to regain his country and, of course, rob the rich to feed the poor. Along the way he meets Achoo (Dave Chappelle), heads with Prince John (Richard Lewis) and the sheriff, and of course still pain for the love of Maid Marian. It is of course the usual clothing line for Brooks to run the comedy in the scenes, and sometimes a joke may not work or may be a repeat look, so much of it stick that it is difficult not to visit. It also helps a few bits of the best in any Brooks movie, such as the Godfather bit (Dom DeLouise at its best), Brooks's own cameo as the rabbi, Lewis and Chappelle's acting turns, and an endless mutilation of quotation lines and some tongue-in-cheek songs. Some of it is obvious, yes, some of it just take right from the pages of Blazing Saddles, sure, but is this a good time for real crowds? Definitely - and for parents who grew up at the 70-year-old Brooks work, it's a fantastic way to introduce the little ones into their work (even the suggestive sex jokes and it's not R-rated.
