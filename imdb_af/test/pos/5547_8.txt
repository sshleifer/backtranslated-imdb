Time does extraordinary things. This is the ultimate judge. Time has awarded 'Married To The Mob', an extra dose of freshness. There are no dead moments or cheap shots. It is now more of a joy than it ever was. Michelle Pfeiffer creates a mafia widow that it is as far away from a caricature as she ever did. A true original creation that touches or hints at the stereotype, just to guide us, but her Angela is very unique. Legendary Dean Stockwell presents us with a mafia boss that is just as dangerous as he is hilarious. And Matthew Modine? Why did I think he had no chemistry with Pfeiffer? I was wrong. They are wonderful together. They reminded me this time to Barbara Stanwyck, "Fred MacMurray of" Remember the Night ". I'm writing this comment now to lure you to visit or visit this Jonathan Demme jewel.
