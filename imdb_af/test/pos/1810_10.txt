What can i say ?? This movie has everything ... Romance, break-ups, rich kids, punks and preps. This is my favorite movie that is all the time I can call line by line. I remember when it first came out, I was 14 and couldn't get in. So it finally got on the cable ... I was addicted! Want to move to California and be a Valley girl. (Hey, I even remember the song by Maan Zappa, did you?) Worked in vain for years to get the never-sounding soundtrack ... now you can find it on rhino records ...
