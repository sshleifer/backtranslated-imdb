I suppose it depends on when one sees the movie for the first time that their impression is shaped as it is. <br /> <br /> I saw it in 1973 as a child on TV when it "The Stranger" and I loved it. It was the time when the space program to the moon was a reality, when performances such as "Search", "UFO" and "6M $ Man" show a 12-year-old child who can keep the world in their future. Adventure and technology. <br /> <br /> You only had to see it once, and that was when the network broadcast them. The only way people could hit your shows was by making their own parody; they did not get your performance and added their own comment on it. <br /> <br /> I didn't know what this "pilot" concept was. I saw the movie and came out that Stryker would come home; did not know that there was a possibility that it would last longer than two hours. <br /> <br /> Then would I understand what so many people hate about the movie? I doubt it because I don't remember it as such. Do I understand now? Not really understanding the story, but one should not see it from their perspective, but rather from that of the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> If one looks like an American, it may be humorous about the lack of security in a police state ..... but if a subject is in that state then compliance can be met and security can be less. When things are supposed to be perfect, perfect to the fullest, perfect one of which is not supposed to doubt, it's probably not as soon as possible to ask the question if things are out of order. <br /> <br /> The subplots of Die film are interesting as the old man who remembered the time before, but looked at his words, as he suspected there were spies everywhere. Or that the police appreciate the state to some extent because they are cautious about how they control or impair their brain power. <br /> <br /> These days, you'll probably know exactly what the movie is about, before they see it. , so much of the tension, surprise is lost. But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect swap if you think this movie was well made in the Cold War and the astronaut's greatest fear is that he has crashed into the USSR. One gets a bit in the film before it becomes clear that such a possibility is the least of its concern. <br /> <br /> This is the primary difference between "The Stranger" and "Doppelganger". The latter can be regarded as timeless, since any comments it has about the USSR are relatively small and lost early in the film. In the former, these links are by the film, presumably directly in the beginning and then as a theme variation after wards. <br /> <br /> All that said, despite my memory for the movie, it's pretty easy to see that it would not be a series. Stryker will make friends every week, Benedict would rush, Stryker would get away. Eventually Benedict's society would get rid of him. Someone else will pick up the chase. A coil would develop. There may be something new, like another crew member of Stryker's mission, but it probably won't be enough to keep the show going. <br /> <br /> If someone comes in with the knives, others will use to cut the movie, chances are they'll cut it too. But if one remembers that it was made during the Cold War and what fears and estimates on the other side were at that time, from what the popular environment is for the viewer, then they can find some entertaining and intellectual themes in it .
