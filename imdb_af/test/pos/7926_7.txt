It was Eisenstein's first completed project in ten years. The film takes place in the 13th century during an invasion of Russian by Germans (Teutonic Knights - I think). Released in 1938, it is a very loose parallel to Russia's closer involvement in World War II, and Germany's advancement in Eastern Europe. There are some amazing scenes, especially the battle near the end of the movie, and there is a shocker when children are thrown into a pit of fire, but it's not an easy watch. The film draws and is not as consistent brilliant as "Potemkin" or "Ivan the Terrible". Sometimes Eisenstein is better in cuts. However, his luster is present, and it is a "must see" for Eisenstein fans and film historians. Russian propaganda at its best.
