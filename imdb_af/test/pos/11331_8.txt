The idea of ​​marital fidelity portrayed in the film looks outdated today, but it is precisely the main characters' adherence to that idea that makes the whole story so tragic. It is this idea that they double and allow them to stick out, as they refer to their respective spouses, "not like them." As Tony Leung said in the film, love only happens. There is no need for a rational explanation of how this happens, it simply does. Even though they didn't want to bump into their spouse's level, it happened. Fidelity, social mores, and timing all conspired against this relationship are being brought to fruition. To just fall in love is far from enough. <br /> <br /> I had the misfortune to sit next to a young couple (still in the university of the talks they were singing, which they shared with me all the time, pain of lost love and missed opportunities ). Their great inability to digest the subtlety and the deepest emotions evoked, made me realize how much a movie like this, as well as other work by Wong Kar Wei, is wasted on the local audience.
