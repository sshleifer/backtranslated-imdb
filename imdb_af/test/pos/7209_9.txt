This is the story of three brothers who come together in the midst of hardship and loss and learn that the very important things in life are family, love, trust, and forgiveness. The whole hostage manages a powerful display despite some turbulent one-liners. A good movie for fans of lifelong problems that credible families experience. Also take a look at the fans of Dermot Mulroney or Sean Astin. They both do an astonishing job, often bringing you to tears. Take my word for it and rent it today!
