The 1970s are often regarded as a golden era of British television comedy, a period that saw many classic sitcoms and sketch programs like Monty Python's Flying Circus. However, the era was not a golden era of the British film comedy, and what worked well on television was seldom passed on to the big screen. The most triumphant exceptions to this rule were provided by the Pythons, but their best films ("Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and "Life of Brian") were very different in the perception of their television program. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with adjusting theater sitcoms is that concepts are designed to fit the 30 minutes of the BBC (25 minutes on ITV, which should find room for advertising). It does not always work as well when expanded into a feature film three or four. times as long. Few people will say the movie versions of, say, "Up Pompeii!" Remember. or "Steptoe and Son" with the same love as the television versions. In the case of many classic TV comedy shows ("Some Mothers Do 'Ave" Em, "Yes, Minister", "Fawlty Towers", "The Goodies"), they did not attempt to roll them at all, for which we can be thankful. Characters like Michael Crawford's Frank Spencer or John Cleese's Basil Fawlty can be hilarious at half-hourly rates, but I doubt they'll be so funny in two hours. A comedy program (a dramatization of a comic strip rather than a normal comedy) that worked in the theater was "The Fall and Rise or Reginald Perrin", but any hope of a movie was through the tragic early the death of his star Leonard Rossiter. <br /> <br /> "Dad's Army" was one of the few television sets of the period that changed into a decent movie. (About the only other one I can think of was "Dad"). This was possible because it had an exceptionally large number of well-developed characters and derived most of his humor from the interactions between them. The original sitcom ran between 1968 and 1977 and tells of the misadventures of a Home Guard platoon in the small coastal town of Walmington-on-Sea. (The Home Guard, initially known as the Local Defense Volunteer, was a relief million during World War II. It was mostly from men who were too old to serve in the regular powers). The movie version is a drama with three plays. Act I'm dealing with the formation of the platoon and the recruitment of its members. In Law II, they cause devastation during an Army exercise. <br /> <br /> The three key players in this drama are the platoon's commander, Captain George Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) and his two subordinates Sergeant Arthur Wilson (John Le Mesurier) and Corporate Jack Jones (Clive Dunn). Mainwaring, which is the local bank manager in civilian life, is a naughty little man peering through some thick glasses in the world. It is he who takes the initiative to form the Home Guard unit and who appoint himself his commander. He is pompous, ominous, with an exaggerated sense of his own interest and of his own leadership, the kind of man who does not suffer foolishly. (And in George Mainwaring's worldview, the term "fool" covers most of the rest of mankind). However, he has his good qualities. He is motivated by a genuine patriotic idealism and is able to have a great physical courage, shown in his encounter with the Germans. <br /> <br /> Wilson is Mainwaring's main business at the bank. The two men are very different in character, something highlighted by differences in appearance, Wilson is tall and thin while Mainwaring is short and naughty. He comes across as more intelligent and better trained than his boss. (His accent indicates that he can be a former public schoolboy). Nonetheless, in civil and military life, he finally played both civil and military life, probably because he has the kind of passive personality that leads to pessimism and defeat and the inability to take anything seriously. Jones is an old soldier who now manages the local butcher's shop. (His promotion to Corporal is mainly due to his ability to bribe Mainwaring with black market sausages). His enthusiasm for his new role is only adjusted by his incompetence and ability to cause chaos. Although his catchphrase is, "Don't panic!" He tends to panic on any given occasion. <br /> <br /> Several other members of the platoon appear. Private Fraser, the spectacular entrepreneur, is even more pessimistic than Wilson. (Catchphrase: "We are doomed, man, doomed!"). Private Godfrey is a gentle old man whose biggest concern is the whereabouts of the nearest toilet. Private Walker is a sharp Cockney Spiv and Private Pike (another bank employee) a spoiled mom's son. (Pike's mother is Wilson's mistress, though Wilson is trying to keep this link secret from the disapproving Mainwaring). Two significant outsiders are the gentle Vicar and the ARP observer, Mainwaring's adjourned enemy, and his eternal greed and indifference. <br /> <br /> There are occasional bawdy double entenders ("Keep your hands out of my privates" Mainwaring apparently refers to the soldiers holding that rank), more than in the television program that was surprisingly free of insinuation. (His creators, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, will later create comedy programs such as "Are You Served" and "Hi-de-hi" who are notorious for suggestive humor). However, the film retains much of the blend of soft white, nostalgia and sharp characterization that made the TV series so successful. 10/07
