A good but not good movie, The Great Dictator, is Chaplin's first talkie. This is a good effort, and sometimes a remarkable satire on Hitler, but unfortunately the moments of Chaplin brilliance are presented here, diminished by the tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue. Yes, Chaplin, the silent screenmaster, uses only too many words in this film, and his tendency to write long speeches and strange scriptures will be conveyed in his other talkie movies, such as (better) "Limelight". Still, Chaplin was extremely risky of even making this movie and his performance in dual roles is definitely memorable. Paulette Goddard doesn't have the brilliance she did in the "Modern Times" (her screen relationship with Chaplin was cool at the time), but she's always worth seeing, and Jack Oakie steals about the show as a competitive dictator to Chaplin's famous creation Hynkel.
