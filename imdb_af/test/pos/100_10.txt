The best short I have ever seen. Some commentators suggest that it can be extended due to the density of insight it offers. There is irony in those comments and little merit. The acting is all about Noonan and he perfectly carries his ungrateful character. I may have preferred the narrator to be less recognizable, but borrowing the gravitas is perfect. It is a short for people who read, for those whose "bar" is high and for those who admit that life in a culture that stupidity and banality can be contradictory and bitter defenders of beauty. A beautiful short film. FWIW: I was delighted with the Picasso reference, as I once believed that Picasso was just another craft with little talent; As I assume, most people - until the day I saw some drawings he made when he was 12. Picasso was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever have in a lifetime. I immediately understood why he had to make the art for which he became known.
