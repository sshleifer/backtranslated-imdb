(Including possible spoilers, but giving away nothing critically.) <br /> <br /> I just watched this classic low-budget movie, and was knocked out by the level of energy on the screen. All the actors take pride in themselves, especially John Daniels, has yet to see one of his films. Not only does this movie offer good performances, it manages stylish rows, such as when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see screens of glass falling into a pool breaking out of the impact of the fallen man, I like That way slow-motive photography was used in the 70's movie, dreamy and hypnotic. Cool and greasy black dudes spray one large linen while slender healthy lumps of white rubbish come to unpleasant ends. I love it, my rating 10 / 10. If ever it comes to DVD, count me for a purchase.
