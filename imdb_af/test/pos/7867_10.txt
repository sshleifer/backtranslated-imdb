Smart psychological drama about a wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood) who escapes in the isolated Confederate school for young women in the Civil War. Slowly, Eastwood begins to seduce every girl in sight until the tables are turned around and he is chased in a disturbing, gothic-toned final. Never before has a movie been so nice erotic, but at the same time disturbing macabre. <br /> <br /> It is undoubtedly Eastwood's best hour (those who agree with Dirty Harry will be surprised), while the rest of the role-play gives uniformly excellent performances. Try to watch the movie as video prints usually remove important flash screens between Geraldine Page and Patrick Culliton.
