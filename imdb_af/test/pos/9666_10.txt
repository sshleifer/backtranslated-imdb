Looking back to the year 2002, when Furia was made, you can easily recognize the remake of today's new generation in Romania. <br /> <br /> The main qualities of Furia stand in a very solid writing, a substantial dramatic core and a very professional development, plus a throw of excellent actors. All four leading roles are performed wonderfully, both with depth and ease: Dragos Bucur and Andy Vasluianu have confirmed that they have been two of our best performers ever since. Dorina Chiriac is following them and Adrian Tuli, a non-professional (in real life). , a cemetery manager!) Cast as Gabonu, was a real revelation! <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Radu Muntean's direction is skillful and expressive, creating in a very compelling style the feel of a fateful night and inevitable destination. One can easily pass over the few uncomfortable and even failed moments, as the time has proved that they are only the uncertainties inherent in a debut, never repeated in his subsequent movies: "Hârtia va fi albasträ" and "Boogie".
