One night at McCool's is a very funny movie that is more intelligent than it should be. Its shape is more sophisticated than I expected, and its arbitrariness was excellent. The thoughts behind the film (mysogenia, sadism, stupid people) are childless. That's what I have to say about this movie, it's not just that it hates women, but it despises men. It has no sympathy for any of the men. It looks like the shape, but the end says it all. Nobody cares. <br /> <br /> The form has the first two-thirds of the movie told by three characters in flashback: Dillon, the stupid bartender; Reiser, the mysogenic stupid lawyer; and Goodman, the stupid, saint-like-you-policeman. The story is therefore always distorted by their own self-image and changed realities. Traveler's BBQ fantasy is a good touch. Eventually we never know the truth, and nothing is what it seems. Dillon was never so innocent, etc. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is actually funny too. From the randomness of the last 5 seconds of the movie to the exaggerated obvious of Tyler's manipulations, it seems that the film has its own energy. Everything is just out of the blue, and nothing seems meaningful. Do we really care if it does? No. <br /> <br /> It's also a very dark comedy, but has a level presentation. Think of Nurse Betty, or Jawbreaker. Many candy covered outside, dark, tough inside. If you want your movies to be random, dark or just pure, see this movie. This one will satisfy you urgently for the strangeness one night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> 8/10
