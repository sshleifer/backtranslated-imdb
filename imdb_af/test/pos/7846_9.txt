The Beguiled is a pretty satisfying movie for those who are after the above. For Clint Eastwood's stubborn supporters it will be a disappointment. Although Eastwood does his best here in his so atypical role (except that his character is a charming woman, which he is not so uncomfortable), the ambiguous character of his character, who falls from some fallen hero to a manipulative and insatiable woman eater (to put it this way) will ultimately be too much to handle for anyone who sees him playing heroes in the best western tradition, morally a little unclean but still without that dark side. I think he is pulling off this unlikely part, but those who really steal the show are the two competing women, the school magnate Geraldine Page and the student head, played by Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> We see that there is a potential devil in every man and a possible witch in every woman, especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire. Hartman's Edwina is the most beloved, innocent girl in the world until she is caught up with John McBurney and becomes possessive of him. This is the cause of tragedy, as well as the headmaster's secret desire, the forbidden fruit. She carries a big and ugly secret about her turbulent relationship with her brother, which she still abhorred. The fourth factor in this "unholy" spiral is the bad Carol, played by Jo Ann Harris, who attracts John from his beloved on Edwina and into her bed. <br /> <br /> The whole nature of the story this movie is a kind of gothic feeling, making it a very rare thing in the Western genre, but a popular thing in the movie of the 70's. A unique performance by the Siegel / Eastwood team and a film that is not for the poor.
