OK, so the next review is more of a summary more than actually containing any spoilers, but better safe than sorry to avoid being blacklisted, right? Right! Consider yourself officially warned and read more ... <br /> <br /> In this parody / tribute to the greatest time in horror film history - the 1980s - a group of stupid teenagers gather to get a seans in the home of the infamous Murder McGee, who killed his whole family a few years ago and buried them in the backyard. As I am sure you can guess, things go from worse to worse than you can say, "Where's the beef?" And in the typical 80's horror movie fashion, death is bloody, the dialogue is cheesy, and beautiful women pull their clothes every chance they get. Good times ... <br /> <br /> No click or 80's horror movie clich√©d characterization is not represented here. In fact, there is no stone left at all? We have the cool hero, his innocent girlfriend, the Goth chick, the difficult villain (think John Bender), the hot blonde who loses her shirt, the shy one in love for the blonde who loses her shirt, some of her beautiful half-naked lesbians and two big geeks. <br /> <br /> As you can see clearly, the throw is quite large. Usually, larger castings where things can fall apart are one or two acidic apples that decorate the entire vessel. Not in this case. Not a single cast member disappointed me. The acting was very well done. All of the cool hero in his Thriller jacket played by Jovan Meredith to the big Goth chick played by Renee Dorian to Geeks One & Two played by Cory Assink & Jonathan Brett ?? they played it straight, brought their A-match and hit it out of the park. If you are a fan of Gary & Wyatt in Weird Science, you will immediately fall in love with the geeks. <br /> <br /> Director / co-author Jeff C. Smith is a guy to look into in the future, trust me about this. If he can do it with a low budget, there is nothing but good things ahead of him if he gets more money for future projects. The characters were dead; the atmosphere was perfect; the laugh was great; the blood flowed and sprayed and nicely sprayed? It was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980s. Call this one "THE BREAKFAST CLUB REACH NAME OF THE DEMONS" !!! The tagline says it all and says it honestly - "EXECUTIVE Violence, FREEness, NO BUDGET" - No false advertising here, people! As supporters of this genre, we have to look to the India and support these hard-working people who break out their bumps there, bringing our original stories, so that we cannot be caught up forever in a world full of big studio PG -13 is not. 'horror' or useless remakes like The Hitcher. No, thank you - no more for me. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must honestly say that STOPID TEENAGERS MUST vote! is by far one of the best indie movies I have enjoyed this year. It's a bloody good time, and keeps on repeated views. From the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobe ... even the last love theme on the final credits (which, if not returned, is the laughter of the reminder of the mid-80 power lines by REO Speedwagon - over-pronounced R's every word starts with the letter 'R' - then I will eat my DVD). Bottom line is, if you're a fan of 80's horror or horror in general, don't hesitate anymore - this movie earns in your collection !!
