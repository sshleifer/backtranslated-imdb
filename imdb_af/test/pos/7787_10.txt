Andaz Apna Apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time. But Aamir and Salman Khan acted brilliantly, while Aamir's play was much better than Salman. Anamir Khan is known as' MR. <br /> <br /> The story moves to two young guys Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan). They are both poor families and are a big dreamer. They want to get rich without wearing pain. So when they hear about Raveena Bajaj (Raveena Tandon), the daughter of Mr. Bajaj (Paresh Rawal) who comes to India to find his groom, they are both foolish to marry their fathers with Raveena Bajaj and start the journey. There is also a twist in the movie that makes the movie even more funny. Paresh Rawal is in dual role (Teja and Mr. Bajaj) and has done brilliantly as he always does. Hakti kapoor (crime master Gogo) also adds to a great comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie is a rippling comedy from first minute to last and is one of Bollywood's classic comedy films.
