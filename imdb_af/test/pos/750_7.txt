Personally, I have a soft spot for horror movies in hospitals and asylum, so I had a good feeling to see it "Don't look in the basement", even though its reputation is doubtful. Well, I did it! It's a wonderful, boring entertainment with some effective shocks and beautifully absurd characters. Of course, you have to look beyond the poor production values ​​and the completely illogical plot, but if you do it (and if you are a fan of this kind of horror, it is an essential quality), you will be. rewarded with an outrageous "video nuisance" in which blood and madness form the main elements. The young and cute nurse Charlotte arrives at a remote sanitary facility where she has to start her new job. She finds out that the doctor who hired her was murdered by a patient and the replacement doctor-in-charge Masters seem reluctant to accept the new arrival. Life in the sanatorium is pretty strange, with the patients walking around and every door being unlocked. After a whole bunch of bizarre events, Charlotte discovers the horrible secrets hidden by the institution .... The opening 10 minutes (pre-credits) is wonderful and so is the completely hidden climax. Everything in between is almost without surprise or excitement, but you wait patiently because you just feel the final will be wild. The asylum patients are textbook lunatics, but I love them. Some of my favorites include the former judge (who only speaks in legal terms), the suspected army Sargeant and the mad old lady. "Don't look in the basement" is a great fun, especially recommended for fans of 70's trash cans, sick puppies and other types of scum. The lunatics took over the asylum, yes!
