I've been a fan of Rachael's since the start of 30MM on the Food Network, so I've seen her grow over the years. The moment I saw her with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen, because I saw Oprah being with her and for good reason: she is over natural and willing to laugh at her, much is interesting. . The set is attractive, and there are some fresh ideas (I like the lazy Susan where the audience is sitting). There's just enough of a celebrity segment, and she stays away from controversy and debate (there's plenty on TV day). The show is a sad escape, and she has not chased away her power (cooking), which is very good planning. I know there are people who hate her and her performance; That's right, you can't all please. And somehow, I think Rachael knows and accepts it. So just turn the channel; I don't think she's thinking.
