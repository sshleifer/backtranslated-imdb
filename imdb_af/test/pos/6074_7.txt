The English Patient is one of those films that deserves the highest praise. I say the most, because this movie, although very serious, intense, deep and very thoughtful, still suffers from a few disadvantages. First, why, oh why are the modern movies so long? This one lasts more than two hours and from time to time it becomes very difficult to concentrate and follow the extremely serious plot. I say, if the film was an hour shorter, it would only serve well. However, we have what we have. The winner of several Oscars, The English Patient is still very good. It is a deep, informative treatise of human soul, love and betrayal, war and cowardice, violence and bravery. Ralph Fiennes is a fantastic actor. His hero, neurotic and silent, is a mysterious person, ready for everything just to save the life of his lover. He is wonderful, even though half-time is a deformed cripple. He's the strongest link here. Juliette Binoche is, as usual, very convincing and sweet. She adds a lot to her excellent play and the love story plot with that Sikh officer. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all big and very strong. And then there is a desert of Egypt, then there are deep, cloudless air, green vegetables of Italy. Nature is here, even when people die, bombs roar, land mines explode. War is also here. It is clear, terrible and bloody. Then there are corpses, horrible vultures, then naked bodies, adultery and all. I do not know what to say. So much of the wonderful actors' work, so much realism, so much brutality that brings the war. It's not a movie for recreation. It makes you think.
