What a tribute to his father! He began to strive to learn more about a man he knew little about, and by the end of the journey I believe Nathaniel Kahn is happy with what he has learned and felt personally. The film is five years in the making and a quarter of a century after his death, Louis I. Kahn's total dedication to his work. Consistently strong desire to build buildings that are significant to mankind and timeless to the whole world, with insight into his life, is proudly portrayed by his son Nathaniel in the documentary "My Architect: A Boy's Journey". <br /> <br /> The movie is by no means an anthology of Louis's work. There are many books and archives that contain records of Louis Kahn's projects and buildings. This documentary works like a mystery, writer-director and co-producer Nathaniel Kahn was looking for the man he knew briefly as his father. <br /> <br /> The movie is in chapters. In "West-West" we are at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. This is a particular view. Kahn's integral concept of building and environment, optimizing light for scientists at work is wonderful. From a former colleague who worked with Lou for 35 years ago, we hear of his close attention to detail, including how rambunctious he could be - certainly did not cut out words in his criticism. A memorable scene is when the camera has pulled back wide and we see Nathaniel skating in the plaza area of ​​the Salk Institute - a tiny figure, like a child happily playing in the dad's hands. <br /> <br /> The "Immigrant" segment brought us to meet Anne Tyng, the architect who worked with Lou, and to carry him a daughter, Alex. Now at 80, Tyng's return with Nathaniel's film staff was after the Bath House project at Trenton, New Jersey, nostalgic. In "Go to the Sea," we see the Barge for the American Windsimony Orchestra - all of steel, and meet Robert Boudreau, who was surprised by Nathaniel when he finally told him he was Lou's son. Boudreau was touched, said he saw Nathaniel when he was six, with his mother (Harriet Pattison), and he didn't want to tell anyone that Lou had a son. It was a "suffocating" emotional moment of reunion. <br /> <br /> Like his father, The Nomad, Nathaniel traveled to Jerusalem and learned about the Synagogue project his father started but didn't realize. He visited the lamenting wall, and when he saw his yarmulks apostate, he had the feeling that he should not be "completely" Jewish to be his father's son. We continue to sit with his two half-sisters in the "Family Matters" segment. We also hear that he talked to his mother in Maine, and to talk to previous office staff at his father's office, teach us how his father worked intensively and practically lived there, on the floor on the office floor, weekends and all slept on a mat. <br /> <br /> "The end of the journey" brought us to Ahmedabad, India, to the Indian Institute of Management. Talk to architect B.V. Doshe was a revelation. In the end, Nathaniel found a very lively Louis Kahn, his father - his spirits live in him. This documentary is a shredder for me. I was teary-eyed most of the time - it was very enjoyable and was in the awe of the man, the architect and his son, and the women in his life besides his famous works and buildings. Louis I. Kahn wanted to give love to the 'whole world', juggling and three families (you can say he has three women in his life to keep his inspiration). If Shamsul Wares noticed the architect in the Bangladesh Complex capital (completed 9 years after Lou's death) so strikingly: Louis Kahn gave the people of Bangladesh a lot, spent time in Bangladesh, understanding the culture of the place and people - as well as giving their democracy through what he has achieved, and for such a dedicated man, usually the people close to him, he often overlooked to see. The price seems to be big, with inevitable personal sacrifices. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of King Vidor's "The Fountainhead" 1949 (good dramatic story in B / W with music by Max Steiner), based on Ayn Rand's novel, along with Gary Cooper as the uncompromising architect who stands by his own ideals, and Patricia Neal as the parallel supportive woman in his life. <br /> <br />
