I found this move beautiful, pleasant and exciting. Initially, the local sites in the film, filmed here in Buffalo, inspired me. Later I lost myself in the power of the movie. How do you pay a gift from God? The ability of characters to rise above their basic nature and respond to the touch of God warmed my heart. The whole audience finished at the end of the film. I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for humanity. What more can any movie do? Hollywood, I hope you pay attention. America likes positive, optimistic movies.
