Read a biography of the late George C. Scott and you'll discover why he was so talented. He was asked by an interviewer what was her secret when he made every character he played himself. Scott replied, he had in him a burning fire that drove him. In one of his last interviewers, he unfortunately revealed that he had lost the ride. This was not the case when he was in the movie, The Hospital. In this presentation he plays talented doctor Bock, medical director of one of the best hospitals in the country. However, life has had some paralyzing problems, such as destroying his wife, alienating both his promising children and worse from everyone, believing he is physically impotent. At this point, he now becomes confident, morose and often fantasizes different ways of committing suicide. To add his growing list of personal barriers, his hospital is under siege by students and neighborhood protesters, incompetent doctors like Dr. Welbeck (Richard Dysart) and a mysterious MD. killing both patients and doctors because he believes he is "the wrath of the lamb." (Barnard Hughes). Few choices are left to Bock. One is promising Doctor Brubaker (Robert Walden), with whom he trusts, saying, "If there was an oven here, I would take my head in it." The second is a nice young woman, Barbara, who is attracted to Bock because he acts like a wounded bear. Paddy Chayefsky wrote the screenplay and Arthur Hiller did a very good job of directing this dramatic, interesting, dark story, but a vehicle was lit by the fire of George C. Scott. ****
