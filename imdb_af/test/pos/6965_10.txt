Sixth (and last) movie in the box. Well, I seem to have saved the best one for the last. Ghoulies IV. I originally did a review for this back in February, but I decided to do a new one. The Ghoulies range is pretty great. I know there are people they don't like, and that's good. It seems to be my favorite one in the series. Yes, I know the real Ghoulies do not appear and are being replaced by 2 guys in costumes, one of them being Tony Cox of Bad Santa. Now, on the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is centered around Jonathan Graves, the main character of the first movie, again played by Peter Liapis. He is now a policeman for the LAPD and she has passed the occult behind him. During the first part of the movie we meet Alexandra (Played by the very hot Stacie Randall) who communicates with a demon of the other Faust, who is the dark side of Jonathan. Faust asks Alexandra for a red jewel and something goes wrong, so the Ghoulies leave outside. <br /> <br /> I think Jim Wynorski did a good job with directing. And the music by Chuck Cirino is also funny. (SPOILER AHEAD) At the end of this movie, the Ghoulies say there will be a Ghoulies IV, Part 2, or Ghoulies V. I still hope the sequel is made and I especially hope Jim Wynorski returns to direct. I agree with GimboTheGhoulies on that.
