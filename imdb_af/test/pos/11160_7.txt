It's not hard to imagine the main problem for a scriptwriter who wants 18 equally written characters with about the same amount of screen time in a movie that lasts about 90 minutes. It is almost impossible not to fall back on stereotypes and that is also what author director Ralf Westhoff is doing here. Very few of the characters can be recognized as people you and I know in real life, many of them are only characterized by two or three characteristics and remain vague. I'm aware, but still think "Shopping" is successful, that it only reaches what it wants. It's a movie with a very well written dialogue, extremely good acting and a movie that makes me run very hard. I don't think this movie wants to make a profound analysis of loneliness in our modern society, or that it wants to be moral commentary on speed dating. It's a movie about something that exists and people and their motivation to use it. Funny and entertaining.
