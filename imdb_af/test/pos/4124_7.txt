First, I'm a big Buddy Holly fan. I grew up and knew who he was, and I knew everything about that fatal plane ride that quenched such incredibly bright flames. But I never really listened to his music. I heard a lot, but not until I sat down with the intention of getting something out of it, I really came to see the real Buddy Holly. And let me tell you that my world is different now because of him. <br /> <br /> Because of this worship for such an amazing man, I bought The Buddy Holly Story without seeing it before. I tore my views of this movie. Maybe that's because Buddy feels so alive that I couldn't see Gary Busey in this role. I will admit he did a good job, but his singing sounded so forced. It seemed to me that he knew he didn't look like Buddy and therefore used too much energy to try and make a similar sound. In some parts of the film he succeeded. But others. Ouch. <br /> <br /> The movie has been playing for a few years, but I feel that the depiction of this time span could be handled much better. I had a difficult time distinguishing at what point in Buddy's life certain events happened. I also had a serious problem with some of the historical inaccuracies. I think the worst was the portrayal of the Cricket. I understand how their real names could not be used, and how to simplify it was just two of them in the movie. And that was a good thing. Because the background song of the movie was worthy, and I don't like the way they are portrayed as a hindrance to Buddy's career. Something else that really made no difference to the movie, but irritated me, was Gary Busey's teeth. They carried me out! Buddy Holly had much better teeth. I don't know why I saw it. But I did it. <br /> <br /> I'll finish this review on what I was the best part of the movie: Buddy's last show. His final call to Maria, the Big Bopper's performance, brings him and Richie Valens to the stage, followed by the quiet frame that ends. It even scared me, and I feel it shows the audience effectively how Buddy Holly was at one moment so lively and energetic and that his flame sniffed into the eye of the eye. It was a beautiful way to portray this terrible tragedy I think. <br /> <br /> Good movie, despite obvious problems. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Some obvious flaws can use a little bit of work ... but not bad.
