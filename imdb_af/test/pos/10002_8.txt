I saw this movie in a sneak preview, and it's great. The cinematography is extremely creative, the acting is good, and the story is fantastic. If this movie isn't going well, it won't be because it doesn't deserve. Before this movie I didn't realize how charming Shia Lebouf could be. He does a wonderful, independent work as the head. There is something incredibly nice about him, and it makes the movie even better. The other actors are also doing a good job, and the movie contains moments of very high voltage, more than one of a movie about golf can expect. Sports movies are a dime a dozen, but this one stands out. <br /> <br /> This is one I would recommend to anyone.
