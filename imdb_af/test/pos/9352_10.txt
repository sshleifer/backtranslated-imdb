What a nice movie! Unfortunately, in 1947, the film could not follow the book it was adapted to, but the homosexual murder would have been too hot to handle in that era. <br /> <br /> I thought everything was great, the screenplay, direction, brilliant black and white cinematography, music and film noir atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I understand that in 1947 the film could not portray racism against blacks or prejudice against homosexuals. (Robert Young's version of prejudice against his grandfather who was Irish and who endured this racism 100 years ago was quite lame, but the times dictated that the film prevented further investigation into racism.) <br /> <br /> I have one observation and one question to ask the viewer: 1. Did you notice that Robert Young did not strive for his gun when he shot and killed Robert Ryan in the dark and Young shot of a top big window in the dark without aiming? 2. If Robert Young's grandfather was murdered 100 years ago in 1847 (the film was made in 1947) and Young was 40 years old, the timeline would not be logical. If the grandfather were killed 50 years ago, the time frame would be realistic.
