I accidentally saw the movie by accident when they showed it on TV and I was too late. I really listened out there. It is truly incredible; from the place (as isolated as it is possible to be on this planet; it looked like the abyss like ET in the pool of the council), through the interesting characters (Keith David is especially good at reactionary Childs - " What if we're wrong about him? "-" Then we're wrong. ") And the effects (more yucky than Alien). <br /> <br /> But the real tension and fear in the movie has nothing to do with the effects. These are the people you are afraid of; knowing that one of them may be - or perhaps not - "all they seem to be". It certainly had the feeling of "who's going there?". <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is wonderful; it really plays the isolation, fear and seriousness of the situation. <br /> <br /> Finally, the epilogue scene really cuts. Even more than the "But who again do?" punchline from Bladerunner. Enough said.
