I watched SEA OF DUST at the Rhode Island Horror Film Festival in Providence. It was the festival's premier movie and won the best picture from a few hundred entries. The director and some of the stars answered questions after the show. One star, Suzy Lorraine, was even warmer in person than in the movie, and she was a catch-up in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is independent, but it has a lot of cinematic feel to it. It even has an original classic music music score. <br /> <br /> I'm a Savini fan and he's the star curtain here, in black hat, he's more of an evil force than a real person I think. He sucks the souls from people and uses them as soldiers in a twisted attempt to establish his version of the Kingdom of God on Earth. In his view, Christ dealt with everything and Savini plans to make everyone suffer. <br /> <br /> The key story line that interests you is about a young doctor, Stefan, who is sent to investigate the strange events of Savini. caused in an isolated town. He puts an aristocratic chick on the road, but her SOB father tells him to get lost. Then he meets a strange possession, but in love land girl. I think she falls in love with him, but she also tries to kill him, just like some hot women in the movie. <br /> <br /> I found the screens shot in the woods for the most beautiful and striking, with strangers along the way (the evil twin girls scared hell out of me). <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot on it, too much to list. There is a lot of blood, torture and gore. Hot chicks lick blood from guys' fingers. A dreaded girl's head explodes. It was unexpected. Kele slits. Some brutal stabbings. <br /> <br /> Sometimes they play it to laugh, a little fun on the whole evil black forest genre. If you're a fan of Hammer movies and Ingrid Pitt, it's fascinating to see her in this movie. She left one of the slides by crossing a cross in his skull. Excellent. The man who played "Multiple Miggs" is in an ax battle. <br /> <br /> The movie is surreal and in the end I'm not sure if the events happened or if they were in. Stefan's head because of his rejection by his fiancee. He goes back in revenge and the scene is brutal. <br /> <br /> The director also talked about the theme of religion being abused to return wars and murders. I can see that Savini's view of religion was certain. <br /> <br /> It was a weird exceptional movie with stars like Savini and Pitt, a very good supporting role, including hot babies, action, and all the time you're wondering what's going on and what goes on happen. <br /> <br /> It earns ten stars because it's an excellent independent film attempt, I don't think it was a low budget, but it had to be much less than a big studio budget, and yet they managed to do something really attractive, unique and mind-made.
