It's a great movie for the tough Chucky fans. Okay, I'm sure it's not as good as the Child's Play movie, but it can be really funny and fun, Chucky's lips are hilarious. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Not one doll, but two, which double the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the piece really well and definitely the best death of the movie moved. <br /> <br /> If you saw the Child's Play movies, it would be a worthy movie on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the children's movies, it will be a new beginning. Of course, you won't have an idea of ​​how Chucky came in its current state (because I'm not telling you), but you'll find out why Chucky is very popular. <br /> <br /> Overall a very enjoyable movie.
