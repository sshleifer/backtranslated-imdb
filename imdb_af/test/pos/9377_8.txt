As a rule, there is little more resistance than Hollywood's efforts to be courageous. Gently mix with gravity, "message movies" complain aloud to the daring to face big problems. CROSSFIRE is not completely free from this infection; It includes a sermon on the nature of senseless hatred that embarrasses, and takes a level of naive in the audience who is depressed to consider. As late as 1947 it was a big problem for a movie to announce that anti-Semitism existed and that it was bad. (It was unthinkable, of course, that Hollywood would address the real subject of the movie-based book. His victim was a homosexual.) Yet, thanks to good writing and excellent acting, CROSSFIRE remains a persuasive investigation of what we will now call a hate crime. <br /> <br /> Postwar malaise was one of the most important components of film noir, and CROSSFIRE addressed it directly. The film is in Washington, D.C., among soldiers still in uniform but inflexible, spending their days on poker and bar-crawling. Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), an intelligent and friendly Jew, explains that the end of the war has created a void: all the energy hated and the enemy is fighting is now unfocused and bottled. Samuels meets three soldiers in a bar: the sensitive Mitchell, who is close to a nervous breakdown, the weak-willed Floyd Bowers and Montgomery, a long-remaining bully, who is a young Tennessee soldier mountain billy ruined. The three soldiers come to Samuels' apartment, where the drunken Monty is increasingly abusive and calls his host "Jewish son". Samuels is killed, and Mitchell disappears, making him the main suspect for the murder. <br /> <br /> The kidnapping of the crime is detective Finlay (Robert Young), dry and by-book, and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows that Mitchell is unable is to murder. Among the pieces of the puzzle are Ginny (Gloria Grahame), a nightclub hostess who met Mitchell and gave him an apartment key, and Floyd (Steve Brodie), who witnessed the crime hole in a sly room was scared. Although there is no true "whodunit" tension, the story continues and the trap laid for the killer is extremely clever. <br /> <br /> The strong noir atmosphere saves the film of didactic or holy feelings. The cinematography is a striking shadow game, with inky dark and hard lights, rooms often illuminated by a single lamp that is filtered by cigarette smoke. World fatigue is as pervasive as noir relief. "Nothing interests me," Finlay says quietly; "To nothing," is Ginny's toast in the nightclub. Gloria Grahame, the paragon of noir femininity, almost steals the film with her two scenes. Platinum blonde, colored and biting, she is the peculiar B-girl, poisoned by the "smelly gin mill" where she works ("for the laugh," she says bitterly), her sweet face, when Mitchell tells her she reminds him his wife. From now on, a capricious friendship shoots through her defensive shell, as she dances with Mitchell on a deserted courtyard, offering him spaghetti at her apartment. When he goes there, he meets a dirty, crumpled man (Paul Kelly), who apparently rinses Ginny, and whose conversation is a dense layer of lies and false confessions. Gloria blows Mitchell's good girl's wife off the screen in a scene where she is asked to give Mitchell an alibi. Slender and weak in her bathrobe, with her fiery lash, let's see how often Ginny is insulted and discharged as a tramp. <br /> <br /> Robert Young is a non-writing actor, and he does not stand a chance against Mitchum's charisma, but he does a good job of keeping his pipe brand, delivering the movie's serious message, this side of turmoil. Meanwhile, Mitchum gets a cool dialogue, but not nearly enough to do; Yet, even if he does nothing but sleeps in a corner, you cannot take his eyes away from him. The third Robert, Ryan, creates a full-blown and terrifying portrait of an ignorant, unstable shit; we see his terrible genius, his bully, his resentment of anyone with benefits, she "Am I right or am I right?" self-fought; how easy he saves labels on people and what satisfaction he gets to despise them. <br /> <br /> CROSSFIRE's message now looks cautious and dated, but not as much as the same year's A GENTLEMAN AGREEMENT. Finlay's speech on bigotry cops coming back for a hundred years for a case of white victims, reminding us that Irish Catholics were once prosecuted; Next it could be people from Tennessee, he says, or men wearing striped neckties. Or maybe blacks, or Japanese, or homosexuals, or communists? The writing seems scary to mention any real contemporary problems. It relieves his message by making the Jewish victim holy, as if his innocence was not sufficient; and it is cautious to free the army, with a superior official declaring the army ashamed of men like Montgomery, and stressing that Samuels served honestly in the war. Yet, immediately after World War II, an American who was fortunate in the Nazi army depicted, and the film's basic premise remains valid. If Monty was alive today, he would have gone out on September 12, 2001 and hit a Sikh.
