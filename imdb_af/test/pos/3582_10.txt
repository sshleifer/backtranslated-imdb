The whole series, not just the blue planet, is nothing but wonderful. The best nature range we have ever seen. The episode at the depths is like traveling to outer space! We watched it with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us couldn't move away. We read a negative comment about this and couldn't believe it. There is so much new information we never learned in school. It is also the best view we have seen of any television or movie in the delicate balance of our earth's ecosystem. The amount of time and effort these shots have captured is very clear when you look at this series. <br /> <br /> Must see everyone.
