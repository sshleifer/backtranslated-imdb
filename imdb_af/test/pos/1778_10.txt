A grossly simple story of murder and death penalty by the state. So painfully slow and accurate in describing the death penalty (from preparing the gallows to the victim who is in his own pants before he dies) has the power to change your mind about death penalty. The whole Decalog came from this story: the Decalog scriptwriter was the powerless lawyer who tried unsuccessfully to defend and then consolidated the accused.
