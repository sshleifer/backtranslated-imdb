I think it's a fantastic movie ... I watched it constantly from the time I was 4 about the time I was 8. But look, it caused many nightmares. I especially got them because of the guy who was always like "the other world" and his friends. I'm 12, and I still get nightmares about this. I can't fall asleep now because I think about it. I love this movie, but it's so scary! I definitely love this movie although I have very good memories from it. Kate is very good at acting in this movie. Amazingly, I never realized it was her! I also think the graphics were very high quality, as opposed to what some people think
