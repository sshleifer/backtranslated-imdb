Yes, it's one of the better television movies and I don't expect Joe Sargent any less. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a big fan of The Carpenters, I have sung all their material in primary school and middle school choir, and I had to do a lot of Karen's solo material. I thought she was one of the most beautiful pop singers of the 70's - and being a kid / teenager singing and learning these songs - the one thing I look forward to meeting this woman. I never came, she died three weeks before that would happen. And yes, it affected me because I didn't know anything about anorexia - and couldn't quite understand what happened. <br /> <br /> When this TV movie was made, I understood quite a bit. Perhaps not everything in Karen and Richard's life is open to television, but when opening up the parts shown, I have to understand much of the music industry of that time. What upset me is that I "write" from that time and see "now". No one has learned a darned thing, though it was a very insightful and sincere look at a family's music industry problems. <br /> <br /> These movies are not made fun, they are ready to open a door and show us something. Here was a wonderful woman who got caught up in the idea that her talent was based on weight. She was good. Didn't know. She got mixed messages about her weight from the brother she loved, the parents she loved and the music industry that looked more like / cared for about her than the talent. At the start of MTV, it got worse. With 'American Idol' it is like a puss festering in an English accent. <br /> <br /> A wonderful TV movie, I'm sure somebody can give it a Bachelor of Arts later, but either, lots of lessons to be learned and the absence of another wonderful talent.
