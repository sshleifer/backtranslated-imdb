I've never been obliged to write a review about anything, but seeing such bad reviews about such an innovative show has made me say something. First, people just have to come to terms with the fact that the voices differ. When you watch an episode, it never comes right. The humor is original and although yes, some jokes carry off the movie, they are delivered fresh. Some even remind Shrek - self-referring humor. Many of these jokes are aimed at teenagers or original movie fans as much as tweens and younger. Patrick Warburton and Eartha Kitt are both hilarious as they portray their roles as Kronk and Yzma and their nominations for Annie Awards are well justified. <br /> <br /> This show takes time to love, to really get into the groove "of things, so to speak. If you ignore the terrible theme song (which really doesn't have to justify as much as you display, as it is only 30 seconds from the overall product, this display is a laughable hilarious and does not lose any of the emperor's new groove spirit.
