"Best in Show" is definitely Christopher Guest's funniest and deepest movie. The characters are superbly portrayed and the connection of pet to owner adds a new level of comedy to the movie. I was a fan of Guest since Spinal Tap, but in this movie he really achieved what he did in the "mock-umentary", a genre he invented and is now perfect.
