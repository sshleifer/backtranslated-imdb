Well, so it begins to be unbelievable with a narrative of the main character (Justine played by Laura Fraser - a wonderful actress in her own right), but it will be something wonderful. It has stupid little things that you really don't find funny, but every time. There is a particularly memorable moment that sees your jaw fall to the ground, the first time you see it when Jake's male body, with Justine's female mind, tries to get used to her new anatomy. I will not spoil it for you, but the second time I saw that it was with friends; since their faces were brilliant. It makes you crazy, but laughs at the same time. I'm also a big fan of the music used. There is a beautiful little band that actually appears randomly on the street or on a road, but also some beautiful but unknown (often the best) pop songs. It has the feel of being written for an English cast by an American writer, who just annoys me a few times. Overall, this movie is hilarious. I am now a massive fan of Laura Fraser, after giving her birthday, and expect that although some of the films are little known, you will also enjoy each one of them.
