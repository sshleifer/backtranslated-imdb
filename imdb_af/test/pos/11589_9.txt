In Spain, former sailor Ramón Sampedro (Javier Bardem) is twenty-eight years of quadriplegics and fights in court for his right to practice euthanasia through an association of freedom of choice and by his friend Géne (Clara Segura). . Ramón is introduced to the lawyer who defends his case, Julia (Belén Rueda), who has a degenerative fatal disease; and met Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a lonely worker abused by men. Their relationship changes the behavior and philosophy of life of Rosa and Julia. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Chilean Alejandro Amenábar is one of the best contemporary directors. His filmography released in Brazil is composed by excellent and original films: "Abre Los Ojos", "Tesis", "The Others" and "Mar Adentro". Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain in the current days. Their association produced this sensitive drama about a very polemic theme, the right to commit euthanasia. This drama is never corny or depressed, as the script uses humor as a relief valve in the most dramatic situations. The cast of the cast is perfect, with characters defending different positions in relation to this unpleasant theme. The dialogues and lines are very solid and intelligent. I noticed in IMDb plot outline that this movie is based on the real story of Ramón Sampedro. Unfortunately, the movie or the DVD does not provide this important information. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Mar Adentro" ("See Inside")
