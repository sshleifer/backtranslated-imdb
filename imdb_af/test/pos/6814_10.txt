I stumbled across this movie while the channel was surfing and blown away. It was broadcast on a lesser known short film program here in Australia. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I was so impressed with a movie, especially one so short. <br /> <br /> The power of the story, the quality of the acting and the beautiful cinematography ... wow. If available, it would make a very valuable addition to my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> I'm undoubtedly impressed, and I'll look forward to Joshua Leonards' next film. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary experience 10/10
