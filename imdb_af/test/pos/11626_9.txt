Sigrid Thornton (Sea Change) is apparently born to fill the role of Cato's Philadelphia Gordon, in this story often compared to Margaret Mitchell's American Civil War classic Gone With the Wind. Waters (Heaven Tonight) is probably also his best role as her larrakin love affair, and the two play a wonderful Australian role in this, probably the best known and best loved Australian miniseries. It is <br /> <br /> a great production, but it doesn't try to see it all at once, and it must be remembered as a wonderful portrayal of life in the pre-Federation Australia. Rating: 8/10
