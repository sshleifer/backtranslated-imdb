Gilmore Girls is my favorite TV show of all time. they only broadcast the first 2 seasons in India, but I watched the rest on DVD or read it online. It is very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist does not stick around her mother's back, but has an open relationship with her. The chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel playing Lorelai and her daughter Rory is really good. all the plays are excellent and the characters, although extremely strange, are still credible. The residents of the hollow of hollow show all the amusing bizarre life of the small town, which is contrary to the endless quirk and social norms that make up the high society life of Lorelai's parents. On the one hand there are dance and fire lights while you have cotillions, DAR events and cocktail parties on hand. all the characteristics develop a lot and there is a happy ending for more or less everyone. There are dramatic elements, but also humorous humor. Rory's boyfriends are incredibly hot like her friend Lane's. basically it is a cool, funny, very satisfying show that covers all aspects of life and gives you a sense of - if you work hard and wait patiently, you will get what you want, even if it is not what you did not mean.
