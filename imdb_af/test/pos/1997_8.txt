I actually watched the movie several times. And what I want to say about this is the only thing that made this movie high-ranking, was the Burak Altay's incredible performance, absolutely nothing else. Not even that stupid model called Deniz Akkaya and some of these popular names at times in the movie. Burak is definitely very talented. I saw a couple of jobs that he made and went through. Although it's kind of horror movie, he does really good work in comedy movies and also in dramas. I bet most of you, everyone has seen Asmali Konak the movie and TV series. These two are going to be an example. All I'm going to say is you better look out for the new works coming out of Burak, then you'll see. Keep the good work bro, lots of love.
