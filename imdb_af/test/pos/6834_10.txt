This is a very good film in the pulp-fiction genre with a lot of film noir being thrown in. Actually one of Emma Thompson's best shows to date. This movie has everything, it's well written, well directed, beautiful movies and has some good performances. I don't know why it didn't catch it. It's spectacular!
