Crossfire (1947) <br /> <br /> Great message, great symbolism, very good movie <br /> <br /> It's all hard to go wrong with Robert Mitchum, Robert Young and Robert Ryan all together three male leads, and together with director Edward Dmytryk together a complicated murder and detective coincidence. That's enough reason to look it once and even twice. <br /> <br /> You might need a second look to fully capture the plot as it is explained (too much) or show back flash (too much) because it's a bit complicated without good reason . But it makes sense in general, and we see early (probably too early) who the culprit is, and even why. <br /> <br /> Apart from the drama, well done in typical noir lighting and filled with those short quips that make post-war movies dramatic, there's the social message, the anti-anti-Semitic point of all. It is only once or twice a sermon, and it is such a clear point to show that it is being made acceptable and waiting for the plot and the dramatic play to take the lead. What they do, especially Young, who is a brilliant laconic and patient detective, and Ryan, in a credible and rough way (Ryan is good at it, his typing is reasonable). Mitchum mostly plays a watered-down version of what he is known for, and the fourth known acting force, Gloria Grahame, is a large, short, presence, even if it is a little unavailable. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is dominated by the sequence of events and the message that both comes in handy, it's really easy to just look at the lighting, camera work and acting, including the classic battle scene covering the first few seconds of the movie, all with shadows. <br /> <br /> The archetypes of soldiers offered are very deliberate, and that might be something that people were well-known at the time and can relate so much to the anti-Semitism thread. The shocked soldier was helpless (but still intrinsically capable), the modest youngster without trust (but also capable) and the tired but outward veteran all there. And of course, the evil, violent soldier who is also a product of war. This last is also a responsibility of society - even the army is all out to make good the injustices here, not just because they are criminal, but because of the wear and tear of a long terrible war. <br /> <br /> Then, more than now, the audience can really get it, but it's there to appreciate.
