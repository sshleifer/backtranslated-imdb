All in all, an excellent movie of that time and source (from Warner Brothers, as it was in craftsmanship and style just before World War II), provided you don't take it seriously. The film really does not claim to be historically accurate, and is certainly no more or less accurate or credible than to say, JFK. (However, this may be more honest, as it essentially recognizes that it should not be considered as very fact-based, but more of a stylish semi-heroic depiction.) It is noteworthy that Time's audiences were no longer naive the story we are today; The NY Times review conceded that the public would reject the factual inaccuracies rinsed by the film, "described Custer's biographical account as" fanciful "and pointed out that Custer's presentation of motivation the final events were in conflict with several historical accounts, they could really have gone overboard to build up Custer, but they succeeded in looking after him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent man, but appropriately determined, principles and inspirational. <br /> <br /> Flynn and DeHavilland, who are doing their 7th movie in 7 years (and their last) together, are so comfortable together, and playing each other so easily at the moment that it's not too difficult to explore how thin their court history is written here, with a first-time mating, it will be hard to imagine what Elizabeth really could do for Custer, but these two work, the movie also misses their director from their previous seven movies said Am (the strongly underrated Michael Curtiz), but given that he worked with them on the previous year's similar theme Santa Fe trail, it is understandable if he decided to end it. a. (They are all with Captain Blood and The Charge of the Light Brigade - both great - so we can't really blame them for having a hard time keeping it fresh.) <br /> <br /> Raoul Walsh, the director here, is definitely more comfortable with the action series - which are outstanding - and all outside. The indoor screens are a little more uneven, but the studios of the studio manage to compensate for it well. Just like Warner Bros' outstanding role of "ordinary suspects" and new faces (Greenstreet, Gene Lockhart, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, etc.). I would have been better off if Kennedy's character was a little less standard (I usually like his job), but here it looks as if he is beating about the same notes in every scene. the part could have been better written - and I suspect they might not have been sure of what he could handle because he was only one year in movies. (Walsh probably adopted him after collaborating with High Sierra.) <br /> Several highlights include the portrayal (probably imagined) of the origin of "Garryowen" as the cavalry theme. The last half hour is particularly excellent, especially with the separation of the clues following the end of their screen partnership, followed by the final games. A thoroughly exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
