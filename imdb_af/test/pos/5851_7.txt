Rating: 7 out of 10. Targeted by Barbet Schroeder. If you like Hitchcock's "Rope", you'll love this movie. Murder by numbers stars Sandra Bullock as psychologically upset yet brilliant police detective Cassie Mayweather. Her partner is Sam Kennedy, a non-discriminating detective played by Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Teenage killers are high school students Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). This young psychotherapy is proving their superiority by committing and killing the perfect murder, but the closeness of catching is exciting and exciting for at least one of the killers. <br /> <br /> The supporting characters include a police chief, an assistant district attorney, and the high school consultant that killers are killing. The movie reminds me of several Hitchcock movies that crossed the "Law and Order" TV show. We see a fair piece of police work and it is very interesting to see what clues the detectives are following and what they do not do. <br /> <br /> The other plot in the movie relates to Cassie Mayweather's past and locked-in band. Most viewers have seen this aspect of the movie unnecessarily and slowly, but I have found it to be the most interesting part of the story. <br /> <br /> "Murder by Numbers" is a nicely crafted movie if you're looking for safe, or should I say a dangerous, murderous story? For more excitement and excitement, try `Se7en 'or Hitchcock's` Dial M for Murder'.
