Flash Gordon was a first class series. I know there were a few goofs, but I didn't look for the errors. Buster Crabbe is Flash Gordon. He was not a trained actor, but he gave a very good, convincing performance. Jean Rogers is beautiful and at age 20. In my opinion, you have found a good job. Charles Middleton as emperor Ming, is excellent. He was in many other films, very versatile, he could sing and dance. In addition, his portrayal of "Ming The Merciless" in all three Flash Gordon series. The rest of the cast also did a very good job. Well, boys and girls, get some popcorn, come back and enjoy.
