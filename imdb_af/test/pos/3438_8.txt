- It has Carla Gugino * Yay * and a crappy end * Boo * <br /> <br /> - "Jaded" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman coming to town, trying her past escape. Whiles there she met two lesbians and after a few drinks the two decided to have fun. But one of the girls takes things a little too far and rapes her while the second girl holds her. She was discovered on the beach where the incident happened the next day and was taken to a hospital. Then we spend the rest of the movie and watch her attempt to bring down the two girls while learning new information about who she is and where she came from and a little bit about her past. <br /> <br /> - Director and co-author Caryn Krooth does an excellent job with this movie in view of his low budget. It's handmade and sometimes looks like 16mm, but it fits the movie as the story requires a hard look. The actors all do well with what is given to them and there is really nothing to complain about. The striking feature in the movie is of course Carla Gugino who gives it all in this movie. She is actually more naked in this movie than she is in "Sin City". Christopher McDonald is also in the movie, but his character is really so senseless, but he's nice to watch. I didn't pay much attention to the music, as it didn't really draw attention to itself, but it did the job with what it did. The movie is R rated and it is for a very good reason. It is sometimes very sexual and very graphic. It's essentially soft core boundaries, but the sex zones are needed for the movie, so it doesn't feel like it's just there for the sake of it. Although there is one infinite scene where we see Chris McDonald turn it on, it was a bit senseless, but it's not really a problem I think. The only mistake with the movie is that we don't get the court hearing, after all we go to in the movie. It's like having sex and not having an orgasm or something <br /> <br /> It is a pity that talented Caryn Krooth has never made a feature film. It is a highly gifted woman who can do very well with a very small budget. I really hope she'll be back in the game soon because she's a great director. Jaded is not a masterpiece of an erotic theater. Instead, it's a pleasant movie that shows a good director in the making. <br /> <br /> - Keep the kids and close the curtains, you don't want people to think you're watching porn watching this movie.
