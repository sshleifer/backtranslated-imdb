I saw The Cure when I was a child and I loved it then. Now, years later, I almost accidentally got a copy and looked at it again. If you're a kid, you don't really have the ability to get things for yourself that you want, it's usually a privilege of your parents - but when I watch it again, I felt sorry I didn't done to get a copy not from this movie, and therefore almost forgot about it until today. <br /> <br /> It's really a beautiful movie. It tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a hard-hardened, clumsy child - who takes his clues from his horrible, abusive mother - and his neighbor, a slightly younger boy with AIDS. <br /> <br /> Right, you say. Another of the "genes". A tear-maker. A bucket movie. A morality tail. Yes, I know, I hate it too. Only this one is not. This is one of the few movies among the many I've seen, which makes a very rare trick: it carries a really sad story (and, yes, a morality story), but without a single moment that forced it or in any other way "hollywoody". It shows a real relationship between two REAL boys, who respond as REAL kids. And through the interaction, the benevolent, loving character of the older son, Eric, begins to shine through his "tough man" person, as he is a great brother-care for Dexter, his HIV-positive younger neighbor. Together they start with an adventure to find a cure - which looks like Erik, just around the corner - so all this stupid Aids thing goes away and they can be friends forever. <br /> <br /> In addition, the production is. But of course, what really carries this movie is the representations of the two leaders - Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello. Especially stunning, Mazzello gives a sense of weakness needed for a sick boy, but at the same time he manages to make Dexter a truly energetic and determined character. He shines on the scene where the boys confront Pony: his impulse to protect his older friend, lures him out, drives him to say what he says - and only then is the horror on his face portrayed as he realizes that what he is said itself is true: his blood is poison ... Renfro also has his moments, especially the screens with his mother. He perfectly portrays how this macho-street child is left completely frozen and numb with his battered, stormy mother, and can't get a word to contradict her because she forbids his relationship with the sick boy from her fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also gives a memorable performance as Dexter's mother, who eventually, in a sense, also becomes a mother figure to Erik. <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie when I was back in America, and loved it - not at all a given about movies of this kind. But the behavior of the children in this movie was so real, I could easily relate to them. Ironically, the teacher who showed us this movie (a wonderful woman, I am still in contact with her) is in trouble because some older parents complained that they had the scene when the two boys went to a Playboy. look. ... Pathetic. Seriously, Americans will ever come across this ridiculous phobia, I don't know. There was a scarcely distinctive shot of a playboy cover in the film and so it is not shown in schools ... how sad. Children should see this movie. It is more inspiring and educational than all the "official" after-school specialists who are compiled. <br /> <br /> And another thing. I know I'm walking, but ... The score. It's wonderful. I am a musician, and as such I know Dave Grusin from his records: he is a well-known Jazz pianist and record producer. Until this film, I really didn't know that he also had movies, although when I checked in later, I found out that I had unconsciously watched several movies he worked on. Really a wonderful job there. <br /> <br /> All in all, a solid Ten. I would recommend this movie to anyone. And I will definitely see it with my younger brothers and sisters - they can watch such a movie under all the standard special effects hysteria they usually see.
