This movie was an excellent performance, excellently targeted and overall had an excellent story. Ive got real life experience with a boy like 'Radio'. At the soccer program in my town, every year we have a mentally challenged boy, exercise, travel and enjoy the soccer team. This movie is really true and I can identify it 100%. A boy like 'Radio' should just feel that they belong to something; They must feel that their lives are worth living. That's how 'Radio' feels and that's why that type of program is set up at my high school. This is a very touching movie that I kept being brought to the big screen. My dad and I loved it and I will always remember it because I'm a movie that tells a resounding story of the goodness and kindness of man!
