<br /> <br /> It's common knowledge and has been said before: Nobody can ever play Scarlett and Rhett like Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley Kilmer (no longer Kilmer divorced from ex-husband Val Kilmer) plays her own Scarlett and although it is a successor and not a repeat (God-forbid !!!) she cannot yet rise. voice sounds several times, she has brown eyes. [Scarlett in both novels has green eyes and even Vivien Leigh's eyes were green] and her vocal power wasn't on the job either. Scarlett is a Southern Belle, so she has an incredible talent for flirting (as she did in SCARLETT's novel and GWTW of course) and being a good flirt like Scarlett will probably have a higher voice Vivien Leigh. <br /> <br /> I suppose I compare Kilmer to Leigh a little too much, but if someone has a role to play as much as Leigh did to Scarlett, you simply can't help criticizing any new Scarletts new no. Timothy Dalton didn't have any accent because of the fact that both Margaret Mitchell's Rhett and Gable in the fi I had nothing. His acting has never been discernible (except perhaps his portrayal of the evil, royal king Philip of France in the LINE IN WINTER) and he gives little or no freshness or vitality to his Rhett. <br /> <br /> Standouts in the movie are especially Tina Kellagher (a born actress with much authenticity in her liberation) as the tragic victim Mary Boyle. And then of course there is Sean Bean as the cold, calculation and not to mention, almost demonic evil Lord Fenton, Mary's nemesis and Scarlett's ultimate offender. One thing I couldn't forgive for the writer was the fact that Scarlett was raped in this movie (a fact that never happened in the novel; Lord Fenton is cold and rude among Irish in the book, but he is nowhere so heartless Like his screen counterpart Another omission of the novel, but read for the movie, is the character of Belle Watling, who was most terribly played by Ann-Margret in a cameo role that we could all have lived without seeing how the book ran such a Bestseller without needing any assistance from Ms. Watling. <br /> <br /> For a film in itself, SCARLETT is a very good one, but not quite in the top of a place in terms of CLOSED WITH THE WIND continued Another actress was very important to Scarlett as well as Rhett. <br /> <br />
