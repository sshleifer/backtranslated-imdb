If you're looking for the Twins Effect, you're looking for a pure Hong Kong movie experience, you'll be disappointed. This is not to say that it is bad, but it is NOT a traditional Hong Kong action movie running in a similar action to Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. It's resolutely stupid and young, so if you want a good little Hong Kong action, watch a John Woo or Yuen Woo Ping movie. This movie is very lax for his folly and I thought the first thing I had to do was explain what you were doing, as many of the purists were disappointed. <br /> <br /> For non-purists and those with more forgiveness, Twins Effect is a wonderful stupid kung-fu comedy. I love it a lot for a variety of reasons, especially the wonderful female leaders who spark one another in a thoroughly entertaining comedy double action. I believe this is the first movie of the type in which they have been, but they jump, kick and fly like seasoned benefits. <br /> <br /> The strikingly ridiculous plot is handled with great care and attention. , and the film was very consciously written, which made a lot of the film laugh out loud. The comedy is really the most important thing here, and it's a subtle, gentle comedy that relies on words like inhuman objects flying a la Stephen Chow. It should be said that the slapstick is also fun. The sequence with the disco-dancing vampires is a total classic. <br /> <br /> The action is a mix of two genres really. It falls between the 'period drama' wire-and-sword battles (which come more towards the end) and the comedy battle style of Jackie Chan comes out with a mixture that although a little derivative at times is always exciting is to watch and occasionally throw up some really innovative encounters. <br /> <br /> All this is great, and the movie is incredibly fun throughout. In spite of this, it does have a few sticking points. For example, Twins Effect is in many ways much more westernized than kung-fu fans are probably accustomed. The inevitable comparison with the Blade series is definitely good as an example, though Twins Effect is honestly much better than Blade ever managed, especially for fighting. Personally, it was also a bit of a shame to see the excellent Anthony Wong (the hissable villain of John Woo's classic Hard Boiled) so underutilized, but the younger audience was aiming to see it unlikely or indeed from Hard Boiled or his other movies, so it's just a personal touch. <br /> <br /> If you see it with an open mind, you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did, but be sure it is a comedy, not a ball to the wall kung-fu movie not. Keep this in mind and it will be good.
