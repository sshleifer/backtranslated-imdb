From director Billy Wilder (Double Damage, The Seven Year Itch, Some Like It Hot), I can see that it is a bit of an undersigned and underrated movie, one that can be seen. This is the biographical story of Charles Augustus 'Slim' Lindbergh (James Stewart), who was the first man to cross the New York travel solo flight in 1927, crossing the Atlantic Ocean, reaching Paris, in a small cabin . The first half hour or whatever sees Lindbergh get permission to do so, and the construction of the aircraft, called "The Spirit of St. Louis", and make all the necessary preparations. Then the rest, of course, see his dangerous journey over the journey, the victory of fatigue, near fuel loss, and moments of direction, but he was successful. Also Murray Hamilton as Bud Gurney, Patricia Smith as Mirror Girl, Bartlett Robinson as Benjamin Frank Mahoney, Robert Cornthwaite as Harry Knight, Sheila Bond as Model / Dancer, Marc Connelly as Father Hussman, Arthur Space as Donald Hall, Harlan Warde as Boedecker and Dabbs Greer as Goldsborough. Apparently Lindbergh was a little younger, so Stewart was too old to play, but then you can't think of someone else who can do better. It's a witty and emotional drama, with Stewart (as always) fantastic, a good music performance by Frank Waxman, and good direction from Wilder, a good little-known jewel. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Special Effects (the only award it ever nominated). James Stewart was number 12 at The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 3 on 100 years, 100 star men, and he was number 13 on the world's largest actor. Very good!
