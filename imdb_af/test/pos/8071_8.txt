Some argue that Argentine director Esteban Sapir's La Antena is an exercise in anachronistic futility; while the silent films that Sapir's tribute was at the forefront of the theater, they were obsolete today, and La Antena is a meaningless stranger. <br /> <br /> I won't agree. Peppy. La Antena reports the conventions of the silent film with 21st century technology. This makes it the ultimate exercise in postmodern movie viewing. <br /> <br /> The movie is in the timeless "The City Without a Voice" supposedly because the citizens were speechless by Mr. TV, a dictator / media magul with his hair painted. The City looks like the first in Fritz Lang's half-stage (1927), perhaps 100 years before that film. These are all expressionistic skyscrapers, TV antennas and animated billboards. <br /> <br /> La Voz (The Voice), the only person with the gift of speech, is the citizens of the City. Her face is constantly being hooded (even when she is naked), and La Voz is forced to sing on Mr. TV's TV network. But when Mr. TV plans a plan to steal the written word also, La Voz and her eyeless son join forces with an apostate family in an effort to give the freedom of speech to the people. <br /> <br /> La Antena is nothing but pure cinema. Sapir must rely on the images to tell his story. There is sound, especially in the almost continuous score of Leo Sujatovich. It evokes the best of silent movie music, as well as the ingenious work of the movie's stargazing, such as the horn of motor horns, or the rhythmic ra-ta tatatat of gunfire. And underlying the whole movie is a familiar twist, as if shown on an antique projector. <br /> <br /> There's also a good dialogue. But instead of using intertitles, Sapir displayed the characters' words in the frame. They are bigger or smaller, fill the screen or move gently in the air, depending on what is being said. Think of a more imaginative version of the subtitles in Night Watch (2004). <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the words do not derive from the images. It's also very happy, as La Antena boasts some of the most creative and original images we've seen in the past, all captured by Cristian Cottet's beautiful black-and-white photography. There are the expressionist city-dwellers. The hairdresser and her eyeless son. There is the city's deserted sky, which resembles the ruined remains of a colossal spider. And there are the sinister dr. Y, whose jabbering mouth is displayed on a television screen on his face. <br /> <br /> La Antena has been criticized for relying too much on his images, skimming at allegorical depth. But again I will disagree. It is true that the sudden appearance of a mind control machine that is shaped like a swastika, or the eyeless son who is apparently crucified on a star of David, feels out of place, a little over the top in what else just recover a well-made fairy. <br /> <br /> But the lack of overt symbols (the two previous examples aside) work in favor of the film. It enables us to determine our own thoughts: to decide whether political significance should go out, La Antena as an allegory of fascism, the danger of capitalist monopolies and the power and responsibility of the media; or just to record the film, as a visually stunning adventure by a world simultaneously unique and familiar. <br /> <br /> The sacrifice of explicit depth in favor of unique images may seem like a compromise. But really, if a movie looks as good as it is, it's hard to care for. There is more imagination and art in every frame of La Antena than Hollywood can shake a derivative stick. Early 100-year-old movies may not make sense, but Sapir may show us what is missing in the movies today. He can tell us it's time for another artistic revolution. And he can be right.
