This movie was achieving two goals: to make a political point and tell a scary adventure story. It's often difficult to make a political point and still tell a good story (look at the highly political but rarely entertaining season of Ellen). Beyond Rangoon finds a good balance between politics and storytelling. <br /> <br /> I already knew that Aung San Suu Kyi won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and knew something about the oppressive political situation in Burma, so the political message of the movie was mostly a dramatization of what I already knew. But I thought the movie had a good job of telling Aung San Suu Kyi and the mostly faceless dictators who tried to silence her for years. The device to present an unknown institution through the eyes of a character that viewers can identify is quite common, but it is pretty good in this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the right benchmark of the movie was its entertainment value. Arquette was excellent as a young woman whose sister took her to a far unknown place to shake her out of her depression about the violent death of her husband and son. She is convincingly loose and depressed. Her sad state gives her a clear reason for her derivative stripes in the thick of a dangerous situation she doesn't understand, something she would otherwise be too intelligent to stumble upon. <br /> <br /> As soon as the dangers become so obvious that she can even see through the cloud of grief, she is trapped, with no easy escape. It puts her on a path of adventure where she needs her intelligence to survive. The authors deserve a lot of credit to make her intelligent and resourceful enough to handle many dangerous situations, while still finding an acceptable reason to be foolish in the first place to get into trouble. The direction is also strong, to keep the tension through the race to escape the powers of the dictatorship. <br /> <br /> This movie had additional impact on me and my wife due to other events of the same period. We've been preparing for a trip to India, and have heard Western tourist news reports taken by a terrorist group in India. Avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is quite another matter to escape an oppressive dictatorship. But the movie and the news shared the element to avoid danger in an unknown country. The general feature has given the film meaning beyond the power of its own skillful storytelling. The film illustrates the international tourist's worst nightmare.
