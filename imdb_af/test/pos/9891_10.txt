I understand that "Check Out" will probably be released in Theaters in the USA in June 2006 and on DVD in November 2006. My recommendation is not to miss 'Check Out' !! This comedy film will entertain everyone, all related to the characters, family relationships, and various social issues portrayed. "Check Out" will let you crawl with quick fire clever humor built into almost every line, and can also positively cry out in a positive way. <br /> <br /> The topic of suicide is dealt with in a comical way, which at the same time can help people consider it, and understand the impact this action may have on those who have touched their lives and on those who love them. Let us hope that "Check Out" can have a positive impact and can help those who consider suicide to work out, especially in the 16-25 age group with the highest suicide rates in the US. <br /> <br /> The writing is wonderfully written, perfectly cast, and loaded with synchronicity and meaningful flashbacks over time, the meaning of which becomes clearer through the film and especially at the end. I believe the script is worthy of an Oscar Oscar for the best screenplay, playing for a movie. (The Phoenix Film Festival honored a "Best Screenplay Award".) <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with great actors doing themselves and has a long record of great performances, acting awards nominations and victories . I feel Peter Falk's performance in "Check Out" deserves an Oscar nomination, and is the most challenging and widest of his career. Laura San Giacomo's performance and chemistry with Peter Falk as her father is masterful and was recognized at the Palm Beach International Film Festival with a best actress award. <br /> <br /> Even the teenage characters shine in the movie and are played by young acting phenomenon Dan Byrd (Films: a Cinderalla story with Hilary Duff; 3 Young Artist Award nominations, Won 1) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead ( TV: Monster Island, Wolf Lake, Passions, Destroyed by an Angel; 2 Young Star Nominations). <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare and Producer Mark Lane wonderfully wonder the characters, their interrelationships, and the story line of this entertaining, enjoyable but complex script. <br /> <br /> The movie editing process keeps pace with the movie, only lowers the desired scenes so that the audience never loses interest from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie you can't take the whole family to see and everyone will love it.
