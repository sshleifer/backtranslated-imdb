After repeatedly saying how brilliant so many Columbo episodes are, it's time to honor an episode with maximum points. "Etude In Black" is not 100 percent perfect, but it's definitely more than 90 percent ... maybe 96 or 97! <br /> <br /> Last week I reviewed "Just Married" and compared it to "Meet The Parents". Well, here is one of the parents, Blythe Danner, played much earlier than the wife of well-known orchestra conductor Alex Benedict, played by John Cassavetes's legend. Alex had a relationship with Jennifer Wells, a girl in the band (not his first case, one suspect). She is extortionate Alex to leave his wife, but if his wife's mother holds the purses for the band, Alex doesn't think it would be such a smart move to destroy his career and marriage overnight. Instead, he made a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a show and murder of his young lover as it seemed like a suicide. <br /> <br /> Fill in Columbo and guess what? It takes him about two seconds to realize that homicide is more likely than suicide. It doesn't take much longer for Columbo to link Alex to the victim, and soon he'll follow him everywhere he goes. Although Columbo is certain that Alex is his husband, it actually takes quite a while and a few false leads (of which Columbo does not really swallow) before he has the important evidence. <br /> <br /> Along the way there are a few top-notch extra characters, ranging from Jennifer Wells's preliminary young neighbor and the English mechanic who appears to be more at home on Coronation Street, up to the fraudulent buyer who almost suits him for the murder. (He also saw Jennifer Wells, the busy girl!). And there is even a short comedy by Commander Lassard of the Police Academy films. As with Leslie Nielsen in "Lady In Waiting", it is impossible to take him seriously (I think you're thinking of the speech he made on the podium, aren't you?!) <br /> <br /> But it's Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes and Peter Falk, who steal the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine like Mrs Benedict. From the moment she saw Alex, Jennifer Wells dialed out of memory, feeling deeply upset about exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful show because she's struggling to trust Alex despite her intuition to say something is very, very wrong. Columbo does not help interrupt her game tennis to ask her turbulent questions about Alex's relationships with members of his band. <br /> <br /> Regarding John Cassavetes, it's a pity he didn't repeat. performances as Columbo villains as he could be with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the show's all-time greats. But this show is great! He is another one who falls into the "highly irritated" category, loses all patience with Columbo, rather than befriends and welcomes him. Despite that, when the match finally emerged, he reluctantly admitted Columbo's genius. <br /> <br /> Well, this is a really great show. It loses some very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music, as highlighted by many of the posters here, but none of these relate to the logic of the story or the characterization. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting! <br /> <br /> Finally, if you did not get there, there is an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett's early 70's show. I'm quite convinced that Steve Coogan watched this movie and Alan Partridge settled on it. Everything about the clip seems to know me, from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra comes on the play, playing circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara make fools and mock the host. <br /> <br /> This may not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavett display clip provides a good insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. It's clear to see from the quality of "Etude In Black" just how well the pair worked together!
