I watched this movie yesterday with a 20-year-old intern from my office (OK - it was the quiet day after Thanksgiving) and we both loved it. I love the unique plot, David Duchovny, David Allen Greer, and the way the dog is waiting on the door. Isn't part of every one of us just like that dog to someone we love? <br /> <br /> I also love the old people at the restaurant - they remind me of some of the older people around Southern New England where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion. And I love the wedding at the end. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver is great in this movie - and Bonnie Hunt has won an award for everything. <br /> <br /> Bonnie - Make More Movies!
