I had my son my weekend and my parent called me and said they wanted the two of us to meet them at the movies. When I got there, my mother said she really wanted to see "The Women" and asked if my son and I thought it was a chick spot. I hesitated to think it would be another "First Wives Club" movie. I must say I was very surprised to find that I really enjoy the movie from the opening scene to the credits. It was a good production and the movie was perfect in their roles. My son and I laughed all through the movie and we're glad we saw it. It made for a good Saturday afternoon movie and I recommend it to anyone, man or woman.
