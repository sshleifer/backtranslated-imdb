It's a hard show to watch. It's not something to sit back and relax. It kept me on the edge of my seat for several seasons. People are screwed, raped, tortured and die like flies. There are male organs everywhere, there are faeces, puk and blood. Oz is a brave show. It brings issues such as racism, homosexuality, the reality of prisoners and most of all; -corporal punishment. It is, in my opinion, also successful in doing this, as opposed to, for example, the single track "Medium". <br /> <br /> It sometimes bored me. It had some strange story lines and they spent a lot of time on characters that just didn't interest me. Oddly enough, I found season 1 that it was pretty boring. Looking at it while it was broadcast, I think I wouldn't continue to see it. I love seasons 2-4. Season 5 and 6 are vigilant, but I don't think it should be allowed to say the words "Cyril" and "Death Row" in the same sentence. <br /> <br /> There are so many wonderful characters to root. The old guys Bob and Busmalis, of whom I absolutely fell in love on the first day. Says Adebesi, Pancamo and Schillinger, four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way. Augustus Hill, whose monologues bound the episodes so effectively. The staff with people like Sister Pete and Ray Mukada also brilliant. Also small characters who were only for a few episodes or a few seasons, but also left a good impression. <br /> <br /> My favorites are the O'Reily brothers. Their relationship was the most beautiful and warmest I saw on television. If there is something I will always remember about this show, it's them. There will never be another "mating" or what to call it, it will hurt me so much. That's why, when the points also came, it hurt too much. I wish it would never have happened. I wish I never looked at it. <br /> <br /> But good one Fontana. I recommend it.
