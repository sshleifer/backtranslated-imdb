I enjoyed this show, it was in the UK, but not at peak times, and they moved it over the schedules so I couldn't see them. I was surprised when it didn't come back and had no idea why I didn't know yet, but I don't think it's important. <br /> <br /> Great performances of the two lead, they were very credible as friends. . The two supporting actresses also added well to the mix. I think it was part of a whole series of live shows, Friends are the obvious head, but sex in the city came a few years later. <br /> <br /> The characters, get coffee, they drink at nice pubs, that kind of thing, a little woody allenish in a way.
