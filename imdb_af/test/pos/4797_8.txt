Looking at Mexico's best movies, you'll probably find that photography has been performed by Gabriel Figueroa. He is recognized in the world as one of the best ever existed. His master camera controls gave an additional asset to the movies he participated in. Adding to his participation, we are heading towards Luis Bunuel, you will never find such aces anywhere in the world. This story, Nazarin, was written by Spain's greatest author, except Miguel de Cervantes (Don Quixote de la Mancha). The story in itself is wonderful: Nazarin, a priest who lives by his beliefs, tries to live a great Christian life, but as always there are people who do not accept it. He wanders through many places to preach his Christianity, but to find most of the time people who do not accept him. But in addition to the wonderful story, it's always interesting to try to interpret the mysterious messages Bunuel gives us through the picture in scenes that make you shake.
