Me. Stoves are sensational in this drama of power over a secret policeman who is questioning a children's writer, believing that she is trying to plant ideas in her writings that are contrary to the state. It's an incredibly powerful movie. Both appearances are worthy of more recognition, such as the message of this movie. Put it on you should see list if you can find it.
