A beautiful and thorough observation of modern life for young people in Japan, such as grain of sand, is subtly and meaningfully subjected to rape, homosexuality and fearful anxiety. It provides insight into the youth culture struggling to define itself beyond the borders of their parents' gender, with stricter compliance and facade. Typically for Japanese cinema, this is often no longer important, as it is so important to those who are not familiar with Japanese film and culture. It can look boring and minimalist (almost like any movie coming from Japan's Mangas bar) if you don't know what to look for. I saw it for the first time when I was 15 and was originally my interest in Japan, it's culture and language. Being 22 now and learning Japanese with the intention of staying there for 2 years, it is unnecessary to say it is a powerful movie. Enjoy it!
