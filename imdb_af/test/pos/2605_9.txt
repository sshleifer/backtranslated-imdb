I have to admit that this is one of the few Lou Costello movies I actually saw in the theater. Most are now on T.V. and I have to admit that Lou is very nice and he also gets the girl. It was my first time seeing Dorothy Provine perform and of course I fell in love with her like many others that day. I saw and enjoyed most of the work she did. Her performance in The Great Race is one of the reasons I bought the disc in the first place. <br /> <br /> Every comment on this movie tells that it is the one movie Lou Costello did with Bud Abbott, which is true, but if Lou lived, he would have made much more. He really does a good job and does not have to rely on his old routines to laugh. I'm sorry the little man from Patterson, N.J. didn't get the chance to do it. <br /> <br /> I hope it comes on DVD a little bit of time so I can add it to my comedy / sci fi collection.
