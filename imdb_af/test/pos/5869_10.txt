I was recently given as a gift to this movie on DVD, and was only uncertain as to whether it would appeal (although one of my favorite actors has a leading role). In fact, it's about to become a favorite. <br /> <br /> First of all, fortunately, it's not * the same * as the book, the end of which I think is excessively melodramatic. Secondly, this is one of the best movies I've seen about the First World War. "What?" you may ask. "It's not a war movie!" True: we see no battles or bombings, no trenches, no gas. But it shows the cost of the war, the damage to the lives of the men fighting in it, and the impact it had on those who were close to them. <br /> <br /> First we see Helen (Sarah Miles), a baronet's widow in anticipation of her release from a mental hospital. All the women in the movie seem to be widows: some of the war, but Helen's older man, Mr. Thomas (we'll see him later in a photo), is sick and dies while at a party and therefore her fault - ravaged collapse. She is lost and alone. The wire around the hospital grounds calls on POW camps and the trenches: like many of the men in the outside world, Helen has a kind of jerk. <br /> <br /> From the hospital she must find out her feet in the outside world: a world we experience through her eyes as pale, desert and unfriendly. Her mother can't really support her. She is a widow, she has set up her own emotional defense, after which she hides to prevent her daughter from experiencing distress. (Like many people, especially at that time, his mental accident seems embarrassing.) <br /> <br /> Ledbetter, the hired driver, becomes a supportive presence and helps Helen to adapt to life, but she realizes not that he becomes dangerous with her. This is an excellent performance by Robert Shaw. Ledbetter is a former regular soldier, an ex-sergeant head who runs a boxing club and set up his own car rental business. Superficially, it seems difficult and strong, reliable, but there are cracks beneath the surface: it has not really adapted to civilian life. He finds out (for reasons he later explains) a family and home life he doesn't have; he has brutal outbursts with colleagues and loveless sex. Come near Helen? a woman who, even with the greater post-war social freedom, could not have hoped to be realistic? exposes psychological error lines that tear him apart. Today one can diagnose PTSD. <br /> <br /> The same goes for the other man in Helen's life, aspiring politician Hugh Cantrip (Peter Egan). He is ambitious, attractive but also very young. Tellingly, his girlfriend, Connie (Caroline Mortimer), moms him, combing his hair and making sure he has a clean handkerchief before going out. He is known to both Ledbetter and Helen: the former served under him during the war, and Helen met him in political circles and thought him a "popinjay". He and Helen are now starting a relationship, with Helen planning to support his political career financially and emotionally. Peter Egan, some of his stage successes as Stanhope in R C Sheriff's Journey's End, makes Hugh more than an immature cat. There is a revealing, understated scene in the back of the car between Helen and Hugh, quoting Brooke's "The Old Vicarage at Grantchester". She asked about his war experience: "Was it really bad?" He can't answer. She says, "Well, you're back now." But she said the answer? "Am I? Sometimes I wonder?" ?? is the key to his character. As light and shadow flicker over his face, we know there are some horrors that cannot be put into words. The excessive casualties suffered by junior officials of its kind? right outside school or university and expect to derive from the front? is known. In a nerve speech (during which Helen reassures him) to local politicians at dinner, he reveals that he will stand as an Independent, no more than a liberal (the party that took the country into war not). His emotional life is as damaged as Ledbetter's. He can not easily free him from Connie, who satisfies him emotionally and financially: reading between the lines, she is probably a war widow (perhaps from a former comrade?) With a child whose drawings we are on the wall of see her house <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> The trio crisis slowly builds, with a frightening scene between Helen and Ledbetter in the car, and Ledbetter listening to Hugh and Connie when he drives them, as Hugh tries to convince Connie that, as his relationship with Helen develops, they can continue themselves; that he would at least support her. Jealousy, obsession and his belief that he must protect Helen from a double gold spade. Better off confronting her and Hugh in her home. <br /> <br /> The end is quite different from that of the novel. Better for it: it is dramatic, but less melodramatic, and keeps an unclear tone. We started with one character who recovered from a spiritual collapse; we end up with another suffering. Helen, one of the senses, is now wiser and stronger than both men who could not quite adapt to the so-called "land pass for heroes" after which they returned from the nightmare of total war. The new end is open: one feels that she will at least handle what lies ahead without illusions. In this, it reflects the reality of the time in which women (Helen, Connie and so many others) had to pick up the bits of a world in which too many men died or had different degrees of spiritual home and physical harm. <br /> <br /> "Well, you're back now." ?? "Am I? Sometimes I wonder?"
