It's a bad, racial, predictable, tough, supple soap? "The best of all" is just a guilty pleasure for me, something like the "Valley of the Dolls". I mean, "Best" has everything. Someone gets pregnant outside of marriage (when is the last time you've heard this phrase?), There are things everywhere, drinking, walking back, jealousy and even a tragic but not totally unexpected death. <br /> <br /> Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the glorious Stephen Boyd) are at the center of the action. Their chemistry is instantaneous and is the glue that this film is too fragmented. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker, the wonderful old fashion model, looks like Gregg Adams, an aspiring actress, a role that, according to any biography I've ever read about her, apparently isn't much of a piece. But Parker is doing a surprisingly credible work here, more than holding her own in a few scenes against Louis Jourdan playing David Savage. Jourdan probably took this role for the money and the special screen credit because he was clearly on the aging star / path. <br /> <br /> Diane Baker is fine as naive, believing April Morrison, Martha Hyer and Barbara Lemont have a particularly succulent storyline, and Joan Crawford movie legend chews her usual ministry as Amanda Farrow, another role, like Jourdan's Savage, which Crawford probably took for the salary. <br /> <br /> There is obviously dated dialogue and plot devices (this IS 1959), and the predictability of the soap opera genre. But if you want a good soap like me, "Best of all" will satisfy you more.
