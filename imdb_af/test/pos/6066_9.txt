We just watched the last of the series shown on the SMT network and will miss our weekly dose of Danish Delight. My wife and I picked up the show after the Swedish show "The Eagle" was finished and it was a very poor replacement for our then favorite TV show. However, on weekends the show grew on me, and although it wasn't as glossy as the Swedish show and certainly smarter in terms of their investigations into everyday crimes, it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly lunch. <br /> <br /> For these 2 shows I wasn't really a fan of the cop genre and I can't say I'm now, but the 2 Scandinavian shows really gave us insight into life in the northern euphoric countries through the eyes of their special police units.
