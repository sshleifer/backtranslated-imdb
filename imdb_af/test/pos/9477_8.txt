That's what James Cagney is about, wisdom cracks, haste, hard like nails and no-nonsense charisma. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is being listened to, the movie is nothing else. This is done in the 30's screw-ball comedy style and works well with his "bickering" with fiance Mae Clark and his responses to his colleague James Burke's long stories. <br /> <br /> What raises it above normal is the dialogue and the role it delivers. Dialogue is good, but it is nothing unless delivery is about and can refuse the characters concerned. This is well done by everyone. <br /> <br /> Good entertainment and good fun.
