This movie is hard to beat. It follows in the tradition of Pulp Fiction, but continues by stamping its own unique style. The film is wonderful, the writing is wonderful - and things like the strange (Pulp Fiction-esque) time sequence are done brilliantly. I especially like how the images provided in flashback differ dramatically, depending on who told the story at the time. If it is one of the indoctrinated criminals, everything is flashy and cool, but if it's the hero's memory, everything is disgusting and disgusting. <br /> <br /> It's an amazing movie - and so I'm extremely annoyed to find it I can't buy it anywhere!
