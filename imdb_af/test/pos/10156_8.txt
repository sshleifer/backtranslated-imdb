If there's one good exciting movie, it's one of them. James Stewart puts a brilliant performance as American dr. Ben McKenna, who is on tour with his wife and son in Africa. They bump into a murder scene, and dr. McKenna's son was later kidnapped hours. <br /> <br /> Before you can say, "Attach your seatbelts," says Dr McKenna too much about a murder attempt and try to stop it. However, other people know that he can be dangerous (dangerous to them, that is) and try to dispose of him. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Hank, the boy, is found alive and well. <br /> <br /> If you like exciting movies, this is the one to watch. <br /> <br /> My Score: 8/10.
