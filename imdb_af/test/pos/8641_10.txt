Spoiler Alert - although it's a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it completely explains. <br /> <br /> 'Mulholland Drive' is by far the most successful expression of David Lynch's cinematic style and vision since the first season. of his 'Twin Peaks' TV series. As Lynch enthusiasts know, is she a style and vision uniquely blended with film noir, horror movies, surrealism and parapsychology? with a healthy dose of postmodern self-awareness and black humor that is well-thrown in. All these elements are rich in work in the Mulholland Drive, which makes a sounding, hair-heating, and highly satisfying movie experience? especially if one is not too obsessive to try to make all the pieces fit into a logical, mystery-unraveling whole. <br /> <br /> The film features great performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring in the lead roles of young women whose lives are cut in different ways amidst a Hollywood environment that is itself a hallucinear mix of Contemporary reality is retro-50's nostalgia and satirical self-destruction. Their seemingly random initial encounter takes place after the opening of the film, in which Harring's character escapes an attempt at her life, thanks to a casual, not to say, horrific car accident. On the hill of Mulholland pass Drive to Sunset Boulevard (the two archetypes of Hollywood passages). She finds her way to the apartment, after which Betty (Naomi Watts) sits down from her 'Aunt Ruth', a seemingly successful actress from Canada to start a new movie. As we learn later, Betty soon arrived from Deep River, Ontario. Shortly afterwards, he won a jitterbug match. <br /> <br /> A highly energetic and stylized jump back to the match is one of two pre-credit prologues that would set the framework Betty's descent from the clich√©d star-innocent innocence of the broken madness of stray lover and nowhere does any actress. She can't remember her own name. The Harring character takes the name 'Rita' from a movie poster for the film noir classic 'Gilda', which decorates Tant Ruth's apartment. (Actually, it seems that Tannie Ruth has died long ago and whose apartment we really are in is a good question to be solved in future views.) In any case, Betty determines to help Rita find out what has happened and to the source of the roles of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women get in Rita's purse. The two women are gathering clues that apparently lead to Rita's true identity. They also become lovers, who at one stage radiate such a fuel chemistry, that I cannot remember his equal in mainstream lesbian love affairs (if a Lynch movie can ever be designated "mainstream"). <br /> <In the local Winkies restaurant (a repetitive place with a dreamy meaning behind its rugged realistic facade), Rita's attention is caught by a waitress's name tag that reads "Diane". This leads her to a reminder of someone named 'Diane Selwyn', whose apartment will soon visit the two women and break into Betty's insistence. I won't reveal what they find, but it is enough to say the scene is rendered with ancient Lynchian creepiness. Then Rita wakes up in the night's sweat, speaks Spanish and hurries Betty to an everyday magic show / theater called 'Silencio' where the art of illusion and lip / instrumental synchronization with manic intensity is practiced and where the Blue-haired Lady, like his noted in the end credits, ruled as the presiding Muse. The blue-haired woman, covered in the red-lit blue-lit Silencio theater, is the last shot in the film, perhaps a symbol of artistic imagination control? rather than Steven's "blue guitar man" as filtered through bad drug surrealism. <br /> <br /> During the Silencio series, and as Rebecca Del Rio came, she has his own powerful Spanish version of Roy Orbison's "Crying", a devastating epiphany when Betty opens her own wallet to discover a blue box with a keyhole that seems to fit the key in Rita's wallet. Even if we don't dive too deep into the Freudian sexual symbolism of wallets, the moment is a unique Hitchcockian one, with the key and boxing adjustment leading to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and in a whole new set of character relationships and meanings. Not least of these changes is the discovery that Betty is the coveted Diane Selwyn and the lost lover of Camilla Rhodes (ie Rita). Camilla, in turn, is a Latin femme fatale film star, to whom Diane is guilty of the few minor roles she has succeeded in ensuring and more meaningfully to whom she is subjected emotionally. <br /> <br /> After this and other discoveries In the last third of the movie, the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie has not been solved as straightforwardly as in Vertigo. While some visuals and dialogue suggest that many, if not all, of the earlier material be projected and displaced from the dreaded Diane subconscious mind, other pieces and pieces suggest the potentially supernatural intervention of a role-playing direct inspirational Peaks, including Michael J. Anderson who portrays his unbeatable dwarf forces and a Bob variant that hangs behind Winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and his id-like associations. <br /> <br /> But you fit the pieces together, but the whole Mulholland drive is much bigger? and more mysterious? as the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, challenging and enjoyable worrying thought journey. In addition, the movie's cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack filled with atmospheric atmospheres, the acting spectacular, and the director / editing masterful. It was perhaps the unknown Best Picture of 2001 among the major US editions.
