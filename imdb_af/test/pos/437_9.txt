Jean Renoir's tribute to the Paris of the late 19th century is beautiful in many ways. Not only does it seem to have been photographed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha, it depicts the geographical Paris; The streets are only accessible to stairs, the unpleasant end of the volatile popularity, and the sexual opportunism of men with a product to sell, in an uncompromising picture of show business that is contrary to the image portrayed by Hollywood. A clear comparison is made with Lloyd Bacon's 42nd Street, made about 20 years ago, with Ruby Keeler as a dancing sensation, a face of the sticks that came to New York. show business, which saves the show if the star fails. "You are going out of the chorus, but you have to come back a STAR!" Warner Baxter's "Julian Marsh" is a director who suffers from his art and is not appreciated. Jean Gabin's "Danglard" likes genital politics, but when he talks about the show, he's more like Knute Rockne than Julian Marsh. He's all about the game, except - for his pointed thing. He has a profitable new venture, until his mistress becomes jealous of the woman she acknowledges as his next mistress. His prospects rise and fall with every coach ride he takes. <br /> <br /> Danglard takes Mistress 1 (Lola de Castro, played by Maria Felix), sneaking on a dive where he sees "Nini" (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) with her boyfriend and first lover, Paulo the baker , and discover that she is a lively dancer. He uses his charm and the prospect of money to attract Nini to study dance so she can go on stage. The prospect of money and famous charm Nini, and she becomes Danglard's next mistress, as well as a suitable cancan student, who named Danglard "French Cancan", to meet the current Anglophile trend in dance. <br /> <br /> Both "42nd St" and "French Cancan" are tributes to show business - to modern entertainment - it has its own iconography and its own imagination. "42st St is centered around Julian Marsh, a good director of Broadway shows, which he organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement. The male youth is a middle-aged twist with lumbago, replaced by Dick Powell, the beautiful one with secret wealth to hide. Danglard, on the other hand, goes from woman to wife, seduces them with the promise of fame, hooks them with what a very convincing endowment, and has no doubt that he is heterosexual and very active Postcoital scenes are abound. <br /> <br /> Days after he seduced Nini away from Paulo, he discovered Esther, a Piaf type, and started preparing for her work on the movie Singing the theme song while playing it on her pussy, of course Nini's jealousy as she aroused Lola's jealousy (and of course Nini has the privilege of being a Tsarina!). how Danglard's opinion cost him money, but how s eleven his troublesome horniness is subordinate to his love for the show - how the audience demands dedication - And this is the powerful combination of false persuasion and seductive fame that Danglard makes the hero, claiming that a true lover of the show never will earn as the money men. In the film's conclusion, Danglard, the creditors and the jealous babies have ventured, approaching a new attraction that approaches the incredible (and believe me, this is incredible) performance of the cancan. "Have you ever thought to be on stage?" he asked, and the curtain descended. Meanwhile, poor Julian escapes from the fire from the theater listening to Peggy Sawyer's new fans, reducing his contribution to the show's success. (I won't even get into the central "42nd Street" line. "Oh, Guy, it was BIG of you to come!") <br /> <br /> And I'm not going to look into the glimpse One gets legendary Parisian entertainers, including a short vision of Piaf, or the vision of a Paris, both urban and rural. Certainly there is an example of the styles that Trenet and Aznavour have gained. But this is the reminder of an assertive and benevolent masculinity, something invisible in any Hollywood music instrument with which it can be compared, is a pleasing relief from the androgens of the Hollywood musicals of 30 (including my beloved Fred Astaire, and Dick Powell). let alone the barf issued by MGM in movies like the repulsive "American in Paris." All those fountains! We will save our comparison of that turkey for "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and the deconstruction of the American man for another day. <br /> <br /> That Danglard may have been a hopeful vision, in post-war France, of some sort of hyper-male mec that may or may not have been, is virtually the point. Being a man's husband, John Wayne and Edward Everett Horton, may be more on target. That he is a man who likes the ladies is never compromised. I, for one, will not mind living his life. I wonder if Gabin was so happy. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of these comments I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis called "boloney". I never got that far. Baz's Moulin Rouge. Well, Paris no longer makes those kinds of things in the signals.
