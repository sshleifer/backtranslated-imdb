Great movie. I laughed all the time. Why? Well, I'm from Austria, I can go with the German (Bavarian) kind of humor. So I think this movie just makes sense to look when you are a German mother tongue. Stefan and Erkan both speak in a new kind of Turkish-German accent, which has become very popular in our countries (GER & AUT). But of course they are very stupid. As in any comedy, your personal humor will decide whether the thumbs up or down.
