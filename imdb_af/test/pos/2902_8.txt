I returned this movie in 1954 on a double bill with "Valley of the Kings." These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!). Today, the "Egyptian" sees a flat dialogue and a few gauches, but it is a glorious movie to watch. The kind of thing Hollywood, unfortunately, doesn't do it anymore. - and it has a wonderful story ... not just the regular boy-meet-girl or revenge-mine-mine. Too bad 20th will not see redesigned prints on the big screen.
