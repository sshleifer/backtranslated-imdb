Jeff Lieberman's "Just Before Dawn" is definitely one of the most underrated horror movies ever made. The movie, while being somewhat influenced by "Deliverance" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", is extremely spectacular and memorable. The atmosphere is really ominous. The film is excellent, Deborah Benson and Jamie Rose are great female leads. The inbred twins are really scary and inexorable killers. The movie is beautifully shot - it is actually filmed on site at Silver Falls State Park in Oregon. There are many gore, but one that kills, when Verchel is put up in the groin, is rather nasty and unpleasant. A must see for treasure fans.10 out of 10 what else?
