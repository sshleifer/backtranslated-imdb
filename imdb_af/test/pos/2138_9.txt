By the time it was opened, the "Hemelsek" became more of a cultural phenomenon than a movie to its detriment. At a time when concerns about excessive budgets and regression arrogance grew, it was a convenient target, as it was an outrageous budget work by the latest "author" to hit Hollywood, which has not yet set the record gave him the benefit of the doubt among critics and industry. As someone pointed out at the time, nobody would jump on Warren Beatty's even more expensive and dark "Reds" because Beatty was one of us, while Michael Cimino didn't get that status. <br /> <But the "Hemelsek" was also influenced by a cultural change that took place at the time, the political movement to the right and to a more indisputable patriotism and embezzlement of the myth of the West (and the Western). A few years earlier, Cimino's demythologizing of the frontier was possibly timely, fresh and a necessary correction. But by 1980, in the wake of the Reagan revolution, it was considered almost un-American. <br /> <br /> What a shame because the movie, seen from the vantage point of view for a few decades, is a fascinating and thought-provoking look at that particular time and place as a world in which life is Hobbes' words were "nasty, brutal and short". Kristofferson plays James Averill, an East-class eastern east looking for adventure sheriff in Wyoming, where he finds that he has to lead a resignation of the settlers and squatters against an assault by a mercenary death group rented by rich landowners. , including Averill's lifelong best friend. In a more innocent time, Averill and his patch would be "army" of poor farmers visible; But this is nothing more than a traditional Western one, and when the American cavalry joins, it's not on the side of the "good guys". <br /> <br /> Much like "The Deer Hunter," Cimino's previous movie, "Heaven's Gate," spends a lot of time building the details of the lives of his principals. This gives the film a temporary calm pace, which nevertheless leads to a gripping conclusion. With an excellent play, a fine musical score and the visual texture that makes one believe, you see the "Old West" through new eyes, "Heaven's Gate" is a movie that repeats rewards. I just want MGM to send out a new DVD, with an improved transfer and a comment by Cimino. Nonetheless, the current version is satisfactory enough to see viewers discovering what was critical in 1980, possibly blinded by the film's cultural sub-texts, that "Heaven's Gate" is a good movie.
