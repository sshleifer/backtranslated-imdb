this is one of my favorite movies ever! with Casablanca and cannibal holocaust, it is close to perfect cinema. Rex Allen tells this wonderful story of a cougar who just needs a little love. contains action, adventure, excitement, comedy and riverbed! SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU NEED TO DO IT !!! You will not find a better cat picture, with a cat from outer space that is not so close. Charlie's performance is wonderful. even include animal cruelty and intense logging! must love disney, for all moral failures!
