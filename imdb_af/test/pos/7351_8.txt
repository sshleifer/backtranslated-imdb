It is without a doubt the biggest spin to Jackass ever made, hell, it even blows Jackass out of the water. <br /> <br /> Photo: You have a group of guys who just didn't want to grow up, throw in a lot of money, and some very stunts, and you have Viva La Bam. <br /> <br /> This show, it's so family-based, and it's not just "the gang running" to be quite jerky (like in Jackass), for example: Bam's parents, April and Phil, are in every episode, starting with Bam's obese uncle, Don Vito to start! The reason why the Margera family makes us laugh is simple: Someone in our family can relate April: The woman who wants to live life and the tradition: Phil: The man who tries to be a good father, and finally, Bam: The boy who never grew out of high school. <br /> <br /> The pranks and jokes in each episode will A guaranteed laugh, and the purchase of the DVDs is definitely recommended! Another thing that is surprising to see is how comfortable Margera is about the whole thing, interviewing him for the vast majority of episodes not acting, and just acting on instinct. <br /> <br /> What I liked most about the whole thing, however, is the influence of Marger a has MTV. He wanted Slayer to play in his backyard, MTV did it. He wanted to hang out with Dani Filth for a day and had a Cradle Of Filt concert in his backyard. <br /> <br /> Add to this his passion for the love metal (and debate as emo) band HIM and his brother's garage band CKY, and there are plenty of headbands going on. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass, you will fall in love with it. Last year I borrowed a friend from season 1, and I will give my legs to meet the Viva La Bam Crew. You will not be disappointed, and I can promise you will be in the lurch!
