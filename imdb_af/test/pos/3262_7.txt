Filmed in 1999, this Aussie movie does an OK job depicting a bunch of little crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the fate of a young willow tribe whose life is in jeopardy after dropping a job for its future boss. Well done by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is pretty credible with a few very humorous moments in one scene that revolves around a bench. The creation of various themes central to the story was done fairly well. E.g. When a criminal is looking for bullets for his gun. I personally have been wronged by violent violence in movies, and in this respect the film did not offend. It has tried and managed to show us the human side of the bad things like Bryan Brown. The rest of the cast did an OK job without any real stand-outs I remember. The direction was very successful in making a credible film that provided good entertainment. The main dominant feature that makes it a good film is the play and direction of Heath Ledger and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes turbulent mistakes for short-term satisfaction. He thinks he's indestructible and doesn't realize that sinister people are waiting. to hit any error. Director Gregor Jordan deserves special mention. Grading in my book - 7 (out of 10).
