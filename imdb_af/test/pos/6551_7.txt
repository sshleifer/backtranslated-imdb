To be honest, I thought this movie would be a Japanese drama. I was dead wrong. This movie is based on the popular Japanese anime novel of the same name. It tells the story of a town cursed by the Uzumaki or The Spiral in English. The town's residents are slowly and slowly becoming dangerously and violently obsessive with anything with spirals, and some of the residents are actually beginning to change their lives. They actually have some kind of spiral in them like a snail. <br /> <br /> The movie was one giant, random, sour journey twisted with romance and drama. Kind of like a twisted drama. What disturbs this movie are the ways in which some of the people are obsessed with The Spiral. For example, one of the fathers has a garage full of household objects with a spiral incorporated therein, one girl has taken her very long hair and pestered to a badly large spiral style, one child slowly changed into a human snail , one man could turn his body into a spiral shape, one woman tried to cut open her ear to get the cochlea inside and one teenager ran over himself so that he could be turned around a tire and one child himself " a washer filled so he could become a spiral. <br /> <br /> Another very disturbing aspect of this very well-syndicated is the atmospheric tone and style of this movie. The camera angles add to the psychotic and distorted story, in other words, a very good cinematography. The overall color of this photo makes for a bit of demented story. The color is a mixture of lime green, yellow and a little orange and the special effects with some spirals are excellent. <br /> <br /> But like many Japanese films, this one has an undertone of forbidden love and romance between a girl and a boy. However, with all the spiral and strange events going on in town, it's hard to keep up with the relationship of the two teenagers. But somehow it is very irrelevant, more like a second-hand story that has nothing to do with the real story of the spiral obsession town. <br /> Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes many different and bizarre foreign films. It just got enough wackiness and madness, it touched me.
