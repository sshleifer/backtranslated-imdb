"Five Fingers of Death" started with the American kung-fu movie love, but I remember it for the first time as "King Boxer" in Chinatown, NYC, without the bad dubbing and few Americans. I was also lucky to see the American premiere of Five Fingers of Death in Times Square, NYC. What a contrast it seems to be ... the same movie but different audiences. <br /> <br /> In Chinatown, this movie gave the viewers a more serious tone. This was because the right voices of the actors (In Chinese) were heard, which made this movie more credible. Chinatown theaters have shown violent kungfu movies for many years (1972's "Boxer From Shantung" all hit them), so the action choreography and storyline was the main attraction. Competitive school plots are not overused, so the storyline was fresh. Every big kung fu movie has wonderful, turbulent villains you wanted to see, get them up and FFoD has them too. The star, Lieh Lo, was a well-known actor in Chinese theaters. The mainly Chinese audience enjoyed this movie immensely. The audience is excited as this film leaves, giving the final satisfaction to me. <br /> <br /> In Times Square, this movie was an action comedy ... probably unintentional. I also enjoyed it here, but for different reasons. The crowd was ethnic and very energetic. From the beginning the film made you laugh. As soon as the audience heard the strange British accent, some of the Chinese actors came in to change the film into a violent and greedy cartoon. Most American audiences have seen this type of gore in a horror movie, not in an action movie. The action sequences blew the audience away. Unfortunately, the movie studios saw that they enjoyed so much that bad dubbing and unnecessary violence became a kung fu movie formula. <br /> <br /> I had fun watching this movie with an American audience, but enjoyed it much more Chinatown. Some movies can pass the test of time, but the print version of FFoD can't. The original "King Boxer" is still nice ... a classic!
