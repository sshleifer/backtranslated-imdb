Sweet, entertaining story of a young 17 1/2-year-old boy, controlled by a remaining religious mother and father-in-law, and how he finds himself retired, eccentric and tragic by his work. Well done, especially by Julie Walters. Rupert Grint plays the role of the teenager well and shows that his talent will last longer than the Harry Potter series of movies. Laura Linney plays his relentless strict mother without a hint of salvation, so there is no place for her. But the film is a very entertaining movie, well made by the British in the style of holders of stomach and calendar girls.
