*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** In the immediate post-war years something had to be in the air that made nightlife attractive movie-making institutions. A lot of nightly urban movies were made at the time, not just in America. One of the most remarkable was Carol Reed's Odd Man Out, an English picture of a wounded armed man wandering through the streets of Belfast. In America, it was the high afternoon, or more properly, high midnight, of film noir. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is not really film noir, but has the noir stumps, although it does use it for its own purposes, which has to do with bigotry. Directed by Edward Dmytryk, written by John Paxton, is adapted from a novel by Richard Brooks. The book relates to the murder of a homosexual; In the film, the victim is changed to a Jew. Though filmed like a mystery, there is little tension in the movie, as it is quite obvious who the killer is doing early. What made the film so attractive and beautiful is the fact that, after World War II, a city, Washington, D.C., was worked by some of the most talented craftsmen in the then films. Unlike many night films, Crossfire is mostly set up indoors: in police stations, campsites and all-night movies. Soldiers are everywhere in the movie, and most are itching to return to their civilian lives. Another sensation, of most men we meet, is that their personalities are so shaped by their military experience, it will be difficult to return to their old neighborhoods. for some maybe even impossible. They look more tied to each other than to anything or anyone else. <br /> <br /> However, some men are never really bound to anyone in the army. The killer, Monty, is such an individual. One feels that he is never connected in his civil life. He is a lonely wolf who also needs people. Desperately alone, he has a sadistic line a mile wide, and always needs someone to be the lap of his jokes. The man he killed did not hurt him and was actually a stranger to him. But once Monty found out the man's religion, it was enough. He didn't really mean to kill the man, because it was his intention to "humiliate" him and just defeat him. But when he was drunk then Monty's fists became the better of him. It is this act that sets the story in motion. <br /> <br /> If the movie builds up a steam head, the other characters come in focus quickly. Monty's opposite number is Keely, another soldier, who, although introspective like Monty, and somewhat detached, has no resentment against anyone and seems a reasonable, even lovely man. Finley, the pipe smokers' detective, is dandy and a little bit lighter compared to the men in uniform, but proves more than a match for the various and mostly irresistible soldiers he handles. The actors playing these roles, Roberts Ryan, Mitchum and Young, give excellent performances, each in a different key. Ryan, like Monty, is tense and paranoid, always looking around for someone to pick up; and one can feel his anxiety to become a victim himself. If Keely is Mitchum low key, almost nonchalant; he never makes his voice; and he has more to say, more to offer than is allowed by the writing. Young's performance is often criticized as too soft, but I find it deceptively strong and pretty off-putting. He cuts the stereotype of the belligerent policeman, making Finley's character a prince of crime detection. <br /> <br /> There are few surprises in Crossfire, although the writing is sometimes surprisingly well written. , even brilliant. Character actor Paul Kelly gives one of the best short performances in the movies as the "boyfriend" of a woman picking up a soldier in a bar. Kelly may or may not be her husband; and he may or may not stay with her, even though he seems enough in her apartment. The beauty of these scenes is that nothing is made clear, and this man himself looks more than a little confused about what his role is, was or should be. In a way, these few scenes form the thematic core of the film, which is anomaly. With the exception of the detective, all the men in the film, aimlessly and basically lost, float even worse than others. In this regard, Crossfire, for all preaching near the end, is a film about the vagueness of identity, and how easy it can be lost or distorted. Men float from one bar to another in this movie, as they are involved in a kind of woozy companionship, their personalities merge into a kind of common American male template. Then something happens, something is nailed. A word is called, whether "Jew" or "hillbilly" and things suddenly become tense, and the idea of ​​individuality, of an outside group, of anyone who is not like them, becomes very offensive, even ominous. Then the men are usually returned to the loose, non-personal group after the storms have disrupted and the order is being restored.
