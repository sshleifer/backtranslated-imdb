The mission is an excellent thriller with several plot twists driven by character, rather than star events, the need to make special effects, mandatory romance and endless car hunters. However, there is a car hunt here, and a dandy is it. Aidan Quinn is wonderful as both the terrorists and the naval officer are "recruited" to eliminate him. It is rare that a second or third-level actor, such as Quinn, be given an important film such as a film-bearer. Usually, such a role is given to an A-list actor with boxing, which is probably why I have never heard of this movie before I saw it. Donald Sutherland is wonderful as the morally ambiguous, somewhat creepy at times, Quinn's agent. Ben Kingsley is also good as the Israeli agent. The plot is very complex and there are several story lines, which gradually come to the end, and not all at once as we are used to seeing. The paranoia and claustrophobia of these thrillers are captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity. The sites are convincing and effective. The soundtrack is nothing special, but rarely do we get all of the above features nowadays, without stupid and / or meaningless plot developments; unconvincing star turns; hard, annoying, music video-type soundtracks; a villain raising it; and repeatedly a movie, costume and plot mostly aimed at an audience under the age of 25. It is an excellent thriller, which most of them have not succeeded due to its release. *** 1/2 of 4 stars.
