Not really sure what to do about this movie. very strange, very artificial. Not the kind of movie you watch, because it has a compelling plot or characters. more like the kind of movie you can't stop watching, because of the terribly fascinating things happening on the screen. Although, the first time my wife looked at it, she couldn't go through it ... upset by her. Walk a bit long, but it's worth looking for those who are interested in very dark movies.
