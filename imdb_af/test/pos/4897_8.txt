Just seen The League of Gentlemen: Apocalypse during a special show in Manchester, with League League Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith. <br /> <br /> At the back, Peter Kay (who has a short comedy in the movie) followed the Q&A session to the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is complicated (in a good way) and very funny. It follows Geoff Tipps, Hilary Briss and Herr Lipp as they try to save fiction Rosyton Vasey from the interests of their creators. <br /> <br /> The League plays a wide variety of characters and themselves (or character based) and is strongly supported by the cream of British character and comedy actors such as Bernard Hill, Victoria Wood and David Warner . <br /> <br /> Warner is a special outcome that reminds me of his smooth and slash in 'Time' Bandits. <br /> <br /> The film swims in and out of different realities and leaves some of the Rosyton Vasey's denisers a little space beyond their normal boundaries of their comedy shoot. <br /> <br /> Steve Pemberton's Herr Lipp has a great Britain moment near the end of the movie and has to make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life which at an unexpected moment opens a button bring the throat and surprise you with the love of the characters. <br /> <br /> Something that Mark and Reece has in the Q&A after, that the league's plot is tired of their famous characters, is untrue and that the whole movie is really a love letter for them. <br /> <br /> For a format that started out as a radio-based, sketch-based show, these guys developed the idea so well they made a movie traveling through fiction, 'reality', comedy, tragedy and a pleasant trip for two of the less obvious characters undertakes to bear a long story of their 70 strange existing creations. <br /> <br /> The fans of the show will like it. It gives a little dedication and attention to detail in the spades. The bugs may be a bit lost, but the joy of the LoG has always been the ability to almost immediately vote in their acutely perceived characters and take the stylistic leap into farce and expressionist film homage. <br /> <br /> There is a great pleasure in this one, including "The Shining" and "La Belle et la Bete", to name but two that I have seen, and they show their love for cinema and history with a segment in 1690's England that makes perfect sense when you are busy with the movie. <br /> <br /> What can I say, I was surprised, angry, emotional, and snickered and they definitely pulled out that many people failed. A successful British TV comedy for bio translation. <br /> <br /> If you've been watching and enjoying the League of Gentlemen in the past, it will see; you will enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you don't, rent / buy a DVD and then watch it. <br /> <br /> Well done guys and thanks for the charming and humorous Q&A.
