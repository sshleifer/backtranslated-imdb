The closer she gets ... is an artificial documentary about the death of a person I actually knew. It gives a glimpse of the private moments of the family involved in the most difficult time of their lives. Parents tend to support the work of their children. In this case, the subject of the documentary went above and beyond. She was willing to share her death experience as a love for her son. It is a special artwork that weaves the serious, tranquil and lighter sides of life for this family. The story is one that can make you laugh, but also cry because it addresses issues that we all have to face. I recommend this documentary to those who are not afraid to cry, and are prepared to deal with the issue of death in a very human way. This movie will touch you.
