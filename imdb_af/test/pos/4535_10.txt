Holy Schnikey! This movie rocks! The duo of Chris Farley and David Spade are good together. My favorite parts are 'Fat Guy' in a dress, O my gosh, Room service and more scenes that will be remembered for years. This movie followed a great cult. I wonder why, proving even eleven years after Chris Farley's tragic death and he is still popular. He plays Tommy who will make you laugh every time you see it. He is a great comedian and is missed. Mr. Spade reminds me of Dan Akyroid while Chris Farley reminds me of John Belushi. They did more than 2 movies together. This movie is a must buy and should be in every Snl fan's collection.
