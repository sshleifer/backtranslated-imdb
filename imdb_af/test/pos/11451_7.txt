This is the old, old story: children have a feast in an old house, demons are released, death and free nudity occur. You know it all, it's still a lot of fun. Many people (okay, many horror fans, to be specific) have good memories of this movie and it is always with slight trials that you visit an old time. movie to see if it is as good as you thought it was. Fortunately, this is. <br /> <br /> It has something for everyone (well, everyone who is male, I think). From a fun title sequence to a shoplifting scam using Linnea Quigley's ass to the "mirror" scene fully on demonic fun, it's a blast from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The girls are cute, the guys are. . . . male, the dead scenes are well done with some good gore effects and, unlike some horrors of the era, it actually keeps a good sense of atmosphere and even tension. Don't get me wrong, it's still fun, but it does offer some freaky moments that most genre fans should please.
