Okay, I will admit that the Inki cartoons made by Loony Tunes are pretty offensive and I can understand why Warner Brothers pulled them off the market. The lips and very stereotypical Inki are not politically correct today. However, the cartoons were made good and it is a pity that they were not released with a declarative prologue (like the one with Leonard Maltin they included in some recent politically-wrong Donald Duck cartoons released on DVD recently). In other words, to completely throw out the cartoons is to forget our history. Plus, Inki, Little Black Sambo and other racist cartoons are out there - especially on the internet. <br /> <br /> This Inki cartoon has our little hero chase. Initially, he would pursue a cute little caterpillar but later accidentally hit a lion - a lion more than happy to make Inki his dinner. But through this comes a strange Minah again and again ... and finally you will see why this bird is so important to the story. <br /> <br /> Fun, well-made and smart. I like the Inki cartoons. I also have the pleasure of showing them to extremely thin-skinned liberal friends just to see they have apoplexy fits or even heart attacks. Lots of fun, people!
