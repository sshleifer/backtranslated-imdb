S. Epatha Merkerson shines as Nanny in this touch and lively look at the life of Ruben Santiago, Jr. (Marcus Franklin) as he grows under Nanny's guardianship. The film gives a good character study of both Nanny and Ruben and drives the lives upwards and downwards in a realistic way as opposed to so many memoirs made in film. The supporting role-play adds a lot of sparkle and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles like Mos Def, Macy Gray, Terrence Dashon Howard, Rosie Perez, Louis Gossett, Jr., Liev Schreiber, Jimmy Smits, Ernie Hudson, Delroy Lindo and Patricia Wettig. Lose some steam and vitality to the end, and the final order makes a bittersweet feel. But, generally, a good movie with excellent performance by Merkerson.
