Well ... What to say. <br /> <br /> I think I'll start with a confession. I cried 4 times in my life. Once my dad died, twice because of a high school girl, and at the end of this movie. This film deals with the real confrontational issues of 6 schoolchildren and forces them to look uncomfortable in the open space for the whole world. I have never seen a film dealing with the human emotional state. everything from incest to incontinence is covered here and I doubt there are many people who are safe from the sting of fame with at least a few scenes. <br /> <br /> It starts with a suicide. at 14:37. then, without knowing who it was who died, the story begins from the beginning of the day. It follows the lives of 6 school children until 2:37. It varies, and edited with personal interviews of the 6 teenagers, letting you know all about their lives. their love, hatred, dreams, desires, secrets, shame, false trust, self-deception, corruption and arrogance. The overall outcome is a kind of "whodunnit" that tries to discover the identity of the suicide before it comes to light at the end of the film. without being deceived, I must let you know. don't get angry at the end. it contains a very important lesson. <br /> <br /> And now a warning. this movie is definitely not for the weak heart. Many people actually walk out of the theater half way through when I see it. Disgusted by some or it's content. Or maybe it is sometimes difficult to experience the cold hard truth of reality. That's how high school is for many people. I'm sure most will agree.
