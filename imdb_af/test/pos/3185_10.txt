My family and I do not normally look at local movies, because the simple reason is that they are poor, they have the depth and not the worth. <br /> <br /> The trailer of "Nasaan ka man" caught me, my daughter-in-law and daughter's so took time to look it up. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story is beautiful and the acting is great. Jericho Rosales was very good, that's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo was that he was effective in his role. I have never been so touched, moved and touched by a local film before. Imagine a cynic like me watching my eyes at the end of the movie? Congratulations to Star Cinema !! Away to go, Jericho and Claudine !!
