Susan Sarandon, for lack of a better word, is incredible. In my opinion (and yes I understand that not everyone will agree with me), she is one of the greatest actresses ever and she must have at least two oscars. I mean, it was an incredible show in Lorenzo's Oil (but then I think every show of her is wonderful) and they gave it to Emma Thompson ... what was it about ??? And by the time she got this oscar, she was in the industry for about 25 years. I couldn't think of anyone who earned it more, especially for a performance so brilliant as her portrayal of Sister Helen Prejean. But then she's all over Hollywood's artificiality and she doesn't need an oscar - people know she's fine anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie carries some very deep, thought-like messages, so unnecessary to say it shouldn't be taken lightly. Of course, Tim Robbins can't escape credit here. You would think that, due to his personal feelings against the death penalty, the representations in this movie would not be correct. However, both sides of the death penalty debate are even given weight. On the one hand, you see the interesting side of Matthew, the human side that makes his death rather heartbreaking. At the same time, you see the way he saved his victims and the constant torment of the mentally sad parents. One word for Tim - BRAVO. <br /> <br /> A brilliant movie and, as I said, a well-deserved and long-awaited Oscar for Susan.
