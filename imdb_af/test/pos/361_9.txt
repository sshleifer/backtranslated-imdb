The first murder scene is one of the best killings in film history (almost as good as the Psycho landfill) and Robert Walker's play is fantastic. A psychopath involved in tennis star in swords. This is the story and overall This movie is very good, but there is one problem: why does Guy Haines not come to <br /> <br /> the policeman in the first place. 4/5
