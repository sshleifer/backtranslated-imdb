While many people found this movie too slow and simplistic, I really connected to it. There is no plot as such, but the film takes the form of a human survival story about three people holding a tree with a man eating crocodile somewhere in the water among them. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought the acting was mostly good, despite the fact that the roles were sometimes demanding and I had a sense of warmth for the characters. The situation they were in was very scary and I felt nervous about them. I found the whole movie nervous because of the mere helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival. <br /> <br /> The crocodile effects are surprisingly well handled for such a low budget film and believe me, I've seen my fair share of dodgy crocodiles. The creature did well and had a real threat, and although the audience I was with was not on the film as a whole, they still jumped and took off when the crocodile appeared. <br /> <br /> Script mode, I would have made some changes, especially at the end, but it wasn't a big problem. For fans of slow-burning survivors who live within the realms of reality, this will be an engaging movie, but unfortunately I think for many audiences seeking a thrill and higher production value of their cinema experience, the point to be missed.
