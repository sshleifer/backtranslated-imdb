It is sometimes difficult to look at such confident "message films" of an earlier, seemingly simpler era without a certain degree of cynicism. The issue of racism and religious tolerance has dawned on us from an early age. As we grew, teachers and authority figures sought less blatant and equally effective means of conveying the message. "The house I live in" (1945) is about as unseen as "message films", and Frank Sinatra apparently treats his audience as a child? Indeed, perhaps this was the point because the brief was undoubtedly meant to influence younger films. Yet I became strange when Sinatra launched that sincere patriotic speech about what it really meant to be an American ?? and I'm not even an American! Director Mervyn LeRoy released only two months after the end of World War II. Mr. Mervyn LeRoy greeted audacious audiences with a message of tolerance, cohesion and, above all, hope. The music is also not bad. <br /> <br /> Face of face Frank Sinatra ?? Already a star, but not yet the superstar, did he become? make the movie into a recording studio and blow up "If you are a dream" with a full orchestra accompaniment. When Frank goes between a smoko, he looks at a large group of children who are a young Jewish boy bully, and their taunts are purely caused by his different religions. Ol 'Blue Eyes puts an end to this childish behavior, marking the bulls' "Nazi werewolves" and their irrational bias. He then leads the group seriously and naturally to the clear folly of racial and religious discrimination, and assures them that every American culture, although of our own, is still American at heart? unless of course you are one of those bloody japs. There is a hint of hypocrisy in advocating racial tolerance, while one nation is presented as the collective enemy, although you cannot blame Hollywood for less than enthusiastic about the fate of the Japanese in 1945. <br /> <br /> Sinatra drives home with a wonderful heartbreaking version of "The House I Live In", written in 1943 by Abel Meeropol. When the songwriter first heard the song on film, he was furious that the filmmakers had completely excluded three of his verses, which he considered essential for the message. These omissions were probably due to time constraints, but Meeropol did not understand them too kindly and was reportedly shot out of the theater. When first released, "The House I Live In" was considered an important short film that won a Golden Globe for the best film for promoting international goodwill and an honorary Oscar for all was involved. In 2007, it was considered "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" and added to the National Film Registry of the Congress Library. That's how I heard about it. While his approach seems a little hokey sixty years later, this movie remains pretty awake, thanks to a young fella named Frank Sinatra.
