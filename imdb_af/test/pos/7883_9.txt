It is a classic film that dramatizes the fate of a man who cannot adapt to changes that occur in society and feels more and more alienated, leading to violence. Joe is a worker, and he is unhappy and angry, and all he needs is an excuse to eradicate what the story is about. Only, Joe is silent; with someone else he becomes deadly. And what makes Joe's character even more cool is that he fully rationalizes his violence so that it's not only bad for him, it's necessary. Joe projects his own violent tendencies on those he sees the enemy and sees him as in a war. In this movie, the "generation gap" is portrayed as a war. But this is just a war in Joe's mind, because "the enemy" in this case is in his imagination. Nobody wants to fight Joe, but Joe feels he has to defend himself. Although this film was released in 1970, the message is now as relevant as it was when society was still undergoing major changes that led to the kind of intense alienation that effectively dramatized the film.
