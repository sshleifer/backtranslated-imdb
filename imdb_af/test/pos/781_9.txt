I saw it tonight with moderate expectations - if Tartan Films picks up something and releases it, it's generally a good sign, but I'm not usually a fan of Julie Walters, and usually keeps her comedy roles (sorry for any fans, but it's a personal thing. I don't find her funny in the comedy. <br /> <br /> It was wonderful though - a great show by everyone, but Grint and Walters are exceptional! Laughing, lots of pados, great timing and a great movie, such a lifetime movie wouldn't normally be what I wanted so much, but I can't recommend it highly enough - and watch Rupert Grint as he falls into " a nice fine actor.
