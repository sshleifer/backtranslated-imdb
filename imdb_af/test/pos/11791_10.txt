I really like this movie. If others want to give it an average of about 5.0 / 10, it's their choice. I'll give it 10/10. Sutherland's performance as a private eye is absolutely fantastic. The story is wonderful, human, exciting, intelligent. That dialogue is good. The story may not be perfect, but anyway - the mood of the movie is good enough to compensate for it. In addition, the end is incredibly cool and they really bring the jigsaw puzzle back together. So anyway, I liked it. I also thought the female main actor did very well. I'm not a big fan of detective movies, but this one was really good, also because it doesn't give damn conventions of the supernatural.
