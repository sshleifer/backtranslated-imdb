Another good moral ambiguity pieces where the anti-hero makes it difficult to decide who to root. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, "The Beguiled", anyone who said it was silent, there were no good parts for actresses in movies, at least in 1971. There were four excellent parts for actresses in. this movie and everyone was well thrown and well executed. <br /> <br /> Pamelyn Ferdin has played a good job as Amy and is going to play "Wanda June". It had to be the first time that an adult male office star shared an extended kiss with a twelve-year-old girl on camera, wondering if there was much controversy at that time. It was probably Polanski's favorite scene. Given the fate of Amy's tortoise "Randolph", it's not surprising that Ferdin is growing up as a hardcore animal rights activist. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page was also excellent and plays a complex character with just the right amount of restraint. Interestingly, she died just three days after Elizabeth Hartman committed suicide (throwing herself through a fifth floor window), as they also worked together in "You're a Big Boy Now". <br /> <br /> Hartman (who seems to be Blair Brown's sister) was wonderful like Edwina and had to get an Oscar (no other show was even near that year), but given what we now she knows, just wonder how much of her performance was a study. trouble and how much just came from her. Edwina shows such raw pain it is difficult to watch. Like Marilyn Monroe's incredible performance in "The Misfits", the viewer sees many of her own demons in the character she plays. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Jo Ann Harris who is perfectly perfect as the flirty Carol. For my money, Harris was the sexiest actress of the 1970s, combining sensuality with intelligence and humor. She was the best reason to watch the "Most Wanted" television series and the only reason to watch Wild Wild West Revisited. Hard to believe that anyone who could bring everything on the screen never became a big star.
