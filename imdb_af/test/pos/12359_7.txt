One day, in Sweden, there was a poor sister of the Salvation Army. At the death of the door she asked, "Send David Holm!" But Victor Sjöström (as David Holm) cannot be located because he spends New Years Eve in a cemetery, with his drinking mates. Dying Sister Astrid Holm (as Edit) wants to see if any of Mr Sjöström's soul has been offered any results over the past year; probably, it didn't. In the cemetery, Sjöström tells the story of "The Phantom Carriage", which he heard from his dead friend Tore Svennberg (as Georges). According to legend, the last person dying in each year must pick up the souls of all the dead until their next New Year's Eve is illuminated. <br /> <br /> Director Sjöström, whose main performance is very strong. , combines with photographer Julius Jaenzon to create a visually appealing movie. The large "double exposure" effect is often used but never looks exaggerated; and it doesn't make the other dramatic highlights of the movie less memorable (for example, Sjöström's tear of his skirt and ax of the door). A Selma Lagerlöf story was probably not one you could have or wanted in the 1920s. It may or may not be why the end of this movie is a deviation. And, unlike similar spiritual stories, it is difficult to suspend your unbelief if you think too carefully about what really happens in "Körkarlen". <br /> <br /> ******* The driver (1/1 / 21) Victor Sjöström ~ Victor Sjöström, Hilda Borgström, Tore Svennberg
