Cleopatra 2525 is a very funny, entertaining show. You don't have to take all the shows seriously, but if you want fun, it's your TV show. Made by the manufacturers of Xena is a quality guarantee, and Cleopatra 2525 is no different from Xena. The female warrior formula is brought to the future, where they must not fight fighters or gods, but dangerous robots living in the surface, and people are forced to live underground. Along the two seasons of Cleopatra, they develop an interesting and funny underground world, and we get to know the three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). They are all different, but as a team they work very well. The three main actresses have previously appeared in Xena, like most of the regular / guest guests (there are also famous faces of Hercules, or of both shows). I especially like the character Danielle Cormack (Ephiny in Xena) played, which is very different from any of her roles I knew before. So if you like Xena and Hercules, you'll love Cleopatra 2525. If you don't know, try it: I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
