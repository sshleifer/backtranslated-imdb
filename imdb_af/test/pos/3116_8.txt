The performances by the male leaders make this long-haired west-interesting world interesting. The soundtrack by the Boys of the Pioneers is one of the most beautiful I have ever heard. The journey itself is somewhat episodic, and Joanne Dru is poorly missed. Overall, it is a very heartwarming and warm western.
