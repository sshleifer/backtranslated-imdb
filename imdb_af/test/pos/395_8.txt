Victor Adult, as a rare civilized and mostly out of control, man and hiker, can be on the poster, but Robert Preston as a failed Union colonel who led his men to get a bond through the Confederal artillery in Shiloh . sent to a Oregon fort for his incompetence, the most interesting part, married to a young and difficult to recognize at the first Anne Bancroft. The uncivilized Adult desires for the colonel's wife, who gives the film an interesting and even dark subplot which so far refers to another man's wife at one point by James Whitmore who plays older and wiser mountain man's figure. Directed by Anthony Mann, this movie is lost under James Stewart among his most famous westerns, but even so, you do not need the Indian threat to make it a movie, although Preston gets his bad judgment as a commander. again in a failed expedition to finally bring the Indians under submission, in a well-advanced attack under the bush that quickly turned into a trail.
