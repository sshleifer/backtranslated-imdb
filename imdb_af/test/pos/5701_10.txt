A surprisingly good documentary. My astonishment was mainly due to the fact that I was confused by the title. I assumed it was about the influence of the drug culture on film, but no it is a far more far-reaching and intelligent movie than could be expected. Demme did a good job of including the period from the late 60's to the late 70's. From 'Easy Rider' and the collapse of studio influence, through all the introspective 'real life' movies, where brilliant young directors try to express themselves politically, sexually and artistically until the start of the bouncers and the return of rule to the money men and their studios. As someone who saw Britain's 'real life' films and the rest of Europe over the sixties and then the revolutionary American films of the 70's and sad that the successor to the successor is so much the order of the day, it was a most fascinating film. The maintenance cuts are measured (thanks to DVD, the full interviews are available as extras!) And the movies are well considered. Also, if someone who is just caught up, 'Joe', I am impressed that this important movie gets her well-deserved entry here.
