It has to be the stupidest movie I've ever seen and that's why it deserves a special award. OK, so it starts out pretty well, logically, humor and then quickly changes to complete and pronounce. The strange thing is that I almost laughed at it, though I think it's funny, with a very serious message. After a moment of thinking why I didn't laugh, the answer was pretty clear ... this movie is much more realistic if I want it. It is therefore extremely silly, yet very sensible if the aim was to reach people who are not "blessed" with many neurons and synapses and electrolytes (huh, electrolytes). This movie can actually be understood by a large audience at some level. <br /> <br /> Although they're probably just laughing. <br /> <br /> Okay, try ... <br /> <br /> I'm now editing (adding) my comment because I read some of the other comments. First I noticed that some people see racism in this movie. Well, it didn't cut me at all when I looked at it. However, I can imagine looking from that perspective, you will see some. Of course, we can discuss the relationship between intelligence and race, but I don't think it's the place to do it. I wonder if we would judge the Huxtable family here, would you complain that they were all black? I don't think so, but I think you can ... (besides that, of the 2 wisest people in the world, half of the woman, don't seem to be quite caucus to me, so "what's the problem?") <br /> <br /> Second, the movie gets very mixed ratings, from 1 to 10 and everything in between, but lots of polarization there, which means the movie does its job very well! It stirs people up, lets them talk about it and judges it "That means it's a good movie, whether you like it or hate it. After 5 minutes it becomes very predictive and boring, but you keep seeing it. I think you hope it doesn't. Or maybe it's our sick way to look at terrible accidents, well, that's one for sure.
