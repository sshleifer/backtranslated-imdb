"The Gig" is a stiff, funny and terribly small movie about a group of friends who regularly met to play Dixieland for fun. The group unexpectedly landed a real paying job, in the music of the musician; a "gig". <br /> <br /> They travel to Upstate NY for a two-week stay at a summer resort, minus one outbreak, due to cancer. At the last moment they hire a professional to get his place. Things are getting tough like an overnight Frankie Valli-type effort to get back to the resort and try to use the band as his band. <br /> <br /> The attitude of the professional bass player made the guys true. By signing up to play the two week's concert, they took bread out of the mouth of someone who needed the work to feed his or her family. While Pop, Rock, Rap, Country and Western, and R&B stars earn money from albums. Jazz musicians must travel abroad to live. Hardly anyone gets rich. The guys who live their dream also cost others an income. <br /> <br /> I believe almost everyone who can play a musical instrument with a few dreams of playing a pay "gig" at some time, Woody Allen and Kevin Bacon are two popular examples of this amateur -to-professional crossover. I especially recommend this movie to anyone who has ever played professional music. My mother, who was a musician, loved it.
