As mentioned before in one of my great reviews, the Universal Pictures' Trilogy or FLASH GORDON should not be classified with the other series. For indeed, the three of them made a kind of celluloid electronic mythology for a spicy, war-phobic middle of the twentieth century. They stand alone in many people's minds as the example of just what a stone hanger was. <br /> <br /> We can remember seeing Buster Crabbhe as a guest on the NBC's late-night show, TOMORROW, hosted by Tom Snyder. It was about 1979-80. During the interview, Mr. Crabbe asked about his personal fitness habits. He has credited weight training and swimming, along with sound dietary habits - which include vitamin and protein supplementation. (And if you believe it, he smoked several cigarettes!) When asked about his profession, Of course, Snyder is the subject of his depiction (and strong identification with) the character of Flash. Buster said he had read and enjoyed the feature in his original medium, which is a cartoon property of Hearst's King Features Syndicate. He said he thought it wouldn't work as soon as it was transferred to the screen! Luckily he was wrong. <br /> <br /> As far as the first series is concerned, it was a very good adaptation to the original continuity of the Sunday Color Comics. The world is about to end due to imminent collision with Planet Mongo. It is for independent work, dr. Zarkov, to rock the wild planet to change its course. He uses Flash and Miss. Dale Arden, recently known paratroopers of the plane, landed in Zarkov's property. <br /> <br /> The Serial excites and manages to make it feel that there is always other danger just outside the film frame. The costumes and d√©cor range from Romanesque to Oriental to Art Decco. It would be easy to suspect that it was due to the tension of Universal, but it was once again true to the creator, the visual concepts of cartoonist Alex Raymond. (Just look at the old strips as in many collections reprint). The rockets were used before, just keep in mind! (Fox 1930), a scientific fiction musical comedy. The other scientific laboratory equipment is provided by Universal's prop dept., As the best Hollywood company to do Horror and SciFi. <br /> <br /> The movie features Jean Rogers (Dale Arden) and Priscilla Lawson (Princess Aura) who come in a good girl against a bad girl battle over Flash. Charles Middleton depicts Emperor Ming in a kind of exaggerated melodramatic villain, but works it. Zarkov (Frank Shannon) has been shown by the sheer madness he suffered in newspaper appearance. (Incidentally, ever wonder how Zar-KOV has a brother?) Richard Alexander makes a fine, strong-built prince Barin, ever useful and so noble. <br /> <br /> Comic actor Jack "Tiny" Lipson is the Surprise of the movie, stealing scene to the scene as a lecherous, Henry VIII like a crook, ally, King Vultan, ruler of the Hawkmen. Among others, Jim Pierce is Prince Thun of the Lion Men. Pierce, like Crabbe, also portrayed Tarzan in a movie, but later married Tarzan's creator, Edgar Rice Bourrough's daughter, Joan. <br /> <br /> FLASH GORDON and the two persecutors, FLASH GORDON'S TRIP TO MARS (1938) and FLASH GORDON CONTINUE THE UNIVERSE (1940), was a staple food for generations, only in the movie houses in Television release . Like good wine, they saw it getting better with age. <br /> <br /> We are all so happy that Mr.Crabbe was wrong.
