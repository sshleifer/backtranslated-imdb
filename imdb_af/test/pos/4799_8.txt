"Nazarin" directed by Luis Bunuel offers an extraordinary view of religion in Mexico. As written by director and Julio Alejandro, his notable collaborator, it was a film that Mexican theater placed on the international map after receiving the Grand Prix in Cannes that year. This is a disturbing movie because Mr. Bunuel is deep in the wrong with the church. <br /> <br /> Nazarin, at all calculations, is a saint. This young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a city's seedy pension. He does not have enough for himself, but he does not mind not separating with a coin when a beggar appears at his window asking for help. At the same time, he took a prostitute who was injured in a fight with another woman. Andara, the woman pays his kindness by burning the room and the whole building! Nazarine is seen and takes to the countryside to pray for food. Andara and Beatriz, two prostitutes from his old town follow him. Nazarins' life is parallel to that of Jesus. In fact, this sacred figure is a matter of humility. <br /> <br /> Of course, Mr. Bunuel had no religion in mind when he and Mr. Alejandro took it upon themselves to create this movie. This is ironic how Spain welcomed him after this film was released because they saw it as Christian traits. In fact, it is a sharp satire on the Catholic church and its preachers. <br /> <br /> The Spanish actor Francisco Rabal makes a wonderful Nazarene. It was one of his best roles. Mr. Rabal worked extensively in his native country, but also in Mexico and Argentina. Rita Macedo, as Andara, is also excellent. Marga Lopez also makes a valuable contribution with her portrayal of Beatriz. <br /> <br /> A great movie by one of the movie's filmmakers: Luis Bunuel.
