I bet I will watch this movie 4 or 5 times a year, and it will do more regularly, now that the Hollyweird abdominal muscles have seen it well on DVD, because it is a classic with a capital letter " C "! This movie is timeless! How can people pay $ 10.00 today to see the JUNK coming out of Hollyweird with films like THE Egyptian; The Ten Commandments; BEN HOW; CAPTAIN NEWMAN MD on tape; DVD; a cable film channel; I can go on forever, but this movie is so big, and for a relative unknown, Edmund Purdom wears the movie like Atlas the world. The story is great, the play is first-rate, and the graphics at the end are so powerful. You sit in your seat for a few minutes, just to drop the words! Really knocking out a movie. I'll give this one 15 stars if they let me go! They no longer make them like this, but they must !!!!!
