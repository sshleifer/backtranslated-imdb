This film by George Fitzmaurice, which has made so many excellent films, is good at its excellent standard. It's sharp, witty, with some wonderful lines, and has the rude Ronald Colman in the romantic lead. Colman plays the irresistible charming younger son of a rich English peer group. He is financially irresponsible (for example, spending £ 15 of his last £ 20 in the world on a cute little terrier he calls George), but open, very generous, disrespectful of lucre, relentlessly in the politically possible way and hopelessly sentimental. He is so dashing that all the women fall in love with him. His girlfriend is a star of the music halls, and so in 1930 a denise of the demi-monde, playing with her typical svelte, smug silvery silence through the youthful Myrna Loy. Fitzmaurice was not a good user of closeups, and gals of that day stunned their faces anyway with that awful claws anyway, so we didn't get such a good look at the faces of the two heroines as we wanted. Anyway, the director looks more interested in the beautiful Colman. The romantic female lead is the youthful and curious Loretta Young, who has not yet become the Proto-July Andrews, we usually know her as, but was still a blushing girl who dries out all the sweetness of a rose garden and happy and wholeheartedly all the time. It is obvious that a character with her tremendous sense of humor was needed to appreciate the snob-busting social anarchism of the refreshing aristocratic character played by Colman. The plot doesn't matter, as so often with these light and amusing movies. It's just as fun.
