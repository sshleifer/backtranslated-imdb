I saw some months before Peter Watkin's Culloden and The War Game and was very impressed. The technique is essentially the same, or at least very similar, in this film on the one hand giving a trial of dissidents in California in the (apparently) near future, and on the other hand the efforts of a group convicted criminals to hit 50 miles from the desert to win their freedom in a state-run "punishment park" as an alternative to prison. Watkins is all in a documentary style, causing more or less discomfort or requiring a strong suspension of unbelief. How is it that the camera crew is in the group for two days with the group of famine and extinct prisoners without help or sharing in their misery? And this is simply the most obvious example. But dubious story telling aside, it packs a punch; No doubt you are interested in political movies to really get involved, but the movie isn't really like anything of its era. It makes no bumps, offers no simple solutions. The left-wing political figures are certainly painted broadly, but they are not all the same; the government functionaries seem a little more cartoon, but even they may show at least a small humanity. Overall, the movie gives a lot to think about and leaves an indelible taste ..... 8/10 DVD rentals
