I certainly didn't see all of Jean Rollin's movies, but they look mostly like bloody vampire-naked women's festivals. If you like that kind of thing, it's not bad, but it's a big room and can almost Cronenberg less the bio-mechanical nightmare stuff. Of course it is in French with subtitles of course. A man riding on the road at night comes across a woman in her slippers and a bathrobe, picking her up, while another woman in the background wears nothing. As they drive, it is clear that there is something that is not right about the woman because she forgets as soon as they happen. Yet it does not seem that the man has sex with her when they return to Paris and his apartment. The man leaves work and a few strangers appear in his place and takes the woman away to this 'tower block', a large apartment building referred to as the Black Tower, where others of its kind (for whom the 'no memory' seems The least of their problems is kept for some reason. Time and happening in the movie, which mostly tries to find what's going on and out of the building for this woman, and she manages to call Robert, the guy who picked her up first, to come and save her. The revelation of what is going on comes in the last few moments of the movie, which touches a rather strange, but at the end. To prevent it from being its "typical" formula, Rollin created in what I feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film. I like this one a lot, check it out. 8 out of 10.
