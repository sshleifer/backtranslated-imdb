Patty Chayevsky was years ahead of the most successful script and drama writers in tackling tough subjects. In this 1971 film, he followed Sinclair Lewis and A. J. Cronin (in ARROWSMITH and THE CITADEL respectively) to critically look at the world of medicine, though his target is at a special stage: a modern Manhattan hospital. Chayevsky's point of view is fairly direct: is the hospital's places where people can go well, or is it money made by organizations where people often die from incompetence. <br /> <br /> As a recent hospital, too many times (and will have to return soon). I find the hospital a very timely and rewarding satire. George C. Scott is Dr. Block, one of the heads of the Manhattan Surgical Center, a major education hospital. He just started his day when he was told that one of the residents of the second year died in an apparent mixture at night. He looked sad and stunned as he slept on a bed (he had a fun with a nurse), and someone had an i.v. containing water with glucose therein (later it appears to have an overdose of insulin in the i.v.). Soon Scott finds that when another member of staff turns around, a heart attack or a blocked operation dies. The key to it all seems to be one patient who, ten days before the examination came to hospital and has since lost one kidney, almost lost her other kidney and is now in a comatose state (Barnard Hughes). <br /> <br /> Hughes' daughter (Diana Rigg) wants to bring the comatose father back to his home on an Apache Indian discussion in Mexico. Scott is not completely opposed to the idea - although hospital errors have almost killed Hughes. Scott also has a crisis in the midst of life with the collapse of his marriage and family and his growing doubts as to what his chosen profession really is. It doesn't just look like a case like Hughes. The hospital is in a constant state of chaos in which regular staff (Scott, Stephen Elliot, Nancy Marchand, Stockard Channing) are overworked and overburdened. They are at war with the business staff (typed by Frances Steenhagen in a very cold show). The local community is hostile because of hospital expansion plans. But when they meet to discuss matters with Elliot, they are divisive (militant Black Panthers versus local clergy versus birth control seeking women and pro-abortion clinics. Types). Rigg (who falls in love with Scott in the course of the film) is becoming more and more sure that the mind of the city is leaving, and Scott also plays the idea. <br /> <br /> Scott was at his acting height in this movie, featuring ANATOMY OF A MOUTH, THE HUSTLER, DR. STRONGLY, and PATTON under his belt before the HOSPITAL. His anxiety registered when he and Rigg knew each other (she prevented him from killing himself because of his despair). He can't tell if anything in hospital is worth it, and shouts the words in the "Summary Line" from the window. Although he later relaxes a little about how well his teaching is for doctors studying with him, Scott is never quite sure. However, he accepts his own sense of responsibility that others just dump. Rigg was also aware of her international fame (if not her acting abilities) - her scam like Mrs. Peel on THE AVENGERS was a few years old, but she was also a leading talent in Britain. as one of the sexiest women artists of that period. <br /> <br /> The supporting actors are also good. Besides the chilling Steenhagen (claiming Medicare / Medicaid / insurance information from comatose patients in the E.R.), there are Hughes as a religious maniac who wins, and Elliot as the retired head of the hospital. There is also my favorite caricature: Richard Dysart as dr. Elwell. Elwell is a butcher who found a real home for himself on the Big Board of the Stock Exchange. He included himself for tax incentives. Anyone who reminds his performances as ethical types, such as the head of the law firm in L.A.LAW or as the friend and doctor of Melvin Douglas in IT THERE, sees her greedy dr. Elwell, another facet of this subordinate actor's talents.
