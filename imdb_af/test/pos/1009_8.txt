I hate football !! I also hate football fans! I hate cars! but this movie was the funniest thing I've seen for some time. <br /> <br /> This weekend I had the opportunity to see this weekend, and all I have to say is I laughed until I cried and when is it available in Britain and Denmark. Girls, this is a football movie you will have to see, its hilarious! <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie started out as some crazy commercial for a telephone company is just wonderful, the guys may not be known. actors, but it is good for eternity, real humor, with real people, and I am complaining to one to take it on the screen. <br /> <br /> WELL GONE!
