As a prolonged admirer of the 2001 film "Moulin Rouge" and a more recent fan of Jean Renoir's movie, I knew that sooner or later I was watching his "French Cancan". The movie tells a fictional story of the opening of the Moulin Rouge nightclub. The impresario Danglard (Jean Gabin) is trying to make Montmartre laundries Nini (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) in a cancan star, without raising the wrath of his stormy mistress, the belly dance Lola (Maria Felix). This is just one of several love triangles in French Cancan. This is true to stereotype. These French showbiz people always fall in love. <br /> <br /> Renoir, with its typical soft humor and attention to supporting characters, also wrote the lyrics to a beautiful walleye that featured prominently in the movie. Gabin perfectly embodies the aging French playboy hero. Arnoul is a cute redhead that holds her own in the dance numbers, except for a few trick shots where a double of course is used. <br /> <br /> "French Cancan" is charged as a musical comedy and while there are a lot of musical numbers taking place on the nightclub stage, etc., just one character, Casimir, ever breaks into a song in the in the middle of the conversation. The actor who plays him, Philippe Clay, is nice to watch - a very long, skinny young man who sings, dances and pushes. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with a long cancan sequence, like everything The characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together. The dance is very brightly lit and coherently edited as in "Moulin Rouge"; In fact, if I have one complaint about "French Cancan", the whole thing is a bit too Technicolor. Even when Nini is experiencing sadness or someone is singing a melancholy song, the lighting is bright and flat, with no shadows breaking into it. Yes, the result is a cheerful and warm cordial musical comedy; It's just that I can't help thinking that things weren't really this colorful and innocent in real life.
