Well, I'm not about adding the diatribe preaching about this movie. <br /> <br /> All I can add is that it doesn't in any way pretend to be a "historic" picture. Unlike 'Braveheart', 'Titanic' or 'The Patriot', all of them have very credible and serious historical changes, purely for theatrical effects (possibly the worst excuses). <br /> <br /> Did everyone bypass a sense of humor? <br /> <br /> All I can add is a paraphrase of the good Captain Macleane - "It looks fantastic and we have a bloody good laugh." <br /> <br /> - One last point. What surprised me is that there is commentary on 'modern music' in a historic setting. I wonder if the same people made the same about Moulin Rouge. I'm not suggesting.
