I just read what I believe to be an analysis of this movie by a lyrical Irishman. Beautiful to read. <br /> <br /> But a brief analysis of this movie is that it is a weathering of the seven deadly sins with the four types of justice. <br /> <br /> Envy, greed, pride, laziness, anger, etc. and justice in the forms of retribution, distribution, blindness and divinity. <br /> <br /> I could demonstrate three examples of each, one for each of the three protagonists; However, it is very nice to observe it for yourself. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it.
