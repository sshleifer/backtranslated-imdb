I'm surprised there is confusion about the title of this movie. This is, of course, an investigation into the nature of modern love. It indicates that love is love while the passage is going well, but one in which people retain the right to set themselves first, and if it gets difficult, they go out and go to something else. <br /> <br /> This observation has generational implications as it comes from Generation X, comments on Generation X, and is ultimately aimed at Generation X. It is disappointing that love has changed from what the Baby Boomers, Generation X's parents came into being in their marriages and family life, giving Generation X the innocent and abundant childhood it eventually enjoys. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Generation X attitude to love is flippant, but when decisions are made and commitments are broken, the biggest accident is the children of Generation X. This is made clear at the end of the movie, and it was so sharp that I took a week to recover from the shock I received from this epiphany.
