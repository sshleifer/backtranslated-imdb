First, I was a fan of the show back when my PBS station started displaying it in 1981. I learned a lot about the show and the people involved in the show. <br /> <br /> This last installment of Doctor Who made me a big impression. The original range, also a classic series, is made pleasantly by the bad special effects and / or wobble sets. Well, that's no longer true. The special effects are great, but what's even better is the writing. You get a chance to learn more about our beloved doctor and perhaps a bit of the reason why he loves the planet earth so much. Without giving away too much, it's a very good range to watch. Christopher Eccelston brought a doctor's side that we will never see, a bitter and angry but at the same time loving. <br /> <br /> A MUST SEE!
