I absolutely love this movie. Everything about it. It almost didn't feel like watching my friends and me on the screen. The way this film was filmed was a pure masterpiece, very original and creative. I relate to these characters and even have the same thoughts as some. I'm really glad I ran over this movie. If there was more genius like Justin out there!
