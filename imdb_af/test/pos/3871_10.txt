Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been! I like watching him !! I was 10 years old (1979) when I first saw him. I wait every day for everything he is going to do. Hopefully someday I will see him personally. He is very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanded and strong! He is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning !!!! In my opinion, he is the greatest actor ever seen! I loved him in "Dracula" (along with many other girls out there) and in "God created woman", "House of D", "Jason and the argonauts" and more. I thought he was genius !!!!!! can't wait to see him in "good night and strength"
