"Curse of Monkey Island" is a treasure; In my opinion, the series as a whole was the holy grail of adventure game, not to mention LucasArts. <br /> <br /> But to return to "Curse," which is beautiful about CMI, it's not afraid to be self. This deviates from the first two, but remains true to the Ron Gilbert productions (if it can only be said about the fourth installment of the series!). The voice work is impeccable, with Dominic Armato playing our favorite protagonist Guybrush Threepwood. The animation, while very different from the classic pixelated characters, is beautifully done. It really is absolutely beautiful. And the music is fantastic! It is never annoying and you never have the urge to turn it off. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not too big, the romantic plays and themes aren't overwhelming at all. They also have the scarce ability to come off as sweet instead of cheese. It says a lot about a girl falling asleep during chicks. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, the classic MI element of humor. CMI is pretty skilled at delivering deadpan lines, totally absurd humor, and just great fun. Gary Coleman makes a cameo as an emerging young entrepreneur, and world events are strategically tackled without leaving the limits of the game. <br /> <br /> It is not quite fair to compare CMI to MI and MI2, because it's true in its own area. Personally, I can never find a favorite between the 3, as they are all completely different. However, if you want a good thing about the flair of the classic series, I insist that you give this game a shot. You will NOT be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars, hands off. <br /> <br /> - Emily N
