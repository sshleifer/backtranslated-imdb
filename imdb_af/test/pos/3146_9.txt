In the world of "shorts" (most of which are not), this film is a jewel. <br /> <br /> A quiet, concise look into the world of a young woman who is a blind woman reader, here is the star Elizabeth Franz - this film contains the textures, low and visual narration of a wonderfully painted still life. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is minimal, the cinematography is amazing and the direction sure, clear and compelling. I watched this movie in a film festival held in a hard Tribeca bar. And within the first two minutes (and the first time that night) the crowd became silent. <br /> <br /> That's all it says.
