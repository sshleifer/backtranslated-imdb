Christopher Boyce, who was in Los Angeles in the 1970s, just went out of school and returned when his father found him a job monitoring intelligence documents. His old friend, Daulton Lee, is a deadly drug dealer and is trapped in a set-up and has to choose between a nark or a long jail in jail. When he is on bail, he jumps and heads to Mexico City. Chris offers Lee a partnership to sell his messenger secret papers to the Soviet Union Embassy in Mexico City, due to the shame he feels about the US government's control over weaker countries to their own profits. But over time, the two begin to clash with their motivations and find them in something bigger than they originally intended. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger has such films as the respectable Midnight Cowboy, Marathon Man, Sunday Bloody Sunday and Day of The Locust, while "The Falcon and the Snowman" may not be so high It is no question that this dreary spy drama (inspired by a true incident) is an unfairly exaggerated character portrait, all of which is quite a subdued affair with no real greatness qualities that hit a massive point. movie of the movie must be the breathtaking versatile main shows of Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as the two ambitious girls Chris and Daulton, Penn is particularly good at his awkward intensity, which works well with Hutton's wonderfully cool and fetching turn. so easy, we watch the situation gradually crumbling, as the two amateurs really find themselves out of their league, the highly detailed and symbolic (robotic) plot focusing mainly on the relationship of the two and their reasoning for their actions, which ultimately shows us the pretty developments that led to their demise. The plan opens up like a wound never to cure properly, due to Daulton's drug addiction, which really makes him leave the rails and leaves Chris to pick up all slack. The harsh political aspect is there, but it focuses on the themes of idealism (Boyce) and greed (Lee) to persuade his point. Both should not mix and show results. Suspension is justified by its stimulating pot-boiling script and character interactions than those of any visual gimmicks. Action is very few, but there is still a pressure-induced style for Schlesinger's assured and realistically dark 'gritty direction'. The tension is mostly well handled, though some series turn on too long, but it grips you as it plays on its authentic paranoid tone to slowly build up to an explosive, sluggish end. Sufficient in the technical production is a volatile music party and professionally gripping cinematography. The supporting role is extremely good with Pat Hingle, Lori Singer, David Suchet, Boris Leskin, Jerry Hardin and Joyce Van Patten. Also look at Michael Ironside in a small part as an FBI agent. <br /> <br /> A very special spy movie that largely benefits from talented top performances and doesn't play the regular game. It's more an emotional ride, then a complex one of the turn. Recommended.
