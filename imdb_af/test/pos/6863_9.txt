I was shocked at how well this German version of movies was like Scream. Exceeds all modern American efforts at slasher movies. <br /> <br /> It's like all the movies don't. Similar characters, true mystery, tension, graphic murders and a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> This stylish horror movie is one of the best of its kind to come out years. The German film only goes from strength to strength from time to time. It is a pity that more people will not see such films because they are missing out. It's easily available on DVD, so even if you hate subtitles, I think you should see it. This will be one of the best horror movies you'll see all year long.
