I really only watched this movie because it had Rupert Grint in it (which I knew as Ron of the Harry Potter movies). I never appreciated Rupert as an actor for this movie. I loved the whole movie. Rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious, quirky movie. I think the movie could have been good without the sex, but it worked somehow. I can't wait to see more of Rupert's films in the future. Julie Walters also did a wonderful job. In the Harry Potter movies she has a very small role, so I didn't know what to expect from her either. But she was wonderful like Lady Evie. The part where she swallowed the key was absolutely hilarious. Overall, a wonderful movie.
