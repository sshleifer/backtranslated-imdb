Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is plagued by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), a terrorist bomber who literally believes he won't be caught. In the opening, everyone's favorite modern series killer, John Kramer (Tobin Bell), is the Saw Series. Through smart planning and influence, Frank can arrest the arrest of Mendoza (Bell). <br /> <br /> From here, it's a series of cat and mouse hunting. Malkovich is a great actor and incredibly versatile. Yet another role in this film he shows me with his ability to exchange his characters with the next film. <br /> <br /> I watched Malkovich in Con Air as a threatening, clever Cyrus, in Van Muise and Men as the tragically challenged bunny lover Lenny, to name a few. He plays a very clever bombing terrorist who is very minded, but is deceived into thinking he can defuse his catches. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood is no one special to me. He is too old to really do a lot of action in movies, so the only thing he really enjoys with you is his ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters he plays are simplistic and one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo plays Eastwood's love interest in the movie and enchants me to be a bigger part for me than Eastwood's. <br /> <br /> While it may seem like an action block, it's relatively slow and playable. You have to wait for the build-up and the end and it will eventually be paid off. Along the way you are fascinated by Malkovich and Eastwood's chemistry and their scenes of cat and mouse.
