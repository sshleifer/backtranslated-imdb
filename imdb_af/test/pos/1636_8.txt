Yes, I know my title sucks. I couldn't think of any other title. x] Ice is a brilliant first season episode. Very interesting idea and good acting. The whole worm-looking thing was very creepy in my opinion. I've never been a fan of insects, so all the insect episodes are creepy to me. x] Anyway, we can go for the good and bad things about this episode, <br /> <br /> The Good: The parasite thing. Awesome! <br /> <br /> Eventually, Scully trusts Mulder. Awww ... <33 <br /> <br /> It was a good idea to put another parasite in it. Although someone told me, I had to put that thing in my ear. I think the whole cabin will be dead. <br /> <br /> The Bad: How did the dog live so long? <Br /> <br /> How did Huffman not get those black spots? Or maybe she did, but nobody saw it. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Very good episode, especially for Season 1. 8/10
