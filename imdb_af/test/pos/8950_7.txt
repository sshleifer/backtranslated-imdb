Once again I see this kind of movie more and more in English humor, which has not been seen too often since the days of Monty Python and Man About The House. Too bad. <br /> <br /> Brenda Blethyn (who I saw in Saving Grace early in the year should see another one.) Excellent, as does Alfred Molina. The rest of the movie, while almost unknown, also makes good performances. The movie starts slowly and gradually becomes tempo and entertainment. In the middle I had tears in my eyes to laugh. <br /> <br /> All in all, a funny English movie, a thousand times better than the so-called "funny" garbage It comes from Hollywood. <br /> <br />
