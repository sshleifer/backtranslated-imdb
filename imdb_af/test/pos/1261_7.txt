This movie was the launch of many of us to the works of K Gordon Murray. That's because it was easy to find. It was on every public domain name in the VHS era, and before that was a late night. cult classic, double knee-beater. Besides, how do you resist the title? <br /> <br /> For late arrivals, a brief explanation of it's merits: Florida Wheeler dealer K. Gordon Murray introduced Mexican horror films, bought them in English, then made a coin with them at the ride . The Mexican ORIGINES were strange enough to start with; American borders and accepted horror movie conventions were cheerfully ignored. Great, wonderful design and lighting are placed along strange or laughing special effects. Nothing in Hollywood was as close as it was strange. Now mixing in Catholics influences social conventions, Mexican folk lore, and we're no longer in Kansas. <br /> <br /> ADD THAT English scripts they were bought. Most were written by Reuban Guberman, who wanted the movements of the actors' lips to match, not the literal translation. As a result, the American soundtracks tended to run from cross to right. There is even a fan site for Murray that is the best print, most top line for each movie. The first time viewers of the films are complaining about the pacing, the press, the production values ​​and being told that it is SUPPOSED to be that way. While people are delighted with things that are normally considered deadly movie mistakes. It must be very confusing if you don't taste it. <br /> <br /> This one was made back in 1957 with the two previous films in the series; AZTEC MUMMY AND AZTEC MUMMY COURSE. All three are now available on the 3-disc AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION (BCI) and it's about time. It has the K Gordon Murray version on the one hand, the original Mexican production on the other. The contrast between the two is fascinating. Many of the times, the original Spanish is not much more. <br /> <br /> ROBOT / MUMMY starts with a nice long flashback that makes you speed up the previous episodes. Similar continuity was thrown out. window in number two, and it is logically sensible from behind. You don't even get the angel back, or any mention of him in this last episode. Names, places, even family trees vary between movies. After a while you start LOOKING for the continuity changes. <br /> <br /> By now, the series crook Doc Krupp is completely crazy, almost demented, and the Aztec breastplate still wants to steal. Rosita Arenas is sent back to the past with another good editing of the AZTEC MUMMY flooring program, and walks out in the dark in her nightmare to help find the doggone chest plate again. The mummy is not happier with it, then he was the last time. <br /> <br /> The robot actually has a production credit. It was made by 'Viana & Co S.A.'. I call it because it seems the grip arose between a slow afternoon when the right costume was going. No. <br /> <br /> It was PLAN. <br /> <br /> Wait until you see the controller that runs it. X box, where were you when Krupp needed you ??? The Robot LOOKS was killed in the end, but actually returned to two more Mexican films. It had a FAN BASE. <br /> <br /> All in all, a funny exciting finish on a three movie series. Sit back and enjoy.
