Joe is the film about the dark side of the power of the 1960s in America, and Susan Sarandon had good boobs. This movie scared me so much when I saw it in the theater that I had never liked Peter Boyle until Young Frankenstein and was still learning a lot from him even after that comedy. Looking back on today's experience, this film looks active again, and it is directly and to the point of half the voters' approval of John McCain's "Joe The Plumber" type and their fear of a black man as US president in the coming weeks. . A Black Prez will be seen as a sweet revenge by the "niggers", but bound to bring much fire again, if not the streets, this time by Joe enthusiasts. So, Joe's spirit in the movie is aroused by Joe The Lumber's campaign! Still, I love American and am afraid of both and knowing they are illustrating what ironic Gregory Peck said our civilized law is also: "a living, breathing reality!" God helps us.
