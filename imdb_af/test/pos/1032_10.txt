President Harry S. Truman once said that the only thing new in the world is the history you do not know. Seven years before Richard Rhodes's excellent Pulitzer Prize winner "Making the Atomic Bomb", the BBC produced a seven-part miniseries, "Oppenheimer". It was a character study of the people who designed the weapon that started in the Atomic era. They have permanently joined science and technology with the state (and especially the army), not just making history, but changing the world forever. <br /> <br /> The production is impeccable, the decisive thing is not miraculous; Not only the main characters, but even secondary characters carry unprecedented similarities with the people depicted. In particular, Sam Waterston is in the title role of US physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the Manhattan project, based on the Los Alamos, NM laboratory (the premises for which he personally chose); Manning Redwood as General Leslie R. Groves, who oversaw the entire Manhattan Engineering District (the project's formal name); David Suchet as physicist and ultimate nemesis of Oppenheimer, Edward Teller (who whispered 40 years later in Ronald Reagan's ear and brought us the Strategic Defense Initiative - Star Wars) and Jana Sheldon as Kitty Oppenheimer. The attention to detail is uniquely excellent. <br /> <br /> Sharing thriller, sharing love story - and finally a tragedy, this series actually recreates a chapter in world history - and that of science - that we dare not forget. Highest recommendation. <br /> <br /> (PLEASE NOTE: Viewers enjoying this series also enjoy the source of Jacob Bronowski's 13-part series "The Ascending of Man" and the BBC movie by Michael Frayn's play "Copenhagen" .)
