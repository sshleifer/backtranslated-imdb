It's an amazing movie, and if you haven't seen it, go to the video store now and rent it. First, the role play is excellent. Not only do current stars, such as Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton, but also have your stars of old like Judge Reinhold. It also has many cameos by actors such as Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson, and Jamie Lee Curtis. Secondly, the story was also very good. It was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie, and it made it almost dramatic. It takes the drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving it a comic face as in "Half-baked", it has a true lifelong image like "Traffic". So look at this movie. If you are a stoner, it will give you insight into something you love. If you do not use drugs, it will give you more realistic views of drugs than you want to see.
