plantonrules' comments should be written on Topsy-Turvy Day, for everything set by the simple life form is the opposite of real truth! <br /> <br /> 'Bluebeard's Eighth Woman' is hilarious in every scene, in every way - the chemistry between Colbert and Cooper couldn't have been finer. supporting casting is excellent. <br /> <br /> Writing and direction is wonderful !!! <br /> <br /> Like so many other comments On this board I complain again: "Why can't movies be that way?" <br /> <br /> This is the classic Paramount 1930's screw ball comedy at its best, people!
