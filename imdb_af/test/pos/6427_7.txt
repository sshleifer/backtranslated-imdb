Footprints are a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to categorize. "Psychological thriller" is the most appropriate description I can think of. The female protagonist, Alice Cespi, discovers that she has remembered nothing of the past three days. The only idea she has is a torn photo of a hotel. She is also chased by a repetitive, very lively, dream about a science fiction film she believes she has seen many years ago. In her pursuit of the truth behind her memory loss she does not trust anyone, but it becomes obvious that she has visited the town where the hotel was before. It is an exciting movie whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how events will unfold, and especially how it will end. The unusual loneliness of the main character and the unreliability of everyone else ensure that the good old paranoid feel is present throughout the film, while beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed rows also make it a visually attractive movie. The key part of one and only Nicoletta Elmi, everyone's favorite redhead, petty child star of Italian horror, is an added bonus.
