The whole short hand that you are more aware of in this strange time is that you are "Blue". The blue state mentality. It is supposed to take us off the hook for what has happened in our country over the past few years (USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook, but it makes us feel better not to benefit from it and get all the good things an American citizen gets, just by being an American citizen. <br /> <br /> But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It does nothing good. I haven't done much action lately and I wonder how many people have. Maybe I'm just down because my job was outsourced last month and now I'm looking for work in the shrinking technology support field where most of the work goes quickly to India and elsewhere. I think so soon that it won't afford to be a citizen here with the screwed infrastructure and the shrinking labor market and the obsession with the war. Nowadays, everyone speaking, jumping and interrogating seems to be "patriotism". Anyway, back to this review: USA The Movie is an obscure DVD that makes me realize that some people are acting, whether through politics, protest or art or media. The filmmaker is, of course, passionate, knowledgeable, willing to go beyond the norm, frustrated, unique, clever, etc. <br /> <br /> I watched the entire site linked to the DVD and in all the articles etc there. The DVD does it too, has references to different times, views and historical points. Sometimes someone does something out there.
