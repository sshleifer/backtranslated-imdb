I like Breillat's movies, but this one is the best I have seen to balance animal warmth with sexual intelligence. Anne Parillaud is electric, and the script is wonderful - especially since it is supposed to be on the set of another Breillat movie. You don't have to agree with her to get everything out of it. It made me think about vulnerability and power. Try to suggest a male director with Jeanne's openness - not impossible, but a little bit of understanding. The unannounced sexual undercurrents that are always present when people come together to make something are kept here in bright light, but not a cold light.
