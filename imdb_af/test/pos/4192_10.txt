Suppose it doesn't happen: when the Monkeys commit suicide by jumping the Golden Gate Bridge! Take Drugs - Take Many Drugs: Take as many drugs as the movie and crew apparently did while making this movie! <br /> <br /> With Monkeys unveiled themselves as the fearsome, sneakiest entertainers in Hollywood's history, bar none. It is confusing to discover that they have blamed the failure of this film on a bad promo. To be sure, promotion was virtually non-existent; but didn't they know how angry, how fairly depressed, how self-destructive is this movie really? I mean, this movie is a journey - on bad acid - to the suicide section of a mental hospital. The only movie I know to be depressed is Terry Gilliam's Brazil; And like Brazil, this film reveals why life in the late 20th century was almost unbearable - if you were happy. It's not just that Western culture suffers from serious information overload, but the information itself was just bad, bad, worse, and gloomy. In fact, it was the over-tax effect itself that kept people, as it allowed people to divert themselves with some crisis - if news from Vietnam had become too much to carry, they could turn the channel and a documentary on the rise look at unemployment rate. <br /> <br /> The "positive" response to reality revealed in Chapter was Woodstock - three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and bugs and bad food and dirty drinks and shit and squeak and bad acid and Peter Townsend barely killed Abbie Hoffman. Everything that happens behind a steel fence under the loving watchful eyes of a true NY State troop army - which means that the "freedom" of Woodstock nation was so illusory as the song John Sebastion thought he was singing while he so outspoken, he could barely speak. "500,000 assholes too stupid to get out of the rain," was one critic's statement about Woodstock (I think it was Andy Warhol). <br /> <br /> The one good thing there was was Jimi Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner. Two years earlier, the Jimi Hendrix Experience went on their first national tour of America, as the warm-up band for the Monkeys began. <br /> <br /> See, it's all connected in some way. <br /> <br /> You owe it to yourself - no, you owe it to your unborn children - to see the right 1960s, just to get on film in this bizarre, miraculous and totally absurd tribute to one of those more interesting capitalist deception of the later 20th century.
