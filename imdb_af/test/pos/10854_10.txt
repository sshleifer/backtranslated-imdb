As a lesbian, I'm sick and tired of being portrayed in movies and on television as a sad person, forever disillusioned between suicide and murder, but never destined to find happiness? <br /> <br /> If you, like me, have your courage with Hollywood's anti-lesbian propaganda, you will have a sigh of relief from this beautiful BBC offer. Nan Astley is the daughter of an Oysterhouse restorer who "is wondering why she can't feel the way she feels about Freddy" (one of the local girls who has his eye on her). His fall ?? and fall hard? for Kitty Butler, a male imitator with a visiting theater group. Nan accompanies Kitty to London as her dressing room? <br /> <br /> Not everything that happens to Nan is pleasant in this story and some of the things she does are not funny - but she will win your heart and her story of love will triumphantly leave. with a beautiful bud in your throat at the end. <br /> <br /> If you are a lesbian macho man or a homophobic housewife, or a trademark of religious fundamentalists who believe that homosexuals should die and go to hell, this series is not for not you. But if you have a heart, and you believe in love, you will cry to the end as much as I did!
