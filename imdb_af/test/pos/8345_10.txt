I am a college student and I bought this movie at a used bookstore because it sounded very funny from the back description. Nothing will prepare me for what the most beautiful movie would ever be! <br /> <br /> It's especially good to see if you're an atheist, like me. Because then you can see how stupid these Christian people are. They seem to think non-believers are living in really disgusting, messy homes and doing nothing but drinking beer, and to mean neighbors. It's a LAST ROT! <br /> <br /> My friends and I watch it every few weeks so we can be entertained beyond our wildest imagination! See this movie NOW! <br /> <br /> Let's hope Rich Christiano makes more of these movies to entertain our pagans!
