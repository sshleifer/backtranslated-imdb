No matter what country you have to buy in this stock exchange. Certainly, it's Australian. If you've ever seen an attempt of our comedy, they suck a lot, but with the hunter's it is not boring forty-year-old men who make bad words, they are a team of people talking about current affairs (pretty much in Australia) fun from our crap ads, make fun of our politicians and so on. <br /> <br /> In 2002, the guys also had a show called Cnnnn which was not as successful as the War that only started this year, so all they talk about is the current news that is really good is, as it doesn't matter how boring or tragic it is, they try to make a little humorous light shine on things.
