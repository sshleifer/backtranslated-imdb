Dr. Franz Tobel, a Swiss scientist, is being smuggled out of his homeland by Sherlock Holmes so that the Nazi agents are not spying on his invention of a new collision. In London, he joins Holmes and Watson, but joins his girlfriend, Charlotte Eberli, with his girlfriend, where he leaves Holmes about the places of his clash, which he divided into four, but Holmes's eternal nemesis, professor Moriarity is also looking for the bumblebee to sell to the Nazis, and kidnapped Dr. Tobel and the clue left at Charlotte's, a code series of dancers, who can't both decipher both Holmes and Moriarity. . Holmes eventually discovers the clue to the code and gets the place of the fourth part of the clash, but Moriarity has the other three and a revelation is inevitable. Very good entry into the Holmes series with lots of mystery and guesswork to go over. Atwill's depiction of Moriarity is more sadistic than the sly type described in the Doyle stories (or George Zucco's performance in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), but Atwill's actor skills make his Moriarity rather merciful. The writing and direction both make this entry more of a cat and mouse game between the two characters and this is one of the reasons why this entry is so successful. Also good work on cinematography. Evaluation, 8.
