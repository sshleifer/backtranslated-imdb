I would give this television series a plus 10 if I could. The authors were "smack on" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus for the show. These characters were so real. One can tell about the two main actresses, Ms. Toussaint and Mrs. Potts, that their relationship was on and off camera. It not only ended when you hear the familiar words "Cut" at the end of a "Tasks". The show gave me lots of life for b. Historical struggle, tragedies and triumphal relationships, relationships, everyday situations, every household has the same situations, no matter who the members are. It really came down to being a wonderful family program. At the end of each episode you can just sit on your lounge sofa and tell yourself "now what I've learned about this particular episode". <br /> <br /> I have to say I tied most of the episodes and I find myself looking over and over. /> <br /> Now you know why I gave it a 10+ !!
