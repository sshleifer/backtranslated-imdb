Again, I read all the comments posted here and agree with the very intelligent people, but totally agree with those who think it was / is loft. Personally, I think core is the only Energy left to us, unless our governments (feds and states) increase the allowances, think homeowners will use photo cells on their roofs. Many attractive and beautiful homes in Southern California are designed and built to take advantage of the cleanest energy around the sun. I live in a loft, which is exposed to total sunlight on its roof all day. I barely use the AC - I'm sure it will consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees cooler. We are blessed with "dry" heat in this part of the country. I'm from the Gulf Coast of the US, so I know about humidity ....... <br /> <br /> That said, I found that the China Syndrome is a convincing movie about what can go on wrong, if the industry is not controlling and inspecting nuclear power plants. I think there are plenty of comments posted here to lift those who are still terribly bothering them: they are safe. TMI is still online. <br /> <br /> Director James Bridges carefully guides this plot (by Mike Gray-T S Cook) to create tension and a thoroughly interesting movie. All the roles were well played: Jane Fonda (Kimberly Wells), Jack Lemmon (Jack Godell) and producer Michael Douglas ("Richard Adams") are excellent in their roles, plus all the other role players. I also loved there was no score. It was so interesting to get a glimpse of the rear screens of the TV industry. It shouldn't be surprising. Currently Dan is the suitor of CBS, and I hope he wins. Can you believe Donald Trump says he's a loser? Trump - who cares? Tiberius1234 "posted a very good comment here - I agree. It is my opinion that it is" vaporized "by a nuclear is much better than being in a wasted world, and becoming" Blade Runner "and / or "Solyent Green." Get away from your video games for a few hours and watch this "dated" movie, and get some training on nuclear power, and I recommend it to the whole family.
