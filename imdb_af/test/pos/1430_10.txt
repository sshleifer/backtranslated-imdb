The man with the golden army, Otto Preminger's controversial, panoramic crime drama, plays out among the mental descriptions of his living and architectural occupants, in rhythmic, lashing arrangement. The opening of the film, a close-up of inside a Frankie bar that is being peered through the window, already tells us the prominence that the protagonist's subjective experience will understand. Towards ever-lighter spaces, the film closes off, as the local gangster's long stretched poker game turns itself off from the daylight, in the sense that Sinatra's Frankie Machine himself closed in a celebrated room. of his sad struggle to overcome his habit. By obscuring the shape and faces of its jazz-like urban harbor, the visual distinction in The Man with the Golden Arm distinguishes skewed psychological conditions that form an overwhelming environment, as maintained by the repetitive tracing shots near Frankie's eyes. <br /> <br /> The grace of this fiery drama, which shoots as early as the exciting crane shoot, displays the command of the observable world that allows studio production. The wonderfully dilapidated urban sets define an independent place without beginning or ending, an indefinite state, the kind that actually does not last as long as this tortuous row looks before it is moderated or leveled. The flair of certain performances, especially Robert Strauss, as the wonderfully named underworld golf boss Schwiefka and Arnold Stang as Frankie's reliable four-eyed dogdog, pleases this fiery surrealistic feature. The incidence of drug addiction, Sinatra's power generation, Elmer Bernstein's infectious, powerful jazz score and Saul Bass's famous influential and controversial opening period, sitting on the animated paper cutout of a heroin addict's arm, ensured the man with his era the Golden Poor presses on the case for realism in the silent Hollywood. It is impressionistic and subjective, as I say, but its intention, its power and its spirit are much closer to home. <br /> <br /> What absorbs me most in this movie is its aspect as a gangster movie. It has the illegal card games, short disadvantages, the battles, the guns, the double crosses, the characters on the lamb, a femme fatale, a beautiful sexy rifle, the shady nightclubs and the urban landscape, but it does more than do it to exploit. environment for entertainment. Really, this is the perfect environment and genre to tell this story, an urban village that is criminal, where it is too easy to escape a bottle or two, or three or four, or drugs, a passing dose. that really just works to keep someone in the dark from any relief and all the clear scenarios the world can offer.
