The movie is not for everyone. Some may think the play is bad if it is actually underestimated and natural. There are no obvious evil acts and there are no wonderful beautiful moments. There are many uncertainty, very contradictory feelings. <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie is a very honest look at a very complex subject, Gender with Minors. It's complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when her body and hormones continue to evolve and both their thoughts and personalities continue to evolve. Complex also because society has very simple views of sex with minors and is complex because the characters do not know whether society is right or if their instincts are right. <br /> <br /> Some won't like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions. Questions like who were really in charge of the relationship, which was damaged, came out well, it was art, which was more damaged, had some of the problems with their relationship because it was banned by society, some of the problems rests on their own immaturity, and most likely, was it really a crime? <br /> <br /> The movie is resolutely neutral on all these things, and it is this neutrality that is its power. This is the reason for underrated, simple sets, lack of background music, soft lighting and the general "flat" presentation. The message is clear. We don't really understand this kind of relationship today, and quick judgments should be level.
