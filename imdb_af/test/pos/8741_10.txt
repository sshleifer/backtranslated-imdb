Beginning on or around 1965 American films made a shock for the shocking and iconoclastic ones that were wonderful for the times - kind of seed that would force the way for more eager, daring plays. Since the many decades that these films have given birth to are so prevalent through their own beliefs, most of the films released during this period are dated. CACTUS FLOWER is no exception. His title gives a sunny romantic comedy that sometimes falls into the risqué. It should not be said that this is a bad thing. On the contrary, risqué topic films have to start somewhere and America is a culture rooted in specific traditions, shocking itself in deep hypocrisy, even for the sake of the fact that it is an indirect reflection of the mores of the time. Meanwhile, European films are falling into the same situation, running down like a million dollars, and keeping shelf life for a shameful time, they are scandalous, show off, "Next" and continue. <br /> <br /> Toni Simmons (Goldie Hawn in her outbreak role), a young sixty-year-old boy, continues with an older dentist named Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), who has commitment issues. He can't marry her: he's already married. Toni decides rather than delete, she really wants to meet his wife and "put things straight." In the picture comes his assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (a light Ingrid Bergman, who returns to the American cinema after a twenty-year absence), a woman closer to his age, acting as if she and the perfect marriage and household had . There is a reason for this: she had silent feelings for Julian, his unaware emotions, even when he asked her to play his wife to deviate from Toni to stop their relationship. And then he rises a bit when Toni's lucky innocent action takes place in the unexpected and he sets Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston) known as Stephanie's "lover". By the way, Harvey is also an older man who has a relationship with a much younger woman (Eve Bruce), of whom he is also in one very funny scene. <br /> <br /> It's funny how the person we're looking for is the one that's always been there. What could be an ungrateful role for Rick Lenz, who plays Igor Sullivan, Toni's neighbor neighbor, was a man who saw not only true beauty in Stephanie, but also the one that Toni saved at the start, to kill herself . (Not the comedy, suicide. It's not your average comedy either.) And of course, Ingrid Bergman's subtle, spicy portrayal of a woman who somehow missed her chances of love, whose tail has become , which because of a lie tells someone else she becomes the right person she was always meant to be. I can't imagine anyone else in this quiet but deep role. <br /> <br /> Films like this can be appreciated and seen as an escape competition - a product of its times - or viewed for the deep symbolism it carries deep within, like its title. It's a tough movie, just like Hawn's and Bergman's performance is as difficult as it looks so simple, without thriving and setting, not coming out and explaining what they're about. Their acting is "not really acting" but playing real people, warts and everyone. CACTUS FLOWER is a story that never takes itself seriously, but reveals itself deeply and very humanly.
