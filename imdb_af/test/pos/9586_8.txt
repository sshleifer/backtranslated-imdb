I always enjoy watching this cartoon, while Sylvester is trying to catch Tweety on a train, rather than at Grandma's house. It's actually a standard fee, but entertaining, especially when Tweety pulls the emergency stop. One of my complaints about this is how messy the animators were at the train. Watching it over and over, as my little boy did (who likes trains, that's why he liked it so much), you start to see something. <br /> <br /> In this brief, the position of the luggage car has changed on the train, 3rd, 4th or 5th, and in long shots at all. The engine has the number 651 or 814, or not at all. The coal tender has the number 99, or the letters "S.P. & Q.R." on it, or no number or letters. The coaches carry the "S.P.Q.R." without the "&" in long shots, and then in closeups it has the words "SouthEast and Western." <br /> <br /> It does not affect the story, but the production data is obviously not watched. in very careful. <br /> <br /> Yet, this cartoon is one of my favorites with Sylvester and Tweety.
