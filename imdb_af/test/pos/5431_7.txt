It was an interesting movie ... half-comedy, half-political excitement. It had very good elements, although it was a bit predictable. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams stars as Tom Dobbs, a popular comedian with a hit show in which he makes political commentary. Think daily show with John Stuart. At the conclusion of one of his shows, a woman in the audience tells him to run for president. This, followed by some serious jokes, was all that was needed to make the ball roll and start Dobbs's political career. <br /> <br /> He runs independently, fighting equally against democrats and republicans. He is straight and honest, and is becoming increasingly popular - but perhaps not popular enough to actually win. He is clearly the suspect in this election. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a corrupt software company has created a program that is much faster and easier for ordinary people to vote for, but there is an error. The glitch is discovered by a young lady named Elanor (Linnley) who is dedicated by the software developer with a lie that he solved before the upcoming election. <br /> <br /> Election Day is about, and watch, Dobbs declared the winner. (Big Surprise!) Elanor knows he's not really the president - he hasn't won legally - she decides to tell the president ... but complications arise. Her company went so far to poison her to silence her. In addition, she quickly took Dobbs. <br /> <br /> The plot takes some twists and turns before it is a bit predictable. But it never became boring. Robin was great as usual, and Christopher Walken often stole the show as Dobbs's manager-turned political adviser and best friend. <br /> <br /> It's an entertaining movie, and it has a good message. I recommend it if you are in the mood for dark satire or something that makes you think. Overall I give it a 7/10.
