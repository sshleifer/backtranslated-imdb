I only saw the film on the cable in the 80's and it threw me into the core. It appeared on the TV six months ago. <br /> <br /> In place of the movie, black and white cinematography was graphically depicted in 1950's New York as the eager "urban jungle" at a time when there was much more industry and port activity in the city, especially in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes has always brought a special intensity to his acting, and is beautiful in the role of the military pianist. His short 1959 TV series "Johnny Staccato" is also a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier and (later in the film) bring Ruby Dee to freshness and vitality. But it is Jack Warden's brilliant performance as the cruel, cruel boss who grabbed my attention. To get an idea of ​​Warden's versatility, watch this movie, look at a 1962 episode of the TV series "Naked City" entitled "Specter of the Rose Street Gang (available on video)." If you're a fan of film noir, it's a must see. Enjoy it!
