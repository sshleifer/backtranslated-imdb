Want to know why French and Italians love / hate each other? Want to have a look at history that drives our lifetime? So, look for Virzi's film (in the original language of course) and watch a wonderful Monica Bellucci speaking her native language from Citt√† di Castello (Umbria, just on the border with Tuscany). And the rest of the characters speak Livornese (beautiful Sabrina Impacciators and all others). Daniel Auteuil definitely in his shoes with Napoleon. Great fun, a real fresco from the Elba Island landscape, and a picture of the political reasons to kill or leave a tyrant (good for all time).
