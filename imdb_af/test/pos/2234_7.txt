This is a pretty clever, well-directed version of the "modern" 30-year-old woman's fairy tale romance. In this case, she helps the man she loves, head of the company, serving as his secretary and eventually winning his love of a twilight social butterfly. Interestingly, her business sense is shown as subtly parallel to her homemade skill, and the ladies of the office are portrayed as the "forces behind the throne." Far above average by Mrs. Astor's intelligent display.
