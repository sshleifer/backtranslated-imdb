Kevin Tenney's Night of the Demons is a delightful horror movie that reminds me of "The Evil Dead". In Hallowen night, a group of teenagers throw a feast in Hull House, a deserted funeral home on the outskirts of the town. Leaded by Angela, they do a seance-like ceremony and inadvertently awaken the evil spirits living in the place. One by one, the uninvited evil has the teenagers, who turn them into bloodthirsty demons. "Night of the Demons" is a perfect horror. film. It is scary, gory and nice atmosferic.The characters are well developed and the gore by Steve Johnson is pretty good. There is a gruesome impulse, a tongue that is bitten, the fingers cut into the eyeballs. The scene, where Suzanne (Linnea Quigley) kicks a tube of lipstick through her nipple, is a hoot. Give this one a look. Follow by two pursuers.
