I just watched over half a dozen movies starring Lino Ventura, but this one looks very much like the other. He plays a laconic criminal - one who is short on words and sometimes sometimes explosive. Given his quiet persona in movies such as ARMY OF SHADOWS and SECOND BREATH, I noticed that his minimalist acting style is extremely effective. In other words, because he is so quiet and fashionable, if he does bad things, it tends to look. And like these other films, he also has a very strong but twisted, moral code. <br /> <br /> Abel Davos (Ventura) and his partner, Lilane, both live in Italy and are career criminals. Both grew up in France and eventually had to flow because of their criminal activities. Now in Italy when the movie starts, they continue to live the life of the thugs and the heat is up to catch them. Strange, instead of running to a third country, they decide to return to France - even though Davos was condemned and found guilty in absentia. And if he is caught, it can mean a life in prison or the death penalty. Much of the first third of the film is about their happy return. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Davos, the proceeds are not going to be perfect and now every police in France seems to be looking for it. In addition, the reaction of his old compatriots in crime is not what he expects. In fact, his clumsy response to his return ends with a series of terrible events towards the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Davos meets and is in me a stranger, Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo). Despite Davos who apparently has no friends, Stark and his wife friend are trying their best to make his return successful. What's another monkey key in this throw, is Davos's two very young boys - what will Davos do to them - do they stick with him in his hiding? <br /> Overall, this is a very good crime movie - kind of like French Film Noir. Unlike American Noir, the many French versions I've seen have a more realistic as well as bright prospects for them. Fatalism rules supreme, that's for sure! The play is the best (especially from Ventura and Belmondo), the direction very sure and the writing is very nice, although I'm sure many won't stop. It just seems to be addressed - like an afterthought. I understood why they did this, but can also see how it can be very dissatisfied. As for me, it left me a little flat. Otherwise, an exceptional movie.
