I would give this movie an 8.5 or a 9. I thought it was just hilarious. I don't know how you couldn't think this movie was funny, but the only thing that disappointed me was that there was too much evil. because personally I think when they are flying bikes and things like that are much harder, but I'm sure there are people who think the other things are very funny, it's not my speech, but anyway, good movie will see it and then definitely have to buy it also if you do not like this movie because it is good because there are many people who think this movie shows how downgrading our society is or whatever it is just my personal opinion and you have yours. Also the Jackass set is definitely worth something to load or buy or whatever you do to get your videos
