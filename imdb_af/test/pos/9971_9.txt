I just saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival in the beautiful Elgin Theater. I was blown away by the beautiful cinematography, the brilliant adaptation of a very difficult play and lastly not the bravura performance of Al Pacino, who was born to play this role, perfectly balanced by an equally strong performance by Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> The film explores the themes of love vs. loyalty, right to justice, and passion for reason. Some may protest that the content is inherently anti-Semitic, but they should consider the historical context of the story and the delicate and nuanced way in which it is said in this adaptation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
