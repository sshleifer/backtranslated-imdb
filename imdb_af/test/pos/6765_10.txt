It's actually a brilliant movie. The story is grotesque, but the actors are brilliant. Especially the performance of Mads Mikkelsen as Svend is beautiful. It's a simple story about two guys with an urge to make it on their own, but it unfolds into a weird and absurd story, with many people being accidentally murdered and served as chicken sticks. If only more people understand it ... It can be a good candidate for an English version. It is also worth mentioning Ole Thestrup, who always delivers the extra twist on the plot, with his slightly crazy character Holger. I can only recommend this movie to the Danish audience. Also look at Adams Ã†bler (2005), a film by Anders Thomas Jensen, also with Mads Mikkelsen, accompanied by a good game, Ulrich Thomsen.
