To answer the question of a previous reviewer named the American official in "Lumumba" is the name of the character "Mr. Carlucci." Frank Carlucci was named secretary at the US Embassy in the Congo. He was subsequently appointed as US Ambassador to Portugal, Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Secretary of Defense, and is now chairman of the Carlyle Group. It is almost surprising that Carlucci's biographical sketch on its www.carlylegroup.com website does not recognize its service in the Belgian Congo. If his name was deliberately censored by the HBO version of "Lumumba", it was possible that the possibility of HBOs in US courts was sued. However, Carlucci's name is clearly mentioned in the theater version of "Lumumba" I have seen recently. In that case, I expect him to refuse any involvement with Lumumba's murder. <br /> <br /> Others commented on the similarity with which the film "Lumumba" deals with the parties involved: Lumumba supporters, other Congolese, even Belgians. I think a somewhat more sinister view of the BBC documentary entitled "Who Lost Lumumba?", Based on the book "The Murder of Lumumba" by Belgian historian Ludo de Witte. When scrutinized, these films demonstrate that the fate of Lumumba and the history of the Congo is not just a matter of black and white. Only Lumumba's murderers believe it.
