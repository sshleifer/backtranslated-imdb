It's a spectacular production! I saw the show twice in Chicago and my only problem with the production was the fact that I could only see fragments of what's going on. The stage consists of three giant catwalks and the platform and if the action moves from one part of the stage to the next, you will loose what is going on, no matter where you are. As always, it's an exciting sensory overload, trapped with 15 cameras in high definition! The visuals have been masterfully adapted, one of the best concert DVDs of all time in my opinion! I just hope and wish they will release it on Blu-Ray from HD DVD so that we can relive this extravagance over and over.
