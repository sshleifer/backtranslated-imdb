An intense, dark action drama with extraordinary rich support from Casey, Keith, et al. Already, many of them get the best roles of their careers and run with them. The film is strangely formed - often the action is delayed only to let the characters get caught up in strange but well-done, seemingly improved dialogues. During the outings, almost all of the "Machine" is caught up in perfectly rendered humorous monologues - and Reynolds the director earns a lot of credit for Reynolds' star loss and gives them space. And unlike most action movies, you really get the characters, who make the 2nd half, when their different destinations unfold well and badly, which becomes unusual. The combination of character development, brutal violence, a jazz soundtrack (Tarantino should be a fan - see this and then Jackie Brown and you'll see what I'm talking about). Make this occasionally erroneous movie. a bit melodramatic) one of the better modern police films, and in my mind it is better than many of the overstated modern noirs such as "Body Heat" and so on.
