I saw Five Fingers at the Drive-in ... what, 1973, '74? It was the first Kung-Fu movie I've ever seen and I was very entertained. I recently bought it on DVD and watched it again. I was also very entertained the second time. I believe it's probably one of the most Kung-Fu movies being modeled. Competitive schools, different styles, revenge, "white hat" good guys and "black hat" bad guys. They even threw the Japanese (VERY bad guys) karate and Judo styles. I remember being amused by the dubbing dialog, according to the lines of "Hey You! You're a very bad guy!" and "They must not get away with it! I'll go to this bad crowd!" This time it wasn't so distracting, I think I'm used to it. If you even have the slightest appreciation for this genre, this is one you should see.
