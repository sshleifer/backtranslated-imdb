I loved this show. I waited for it to come out on DVD .... it never did. Does anyone know how to make the show available on DVD? I contacted Lifetime TV and some others and nothing. Please let me know if there is a way to get this series on DVD. I would be first in line to buy it. I was really caught up in this show. I don't understand how many other TV shows are available on DVD, but not any day. I'm sure there are many of us out there who would like this series on DVD or even VHS. I thought to contact the production company. Does anyone out there try to contact someone for this information?
