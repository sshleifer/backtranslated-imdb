This movie is based on a true story. The author of the same title novel, Einar MÃ¡r Gudmundsson, had a brother who became mentally ill. I moved this movie very much, to the main character's path to disease, to see how he was trying to handle life after diagnosis, and how he made friends at the spiritual institution, all of which is very convincing. There are also some wonderful incidents in the manuscript. The title does not give away the story. You have to watch it to understand ... and listen to the music that turns and turns your heart and soul upside down and back as the movie moves. A must-see for everyone.
