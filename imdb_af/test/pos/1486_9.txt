Because Mr. Bean hardly ever speaks, I heartily recommend using a DVD player with the teacher holding his finger over the pause / play button. At the end of any age group's lesson, spend only 5 minutes pausing and playing the DVD, and encourage students to get the answers to "What is it?", "What will happen?", "What happens," ,? or any other question that elicits answers from the lesson's new vocabulary and grammar. <br /> <br /> Because everyone is watching TV, shy students are usually vocal. Because the DVD can be started or stopped at any time, it is a perfect "filler" for the uncomfortable "between" times while students leave and arrive. <br /> <br /> I tried other DVDs, especially Tom & Jerry "cartoons and Red Skelton DVDs, but no one else was as good as" Mister Bean "to keep students' constant attention.
