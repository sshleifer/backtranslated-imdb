I really found the movie as much as Saving Private Ryan and giving a prior account of the German perspective. The graphic action and individual characters gave this movie much interest to me throughout the movie. Stalingrad was a very cruel battle and the scenes gave this movie the strong reality of this battle. I recommend it to anyone interested in military history. This was my second viewing of this movie in a few years and was once again captivated by its realism. Hearing the weapons, uniforms, and German while reading the captions, gave it a lot of credit for a good military movie. In fact, it was a German perspective of the struggle, and I rooted for the Germans, although they were the aggressor and the ultimate loser of the war.
