I really love anything done by Savage Steve Holland, the author / director of this wonderful movie. See also "Better off dead" and "How did I get to college." Great! Anyway, this movie is really humorous and produces some unexpected things. Where else in this movie can you see Demi Moore as a talented singer and Bobcat Golthwait as a twin? I recommend it to anyone looking for an old-fashioned slapstick comedy (George with the tortoise), not to mention a very well written sarcasm (the Christmas tree on the roof of the car). This movie continually sheds your unexpected stuff after you've seen it 100 times, as I did! Enjoy it!
