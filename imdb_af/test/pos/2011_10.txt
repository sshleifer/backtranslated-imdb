It was a modern TV classic! The story goes as follows, Bob has a girlfriend named Alicia. Bob and Alicia are in love and want to marry. Bob has a button called Owen with which he works. Owen is jealous of Alicia. He likes to hang out with Bob. Now Owen is hanging out with Bob and Alicia. Bob and Owen have a secretary named Heather. Heather is very accidentally inclined. She's also, if you don't guess, is kind of lonely. She also hangs with Bob and Alicia, and Owen. Sometimes Alicia wants Bob to have no friends. <br /> <br /> By the end of the first season, it seemed as if Owen had finally found a really long-standing friend. Bob and Alicia rode the night before their wedding, drove into a small car and then jammed. Way out in the middle of nowhere! What happened next? What about poor Heather? Has anyone married? Sorry, the series ended. <br /> <br /> Not even a TV guide made FOX think twice about putting it back on the air. It was a good performance with a good role. I also loved Heather. She looked cool in those glasses and was hilarious. I miss this show a lot. It's like reading a good book with the end of the mist ... sad.
