This movie is the smartest comedy I've ever seen, many jokes are either a parody of another movie, from star wars to balls of power to kung fu etc.) Or somehow related to the history of what though, (Otis creates the elevator), many jokes are also related to the modern world and made fun because it was BC (As the wheels of the horse carriage turn) Other jokes are just indifferent, but also hilarious (like the familiar scene , with the dog walking to the Roman guy with the small music). In this movie, they really mix up every kind of humor. I've watched this movie 6 times and every time I see it, I find other subtle jokes. (like the scene where Waldo is part of the Egyptian crowd). This is the funniest movie I see every time, ultimately a lazy-loud comedy that doesn't include toilet or sex humor. Numero's is what makes the movie, everything that comes from the guys is hilarious. This movie is almost perfect, except for a few clicks, such as the fact that Asterix gets its power back because it kisses, it's simply stupid. But overall an excellent movie !! 9.5 out of 10
