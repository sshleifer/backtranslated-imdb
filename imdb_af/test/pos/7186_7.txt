The French people are not known as a major film producer. <br /> <br /> Although their Amelie scored high on the Oscars. Asterix et Obelix is ​​a very different film of what I am used to by the French. It's a good movie, especially for kids. The only thing that led me to was that it was spoken in French and subtitles. Usually with the English spoken movies (here in the Netherlands) I don't have to read the captions. But with the French language you just have to read to understand. The story itself is just fine with Obelix, who doesn't remind himself of thick, but there are also nice details mainly in names like brucewillix and malcomix. You all know the story from the comic books and this movie shows the most slide through the book. Every thing is in it, from the Sphinx nose that brakes to pirate red beard, loses three more ships. I will be a good movie with the kids this weekend.
