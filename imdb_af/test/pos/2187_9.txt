Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: The DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on March 1, 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the forefront. Although it swept virtually every conceivable award, the cash register lost its expectation and the original production ended at 557 performances. Fortunately, however, the play went on tour - and alongside the road was captured on film. The result is a remarkable recording of the play with George Hern, who replaced Cariou, and Lansbury in close proximity to the original Broadway station. <br /> <br /> However, there is an error. Simply put, stage games do not play very well, because a performance that works well on stage must fill the theater and is therefore very large. And when placed on film, such appearances often look slightly static, repressive, or both. SWEENY TODD is no exception. In the film it is a "stand-and-sing" quality. Although Hern and Lansbury have modulated their camera prospect performance, it's not the case with Betsy Joslyn as Joanna. her bigger-than-life show reads on film as unpleasantly devastating and her extraordinary operational voice feels uncomfortable when it violates the voices of the overall cast. <br /> <br /> Taking this stage-to-film effect into account, however, it is an exceptional performance of a unique and macabre comic musical in the operetta style. Lansbury is astonishing, a mixture of foolishness, stupidity and wicked evil, while Hern has the role of the psychotic hairdresser whose clients are "shamelessly shaven". The overall throw is pretty good and although the movie doesn't show us enough of the set, there's plenty to see that it's impressive. And the music! Who can argue with what most consider Sondheim's best work? The story itself is extremely well known, especially in England. In 1846, Thomas Peckett Perst joined several urban myths for a short story entitled A STRING OF PEARLS; within a year or so it was adapted to the stage such as SWEENEY TODD, DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET - and in an era that had little of the copyright law, variations of the play had already taken place in England. But each one was more or less the same: a hairdresser, Sweeney Todd, killed the men who came to him to shave; Mrs. Lovett, his co-worker, baked them in pies and fed them to an unsuspecting public. The Sondheim version is specifically based on a 1973 version by Christopher Bond. <br /> <br /> The story is very grand Guignol, with lots of blood, bodies that fall diagonally and grotesque humor; At the same time, the music, lyrics and subplot of an innocent in the clutches of evil open the subject to many lyrical charms that one would not expect. Sondheim's lyrics are often ironic, but never more so than here; He mixes a bit of malicious satire on the industry and capitalism along the way, and surely one cannot blame the strange but Victorian elegant of his complex music. <br /> <br /> Like the concert version starring Hern and Patti LuPone, this particular movie also offers several choices cut from the 2007 Tim Burton movie version, especially the opening "The Tale of Sweeney Todd Attend," that runs like a thread in the play. It is also, in my opinion, considerably more comical than the film, which tends to underline comedy in favor of an even greater blood display. Whatever the case, if you are a fan of the story, it is the legendary Broadway tournament on tour, and that is a knockout. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
