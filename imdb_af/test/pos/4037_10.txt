The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her struggle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the film. Kay is the poison of dark forces: temptation. This story encourages me to, like Gerda, fight for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for Mr Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay. And I wish it ended soon ... Snowqueen tells me though my life, I identify deeply with the story and the characters. Thank you to Hans Christian Anderson and the director.
