How many people expect it in Horror, anyway. Is it something Greek like "SAW" or it's just crap ... ??? Now I'm not claiming to be a knowledgeable expert, but I'm about 47, I literally saw and owned thousands of movies and I honestly think this director gave this movie a good, sincere effort. Believe me, I managed to ring as soon as the dialogue started. ACCEPT it will be terrible and I was pleasantly surprised. It's not a Mamet script, it's for sure; but come on !!! With all the HORRIBLE garbage out there, especially in Horror, I thought this one was approaching the top of the pile than most. <br /> <br /> The director used many neat, smart camera angles; the soundtrack was excellent and moody, perfect for the atmosphere needed for this kind of movie. The editing and timing was very good. And it does not resort to the tired, worn-out clicks of excessive slasher violence; For example, ***** MINOR SPOILER ***** During an absolutely delicious and totally free (but nice ..., oh, I mean tasteful) naked landfill I expect her to be cut and cut; but amazingly we just get her heavenly sweetness and that is it ***** END MINOR SPOILER ***** Also the tension is very well built, which leads to a nice ambiguous end where you are not quite sure what is not that. ***** SPOILER ***** Especially in the scene where the psychiatrist leaves the girl and Pinnochio alone in the office; We actually see the doll talking to her, but in the video recording we don't. The mother also saw Pinnochio moving and was rather nasty; So, both mother and daughter are mentally ill ... ??? There is also the original 'killer' and the mother suspected of a possible evil influence. But even with all this, we're not quite sure who killed the death ***** END SPOILER ***** All in all, I believe it was a good, strong, sincere effort to create some good o 'Early Full Moon-type style and with a great deal of restraint on violence. And with no typical SLEAZE thrown in for no reason (just the beautiful, innocent, clean shower scene I will remember until the end of my days ... :) Compared to the absolute MINDLESS drive out there, a DEFINITE, strong 8/10 !!!
