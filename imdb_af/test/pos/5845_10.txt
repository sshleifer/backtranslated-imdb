Oz is an Oswald State Correctional Facility. It tells the story of confrontation, cruelty, violence, hatred and survival at any cost. In a place like Oz, you should have eyes in the back of your head. <br /> <br /> This completely original, intelligent and compelling drama tells of how distorted life becomes as soon as you get through the gates of Emerald City. <br /> <br /> What is supposed to be a corporate correctional facility is actually far from such a thing. The show brings to light some of the many flaws in prison, the underestimation of humanity that can still keep cold hard killers, and one truth: the prisoners are the one who controls the prison. <br /> <br /> This beautiful and somewhat surreal show teaches about the importance of every life and helps to understand the reasons for most prisoners. This show can only look shocking, but to really tell it is needed. Oz is a great representation of hell on earth and how such a place teaches you the most important lessons you will ever learn.
