Uzak (2002), a Turkish film shown in the US as "Distant" <br /> <br /> was directed, produced, written and filmed by Nuri Bilge <br /> <br /> Ceylan. <Br /> <br /> This movie is a grim and gloomy version of the clash between a "city mouse", Mahmut, played by Muzaffer Özdemir, and a "country mouse", Yusuf, played by Emin Toprak. <br /> <br /> Both men are excellent actors, and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting skill. (Tragies, Emin Toprak died in a car accident shortly after the movie was completed.) <br /> <br /> In most cousins ​​/ urban cousins, the contrast between rural and urban lifestyles is portrayed in a humorous way. In this film there is little humor or even warmth. Both men <br /> <br /> lost contact with human society. Mahmut's work as a <br /> <br /> commercial photographer for a tile company doesn't satisfy him. He divorced a woman he knew. <br /> <br /> still love and have no satisfactory human relationships. <br /> <br /> Mahmut lost his job due to a factory closed in his small town, not having the skills or energy to find work in the city. His human interactions are largely confined to silent observations of the other people crossing his path. He is clearly a warm and caring, but cannot express these features in an urban environment. <br /> <br /> The cousins ​​don't relate well to the world, and they don't relate well to each other. Also, do not attempt to behave in a way that provides an opportunity for bonding or closeness. <br /> <br /> In a sense, this film portrays a wasteful event. <br /> <br /> Probably every cousin could have provided at least a portion of what was missing in another's life. Instead, they send out parallel unhappy courses. The two men are far away, which is a situation represented by the title of the film. <br /> <br /> One of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which Ceylan builds detail on detail. This information ultimately tells us more about the characters than we learned with simple explanation. <br /> <br /> Uzak was shown as part of the Rochester Labor Series. It's not a "movie" in the traditional sense of that genre. It is a labor film because it demonstrates the harmful effects of unsatisfactory work (Mahmut) and unemployment (Yusuf). <br /> <br /> It's a quiet, absorbent, dark film. Although it doesn't make for happy performance, I walked out of the <br /> <br /> theater and realized I saw a real creative and <br /> <br /> important movie. This movie is worth finding and seeing!
