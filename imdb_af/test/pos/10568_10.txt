The chemistry between Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy was incredible. They were thoroughly convincing and really nice in their roles. Imelda Staunton has the sparkling Mrs. Sucksby played brilliantly. In spite of the fact that she was a deadly opportunist, she somehow managed to make you sympathize. Rupert Evans played the sled ball gentleman with pure charm and snark. He was a playmaker. The story itself was very unique, just like the way it was told. The Victorian England area with two lesbian main characters was intriguing and delightful. There were some fantastic and unexpected twists and turns that the audience really took in the story. A wonderful cast and great story made this movie fantastic.
