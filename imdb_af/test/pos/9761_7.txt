If you like the book, don't stop watching the video as Jean and Joe met in Australia. Until then, this is a fairly faithful version of the book, and the visuals are great. 10 out of 10 to that point and I really enjoyed it. Then the story is seriously restored and revised in ways that really destroy the essence of the book, ie how Jean creates a town like Alice (Springs). In the early part, the big change is to make Strachan a 40-something bachelor instead of a seventy-year-old widower. It rather separates this love story, especially if there are also small changes that contribute to making it more egoistic and fervent, such as: in the book he considers Joe at the ship that he can find more than a letter waiting for him Australia, but in the video he gives Joe no idea about Jean's whereabouts or intentions. The last hour of the 5-hour video kicks and breaks the last third of the book. I see no reason why they have thrown a fight between Joe and Jean - it is pretty out of character and looks like it's just an Aussie dig at Pommies telling them what to do. Then they bring Strachan for the wedding (instead of three years later) - and let him read the toast !! - Very strange, especially in the context of the relationship between Jean and Noel as cast in the video. The whole wedding scene is the invention of scriptwriters. These horrors take time in the last hour, which was not long enough to fix the fascinating story of how Jean Willstown recreate as a place where she and Joe can both be happy.
