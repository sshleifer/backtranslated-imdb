This movie is real action at its best, it doesn't get any better than that. It's one of those movies that you can just jump back and look at some good, non-stop shooting and killing, plus there are some great lines to do with all of these. My favorite is there is one bad guy breaking into those old guys at home and he steals a TV or something and he goes all the way to them and shouts, "I'll be here soon if I want to!" " And just before he jumps out of the window, he shouts "Anytime !!!" I mean it's just classic stuff all around, so you have a choice, you can see that fool, Smith will try to go to an action movie or you can see one of the masters Charles Bronson !!!!
