It's not among my favorite Hitchcock movies, although I have to admit it's pretty good. Among the things I really liked was the presence of Jimmy Stewart (he always improves even the most mediocre material) and the incredible and terrifying assassin (which looks like a skeleton with only a thin layer of skin over him). Although it cost the studio a lot of money, I didn't especially care for Doris Day in the movie - she wept a lot and threw "Que Sera" like a fullback. Yes, I know she had to sing like that, but it hated me forever. Sorry. <br /> <br /> The other complaint, though minor, I had over the movie was that it was a bit "too polished" and "Hollywood esque". The original version (also done by Hitchcock) just looks much bigger and seed-colored - and it added to the frightening atmosphere.
