Duchess and her three kittens enjoy the high life with their dedicated human lover until the wicked Butler Edgar, with his eyes on a great heritage, decides to devour them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures handle the unknown countryside and the mean streets of Paris? Only by meeting the insatiable alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After searching the wide dangerous world, he led them home, and Edgar got his neat desserts on the wrong side of a horse. As always, it's really the voices rather than the animation that is at the heart of Disney's magic: Phil Harris is brilliant as O'Malley, Eva Gabor as Duchess is ... Well ... Eva Gabor; but perhaps the most memorable turns are by Pat Buttram and George Lindsay, who transformed old dogs Napoleon and Lafayette into a little pure-fried Rednecks. Their scenes with Edgar, and the music numbers with Scat Cat and his cool-dude band, are classic. Most hits to see the Aristocats are now how deeply Disney's style of animation has changed, as it was in the forefront in 1970. Perhaps the nostalgic, dated feeling is simply the result of being demolished in Belle Epoque Paris, but the illustrations are fatter (sorry) and the animation and overall fit far less frightening (sometimes a relief) than in recent attempts like Aladdin.
