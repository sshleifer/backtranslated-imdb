I watched this movie on TV many years ago and tied it from there. I could never really understand why my own mother was upset to see it! That was because I was so young at the time. I just put this movie again. I now have 2 own children and I had to try again to fight the tears, but that didn't happen. I cried most of the movies. It's just to show you how different you feel. when you have children yourself Such a wonderful family, such a heartbreaking movie, wonderful! Someone said that about 8 are still more news, are you all in touch, I want to know! Completely conquered by the movie!
