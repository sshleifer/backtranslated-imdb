As a child I was never in a situation where I could become known to Dr. Wie and although I have heard from the series, I never really realized what it was. It was then with some hesitation that I sat down to watch the ninth doctor and his antics said he was something like Arthur Dent (from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), but cooler. I can't believe what I missed, seriously, why didn't anyone tell me this before? My whole childhood was deprived of doctor's adventures; I'm a huge fan of most sci-fi and fantasy adventures. Honestly, I thoroughly enjoyed it and looking forward to any future episodes. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I wasn't initially sure that Billie Piper would be the best actress, but I'm happy to say she's done very well, I thought, and has a lot of realistic touch to the range added. I think that was actually one of my favorite aspects of the series; the contrast between great alien conflict tones as opposed to the onerous normality of the South London Council's estate. I am always interested in cases where people's ideas around the world are being challenged drastically and how people can take any situation and change their minds to fit in with their everyday lives. I also love Christopher Eccleston. I didn't see much of his films and I have never seen another actor as dr. Who didn't, but I thought his doctor's portrayal was brilliant, very nice and yet dark enough to wonder. I find that many other characters with its kind of character history tend to be a little two-dimensional; they have all the right emotions and deeds, but they always look a little flat. This doctor, on the other hand, earned my loyalty with his stratified personality. I agree with some of the other comments that a higher budget for the special effects, strangers and what could not have been a bit more effective. but then it's not about special effects (though they help) of what I've read and heard for a long time Dr Who fans; It's the spirit of all things that really counts. And I don't think they did a bad job with what they had. I loved all the strangers, but my favorite was to be the Daleks; as ever from dr. Who knew something before I looked at the series was that there were things in it that looked like thrown rubbish bins on wheels. Before looking, I was pretty skeptical about these pepper pots that threatened the existence of humanity, but some of them were rather scary! What I loved of course. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good show. I look forward to future episodes with joy. The doctor has a new fan.
