.. This movie was done when Hitler (and Mussolini who is so good in the movie) was above and much political and even the Roman Church had eyes on the brutality and evil of Nazism. Especially in the US there were many people who didn't understand what really happened in Germany and Europe (for example, Charles Lindenbergh). This would be a parody of Berlusconi or Chirac as a great actor today. Chaplin may have made many mistakes in his life, but it's really a masterpiece of humanity and IMHO is a good demonstration that he was a brave man. The movie is funny and deep, the final speech has a terrible power and is still updated. I think this movie is one of the best ever done.
