Barbora Bobulova's depiction of Valeria in this story was quite fascinating and heartbreaking at the same time. It's been a long time since I saw so much hidden passion and mystery presented by any actor, simply by using her facial features and using her eyes and mouth as Barbora does with this character. She was completely credible like Valeria and I was rubbed off with her characterization of this role. Immediately the movie was real life and fantasy. The clever use of a limited dialogue passed me by. I was obliged to read between the lines and each of the key players used the art of body language and emotional intent to convey a strong story line. Barbora in particular was visually stimulating in an almost asexual manner and at the same time sexy. These comments can easily be related to each of the many emotions produced by her performance. Below in terms of dialogue, but powerful in terms of presence. I am captivated by the delivery of this actress and will be eagerly looking for her work.
