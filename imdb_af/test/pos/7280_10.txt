The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up. A quality film around. <br /> <br /> I suppose you can just love this movie for its action, but I liked it more than that. <br /> <br /> This is a pure thriller / horror movie. It offers a more full-fledged script than most horror movies do. I thought, at least the US version, ended brilliantly and was wonderful. The story felt honest and brutal. <br /> <br /> The movie has an excellent, stiff writing that moves action, with credible characters in largely credible situations.
