I love this movie. Team with great characters. The child of "Sandlot" is excellent as Corey Feldman. When the kids storm the bank, it is pure adrenaline. Inside the bank it becomes like a "Lord of the Flies" situation where they turn on each other. Justin Walker of "Clueless" is wonderful. I saw it on "Showtime" while channel was navigating. It was a pleasant surprise. James Remar is also very good here than the small town of Balju. Taylor Nichols, who I love "Barcelona", also does a good job as a federal agent. I recommend this movie for any fan of bank robbery with very good characters. I was shocked to discover that Roger Corman was a producer here as the film is not a B-movie.
