A movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot. The film portrays a zigzag progress from the main actor's inner feel. Max, who lived in New York for two years and plans to marry a girl he met, comes back to Paris and meets his ex-girlfriend, whom he still loves, but eventually finds out who he loves most. is her best friend. Nonlinear narration so many flashbacks and each part is fairly well articulated. The three women Max met, symbolizing something we should pursue, although perhaps not having a clear picture of the underlying motivation. His fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and therefore no loyalty we can see. She also gives him no love, but only stability. True love can also not be found in its relationship with the ex-girlfriend. Just a fantasy for him to escape - many things very romantic that he did for her, but almost nothing seems negligible. The one who really lives Max's life is her best friend. The equilibrium at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium, because Max understands much more about his inner feeling. The non-linear structure makes the search progress easier. Not as ingenious as "Pulp Fiction", but things look much more natural in "The Apartment". Max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and interesting is also the description of Romane Bohringer. The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci looks very nice. A good comment from today's love and undoubtedly a movie worth seeing. <br /> <br />
