The portrayal of the Marines in this film is about to come. The action scenes are the best ever produced in the accuracy of the content. The uniforms and weapons of both the US and German troops were perfect. The Berbers costumes and weapons were also perfect. This film can easily be used to teach militaria of the period and is used by the USMC Academy for this purpose. The screens that Roosevelt shot and the guns he used were beautiful. Obtaining so much time weapons in such a good shape is testimony to the attention to detail and presentation that this film should be noted. Millius is a genius.
