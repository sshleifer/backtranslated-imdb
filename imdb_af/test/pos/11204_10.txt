The first time I saw the poster, I was amazed by its tranquility and beauty. Then the city of Istanbul has been in my mind since then. <br /> <br /> Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole movie is so persistent and aesthetically shot like a sculpture. It is itself a landscape. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many things happening in the movie, but the director deliberately omitted most dramatic parts and left them to our imagination, making a very flat life. ** (soft spoiler) One can see Mahmut's ladylove crying in the toilet and then go out without a word, but not their fight; One can see Mahmut who accompanies his mother in hospital, but not her fight. The most dramatic scene in the movie for me is Yusuf aloud to the toy soldier he bought for his cousin, ** and then it almost broke my heart to break this boring, lonely life in such a way. /> With all the trivialities in life weeded, the story presents us with the pure inner world of all the characters, their sadness, anxiety, loneliness, regret ... And as the story unfolded, I finally their desperate situation where their emotions were really no way out if no extraordinary things had intervened. This is exactly every one trying to keep at all costs, especially for an irresponsible artist like Mahmut. <br /> <br /> I just finished my second look. Last night I sat in my duvet, had a few Vodka next to my bed and went into the trance throughout the film. I have two real lives going on, one outside the screen, one in the screen. I feel free from all the loneliness and fear because people have experienced it. I just removed myself from all the things. <br /> <br /> We cannot deny the universal communication problem, and loneliness even places us far away and it becomes an evil spiral. I bet Mahmut still hasn't lived a way of life. That's why he walked out of his room to try to find the answers from the outer world, the cold and the landscape.
