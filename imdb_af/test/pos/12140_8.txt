This is a black and white movie from France, <br /> <br /> Simple plot, expensive mobster looking and getting help etc. We've seen this kind of movie many times over the years. What makes this film different is mainly acting and style. All the actors are quiet, no one screams and hardly anyone loses his temper. There are quite a few deaths, some surprises. There are also beautiful women, but no sex scenes. No car racing. <br /> <br /> Just Talking / It's so refreshing to listen to people talking, and here we also need to read captions. <br /> <br /> The play is almost perfect by everyone. especially the leadership of <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura & in a smaller but important role Jean Paul Belmondo. These two actors were the best. <br /> <br /> I said the movie was wrong. There are some shortages in few places. They are small. The acting is the thing in this movie. Production is also the first time. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 4) 88 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
