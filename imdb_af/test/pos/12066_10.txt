This show is over on brilliant. It's a contemporary married ... with kids. The scripts are funny, as they are sprinkled with clever sarcasm. They are also realistic, dealing with issues that many teenagers are experiencing today. As well as the persistent burden that you may not be the world's largest parent, and how is the best way to handle it? At the same time, however, it drives light and heart. With all the drama and action on television these days, it is a very pleasant and welcome change. It is something that you can sit and relax for 30 minutes, laugh and relate to. It's not the world's most hilarious comedy. but will let you laugh at least a few times. Michael Rapaport is brilliant in the lead as Dave. He fills the big shoes that require heavy sarcastic writing and then some. He and Anita Barone (Vikki) have fantastic chemistry and reflect each other very well. This show has a strong future if it is marketed at the right target audience and put in the right time slot. Also, if Fox releases it on DVD, the next will be stronger and bigger. (Like a classic example with Scrubs.)
