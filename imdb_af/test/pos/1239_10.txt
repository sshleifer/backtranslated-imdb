Why would I say this? Because when the movie ended, I was in a good mood. So many people are calling to the end, wow! Bruce Willis can be funny. For those who believe that he has learned how to deal with the sixth sentence, you must be very new to his career. He won an best actor emmy in a comedy series before working on Die Hard. It's like saying, wow, the sky has learned to lay snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life. The movie was hilarious. What reminds me is how some other commentary on this movie has made, says there are no memorable lines or scenes. Spoiler ... <br /> <br /> The wading ambulance? I'm not a loser? Have you ever seen a big scream, I'm not a loser yet? <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was great. It was funny, it was never boring and in a cute Disney way it had a point to make. Something to do with life and, of course, a children's movie trying to do so is in its head, but for one time I don't care. <br /> <br /> If you didn't watch it, do it. You will like it.
