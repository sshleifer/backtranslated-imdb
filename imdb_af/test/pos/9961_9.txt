The Venice dealer is a fantastic movie. This is very true of the original Shakespeare game. If you've seen Jeremy Irons in Casanova and love his performance, it's a movie for you! If you saw Joseph Fiennes in Shakespeare in Love and you enjoyed his performance, it's a movie for you! If you've seen Al Pacino in Donnie Brasco and like his show, it's a movie for you! This is a great movie and if you study Shakespeare like me, it's a great movie to watch !! The only problem with this movie is that you can't show the little ones, because there's a little nudity in it. But unlike this, it's a very good movie !!
