More and more French cinema demonstrates that it is the only one that can confront Hollywood, and spend high amounts on money in their movies. If Bon Voyage was made in the US, no one would be surprised. Perfect in France, in the 40's, then the Nazi invasion, technically impeccable, and with some of the most international French actors (Depardieu, Adjani, Ledoyen ...). Bon Voyage centers on two parallel stories: a scientist and his disciple (Ledoyen) trying to hide one of his discoveries (a kind of water that may work as an atomic bomb) from the Nazis; and a poor man in love with a well-known actress (Adjani) who ends up in jail is accused of a crime he did not commit to protect her. <br /> <br /> Bon Voyage seems to be made in the old style, with no unnecessary camera movements and effects. Without big turns in the plot. As I said before, they did a good job. But the biggest problem with this movie is about the script. Is this a spy movie? A romantic comedy? A spy comedy? A plot of plot? It's not clear. That makes Bon Voyage a bit unbalanced. If you think you are watching a comedy, it suddenly changes to a different story line, a more dramatic one, slower ... I think they should have focused on one of the arguments (one about the spy) and left the romantic parts in the background. <br /> <br /> Rate: 6.5 / 10
