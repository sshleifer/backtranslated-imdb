Denis Leary can sometimes be funny and smart and is always nice, but it takes the cake! This show showed Leary's genius. <br /> <br /> The work is in New York. Leary plays Mike McNeil, a stubborn detective, has an occasional drug problem and has a girl. McNeil has a serious attitude. He drops so much in it. The area is filled with funny, interesting and fun characters alongside McNeil. An excellent throw too. All the episodes in this show are really funny and addictive. The one linen in this show is everywhere. You will be in stitches after you hear them and a few more minutes later and then laugh at them. The area the area is dealing with is something else to strip nuns, a bathroom hostage situation, and more. This show was too good. Bones could have grown to keep much more seasons. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: A Great, Fantastic Show. I miss this show scarcely. All episodes of this show are wonderful. You even get stomach-laugh ... lots. ABC made a big mistake by giving it an ax. Too bad, Leary didn't revive the show for cable television. Yet I give this show one of my highest recommendations. Actually, one of a kind show.
