Born Bath is a well-crafted crime drama about a group of teenage children. Teenagers as well as young adults will find this movie well-behaved and entertaining. The movie is similar to The Black Circle Boys in the sense that a lot of teenage boys go around their town to set up their own rules and not care about the consequences.
