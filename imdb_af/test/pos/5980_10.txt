Larisa Shepitko's THE ASCENT (1976) is an extraordinary, disturbing report by the party's struggle against the Nazis in German-occupied Belorussia. The Ascent reflects the Russian obsession with the horrors of the Great Patriotic War, but unusually it is both in religious symbolism and ready to recognize the existence of the lesser Russian collaborator. The real struggle is not with the Nazis who are in the background as mere extras, but between Russian Nazi investigator and Sotnikov, the captured partisan who finds the spiritual power to go unbeaten. With his many references to the Crucifixion, the story addresses heroic relationships that glorify the suffering of the martyr and his influence on future generations. A remarkable piece of work.
