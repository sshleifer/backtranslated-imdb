I like both this version of DORIAN GRAY and the MGM version. Both add a little girl early in the story who has an association with Dorian (it's not in the original book) and that's my only complaint. I especially like Angela Lansbury as Sybil Vane and George Sanders as Harry in the MGM version, but Shane Briant as Dorian in the TV version is much better (I think) and much more relentless than Hurd Hatfield in the MGM version: I think Briant is more true to the novel's Dorian. Ultimately, this is a very good adaptation of the novel (it even shows Dorian's liaison with men, like Wylde, which couldn't be done in the MGM version).
