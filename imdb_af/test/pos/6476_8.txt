Knut Rockne All American, the biopsy about the famous Notre Dame beloved coach Knute Rockne, is an excellent sports movie to watch. We have never seen it before, we were amazed at the technique used by director Lloyd Bacon in the movie. He shows that he was before his time photographing photo cards. The result is a lively picture about the man responsible for the legacy of collegial sport, Knute Rockne. <br /> <br /> The film presents Rockne from his humble origins in Chicago to his studies at the famous Notre Dame University in South Bend, Indiana. He was an ambitious man who had a vision of how the game should be played. Fortunately, he went to give his beloved Notre Dame the glory he was. <br /> <br /> Pat O'Brien looks a bit older as he starts as a first-class player. In fact, he doesn't change much about the movie, but he's good like Mr. Rockne. Pat O'Brien shows that he can inspire the players under him by being just a father figure. Gale Page plays Bonnie Rockne, the wise woman who understood her husband's call in life. Ronald Reagan plays George "The Gipper" Gipp, who was a legend who died too young but left a legacy. Donald Crisp makes a good contribution as Father John Callahan, who was Rockne's mentor at the university. <br /> <br /> This movie will not only entertain sports, as LLoyd Bacon's direction and the fast pace he gives the film.
