The best part of this movie is that you can watch it over and over, and still aren't happy to watch it. I have watched this movie at least 10 times over the past 10 years and it still makes me laugh as if I was watching it for the first time. I like good comics like the Orgazmo, Cheech n Chong, Monty Python series and many others, but this one in Hindi is one of my favorite outstanding movies. Some of them are recently in Hindi Golmaal, Munnabhai series and Herapheri series. So all I can say is Hind's comedy is finally evolving. But Andaaz Apna Apna is very different from the movies I mentioned above. This is what I call the Hindi-stoned comedy and very little of the kind found in the Hindi cinema in 1994. Come to Rajkumar Santoshi for the brilliant movie.
