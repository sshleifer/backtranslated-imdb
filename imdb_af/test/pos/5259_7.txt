Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) a wealthy woman discovers her husband is on her fraud with a younger woman (Eva Mendes). She doesn't know what to do and friends Sylvia Fowler (Annette Bening), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) and Alex Fisher (Jad Pinkett Smith) try to help. <br /> <br /> OK - there was no reason. to repeat the 1939 movie. It's a real classic and doesn't have to be updated. Of course this is done. It got some of the worst reviews I've ever seen for a movie. I love the original and have seen it many times - I have constantly compared it. Now it's not a classic, but it's not that bad. <br /> <br /> ** MINOR SPOILERS !!! ** First of all the bad - the story is old and has been (badly) updated. Really - a man cheating on his wife is shocking today. Meg Ryan (a wonderful actress) is pretty awful here. Her face is unable to change expression! I couldn't believe how bad some of her scenes were. Eva Mendes is also bad - but it's not entirely her fault. Her role was poorly written and she had to compete with Joan Crawford of the original. Smith's character (a tough lesbian) is divided into an operating room. It's funny ... but it shows that a strong woman immediately comes in pieces when an emergency is confronted. Also the script places some awkward sections where Ryan talks to her daughter about yourself. In those moments it looks more like a lifetime movie than anything else. <br /> <br /> Now the good - this movie retains the original's decision to never show a man on the screen. This movie is over and for women - men are not needed (VAT - I'm a man). Bening is just fantastic like Fowler - when she's on the screen, the movie makes a big leap. Smith is also wonderful - she doesn't survive her lesbian character too much. Brass is also good, but she's not that much. Bette Midler is only hysterical in a small role and Cloris Leachman pulls the nonsense from a housekeeper. The direction is also good - especially during a fashion show. I heard that director Diane Engels had a lot of trouble directing her first full movie, but it didn't show up in the final product. There are also clever references to the original (mostly certain lines) inserted without grease. <br /> <br /> I saw it in an audience full of women (there were a few guys but not many) and they loved it. The movie ends in an opera room sequence that all cries. So - it wasn't necessary, but it's not the disaster that people say it is. Also - people say we don't need a movie with all women. Well why not? I see a lot of movies with all the guys in the role and no one complains about it! Ignore the complaints and bad reviews and see it. With a better performance by Ryan, I could have given it an 8 or 9, but as it is, I can only give it a 7.
