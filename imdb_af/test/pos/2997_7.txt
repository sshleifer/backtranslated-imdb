I caught this movie on the track of a band I used to catch a movie I really wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to see it. In fact, it was a bit entertaining, and took me back "in the back-breaking machine" to the filmed films that Hollywood erupted in the sixties, much in the same genre as current Austin Power. Oh the acting was not excellent, nor the plot, but it was worth watching. There was a beautiful scenery, though me. Welch had the most pleasant of such deliveries. Tape it if you get the chance and watch when you have absolutely nothing else to do. It is not a snoozer, but you will no longer want to roll in the corridors.
