I expected it to be just like the others, trying to be frightening, and that's stupid. Somewhere along the line, the authors should have realized this and so the film, in a completely different direction, generally ignored the other films. It feels like another movie rather than the fourth entry in the Child's Play series. The new idea works by far the best in the series.
