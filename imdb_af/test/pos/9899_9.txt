The timing of this film being released cannot be better, especially in the face of all the turmoil in this world today. The film is a heart-warming, engaging and witty piece. If you have brothers and sisters and still live with parents, it will be good for the viewer. If you have lost your parents, it will get you deep. The laugh comes often, the ensemble site works very well and is credible. This film is intelligently written and the lines that come from each of the actors often make the viewer out loud. There are moments that will also bring tears to your eyes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who respects the importance of family and can follow an intelligent movie.
