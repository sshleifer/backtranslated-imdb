A movie like this doesn't come too often. I'm surprised it took 9 years to finally see it. Politicians and civic seas must see this before making decisions about how destructive people live. I watched it the day after the TV show "Revolt" over the Warsaw ghetto. Even with this new thought, I felt sympathy for the German soldier. I congratulate all parties for this tragedy to happen. It will take a while to thaw out of this one. I'm surprised they didn't make a movie based on "The Forgotten Soldier" by Buy Sajer. This movie shares the cold with the book. Both will haunt me for the rest of my life.
