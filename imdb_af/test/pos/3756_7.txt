I first saw this movie when it was shown on TV, but I can remember it another 15 years later, something like that has to be said about it. I thought it was an intelligent look at school education, friendship, bullies and the impact it could have on adult life. <br /> <br /> The title really refers to how good or bad the sport can make you the lowest. from the low or you will be tolerated by the clothes in school and even later in adulthood if you are good - it is in a private school in England, but it can be anywhere. <br /> <br /> The main character is bad at games, looking for revenge in later life, all of which culminate in a climate confrontation on a cricket field. I must admit I came to the end - it was powerful and sad.
