A heroic young trail exploration leads a great deal of the pioneers along the GREAT TRAIL to the West, with Indian attacks, natural disasters and romantic complications, all of which are part of the adventure. <br /> <br /> So terrific and wonderful as his story, Raoul Walsh's THE BIG TRAIL is a wonderful movie, as entertaining as it was over seven decades ago. With very good acting and excellent production values, it lives up to its reputation as the talkies' first epic Western. <br /> <br /> John Wayne, who has been out of the dark for his first major film role, seems impossible young, but he immediately impressed with the natural charm and male authority, bringing the hero's role; He dominates the movie quietly with the features that will ever make him a big star. Marguerite Churchill picks up as a beautiful southern belle who slowly joins the Duke's attention. Dialect comic El Brendel is fun as a Swedish immigrant occupied with mule & mother-in-law; his appearance in a scene signals laughter for the viewer. <br /> <br /> Look and sound like a human grizzly bear, Tyrone Power Sr., big and repulsive, making a great villain. Slick cardsharp Ian Keith is a sophisticated bad guy. (His famous physical deal with John Gilbert is very clear here.) Silent film character actor Tully Marshall is impressive as an old old mountain man who helps guide the wagon train. Corpulent Russ Powell, as a friendly furry stacker, sets his vocal talent for the use of noise. Sharp-eyed movie ghosts will see Ward Bond as one of the Missouri settlers. <br /> <br /> What many modern viewers will surprise is that the BIG TRAIL is filmed in an early wide-screen process called Grandeur. More than its name, the picture looks great, with Walsh showing a new technology mastery. He fills the screen, every part of it, with action. Note during the scissors screens, how everyone is doing real work, which adds so much to the likelihood of these rich people. Walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use wide screen. In addition, the film is blessed with the backdrop photography that saturates so many older movies. It should also be emphasized that it is only natural that the soundtrack sounds a bit primitive; talks were still in their cradle. That Walsh couldn't use a microphone, with most of the screens shot from the door, is more kudos for him. <br /> <br /> The BIG TRAIL was not a cash success. In 1930, William Haines' comedies were the big money makers and the public was looking for rates other than intelligent Westerners. Most of the throws went into darkness, including Wayne. It won't be until 1939 when John Ford rescued him in STAGECOACH that John Wayne's legend would start seriously. And in spite of its large and fleeting views, it would be another 25 years before wide screen was trapped with Hollywood, mainly as a response to the economic threat of television.
