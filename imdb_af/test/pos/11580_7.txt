It is a soap opera drawing on an applied ethical idea. A movie about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie. I got no emotion from it, the ideas are not new, the tension is lacking, it gets annoying after the second half, but I think it is very interesting on a burlesque. I mean you have this middle-aged, paralyzed bald guy who gets more women than Don Juan. He does not look as much as you would expect from someone who has been completely paralyzed for 28 years, he has no problems with God (and it will probably expect it as well). The people around him seem to be the perfect slaves. Can't get out of my mind, Bergman's Kries and Whisper, similar to this one in many ways, which only bursts with emotions, and not all of them.). This movie is the perfect recipe for housewives looking for some emotional excitement but don't expect to be blown away. The film is worth seeing under all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical issue with no desire to awaken the viewer. Amenabar does not rub your face in it and he does not take sides, he does not want to make a fanatic for a particular idea. Yet I have no idea why this movie is so highly regarded.
