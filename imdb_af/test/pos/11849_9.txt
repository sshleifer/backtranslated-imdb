I came into the pit this morning where Ed was involved in the 3-Way and thought my wife had caught some early morning gore! To my surprise, it grabbed my attention and I re-invented it and we started watching it at 4:30 am in the morning! What a very entertaining, rich, funny and well-developed plot line and script. We both enjoyed it very much, my wife so much that she shared the experience with her friends at work! Will it recommend and say what a "kick" she got from it. I'm in my late 40's and she's in her early 50's. I think this movie will appeal to both young and old. An unexpected, very pleasant surprise. Nice work! Thank you! Two thumbs up!
