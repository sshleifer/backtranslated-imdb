Florence Vidor stars as the daughter of a strict biblical father who throws her out of the house when gossip hides her name. In the big city she finds the dying wife of her own brother (the two married in secret) and raises their child on her own. Years later, she returned home to confront her family. <br /> <br /> This ancient melodrama is heavily loaded with fascinating feminist themes (around 1921, but sounds remarkably modern). Some of it is laid with a trowel (like the father, Theodore Roberts gives his eyebrows a real workout), but it is well composed and written by film writer Henry Sharp.
