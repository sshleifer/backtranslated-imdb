Well, unlike most people .... I've been in this movie, expecting it not to be so good and it seems to be a great movie. Pretty cool plot I love it, but it made the movie. they all did an incredible job and it was pretty cool to work fish and dillon together. It's a movie you're thinking of right away, and you'll be able to predict what's going to happen, but it's not clear how you predicted it. I don't want to give anything about the story, so I won't ... but I suggest this one be given a chance. If you've seen the movie Money Train and enjoy watching this movie. Perhaps everything that Lawrence Fishburn touches is gold?
