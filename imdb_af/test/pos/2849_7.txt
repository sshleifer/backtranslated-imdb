Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most beautiful, disapproved and light-hearted comedies of the year. <br /> <br /> When sea-pop obsession waitress Betty Sizemore witnessed her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she understands and thinks the role-players are in love really. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find the famous heart specialist Dr David Ravell (a character on the show). <br /> <br /> As the two strangely paired Hitmen, the biting Rock and the pace-making Freeman generate lots of fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona. Ren√© Zellweger turns into an innocent, sweet and sometimes awful sweet show as nurse Betty. She has good, warmth and is irresistible. While the writing sometimes feels like a sit-com, is filled with sometimes incredible characters and confronted situations, Zellweger is so nice and so disarmed that it all comes together. <br /> <br /> With just a few splashes of black comedy to keep things interesting, a winning performance from Zellweger, a great supporting role and a skilled writing, Nurse Betty is extremely wonderful. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
