Not only unique to his time, but one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. Made without CGI at a very low budget in today's custom figures. Stanley Kubrick made this movie without the high shooting ratio he normally has. Stanley Kubrick is without a doubt the greatest director in history so far. <br /> <br /> This movie was cut from five hours to two hours and twenty minutes and the art direction was wonderful. <br /> <br /> Stanley Kubrick and the great Aurthur C. Clarke worked together to write less classics this time. <br /> <br /> Aliens are a special message on Earth in the light of Human Child and one on the Moon that modern man finds. <br /> <br /> Finally, people accompanied by the most advanced computer ever put to Jupiter, find the following monumental message that seems to be a gateway. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has studied film and / or wants to be part of the movie industry or just enjoy the great movies that this movie has to experience. <br /> <br /> If you don't like it, you belong to Bollywood or your true Aussie.
