Apocalyptic movie fans will enjoy this well-made low-budget thriller, which is essentially a remake of the 1951 George Pal classic "When Worlds Collide." A comet is about to collide with the earth, and if his fellow scientists ignore his war crimes, eccentric scientist Peter Crawford (Dennis Hopper) gathers a group of private investors to secret an underground sanctuary to build. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds through the eyes of muscle-bound Gulf War veteran Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati) who accidentally discovers Crawford's hidden sanctuary and decides Crawford is wrong to keep his project away from the rest of the humanity. As the comet approaches, the subject of whoever has to live and who must die for must be interesting drama. <br /> <br /> While the special effects aren't in the same league, I enjoyed the story more than I did Spielberg's World War because I feel this script is better. Some suspension of scientific reality is required, but it is worth the development of a good story. I recommend this movie to fans of the genre.
