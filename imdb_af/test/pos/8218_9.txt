If you actually read this review, I give you a lot of credit. You care enough to really look up this movie, after which most people have forgotten and then looked after the first review! So for your reading pleasure ... <br /> <br /> I suppose you know the plot line, so I won't waste time typing it out. I will mention that Sandra Bullock did a wonderful job with this movie. She brought a lot of sympathy to the role of a computer programmer, often difficult to do. I can say that because I'm a computer programmer. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought the basic plot was a very good one. You can easily build subplots on its main frame and make it into a very pleasant movie. The premise is also scarily realistic, as all this can really happen if the right advances are not taken. <br /> <br /> To make a long review short ... oops! Too late! Enjoying Sandra Bullock brings a role in life and wants to see a very good movie for the time, look at this jeweler. You won't be disappointed. :-)
