Almost every commentator mentioned the way some of the interviewing about the conceptual material was placed in place. This is true and is the biggest mistake of this movie. However, it is not so often, or so bad, that one should not see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you should see it. Apart from seeing Black Sabbath in the Seventies and early Eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also wrote OZZfest as written in this video. The concert was wonderful, and so much, so I rented it in the first place. It's about the best geezer rock out there. Look at that.
