OMG, it is seriously the best performance in the world. It rocks harder than Jackass and CKY and is so funny and entertaining. I love the show. All 5 seasons are great, but for a quick summary: Season 1: - Big if you want to plan a scavenger hunt, watch the house be pulled apart and enjoy Phil's hunger. <br /> <br /> Season 2: - Big if you want to see them buy Castle Bam, watch a slayer concert, see the wonder that Mardi Gras is and the pleasure to get it, see a demo -by and actually see the making and opening of a Tree Top Casino. <br /> <br /> Season 3: - Wonderful if you want to see probably the first Driveway Skatepark, a civil war, Johnny Knoxville, a pirate ship and Don Vito who actually played one of Bam's reindeer. <br /> <br /> Season 4: - Big if you want to see them in Europe, they get work, build a state and a Bayou and The Dudesons Season 5: - Big if you want to see it in Brazil , Monkey's birthday, Mike Vallely, The Metal Mulisha, Bams Lambo disappear, Bams Hummer is destroyed, a playboy party in bams pool and the very last Viva La Bam :(
