'Anne Christie' was Garbo's 14th movie and the first in which her soft, Swedish voice was heard. She plays the main character, Anna, who has struggled to leave her father, Chris (a drunken shipwright played by George F Marion) and with the accident of life she must keep her head above water. br /> <br /> Meeting Irish Matt (Charles Bickford) can mark or do her turning point? Garbo looks and sounds good in this drama, which, although he looks rather clunky and slow, still has an interest and attracts an audience almost 80 years later. Marie Dressler impacts on the role she has given her a second flush of movie success in films such as Min and Bill, Dinner at Eight and Emma; while Marion and Bickford are more than adequate. <br /> <br /> An interesting piece of film history. Garbo will do better talk over the next few years, but 'Anna Christie' will always be remembered for the first time she spoke on the screen.
