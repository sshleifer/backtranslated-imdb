My sister, Dad, and I really are in D&D and one night we are on Netflix looking for a movie to watch when this one came up. We thought we'd try it out and I eventually killed. The writing and acting in this movie is so amazing! Sharp characters, great interaction, and hilarious moments kept us in stitches all the time. I love this movie! It may not make much sense to those who don't know Dungeons & Dragons, but it's a good movie. It just shows that movies do not need an astronomical budget and big names actors / actresses to succeed. Check it out if you want a good, clean comedy.
