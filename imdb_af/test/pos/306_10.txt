Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) was sent to a spot during a controlled mission in Cambodia during the Vietnam War. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) to be murdered as he is completely insane and no longer accepts orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it's hard for Capt. Willard to understand how spotless. Kurtz can go from the deepest point, as he did, without solving and taking the war into his own hands. What could have pushed this great man at the top of the thrust? By Willard's long journey through the jungle to find his target, he tries to understand why. But what will he decide to do once he gets it? <br /> <br /> Any movie that can start with The Doors' "The End" is a good movie in my book, especially if it can flow with the mood. and displaying images with the song. Apocalypse It does it perfectly now. I can't think of anything better to put it, the Vietnam War and the madness in the minds that created it. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the brilliant jungles in Vietnam, whose ultimate destination is murder. By using music and counting alone, we are thrown into a dark world of mystery, violence and madness. A perfect example of how to vote through music alone is this movie here. <br /> <br /> An overall good cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting to spread on our movie cattle bread. I just love Fishburne, since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's playhouse, little contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten times. I realize the pettiness of this, but I just don't care. We must have sick Gary Oldman on him. Brando is excellent as coal. Kurtz and I can't think of any other actor playing the good man and holding such a screen presence. Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his interrogation of his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the movie is Robert Duvall's Lt. Colonel Kilgore. In front of this film, I have never suggested Duvall as a time warrior, but honestly this is my favorite of its parts to date. He simply ignored his character, one of the best in the whole movie, as the gung-ho Air Cavalry commander who likes to navigate. Maybe a bit on top, but brilliant. I also like the smell of napalm in the morning. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple and it doesn't take too much brain power to figure out what's going on. Willard's goal is to kill Kurtz, simply and simply. But this is the journey of the movie, it is really the heart and also the dire situations of the war itself. In the Redux version, we are forced to pass through the extensive French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene, which really does nothing more about the film's whole, but it makes it a long journey. I don't feel they are throwing anything away, it's just a matter of watching a three and a half hour movie or the original one. Through this journey, the film shows the total uselessness and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and its massive impact on the soldiers fighting in it. In fact, this is the whole point. In addition, the troops are not supported by the public and it may well have helped a character such as Kurtz 'become completely angry. <br /> <br /> A great war movie lover, this one is there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter, all of them classic. I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre, but in the past I have had trouble in my reviews, as I went back to what I said. All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War. So to really say, one is better than the other, is pretty useless. Although, after watching AN recently, I think it's a little better. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a true classic in any version and worthy of the status it is given. As a fellow judge has said before, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made.
