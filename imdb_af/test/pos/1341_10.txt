When I was five, it was my favorite television program. I remember it was on Channel 11 every morning. The show's performance was simple with Carole and Janis as the hostesses of these children's television programs. They sang songs and read stories to us as children. This was done in a studio with only 54 episodes being broadcast over and over. I remember Sherlock, the puppet, in the tree. The show taught us how to count, add, subtract and alphabet. For thirty minutes a day I learned something new with Paula and Janis. I remember those days as pleasant memories and now I hope that the children today can learn to hear simpler things like hearings, cheap props, swings and talking dolls. The set was ideal and simple, but it was Carole and Janis who made it worthwhile. I miss my childhood and those days where the most important thing was the Magic Garden. Life was so much simpler and better. Now, I hope the kids enjoy the show today.
