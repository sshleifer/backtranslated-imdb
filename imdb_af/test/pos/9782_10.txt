When I heard, there was a mini-series based on life in the Changi [WWII POW] camp, focusing on "elements of the comedy". I was deeply skeptical and critical. /> <br /> My dad served in the Second World War. So was the barbarism of the Japanese, he could talk about the abominations in and around Labuan (where he was stationed) until very recently. Along with my father, I have been fortunate to know many great men (of stronger character and spirit than I ever have) who have seen acts of unspeakable barbarian in the hands of the kingdom of Japan and have never completely recovered. The name 'Changi' is meant to claim horrible images for centuries to come ... <br /> <br /> But when I saw it, I was very impressed with the cast, the characters and the complex plot lines of this wonderful series. I now consider 'Changi' as the highlight of my week, (remember I have only watched three episodes so far ... I hope the remaining episodes meet the standards set by the first three.) <br /> < The black humor works badly, but the cruelty is a little exaggerated. And although much of the horror has been suppressed, the series comes close to reviving the untamed spirit of the survivors who could continue later. with their lives despite the inhibitory memories. <br /> <br /> Some of this 'jump-back' format will be difficult for some to follow, <br /> <br /> but I can't think of anything to do enough justice to the men who have suffered deep emotional scars ... when remembering painfully oppressed experiences, sometimes years after the abomination. <br /> <br /> One of the darkest chapters of World War II, the 20th century, and (I go as far as to say), in the history of humanity, is transferred to a new spirit followed by this series, and I hope it serves to revive the overwhelming adversity caused by war-time generation. <br /> <br /> The progress of 'Changi', I don't think, will ever be able to listen to the gripping voice 'on the way to Gundagai' the same way again. Tune in...
