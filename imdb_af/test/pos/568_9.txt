I just saw the movie through Netflix. I was intrigued by the way the movie was described, but in the end it was better. I was moved in many different directions while watching this movie. I was filled with hurt, hatred, evil, bitterness, pain and eventually relief. Looking at the accused's young man will break your heart and convince you that they have the wrong person. Police filthiness makes you burn, because just as Rodney King Beating revealed the brutality of the police, this movie brings the total lack of moral fiber in this police. And the fact that they beat this boy and got away with it just admonishes you. <br /> <br /> But I have to tell you, I fell in love with the lawyer, Mc Guinness. One of my favorite lines when he told us what a ** hole on the police was ... The police word told him to continue, sucking on the cancer stick. Mc Guinness told police ... "I always have a cigarette before sex ..." I told him I was going to screw him. <br /> <br /> I have a new respect for some of the law in this country.
