An unfairly neglected classic, "Intruder in the Dust", is one of the major films of the 1940s that unfortunately slipped into darkness. Based on a story by William Faulker, and in his hometown of Oxford, the "Invader" tells the story of Lucas Beauchamp (played with great dignity by Juano Hernandez), a black man who is unfairly accused of murdering a local white man, and a white boy (Claude Jarman, Jr.) who used this situation as an opportunity to pay a previous debt to Beauchamp. Wonderful acting, especially by two great character actors, Porter Hall (as the dead father) and Elizabeth Patterson (known as Trumbull on "I Love Lucy") as an old woman willing to stand against the villagers To see it right is done. This straightforward, tense and sincere study of racial deserves is worth seeing.
