It took me several times to fully appreciate this movie. Initially I was hit by the stylized sets, but I found the rest slow and dull. I thought such a sensational topic needed the Ken Russell treatment to keep it over the top. I now find the forced restraint (placed on the production by Mishima's widow) to be an asset. Some of the more vague aspects of Mishima's life are repeated and dramatized by similar themes from his novels. I think it helps to be familiar with the novels - it finally made the difference to me. However, the movie overall may feel a bit harder and warmer, but it is truly unique and deserves much attention. Love the fact that Japanese characters speak Japanese - not English. The Philip Glass count is fascinating.
