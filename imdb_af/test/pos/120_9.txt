There are questions that sometimes move over us and have no answer. Two women progressively find themselves in each other's arms (as the expression sounds, that is exactly what happens) and find that they cannot answer their own question as defining their relationship as their own society has no name on what they are. Deepa Mehta's somewhat wrong title BRAND is the first of a flyhalf trilogy, linked to the theme of the elements, and more symbolic than to use. Fire as uncontrolled erotic passion does not look here, as the older and female Radha (Shabana Azmi) and the younger, more masculine hardened Sita (Nandita Das) realize that they share much more than common ideas and love one another and stand for what they believe their passion for each other, in spite of the opposition they experience many traditional men and families. As in WATER, fire is very spiritual, even though it technically falls into the mode of sentimental melodrama (where WATER, much like the word's weight, bears a stronger meaning that ultimately surpasses its definition). Yet it is a very nice picture and a strong voice from a strong director.
