Dirty Dancing - I think everyone saw the movie at some time or another. I can remember as a child I loved for this movie and it looked over and over without utilizing it. <br /> <br /> Now that I'm a bit older, I recently bought the DVD and still aren't disappointed with the show. <br /> <br /> Swayze and Gray create the atmosphere for this movie, although it's claimed they don't come together, the chemistry in the movie is incredible! As the movie goes, we get sucked into their relationship and believe each one of their actions. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is incredible, the music just adds to the romantic mood of the movie and adds to the relationship between Baby & Patrick. <br /> <br /> The last scene makes this movie, who can ever forget the famous line "Noboby puts Baby in the corner." The song is perfect and the dance is great! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone. At any age, it's just a fun movie that everyone can enjoy 8/10.
