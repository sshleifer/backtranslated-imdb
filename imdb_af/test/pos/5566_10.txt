This series is much underestimated. Like many others, I came to Farscape after the series was canceled. Purchased Season 1 and was surprised to find a cleverly written drama with a balanced mix of tension, romance, white and of course sci-fi. Right from the bat it has a 10 to be the first series or movie to satisfy us how our hero - and every stranger he comes into contact with - speaks English! Okay, some others cut the problem, but Farscape did it best. The point is that the writers pay close attention to detail to make the show as credible as possible. <br /> <br /> With so much programming out there, it is a pity that balanced, entertaining series like Farscape don't get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production. While enjoying the four seasons, and fortunately the four-hour miniseries, we may be making enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show.
