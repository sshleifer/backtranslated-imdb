I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the first moment! This is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dance, music and choreography! The leaders, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne captivated me with their beautiful dance! May they always shine and dance. Their on the rise chemistry was wonderful, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they're made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favorite, and will probably always be. Long Live River Dance!
