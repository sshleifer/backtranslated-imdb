This show is pure entertainment and doesn't try to be a Greek drama. It definitely contains elements of one that rotates with the whole plot, but it is very enjoyable and fun. Las Vegas is the perfect setting for a show and they will definitely never have a lack of material to work with! Anything and everything happens there! The actors in this show are extremely encouraging and you really want to see what they do every week and every week. The show is also very funny. The humor comes from the characters and situations. Not just thrown. It's a well-crafted performance in this regard. It certainly makes me look Friday night and I'm glad I now own the first two seasons on DVD!
