When I first returned this movie in mid-January (2005), I didn't like it. I thought it was too strange and thought some parts that the star, Judith Light, had acted so differently from her. (Which of course is true) And then I saw bits the next day when it was broadcast again and I almost felt the same. Then I watched it again two Sundays (March 20, 2005) and I really enjoyed it and this time I tackled the whole thing. I even cried the first 2 times, but mainly because the actress is actually crying and I'm a big fan of her. <br /> <br /> This is a very well-activated TV movie. Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a great job in this movie! I keep it over and over. It's a sad movie, but very good. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, I definitely recommend it! It's not usually my kind of movie, but I enjoyed it! A +++
