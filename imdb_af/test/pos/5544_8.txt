Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine are delighted to see this screwball comedy. Alec Baldwin, who was an exciting star when the film was made, is a hoot. Dean Stockwell, in a statement by John Gotti, is hysterical. But Mercedes Ruehl, as the paranoid and over Connie, steals the movie. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme, formerly known for wacky comedies like "Something Wild" and "Melvin and Howard", proves he's a genius. I was not surprised when he won the Oscar for directing the silence of the lambs. The performances he calls from his actors in "Married" are inspired, and the audience is compiled for a wild and woolly ride. <br /> <br /> One of the cutest, most intimate films of the 80's, stands and shoulders above many of the satires of his era.
