This British film version of the play I AM A CAMERA is based on Christopher Isherwood's "Berlin Stories." This is the source material for the famous musical CABARET. <br /> <br /> Julie Harris, a major stage actress of her day, reprises her 1951 Tony award role as Sally Bowles. She is far from the Liza Minnelli character, but the basic Sally is already here, despite the various movie codes that have blocked this story from being filmed in Hollywood. Harris may be dumb, but she is also very good at Madcap and Sally. Her song number is of course called (by Marlene Dietrich no less), although Harris may even sing for herself in other moments. <br /> <br /> Laurence Harvey (with the very ugly hair) plays Isherwood with zero charm and can't even make the character interesting. Shelley Winters does little with Natalia's role (Marian Winters won a supporting Tony for the play), and Anton Diffring is OK as Fritz. Ron Randell plays the caddish Clive but looks a little hard. Lee Seidl is funny like the housewife. <br /> <br /> Despite the overall staginess and cheap look, Harris takes the middle stage and she is wonderful. This film was released the same year as EAST VAN EDEN, in which Harris gave a glowing performance as Abra. Comparing the two performances gives a good look at Miss Harris's talent. These two characters can no longer be unbalanced. Harris' Sally preens and prances over and grows out of a very capricious laugh. She also does circles around the boring Harvey. <br /> <br /> Without the music and with a well-known story, many viewers can find little here to recommend this movie, but it's a good chance to see the great Julie Harris repeating what was likely a very shocking role in 1951.
