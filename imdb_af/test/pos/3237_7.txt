I just watched it on BBC Channel 4. It's not Jane Austen's best novel, but the film is a reasonable interpretation. I suspect the Assembly rooms at Bath would have been more crowded than shown; Maybe they couldn't afford the extras. Also why do everyone like the dancing couple to have an audible conversation? I have never heard anything that someone told me when I danced and I suspect it would have been the same in the 18 / 19th century in Bath. <br /> <br /> I can't review US / Canada reviews; they completely miss the ironic element that is in the film throughout. The "gothic" scenes are quite cleverly presented, but you should read it properly. I'm sure Jane A will be amused by the reviews. A suggestion of nothing, does anyone else think that Peter Firth looks more like Colin Baker (a former Doctor Who) or vice versa the parent they both get?
