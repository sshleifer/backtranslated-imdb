I can't believe how perfect this movie is. Great CG graphics, good storyline, and fighting, oh the fighting !!! This movie was wonderful !! The characters. They really look enough to be considered real. They definitely look like the one that looks perfect. The scene in which .... all the scenes dropped my jaw. Fantastic 10/10 graphics The story. Fully explained. Plus the way Aeris will help in the movie Cloud at various times. They explain it very well and drop your jaw of how perfect it is. But the repetitive battles take a little story, but it's just a little thing. Story 9.5 / 10 Everything else, wonderful. The movie was just amazing. I really no longer know what to say, except that this movie was almost perfect. I WAS THEREFORE !!!
