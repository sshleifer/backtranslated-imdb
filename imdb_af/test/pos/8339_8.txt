This film, an early William Wellman, has an important message, especially today. It suggests that sometimes things are more important than your own personal juice or well-being. The movie, which led Walter Huston, is stolen by performing "Chic" Sales as Grampa. He is the most completely drawn character in the film and a joy to watch. You recognize some familiar faces when you watch many movies from the 20's and 30's. Well, your time is to see if you have the opportunity. Recommended.
