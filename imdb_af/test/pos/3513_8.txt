I waited almost 25 years to find it difficult to find horror thriller and I eventually did because it is a proper rebirth on DVD. Of course, I didn't have the same impact as I would have had if I saw the 80's, but director Lieberman (his film "Squirm" is excellent) makes good use of the beautiful Oregon location and takes the time to develop it. characters, not just to send them out in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's flute music is very creepy and adds to the desert proceedings making this great fun for genre fans. A must see if you underestimate horror movies. To describe, it would sprinkle an intelligent "Friday The 13th" with some nice bits of "Liberation." There are some very cool and original moments like my favorite when a couple swim in a lake and the man disappears underwater to play a trick on his gall. Just when you think it's the usual scare, it suddenly seems to be kissing and ... I can't make it honest. You just have to look for yourself. Also, the end is just one of those you just have to see to believe ?? It came out of nowhere and it is weird and wild! The DVD includes comments from Lieberman.
