I saw so many bad reviews on Supervivientes de los Andes that I forced to stand for (or at least I'll try). First of all, of course it seems dated, it was made in the seventies with a very low budget, but it is part of its charm. I like contemporary movies, but also the old ones are digging for what they are worth. I'm not the one who feels the urge to see or keep with modern treatments and effects only; In addition, almost every movie buffy keeps old-fashioned motion pictures (which do not hold films of El Santo or Plan 9 from outer space, no matter if it's overall quality). In terms of convenience, it's just a tool to cover again (it's low cost), and I think the constant dialogues are in order of better character and situation development. Sure, Alive has better FX, but I won't just despise the guy, and I don't feel very appealing to English speakers in an event involving people from Uruguay and that gives me a plus to Supervivientes de los Andes . It is as if Canoa, from the seventies and on the basis of a real event, would now have a better remake due to advances in technology, but I think I would adhere to the emotions that offer, regardless of the production date . <br /> <br /> All of this is based on the impact I had on my mind because the first time I saw it on TV, and today I don't think it lost its power. Of course it's been a long time and I've seen tons of better movies in every aspect of the theater, but it doesn't diminish its true value. It's not a bad movie, and I put it above Alive without hesitation. Just give it a break.
