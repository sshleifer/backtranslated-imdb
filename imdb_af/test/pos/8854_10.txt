The thing is a milestone in film making and remains one of my favorite movies of all time. Despite the film's roots in science fiction, it is ultimately a horror movie that splashes brilliant balances with psychological trauma. Today, more than twenty-five years after its release, the special effects stand out as an example of mere gloss and effects. Rob Botin had a complete physical collapse for his art. It will be impossible to make the same movie today, as the Studio definitely insists on a female character or a Paul-Walker type. <br /> <br /> A male American science team in Antarctica is being thrown into turmoil. When an alien life form is able to perfectly absorb and imitate other life forms, they infiltrate camp. Their trust in each other is still crumbling, as they are increasingly certain who is real and who is an imitation, and this body-snatchers scenario still sees their numbers as one-on-one, their victim of The Thing. When constructed, it manifests itself as another nightmarish being. The metamorphosis is always terrible and compelling. <br /> <br /> The helplessness, isolation and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men, without any reason from their situation and no way to help them, is knowledgeable. The long hours of darkness and increasing snowfall offer a pale background to the unfolding terror. Director John Carpenter has carefully chosen a team of brilliant character actors and each team member fits perfectly with the part they play, whether it's the young and street fish chef, the elderly and wise doctor or the bitter and cynical helicopter is. pilot. The point is that no one is close to an all-American badass superhero with blonde locks and a six-pack and the movie's real strength is in no way part of this scary realism. The people on the screen are recognizable in our daily lives. <br /> <br /> The thing remains enjoyable and influences even after repeated views. I have now seen the film more than twenty separate occasions and my amazement at the quality of the direction, the acting and the special effects is unshakable. My girlfriend prefers the high-school spin-off of the movie - The Faculty - which is good and solid entertainment, but much more light-hearted and fluent. She still loves and recognizes The Thing's glory and thanks for that. Because I couldn't stay in the company of someone who doesn't love this movie. <br /> <br /> A classic and then some.
