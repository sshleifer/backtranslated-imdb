Shtrafbat is the story that only Russians of World War II could tell. Ironically, the biggest front of the whole conflict was the least phenomenon on the silver screen after the war. While the Western Allies war effort is depicted on virtually every possible detail and manner, the East is left out, or the work is left to only a few old propaganda movies of slightly different historical value. <br /> <br /> There is no chance that Shtrafbat will be able to compete in every detail with Band of Brothers, but you also don't want to look at the screen with the consideration of small visual effects in mind. The fact that the soldiers are Russians is enough reason to forgive the less-eye-catching battlefield and you can concentrate on the most interesting story. So much else was the war in the eastern front and the nature of the Russian army, that you might want people to produce more dramatizations of the other fronts and of the armies. <br /> <br /> Shtrafbat isn't perfect, but it has a few rare specialties that increase overall rating. It tends to waste myths about World War II, the real heroes were Russian people and not their leaders who sent them to missions where they could just die. Another great myth bust is that it offers the enemy, who doesn't take up his gun, as an equal man - a progress that is also difficult to try in many famous films. Shtrafbat shows how the war in the eastern front was a war of survival and how the clash of the people interferes with dust.
