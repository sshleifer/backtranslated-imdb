This movie tops the previous incarnation by a mile, all to the next level. As always, the JackAss guys are purely incredible, and I personally laughed in that theater as I had for a long time. Like the first JackAss, it's not as much a movie as an eighty minute long rope of stunts and pranks. It's pure circus entertainment to the highest level. In essence, these guys are clowns, who entertain themselves for the entertainment of others. And she's big. The shenanigans are so low, scandalous and often disgusting that they outperform in a higher form of entertainment. <br /> <br /> You can't assess it with other movies, it's in a class of its own. And it shines. Go and enjoy it for the pure show.
