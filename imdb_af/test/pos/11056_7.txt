The short film that Gaspar Noe got on the movie card, introduced us to his terrible, but thoroughly interesting character The Butcher, Phillipe Nahon played brilliantly. Noe's direction has all the features of his later films, showing that he has cut his own voice and style from the beginning. His sudden cut with a loud, loud noise, flash back and many other techniques are all used to upset the viewer. And it certainly works. He is also not afraid to show violence, as Irreversible viewers will know. Here the violence is equally strong, and in the sequel Seul Contre Tous it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a horse being killed. It is shot in the head, and we watch it being written on the floor, its puddle of blood flowing out. We then see a human birth in all its bloody glory, The Butcher's daughter. He was orphan in World War II, and grew up to hate the world, and everyone and everything in it. He serves his clients, but his domestic monologue reminds us of his thoughts - he wants them all to be dead. His daughter, Blandine Lenoir, who also wants to revive her role six years later, is the only thing he cares about and we look at them getting older. However, she is dumb and the subject of bullies and toying. The Creator's relationship with her is almost offensive, her bath when she is old enough to do it herself, etc., but it is being explored more in the next film. When attacked by a man, the Butcher explodes with anger, an innocent man stabbing in the mouth. He's in prison, taken from the only things he wants - his shop and daughter. In the short 40 minutes we see all this and more, his time in prison and go back to his world. Because of his daughter's state, also autistic, I think she is slim, does little except staring and is under the full control of her father. The film continues in particular pale Seul Contre Tous. If you can, watch these two movies for this one. It has a very excellent play, but it is very difficult to watch because of the relentless show. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
