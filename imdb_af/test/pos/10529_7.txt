This BBC version of an Agatha Christie book shows the pitfalls of following a book. Christie's books tend to move in a gentle, sometimes even soft, pace, and "Evans" is definitely one. It also has a solid school of red herring to confuse the plot. This version is extremely true to the book, resulting in a very slow, relevant story. As a Christie fan, I gave it 7 stars, but it takes 3 hours to make a relatively action-free story. I appreciate some of the cut of plots the BBC has done for its later Christie productions. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is a tranquil pleasure, highlighted by the breathtaking Fransca Annis who brings considerable charisma to her role and plays James Warwick very well.
