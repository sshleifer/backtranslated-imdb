"Thesis", "Open Your Eyes" and "The Others" was evidence of Amenabar's talent and skill as a filmmaker, but (in my humble opinion) were also flawed films in their attempt to smother the audience. Screw too much, favor low voltage, turn and turn over depth and resonance. Happy to everyone Amenabar has chosen a subject for his new movie that will not allow a surprise ending, with the emphasis on characters and the emotional ties that they tie. <br /> <br /> The result is a small miracle of a movie, beautifully written, photographed, recorded, acted and directed. Everyone involved in this film delivers a high performance, behind and in front of the cameras, of the wonderful role play (Bardem shines, but Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Clara Segura and Lola Due√±as give the film a wonderful authenticity) to Aguirresarobe's beautiful Lensing. <br /> <br /> The movie tapes on many relevant issues and emotions effectively. It speaks heart and mind with equal strength and produces a final punch that stays long after the credit roll. It is a brilliant movie that will not only be a landmark in Spanish theater, but will surely be a pleasant surprise when it opens overseas. (Sony Classics paid a $ 6m record to distribute it.) Don't be surprised it is managed to get into the Oscar race ... There is no Amenabar stop. <br /> <br /> Bow trabajo, Alejandro!
