This movie has been playing in Lexington KY for 7 days. I saw it on the last day of her run and regretted that I couldn't recommend it to others because it was a movie that exclaimed for the big screen experience. The airship where the pushing ship moves away from the equally cute dock, is a masterpiece like the scene where the two main characters on the deck flirt - almost a ballet and sexier in his suggestion as much more explicit movies these days. I just scream to think that more people will not have the opportunity to see this fine movie in a theater; The DVD experience won't be the same. Here's an idea: If you live in a college town, see if you can lobby for it to show up at a campus movie festival.
