In 'Black Snake Moon', writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that a part of me wanted to reject the entire film as pretentious - a struggling Southern parable with some oh-so-risky topic. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is taken in the picture. It is again integrated without subtlety. After the darker plays, the film is still blowing more and more into the whole production with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I will admit that the last 15 minutes far from the "Happy Ending" area goes to my liking). And it is not to mention the archival images of musician Son House, which is based on love and death (and of course the things that lie ahead). Still in a strange way, these demerits are also characteristics of "Black Snake Moan", the story of aging Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), recently killed by his wife (for his brother, no less), which is near death comes Nimho Rae (Christina Ricci, who ever gives the hottest depiction of trailer's waste on celluloid); Nursing the girl back to health, he chains her to his radiator to overcome her demons, and hopefully his own cases leave alone. Although there is a definite sincere appeal to let Ricci fall, she falls out of the skimpy outfits. Her performance is risky and mature - not a trace of Addams Wednesday, and she easily joins Jackson with the "blues" in his portrait of a defective, God-fearing man. While passionate, the scene where Lazarus sings Rae a song in the midst of a lightning storm / blackout is compelling, just like a scene in a blues club wishing you were there. The institution is strong and a matter can be made for the literary symbolism (the chain, the cooler, the strange vague man who sees Rae's libido) is a deliberate outgrowth of superstition and spirituality. And this is the conviction with which this spirituality is played that gives "Black Snake Moan" much of its power. The dedicated performances of Jackson and Ricci make it a cruel movie to deal with, with a good seamless grace. While Justin Timberlake's jealous lover is a plot I could not do without, he or she cannot be a fascinating meditative film either.
