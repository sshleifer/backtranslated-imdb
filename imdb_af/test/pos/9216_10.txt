This movie is wonderful because it showed how good cartoons really look in the 80's, the animators were not lazy as they are today. The cartoon had so much detail with little resources they have with them compared to what we have today. If more people were to request these cartoons to resend, maybe all the other 80's cartoons would be shown on television again. To complete my sentence, I just wanted to say that it was a cartoon I grew up in and really wanted it to be on TV again.
