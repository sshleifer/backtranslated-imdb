This one started excellently. Photography and sound are the best I have experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colors in some rows is amazing. Also, to whisper Jennifer Lopez most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I don't know what Singh wants to achieve with that. <br /> <br /> Now for the minuses. The script was terrible. Lopez's part seems to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to have to die for the movie to sell herself and the photo. The three beds were just too obvious. The baptism of the child Carl was a psychologically underlined way to embody the motive Carl 'worked under'. And so on .. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie has a great way to show where Singh comes from. Why does it look like the most talented directors are coming out of India today?
