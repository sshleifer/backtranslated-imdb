This silent and unpretentious Danish film is flawlessly directed, written, performed and filmed. This is an example of cinema at its best, and if anyone can see BABETTE'S FEAST without being touched on a very fundamental level, they are a person I don't care to know. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple. In the 1800s, two elderly girls (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) live in remote Jutland, where they sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities and personal happiness to continue their long-dead father's religious ministry to the small flock he served . . One of the women's youthful admirers sends a Frenchman, Babette (Stephane Audran), whose husband and son were murdered in France and who fled her homeland so that she could not fulfill the same fate. Although they do not really need her services, the sisters engage her as a maid and cook - and as the years accompany her cunning and tireless efforts on their behalf, the aging congregation can stay together and imagine the sisters more comfortably than they had; In fact, the whole town admires and depends on her. <br /> <br /> One day, however, Babette receives a letter: she won a lottery and is now a rich woman according to village standards. Knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to France, the sisters give her a desire to allow them to prepare a true French meal for them and the members of their small congregation. The dinner and the evening it is served are actually an evening to remember - but not for reasons to be expected, because Babette's feast proves food for body and soul and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who were so good to her. <br /> <br /> The movie is exceptional in every respect, meticulously detailed, but not overwhelming in its presentation. As the film progresses, we come to love the characters in both their simple dedication to God and their all-human deceptions. The screens in which Babette prepares her festival and in which the meal is consumed are powerful, beautiful and incredibly memorable. There are several movies that used food as a metaphor for love, but no one approaches the simple artworks and beauty of BABETTE'S FEAST, which reminds us of all the good things about mankind and what food for body and soul proves. Highly, highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
