This film attacked more often in and out of fashion than the mini-skirt. A victory in the post-war period was virtually forgotten by the 1970s, except by theater students. Recently it has been recognized as possibly the most equal representation of soldiers' integration into the post-war life ever made (and it certainly includes films like "The Deer Hunter".) I like it, but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremes. <br /> <br /> The story is a simple one. Three very different soldiers who fled after the Second World War (The Big One!) Fly to their Midwest village and try to resume or create civilian lives. One has a disability, one has a soft work waiting for him and the other has nothing to do, but determination. <br /> <br /> There are some good but unfortunately uneven shows. Fredric March won the best actor Oscar for playing an old sergeant returning to his work at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for "It's a Wonderful Life," which also earned the best photo award, but this movie became clear with the post-war audience. As I said, it was fashionable. March has a fantastic scene, a humorous speech that kept a little similar incident in mind when keeping the real WWII hero Pappy Boyington in mind. Otherwise, it's solid, but uncluttered. <br /> <br /> I'm here against the grain, but I thought Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was justly ignored by the Academy. I hardly discovered a hint of warmth from her. In fact, I thought she was going to hit Frederic March because she was annoying her. Every time she grabbed each time they were together. Something was definitely there, in her forced smile and her air of tolerance rather than joy. I think all this nonsense that she is the "perfect woman" is just right if you think a passionate homemade domestic worker is your ideal. You may not agree, but the Academy voters do not seem to. She's a big problem with this movie, terribly disgusted. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews as a former soft drink who has become a war hero, then becomes behind the counter. It's incredible. He was sowed with a woman who apparently married him before he left the war for all the wrong reasons and his future looked dark. But then he gets on March's daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic turn), and fireworks explode. Both are wonderful, but then that inequality comes through which this film penetrates. A few moments of pure soap opera are harnessed by the everyday classic line, "I'm going to raise that marriage!" The romance is exciting and reflects a general condition after the war, the return of soldiers who find love on their return. <br /> <br /> Speaking of upliftment, now we come to Harold Russell. He has, or is non-acting, a naturalistic quality to his acting, just as it does today. He is an inspiration for a no-nonsense approach to his situation. His best scene, one of the best in all movies, is when he brings the girl who holds him into his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. "I'm happy, I still have my elbows, unlike some of the boys." Actually good things. <br /> <br /> The movie has a few moments moving. It also has a few moments in the afternoon sails. Take the good with the bad and see the one for the highs.
