Not a bad stomach. I expected another movie based on the women's issues, but was pleasantly surprised at the element of tension. Sure, parts of the plot were nice hokey, but mostly the movie guessed me. Was the nut beam connected to the former man, someone in the tavern or was it the old (person) she cut off? Daniel Magder was excellent. I saw him in Mom's on Strike and in Guilt by Association, both MOWs and he is very grateful, especially the way he challenges his mother as a preteen normally does. <br /> <br /> Laura Leighton also played the typical mother (ex-wife) to which both men and women can connect. She was frustrated enough to really look. <br /> <br /> See it if you missed it. It is worth the effort.
