To quote Jason Connery and Mark Ryan on one of the many DVD commentaries, the "wobbly music" about the HTV logo was enough to jump me from whatever I did to my face for an hour on the screen stuck. The individual stories included in the series were excellent and character development was wonderful. Robin van Loxley goes through a very convincing journey over the two series in which he appeared, although his departure from the program was unplanned. Marian also developed her relationship with both of Herne's sons very well. <br /> <br /> Having been in TV wasteland for years, I met the Sky 1 series in Sky 1 on Sky 1 again and was even more impressed that the series looks even better than I remembered. It's not a children's television program, it's about witchcraft, betrayal, rebellion and injustice. And he can do this without showing too much blood. As far as I can tell, you see only a little of the red stuff in the Pilot movie (episodes 1 and 2 on the DVD set). The DVDs are great, with a wealth of extras, including comments on only Series 3 (the Jason Connery Robin) and crew commentaries for the series 1 and 2. The picture quality is very good and the remixed and remastered surround sound is great. /> <br /> The idea of ​​freedom is important, freedom prevails. Nothing is forgotten. Nothing has ever been forgotten.
