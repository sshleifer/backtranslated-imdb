The Columbia Pictures Short Subject unit never had any fraud about producing any "Art" movies. They just wanted to give the movie exhibitors a little more for their money when discussing a Columbia Picture in their theaters. This will double for the 3 Stooges movies. <br /> <br /> PEOPLE IN BLACK (1934) came as close as any of their Comedy Shorts, as it received an Oscar nomination for Best Short Box, Comedy. Although it did not win, it could. It was good enough and even those who don't call themselves Stooge files still seem to get victory by the complaints of "Dr Howard, Dr Fine, Dr. Howard! This was the second. entry into the long series of Comedy Shorts, made by Stooges for Producer Jules White, head of Columbia's Short Subjects Department, only WOMAN HATERS described in his credits as a "Musical Novelty" preceded Harry Cohen's Swedish Swedish Poverty Row. <br /> <br /> The film starts at the office of Dr. Graves, the head of the hospital, and receives new interns and in addressing the group, he says three of them are healthy of Medical Needs as they have been there for so long.

(It all plays well, honestly!) The sets used were very authentic and undoubtedly borrowed from Columbia features made about the same time. There are many wheelchairs, surgical cats, stetascopes, sural scalpels, etc., as proven to maintain the illusion of a hospital. <br /> <br /> A true strength of PEOPLE IN BLACK is the high number of usually unnamed players, who all recognize us by face. Along with them, the film features a large number of veteran comedy actors, who always turn in good performances, often stealing the scene. The people with names like Billy Gilbert, Hank Mann and Bud Jamison shine even small parts. <br /> <br /> And the latter we have the Maestro, Conductor Director Raymond McCarey, a little brother of Leo McCarey who has his ability to get this little movie in the look. He kept it up well and sometimes acted as a traffic sensor, who, with all the actors, extras and behind the scenes, crew and out of each other's way. And it's not the Giant 3 Man Tandem Bicycle, The Swing Backed Horse and Miniature Race Cars, not to mention the 'Giant, Green Canaries!'
