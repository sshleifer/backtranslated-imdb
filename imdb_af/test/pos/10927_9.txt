I just watched this short on PlanetOut Movies. <br /> <br /> Starcrossed was a very sweet, sad, little movie about two brothers in love. There are some great, subtle acting from both the male lead. Often, with this topic in the controversy and shock value of the plot, films with this subject seem to forget that there is a real story. Happy author director James Burkhammer does not, and instead the story plays with honesty. The order of the two boys who first fall in love is very sweet.
