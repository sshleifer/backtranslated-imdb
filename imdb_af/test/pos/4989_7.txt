Too much added with too much taken away from a great western written by McMurtry about the Texas Rangers vs the Indian. This script just removes this mini-series with many hot fuzzy relationships that are in fact secondary to the main story. It ends with a totally incredible and detached ending not written in the book. It questions you how we should be transported to Lonesome Dove. <br /> <br /> The series of main characters was in fact very well thrown, the filming stations were excellent, but this mini-series had to stay true, which is a good book.
