Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are brilliant as Sir and his Dresser. Of course, the play is brilliant to start with and can't compare to the immediacy and collegiality of theater, and I think you're listening better in the theater; but on the screen we become more intimate, we are "up close" more than we are in the theater, we see subtle changes in expression, we see and listen better. Both the play and the movie are wonderful: moving, intelligent, illuminating - from the background story of the company, the historical context, the two main characters and the parallel characters in "Lear" itself. If you can't see it in a theater (I don't think it's much produced today), then do yourself a favor and get the video.
