I just can't understand why people are surprised. This movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were wasted at Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does wonderful. <br /> <br /> The Monkeys are good actors. They would not be hired if they were not good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at pure psychotic comedy. Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people who believe he was so stupid in real life. Don't tell me they can't act because they definitely can. <br /> <br /> They can also write. Sure, Jack & Bob get the only credits, but in reality they have a huge helping hand in the writing from the Monkeys, who were also in those smoking facilities. <br /> <br /> (It is quite impossible to spoil this movie) Head is very symbolic. Among the more memorable elements is the black box, which was actually based on 2 things: the Monkee image to which the boys had to be bound, and the true black box on the screen gems, where the bond between the tasks was held. There is so much more symbolism in the movie that I just let you see and find out. <br /> <br /> The music is great. "Circle Sky" is one of Papa Nez's best songs ever, and "Porpoise Song" and "As We Go Along" will captivate you. If you're better off, it can be "Ditty Diego," "Can You Dig It?" And "Long Title" be satisfactory, good songs they are. And then there is 'Daddy's Song', without a doubt a tribute to Davy's Broadway days, and the editing / color scheme for that order is wonderful. (At least for '68.) <br /> <br /> For those who aren't going to watch a 'PG' movie, you miss out. Especially since Head was originally classified in 1968 R. The score was lowered about twenty years later! <br /> <br /> Where was I? Oh yes: "We spoke of beliefs. Faith and conditioning ...."
