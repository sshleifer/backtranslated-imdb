This Bravo special is one of the most pure entertaining things I've ever seen on TV. Unlike my first and the Gimme Gimmes (the world's leading Punk Supergroup / Cover-Band), the Dan Band really needs to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> On paper, The Dan Band is just a one-joke act-guy singing girly songs and adding gratuitous profanity to the lyrics. If you listen to their "Dan Band Live" CD, this is all you will get, and it will be soon. (I just bought it because it had some songs that weren't on the TV broadcast.) But what Dan Finnerty made a Hollywood cult hero is his wonderful stage presence. This man is to his audience for every second, he is on stage. And the backup singers are also a big part of the visual punch line. Regarding the real band, they mostly stay out of sight, but it's definitely very energetic and enthusiastic about your typical lounge. Hopefully a DVD version will be released soon. There was almost certainly some songs cut and although the heavy censorship adds a little unintentional humor, it also removes the INTENSIONAL humor. <br /> <br /> If there's any sense in the world, Vegas casino owners will soon be fighting over who Dan can build his own showroom faster. <br /> <br /> "member ---- my name ... FAME!"
