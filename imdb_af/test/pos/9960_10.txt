A few thoughts before I get to the heart of the movie: 1) I have never seen so many naked breasts in a movie; it has seen so many non-sexual scenes; it was strange; 2) Joseph Fiennes, where were you? You loved us in * Elizabeth * and * Shakespeare in Love *, and then you went for a while. Mainstream American wants more! Okay, I'm a college English professor, I've read this play many times, and that's probably the best movie version I've ever seen. Although individual aspects of other productions can stand out, it is the overall package that is well-crafted. Pacino is not Olivier, but he doesn't have to be, so come on! The movie's cinematography is beautiful and not just because of the bare breasts. Venice is unbelievably portrayed, and you get a sense of being really there. Portia's residential island is incredibly beautiful and the lighting is always the right way for the proper mood of the scenes. Anti-Semitism in this movie / play is hard to watch, especially at the end. Pacino's kneeling and clinging to his religious artefact is perhaps the most powerful moment of his movie The Godfather Part III (when Michael's daughter is shot on the opera stairs). Is the play anti-Semitic? Sure. Is * Othello * racist? Sure. Take it for what it is: a comment on the Elizabethan era, not a comment on today. <br /> <br /> Fiennes is underutilized in the movie, but still a pleasure to watch. The women in the movie are good; No one really stood out here, but they mix nicely with the scenery. Jeremy Irons and Pacino are excellent in the two most beautiful roles, opponents to the end. I've always felt that the ears were underlying (I still get cold fever when I hear his voice from * The Lion King *), and Pacino is Pacino.
