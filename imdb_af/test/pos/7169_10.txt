OKNO V PARIZH also shows the west in an unfavorable light, a strange and fearless criticism of Russian society and culture during the transition from communism. A group of Russians living in St. Petersburg (namely, Peter the Great's "window in the west") finds a magic portal that immediately transports them to Paris. Mamin's film is really hilarious, and just "odd" enough, the twisted film look keeps on its toes. The songs, the dream sequence and the fun disgusting edge of both cultures blend to create a memorable and meaningful film. Anyone trying to understand the shift in Russian cultural sentiments since the fall of the USSR must begin here.
