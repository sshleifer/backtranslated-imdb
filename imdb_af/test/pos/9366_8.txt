Edward Dmytryk's "Crossfire" is a rare film coming from the Hollywood of the 1940s. It was a groundbreaking territory for Mr. Myth and the studio because of what the director and his adapter, John Paxton, decided to do with the novel in which the film is based. <br /> <br /> If you don't watch the movie, please stop reading. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks's novel about the murder of a gay soldier. In the film, the subject turned to prejudice against Jews, a theme that was taboo at the time in the American cinema. It is up to Mr. My credit is to have the courage to get involved in this film project. <br /> <br /> The film is an excellent movie production because the director suggests it. Of course, influenced by the film noir style, we are taken to the Washington of the post war. The opening scene of the brutal murder of Samuels shows that such unusual cruelty is being given to a decent man, whom we have not yet known or why was murdered, but which did not deserve such a horrible way. <Br /> <br /> The basis of the murder is prejudice, pure and simple. We realize how in the minds of an ignorant man, the mere fact that he is successful and different, plays in the mind of the killer. Samuels stand as the sacrificial lamb, so the gay soldier is the victim of the novel. The parallels are well drawn. <br /> <br /> This movie makes compelling viewing because of the brilliant star turn of Robert Ryan, as well as Montgomery. Mr. Ryan was an actor who always played interesting roles, but never as good as in "Crossfire". There is also a great appearance by Gloria Grahame, like Ginny, the prostitute with her heart in the right place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the role play as an ensemble. Robert Young, as the police detective in charge of the investigation, is a decent man who has prejudice firsthand in his own family and speaks hard to it. Robert Mitchum plays a cool Sgt. Keeley, who is deeply affected by the crime when one of his men is accused of committing it. Sam Levene is excellent in his small role in Samuels. <br /> <br /> It's a movie to watch because it's probably the first to speak out loud against ignorance.
