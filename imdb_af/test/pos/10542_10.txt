This movie is the best horror movie I've ever seen. The play is terrible and the plot leaves much to be desired, but the puppet gave me nightmares for weeks. Seriously, if you have small children, don't let them see it. Of course, I'm a bit biased because of an irrational fear of dolls and midgets. A body also came double through the guy who does my mini-robe. and some free nudity, a must in low budget horror movie. all other horror movies will be judged forever in my book.
