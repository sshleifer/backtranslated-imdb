I was one of the lucky people to see this movie in New York. This is a compelling story of how a group of extremely close friends dealt with the September 11 tragedy. This film made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit can endure through love and friendship and create wonderful things from one of our darkest days. The filmmakers really caught the emotions of the individuals involved. It was great to see the same story being told by so many different people. I walked out of the theater that day to call all my friends just to say hello. I would recommend that everyone see this documentary. I will rate this movie with an A ++++++++++. See it if you get a chance.
