Insanely well crafted mini series. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it most twice when shown on the American Playhouse on PBS. Was heavily promoted at the time. I believe it was one of the very early mini-shows shown on PBS outside the Masterpiece Theater series. <br /> <br /> The full length production was shown. I believe only once during his first broadcast. Was 6-8 hours total. This length was edited slightly up to 6 hours. Cut some interesting but slow scenes. <br /> <br /> I hope many people who keep their current rights can repeat a full, unedited DVD version. It's not worth creating a VHS version at this stage. <br /> <br /> Will fit well into the mini-series or dramatic history genre.
