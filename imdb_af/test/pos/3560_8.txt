"Any Gun Can Play" (1967), directed by Enzo G. Castellari, is a very good pastiche of Spaghetti Westerns, especially Leone. The first half is good, which, apart from the opening a few more bucks, "" with Monco, Colonel Douglas Mortimer and El Indio look-alike in a ghost town and then quickly killed by a Bounty Hunter. called "The Stranger", is quite serious, with huge rifles (especially the train-deprived scene), quick and furious action and fine performances by Gilbert Roland, George Hilton and (well-managed since he is bad). Edd Byrnes. But then, when the movie reaches the halfway point, there is a johist fist fight between Hilton and Byrnes. It's not very funny and is the worst part of the movie, but it throws everything you've previously seen in a new light. You realize that the whole thing is actually a spoof of Spaghetti West conventions. In the background, the first half is done so well that you completely miss this ghost undercurrent. What follows is a more obvious parody, with even a few acrobatic Brynes jumps that precede the 70s of Circus Westerns. The end, a complete reception of the "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" climax, was done very well, as in other hands it could be very stupid. So, a fun Spaghetti Western, it doesn't take too much. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Spaghetti Westerns.
