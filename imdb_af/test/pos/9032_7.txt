A very powerful drama of Faulkner's small town south of an innocent black man's murder of local ne'er does. Striking cinematography and good narration (via flashback) take us through the awkward relationship between the suspect and his lawyer's son. A strong powerful story predicting the Sidney Poitier films of racial prejudice. Porter Hall has a big role as the murdered man's father. Trivia: It's actually filmed in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Miss. With many of the residents being used as extras.
