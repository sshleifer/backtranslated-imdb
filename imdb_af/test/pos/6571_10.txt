Every frame in the movie is a lesson for new directors or existing directors to know how a movie should be taken. Hats off to Sekhar. He is underestimated in the Indian film industry. The director has all the features to take this movie into the series, Satyajir, Adoor. Each character is depicted effectively in the film. Although it is a simple story, it is taken as one of the best in India. I don't have enough adjectives to praise the movie. Just like the way life goes into the contemporary atmosphere, the movie was taken. Although the songs in Indian movies are considered a weak area, songs in this movie have given extra energy to the potential of the movie.
