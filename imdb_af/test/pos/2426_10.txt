First of all, let me say this movie is not for everyone. It has a very strange subject. A spinner living alone living a boring life discovers a young man in a park right across the street from her townhouse. She sees him sitting in the rain and invites him to dry and warm up. The man does not speak and the woman assumes he is deaf mute. Yet she is fascinated with him and sexually interested in him. He finds her strange and silent, although we later find out that he is not dumb at all and that he tells his sister everything that goes on between him and the woman. I will not give away the rest of the plot. If you can find this movie watch it. You can't take your eyes out of it. What makes it so interesting? Well, it's totally unique. I have never seen anything like this and watching these two together is very uncomfortable. Especially when you find out what this common, boring, obsessive spider is capable of. You won't forget it soon.
