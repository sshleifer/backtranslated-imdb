I loved this movie. Not as big as "50 First Dates", but it's definitely a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with a group of girls. Yes, the plot was "cute" and maybe even incredible, but what's so bad about a good movie. Grabbed as Josie and her romance with the teacher is so sweet and brother baseball wannabee adds to the movie's good feeling. With all the rubbish out there, what's so bad about a good movie that the whole family can enjoy? Without embarrassment while watching your children! Drew is an awesome actress who looks mostly uncomfortable. This is definitely one of her best roles!
