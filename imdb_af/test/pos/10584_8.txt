I bought this movie just to see Bam, because I really loved him, but after seeing it, I don't like him much. I mean, his performance was good and everything I think, but when it showed the totally unnecessary skate scenes, I just told myself, "Alright, we know you're a professional skateboarder. Now we can come back to Ryan Dunn? ' Dunn, Rake and Brandon really made the film in my perspective. <br /> <br /> I noticed that Jenn Rivell (of course) and Missy Rothstein were both in Haggard, but who was Bam then? Anyways, I actually enjoyed Haggard and I think it's really like no other movie I've ever seen. It's kind of in its own category.
