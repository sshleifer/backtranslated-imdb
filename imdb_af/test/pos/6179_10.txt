I absolutely loved this movie. Great, realistic search for one thing and touch, true story as well. The calm, understated way of the main character, Franta, makes him very enjoyable. The human relationships in the story were as typical and possibly of what you could expect in wartime. The relationship between Franta and Carel shows the loyalty period that comrades can have for each other and is often described in veterans' books and interviews. The captions do not reflect the story at all and actually serve to underline the problems the Czech pilots had in the RAF. The post-war story is a great reminder that for many people the suffering of World War II did not end in 1945, especially in Russian-occupied countries. The cinematography was also very good. Wish I could have seen it on the big screen.
