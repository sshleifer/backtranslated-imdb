This movie was even better than 'Wait for Guffman'. The great power of these two films lies in the brilliant character acting by Guest and Levy's small second-second urban troop. If anyone finds this movie boring or useless, God helps them, they just haven't found it. It's a mockumentary, something that Gast and Levy have a genius. At the end of the film where Guest's southern domestic lover told us to relax after the show, he went to Israel to work on a "caboose" or when he told us that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyph <br /> <br /> of an ancient Egyptian who had a small Egyptian Egyptian in his hand, I realized it was moments like this that made life worth living. Thank you, Lord God and Lord, Lord, and God bless you.
