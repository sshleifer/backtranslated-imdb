Victor Sjöström's Körkarlen picks the viewer into the lower depths of life for much of his current time, with grim scenes of alcoholic decline, domestic violence and suicide hopes, but the most memorable parts involve the mythological image of Death itself. Here, death was embodied as a ghostly horse cart, driven by a miserable sinner who was the previous person on the previous New Year's Eve. For one year, the misery of the new room has to be collected, and after twelve months of this terrible servitude, the driver's own soul is eventually released when the last person dies on December 31, the new manager. <br /> <br /> The scenes in this transport (the film is known as "The Phantom Carriage" or "The Phantom Chariot" in English-speaking countries) is ominous and fascinating using double exposure cinematography that was quite sophisticated for his time and still effective when seen today. Most noticeable, the cars travel to the sea floor to collect the soul of a drowning person. As fascinating as these scenes, however, most of the film is concerned with the downward spiral of David Holm, which the director himself plays in an underestimated depiction of a man who has given the opportunity to live a decent life . In flashbacks, Holm sees a pleasant day on the beach with his wife, children and brother, and he seems to be a perfect ordinary man. Suddenly, without segregation or explanation, we see Holm as an alcoholic wreck, in trouble with the law and alienated from his family. Usually, this jump may seem like a story-telling shortage from the front to the top, but in this case the filmmakers trust us to fill in the familiar, bad details on our own. It is suggested that Holm be seduced by his beloved friend Georges, the drinking company, who is the story of the Phantom Carriage, but whatever the cause of his demise Holm seems to be, is a lost cause, a drunk drinking what take perverse. pleasure to cause pain on his family and to reform. <br /> <br /> While David Holm is our central figure, the true catalyst of the story is a young Savior Army nurse who enjoys sympathetic interest in his cause and believes in him despite his hateful behavior. When the nurse himself dies - indirectly because of her ministries on behalf of Holm - his claim to see him, and thus incessantly implements a chain of events that will lead to his recovery. <br /> <br /> Often, this film looks like Dickens Scrooge's story in the use of haunting visitors who inspire a deeply flawed man to make stock of his life, suffer from his misconduct and reform. I am also reminded of Sjöström's 1917 drama, Terje Vigen, in which a man comes out of jail to empty his home and leave his family. The director also reiterates a standard theme of Scandinavian folklore, previously found in his "Berg-Ejvind and hans wife" (aa "The Outlaw and His Wife," 1918), that no one can overtake his fate. This time, however, it can be argued that David Holm actually manages to evade his seemingly inevitable fate because he has given an unexpected second chance to compensation. <br /> <br /> Viewers who expect a dive into the supernatural will be the value of the sequels that the Phantom Carriage contains, but cannot be prepared for the film's painful investigation into a troubled man alcoholic demise. But those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate Körkarlen as a whole. It stands with the best serious cinema of its era and surely one of Sjöström's most completed works.
