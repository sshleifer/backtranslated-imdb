I didn't know anything about this movie until I watched it. My brother actually suggested I look. Usually, his suggestions aren't much cops, but I held on to something to watch so I looked at it. <br /> <br /> To cut a long story short, I give it 10/10. <Br /> <br /> The movie centers around two people, meeting while staying in the same place. The one is initially very dependent on the institution around him, the other is a rebel. One does what he wants, the other he tells. <br /> <br /> From the first moments of the film, we quickly see the friendship between the two buildings and see how they rub a little on each other. It's a remarkable piece of work that tells a good story without turning, turning people out of baths, or superheros that save the day. <br /> <br /> There is a fair amount of grain and reality. There can't just be everything right - not all waves can ever be stretched - and this movie shows lots. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and are not impressed ..... I suggest you look no further.
