Maybe this film is meant to be nothing but funny. Maybe it's meant to excite teenage boys about all the nudity in it. But what I got from it was actually something many people believe. And this is, "Nice guys finish last". <br /> <br /> There is a line in Angel Heart of Lisa Bonet's character who says, "It takes a bad ass to beat a girl's heart faster." True. Most probably. Women always say they want the flowers and candy and politeness. But (at least at an early age) they end up with the beautiful, clever, irreverent, untamed man. The one they know cannot meet their beliefs. And this is part of the attraction. After all, what is exciting about a man who is already the way you want him to be? I believe it can have happened to Boaz Davidson. And what he has to say in this movie that is disguised with sex and nudity and parties and everything teenagers can have is that you will cut your heart. This happens to everyone and it will happen to you. And this is a strong final statement in the movie. But after all this, the movie is fun. It's funny and it shows the antics of high school students pretty well. <br /> <br /> It is a rare movie that is sleazy enough to please the teenagers, but it is also intelligent and attractive enough to show what it is; Like to get your heart broken. No high school movie ever did it better. As I said, I think the authors had to experience a situation like this first hand. Maybe we all have. <br /> <br /> This is an old movie, but if you ever find yourself in your local video store, pick it up, you might be surprised. It's a hell much better than never kissed.
