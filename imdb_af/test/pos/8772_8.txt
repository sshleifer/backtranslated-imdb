Bob Cummings is excellent in this, as this technically brilliant Hitchcock movie doesn't really get the fame of some of his other films, but even today it is still very visible. Priscilla Lane proves in this one that she can maintain herself with other blonde's who later worked with Hitchcock. She just made a handful of movies here, which almost made her forget about it today. <br /> <br /> There are sequences in this that will remind the viewer of set-ups in later movies by the director. The acting is so well done and the story is so well done that this film is still very entertaining today. Every person in the role player works well. There are several great backgrounds in the black-and-white film. <br /> <br /> It was the first film by Universal for Hitchcock. Long time between the movies he did at Universal plus the television series, Hitchcock would make so much box for the studios as anyone who worked there. This fact is lost in film history. <br /> <br /> Norman Lloyd is well-cast as the real bad man in this movie. The story really moves well, including Hitchcock's only filmed western drive. This film is very good with very good work by all who do it.
