Let's get the error right from the top - the movie should have been much longer. Ray Charles was a brilliant, captivating man leading a complex, challenging life. There was simply no way to fit it all - or even touch it all - into a standard length movie. As a result, the makers of this film made an admirable (and certainly rather painful) work to put together a film that could not tell the whole story, yet created a representative sample of the man and his music. Ray Charles's strengths were evident in the film and his weaknesses were neither strengthened nor sugar covered. After another hour, we could have preached his life after his life, but I suspect it would have tended to change the film into a tribute. It would also be possible for the solution of several things to hang out, balance I think was better as offered. <br /> <br /> Now for the big question: what are the criteria for an Oscar? The woman and I have seen countless movies in our years, but we immediately agreed that we had never seen a show like Jamie Foxx's. The line between actor and character was not blurred - but it completely disappeared. We heard a lot of hype before the movie was seen, but it was rude. Foxx was Ray Charles. You haven't watched the movie with the feeling that you're watching Foxx doing an excellent job of portraying Ray Charles. You watched it somehow believe you understand you were Charles Charles yourself. I don't know how to put it differently. We were completely blown away. I will admit that we haven't seen all the other performances for an Oscar this year, but it doesn't matter. Foxx took it to a whole utility level, of which we have never testified and doubt that we can ever see it again. I can't think of any other movie I've ever seen in which one plays such a part so well and convincingly becomes the person portrayed. We greet you, Mr. Foxx. We understand that awarding an Oscar with much more than the show, but whether you win or not, we want you to know that you have done something in class, absolutely in itself and You must take great pride in your unmatched performance. <br /> <br /> PS The music was of course wonderful. I told the woman that if there was one moment in the history of music I wish I could have been, it would be the genesis (in Kansas City wasn't it?) What did I say? The movie did a wonderful job with it - just wish I could have been there!
