I rank OPERA as one of the better Argento movies. Plots and contradictions? Certainly, but I don't think they seem to be this movie as much as many other reviewers think. Many elements that are in many of Argento's films are similar to the wall, but it is part of the drawings of his films. Short story: psycho steals the opera's new leader lady. The typical Argento twist and turn followed, which led to a decent payout of a climax. Not Argento's best, but I'm still pulling this one out from time to time. Definitely a look if you like his other things - don't do this one with the uncomfortable PHANTOM OR THE OPERA remake that Argento did, the one is really awful ... 8/10
