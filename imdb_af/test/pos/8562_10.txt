I made this movie with my family over a long Thanksgiving holiday weekend. I'm grateful that someone insisted that we see it, though I didn't pay much attention to the end of the movie, when a head shift was promised, but it didn't. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I watched this movie a few years later, and its vitality, absurdity, sparkle, and just love. I think the movie has a female tone. Women aren't exploited, though I'm sure someone might think the movie is pure exploitation. I think the movie is playing with tropics of the period. <br /> <br /> I think someone should try it again. And escape some of the implications in the original.
