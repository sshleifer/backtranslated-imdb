If someone cut me in Ray for about 15 minutes and asked what I thought of Jamie Foxx in the title role, it would be time for an empty star. After all, what is this (fictional) person talking about? It wasn't Jamie Foxx on the big screen. It was Ray Charles. This is one of the best performances by anyone in the past year. Like the soundtrack, Jamie as Ray is exuberantly brilliant. <br /> <br /> The blind Genius of Soul (who is a revolutionary step in mixing gospel with R&B) died during production. The movie about his troubled life is good, not good. Taylor Hackford's direction and James L. White's writing follow the well-behaved biopic outline. Super talented youngster fights, reaches greatness while he is self-destructive, and takes him out of the gutter for a happy ending. The film shows Charles's mistakes (heroin abuse, chronic female, persistent bastard fathers), even when it closes you with his beautiful music. <br /> <br /> Kerry Washington and Regina King play the lead women in Ray's life, one his long-suffering wife and the other his yearly mistress. Both actresses use Foxx battle. However, taking him to another level is his deep understanding and unpleasant personalization of the great musician. The whole movie is effective, especially Sharon Warren as his head mom and Curtis Armstrong as a music performance. Hackford's stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies and - better still --- more leading roles. <br /> <br /> I wasn't a Ray Charles aficionado in front of Ray. Apparently, the movie has left a lot (just like all biopic articles), but this photo functions as an old-fashioned crowd pleaser and a dark inquiry from a brilliant / restless man. For those who think Foxx is not actually singing (as if in some way diminishing), take a walk. No mere actor can, in any case, like Mr. Charles didn't sing. You can't have everything. As for the talented star in this photo, it's about as close to "everything" as we will probably see for a while.
