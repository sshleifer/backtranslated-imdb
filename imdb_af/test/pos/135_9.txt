The cinematography is the brilliant feature of the film. Park knows its good when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera. Each shot is filled with vibrant colors that jump off the screen. Every frame of the movie looks like it's a story on its own. I hope there is a Blu-ray release of this movie because it will look fantastic. It is rather interesting to see what elements of the vampire phytology park were used for his vision. Singing hyeon must drink blood to survive and remain flawless, has incredible power and is vulnerable to sunlight. However, he does not have a drop and also has a reflection in the mirror. <br /> <br /> Although I have never seen the movie, I couldn't help but feel it was Chan-wook Park's version of Twilight. The whole middle part of the film is dedicated to Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo's love for each other. It really feels like the adult version of Twilight. There is a lot of blood, nudity, sex, and even some obsessions that are well thrown in. Maybe it's the Chan-Wook Park fanboy in me, but I honestly feel I can guarantee it's the better movie of the two. The psychological aspect I like about Park's previous films is also in Dors. This is an important factor for me as any movie that makes me think or is unusual, in any way, becomes a favorite favorite. The soundtracks to Park's movies always look like it's a glove. Thirst is no exception. While the soundtrack is a bit more subtle, it fits the overall atmosphere of the movie quite effortlessly. <br /> <br /> The middle part of the movie seems to be dragging more than anything else in the movie. It's scarce, as the scenes were critical to the movie's storyline at that time and it's hard to imagine Dors is the same movie as any of those scenes cut. Yet it is my one nitpick of the movie. <br /> <br /> Chan-wook Park bites in the vampire mythology with Thirst and turns its own dark, psychologist over it. Park's movies always look as if they are a particular formula or most of the following: good writing, beautiful cinematography, solid throw, a kind of psychologist twisting your head and a memorable end. Threshing on all fronts and hopefully deserve more of the attention it deserves during its theater program on DVD (and eventually Blu-ray, hopefully).
