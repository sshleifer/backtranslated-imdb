Where do I start? Walt Disney's happiest movie "Lady and the Tramp" is one of, if not, my favorite in the Disney Animation Theater Gun. However, the successor is ... to enjoy the least, pleasant. I enjoyed myself throughout the movie. It was (flame shield!) Adorable! The Broadway style of the songs and the movie worked, and I mumbled the songs for the rest of the night. If you asked me, I can sing all the songs. <br /> <br /> But where the movie was really good for me, it was very bad in many other places. The animation was sometimes frightening. Every time there was a close-up of someone's face, I didn't know ... it was just scary for me. Also, where was the hell lady? She gets two lines of dialogue and only doggy hugs Scamp at the end. She gets 0% interaction with the plot and her only son! <br /> <br /> But all, I really enjoyed it. Compared to the original, does it stick? No. The songs are not so good, but the plot was much less involved. Lady has virtually nothing to do with it, and it's not as cute as the first. But when you open your mind, you will have fun, and maybe "gasp!" Like it?
