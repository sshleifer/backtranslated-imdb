I have to be a little skeptical when I entered the kiosk to watch OSS117: French comedies are so confident these days that only the stupid people in the national box are high. But I was surprised that although the humor did not always reach the level of the Monthy Pythons, the many references to the French's vision of the world in the 1950s, which represents OSS117, are Hilarious and the director has the filmmaking of that time an amazing faithfulness. To put it briefly, a bit of a good surprise, not to mention the excellent performances of various secondary actors. And at least once, Jean Dujardin's style (which can come on many people's nerves) perfectly matches the character he plays.
