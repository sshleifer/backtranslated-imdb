It will be by far the biggest series I have ever seen. I watched every Sunday night and bought the box as soon as it was available. It's a timeless play written by a fantastic Australian who can handle people of all ages, whether it's Australian or not, but for those of us who are Australian, it really brings about the typical Australian icon. A must see 10/10
