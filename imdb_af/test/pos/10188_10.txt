I'm not a Disney fan at all, but I'm in Orlando for a friend's wedding. So my traveling companion and I went to Disney a few days ago. I didn't see a good 3-D effect, though. So I usually try to stay away from these offers. The 3-D effect in this was so good. I'm an adult man of 38, and even I wanted to try to reach out and touch. It's so good! Word of advice. At the end, look at the back of the theater on the wall. Put it that way ... the first time I saw it, the effect didn't work. So I told my friend ... "It would be nice if ...." My friend said, "That's exactly what happens. It doesn't work for some reason." It's a great show. You will NOT be disappointed !!!
