A while back, I bought the Chinese box Vuiste van de Noordster who came with all the Fists of the North Star, Fist of the North Star 2, the New Fist of the North Star and the Fist of the Northster movie. While there is a US version and some European versions, they end up halfway through the Fist of the North Star which goes as far as the movie goes. <br /> <br /> The series is about the successor of an ancient martial art called Hokuto Shin Ken (Fist of the North Star) called Kenshiro, or Ken for Short. There is only one successor each generation. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where martial arts is the strongest weapon. The two most powerful art is Hokuto Shin Ken and Nanto Divine Ken, as my version calls it. Nanto is very different in style, but they are all the same, as they allow a person to cut someone down. There are six Nanto masters and each has their own star. Hokuto is an art that allows someone to damage / kill or heal someone by hitting a point on their body. Each art has its own constellation. Hokuto - Big Dipper, Nanto - Gemini. Kenshiro is going to save the world from the evil that consists of going to his two brothers and three of the Nanto masters and their armies. Every army captain has their own way of fighting that makes every episode different and the number of soldiers bloody. Kenshiro is also looking for his girlfriend, Yuria, who was stolen by the Nanto master Shin. Along the way, Kenshiro joins his brother Toki after saving him from his brother Rao, who calls himself Kenou or Boxing King. He is also joined by two Nanto Masters Rei, who is looking for his sister who was taken by Ken's brother Jagi and Shu. Both and Toki die along the way. Other characters joining Ken are two children, Rin and Batto, who don't do much. It's about as much as I can tell story because it's so long and full of detail. The series is also divided into four parts. <br /> <br /> What makes this show good is the battle. Ken usually goes against a group of people who think they are tough and then killed at one time. What is funny and bad, but makes for quick fighting. Another big part is comedy / weakness. Ken is hitting someone and they don't think about it. Ken says they're already dead. Then they die. Other parts are when he will hit them and tell them they have a few seconds to live. Then a counter will appear. Or, if he tells them, it's not worth knowing his name. Then there is when he does a quick kick or punch and then wa da da da da da. Eventually you might find it with him. One big part was when a bad guy thought he knew Hokuto. He went to Ken and beat him. Ken said there was death in a few seconds. The bad man who was counted then died. It's not limited to Ken, everyone kills just as fast. There has never been such a character as Ken and they will probably never want to. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some issues. One is the recurring nature. Some flashbacks, mainly the one taken with Yuria, are played too much, and there are also too many repetition appointments especially in part four of the series. In fact, the last episode is an overview of the whole thing. Another problem is the end. The last battle with Rao wasn't that impressive. Ken and Rao fought when talked, etc., until Rao came to some sense and killed himself instead of Ken who killed him. But it's better than the American and European versions that just cut halfway. <br /> <br /> Who would I recommend it? This is for older teenagers and adults who like action. Because the styles cause people to explode or cut into pieces, the violence is very graphic and there are a lot of them, but they do not show much blood, as they usually kill, just a silhouette that looks just like the person . less colorful. This is probably done to avoid censorship. If you don't like action, rent the US version. However, if you like action, I say the entry because you can see the whole series, but they don't have the best English translation, as it is subtitled by the Chinese. Note: My input came with everything I said at the beginning. Some imported versions do not, but you still need to get an input to see all the series and Fists of the North Star 2. If you don't think you can handle The captions for any reason then get the US version. Another note: In the version, I have no captions on the latest disk for New Fist of the North Star; Although New Fist of the North Star is not very good to start with. <br /> <br /> I give the show an 8/10 for its high amount of action, good story and the madness of Kenshiro. <br /> **** UPDATE **** <br /> <br /> Toei Animation released an English subtitle version. You can download the episodes as well as Hokuto no Ken 2 from IGN's Direct2Drive or download it for free on FUNimation's website.
