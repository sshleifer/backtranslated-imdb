Big Fat Liar is the best movie ever! It's funny and cool. Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz) proves he's not lying and going to Los Angeles to get his paper back from Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Along with friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes), his life was wasted because Marty didn't call Jason's father and said he wrote the paper! Yet it seems good and it is a good movie to watch!
