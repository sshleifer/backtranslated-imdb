Note: It should probably only be read after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Finding a documentary or movie that focuses on the loser is very rare. Deep Water does just that, making it one of the most thought-producing movies in a very long time. It does not give us a hero to look at, but rather an anti-hero that forces us to look at ourselves. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a group of men trying to navigate the world. , one-handed, and without stopping. Only one makes it, some die, one decides not to return, each on a psychological journey that is intriguing enough to earn whole movies for themselves. Still, the most interesting is Donald Crowhurst, or rather the way he is portrayed by the filmmakers and our response to him as viewers. <br /> <br /> For any standard, this man should be considered a despicable character, but why was he portrayed so heroically? Why are we so sympathetic to him? From the beginning he made all the wrong choices. He financially threatened his family to get the boat, he was more dangerous to get more publicity. He ignored all the warnings, despite his lack of experience, he preferred to lie instead of admitting defeat. These choices have snowball to the inevitable and final one: suicide. Everything for what? A place in history? A sense of fulfillment? Maybe. What is important to consider is whether this men's situation was inevitable. Every individual must ask himself whether his natural human drive for fame and fulfillment will bring him such recklessness, and I believe that this is your own response to Crowhurst's story that will at least provide some answers to that question.
