This second pair of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner is great as the first. Predictably maybe, but I don't mind and still laugh so much when I see it. The Wile E./Road runner shorts always had the most special place in my heart. So I know that the second slide of the Golden Collection will not only contain 11 of them, BUT it will be chronological (2 to 12, the first episode was on Volume 1), made me a foggy eye. I love these things. This animated short can be seen on Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2. It also contains an optional comment from Micheal Barrier. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A +
