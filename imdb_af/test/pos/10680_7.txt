When I watched this movie broadcast on late-night television, I initially decided to give it a miss. I'm glad I started looking. Yes, the special effects are the same as Gerry Andersen's puppet show. Some of the actors / actresses are of his other productions. He later of course used the same composer, as the cheesy soundtrack only came from one of his productions, and the plot is as slow as a night's weekend. Get everything and you have a movie that shows intriguing possibilities. Is there a planet on the other side of the sun? Is this a duplicate earth? Is everything reversed and if so, do they speak English in reverse? I love this dated SF if it's just for Gerry's wonderful model cars, planes, buildings and space ships. Some of them were not so far-fetched because they looked right. And did you see the logo of the European Space Center? Much reminiscent of the Euro logo today. Violating faith and spending a few hours watching it, you'll be glad you did.
