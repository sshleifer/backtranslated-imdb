Algernon4's comment that Ms Paget's "ultra-vibrant dance in (this movie) is the most erotic in the history of movies" is definitely one yolk of exaggeration. It's not even Debra Paget's most erotic dance. Her nearby magic in Fritz Lang's "The Indian Tomb" definitely makes this number tame. Like being the most erotic in the history of dance. Good! Where do I start? Salma Hayek's performance as Santanico Pandemonium in "From Dusk to Dawn" (1996); Jamie Lee Curtis in "True Lies" (1994); Jessica Alba in "Sin City" (2005); Rose McGowan in "Terror Planet" (2007); Sheila Kelley in "Dancing at the Blue Iguana" (2000), blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. I like the sequence and included it in my "Cheesecake Dance" series on Youtube. I just think a claim like "most erotic in the history of the movie" really goes on a very fragile limb.
