Some people think it was a little bad TV show, with cheese effects. (since it was filmed between 1977-1979), but really, look back at those years and think, "We didn't have computers." So if you think about it, it's a pretty good TV show. <br /> <br /> I always thought bad ratings killed the show, but no. the network did. they canceled their theme as the "superhero network" and dropped a short-lived spider-man series. If that were the case, it would probably have been good in the 80's, and if it was really happy (and I mean really happy), the early 90's. <br /> <br /> And no one wanted to choose this series. up. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Jolly Old (or young) Nicholas Hammond, of The Sound of Music Fame, is brought to the TV screen as Peter Parker, the secret identity of the wonderful Spider-Man. In the series, Peter deals with a clone, a beautiful girl from a foreign country and a corrupt politician. <br /> <br /> The series is far from the timeline (that is, Peter has already graduated from the university, and that's when he gets a bit, and Uncle Ben is already dead.) The audience is treated to action, tension , and the attitude the characters have towards Peter and his alter ego, spider. <br /> <br /> While this is also slightly disappointing that Robert. F Simon does not look like JJJameson, it is not so disappointing that Betty award is not Betty award but a hot African American girl (who reminds me of Halle Berry, which is one of the hottest women on the planet ) one was not so bad. <br /> <br /> But considering the time, and how much drama they packed into this one, it's kind of the shadow that bad TV is today. Anyway, it's entertaining, even for today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
