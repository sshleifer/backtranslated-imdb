When I went to see Rendition, I was expecting an exciting movie on a controversial topic with great actors. I didn't expect a movie that was so annoying, exciting, poetic and sad that picked me up from the beginning and didn't let me go, even after I left the theater. A word of advice to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, doesn't let your politics get in the way of enjoying or not enjoying this movie. Take it for what it is. I saw it with my conservative Jewish family (I am the black sheep, the pseudo-liberal university student) and I thought they would write it off as "liberal propaganda". Instead, they said it was a good movie with excellent performances (they like to impress their own film critics). It's sad that a film like this has to be marketed by its Oscar-affiliated actors, leaving the constantly underrated Sarsgaard as well as new talent such as the truly excellent Metwally. The whole movie produced good performances, and some exhibited much more than others; My only problem with that was that there was a lot happening that didn't allow much screen time for each of the characters. In fact, I felt that the "sub-plot" with Fatima and Khalid was just as prominent on the screen as Anwar's part of the story. <br /> <br /> The characters all have the potential to fall into stereotypes, but the actors do a good job of giving them depth with the small screen time they have. Stripe is really awesome, as a heartless senator, and as much as I don't want to see the actress in such a terrible role, it's impossible to believe her. Gyllenhaal, who will probably be one of the Oscar buttons for this movie, sometimes seems unclear in his role. H tries to portray his inner conflict, but usually just comes down as if he forgot his lines or he doesn't know how to feel. Sarsgaard delivered an excellent performance; his memorable confrontation with Stripe is easily one of the best parts of the movie. Metwally, again, was great, and I hope to see him in more mainstream movies. It is a pity that Gyllenhaal is probably nominated for him. Yigal Naor, as shown on IMDb, is already a few films, but he's a newcomer to my eyes. He performed well with Mohammed Khouas and Zineb Oukach. <br /> <br /> The story of Fatima and Khalid was not found in advertising, but it brings a sad humanity to the story. The story was interesting, as I really connected the two stories until it was clearly told at the end. I read some comments here that the love story was useless, but I disagree. I think it certainly shows a different side to the controversial issue as well as humanity in general. Khalid was the real terrorist, but he did it to avenge his brother and although he is responsible for the attack, you see a human side with him through the story with Fatima. Not that I think we should feel bad for real terrorists, but I think the theme of all of us is definitely relevant. <br /> <br /> Whatever your feelings about terrorism, politics, etc. Leave it out of the theater. The bottom line is it's an interesting story with a message we all need to hear.
