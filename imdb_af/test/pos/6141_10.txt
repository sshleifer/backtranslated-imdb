Although several scenes of Wirey Spindell can be described as "over". I thought it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to a level of taboo-turned comedy. <br /> <br /> Wirey Spindell is a great movie with great dialogue. I won't say this movie is for everyone, but the movie is on my top 10 list. <br /> <br /> If you can look further, it is sometimes disapproving and looking at the movie it is, I hope you can see it in the same light as I do.
