I like the movie, but it should have been longer. The actors did a good job. Portia De Rossi is a wonderful actress and Kristoffer Polaha is a hottie. He didn't look like John at 100%, but he favored him from a distance. I look forward to seeing more of him on the big screen. He didn't have John's charisma, but he certainly has a charm about himself. He has beautiful eyes and a big smile. He reminds me of my boyfriend a lot. Mrs. Bissett was just amazing to me. She should look out on the asthma. I'm not going to comment on the Darryl Hannah character. My mother always said, "If you can't say anything good, then go to hell!" so I'm going to do it. <br /> <br /> Molly
