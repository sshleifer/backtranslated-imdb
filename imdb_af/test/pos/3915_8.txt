I saw this movie on the opening night and enjoyed it. I would probably have enjoyed it more if I wasn't sitting by my dad. My dad saw the original (unfortunately I haven't seen it yet) and talked about the whole thing. He said the movie sucked and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators made some fun of the horror genre with the movie. In every horror movie there is always a certain character depicted. If they weren't in the movie, well, you shouldn't like it too much. The characters' characters are: <br /> <br /> "The main character": Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) "The main character's boyfriend": Wade (Jared Padalecki) "The Lead Character's Sibling / (Soon-To-Be) Reformed Jake ": Nick (Chad Michael Murray)" The Annoying Sluttish Character ": Paige (Paris Hilton)" Characters Just Looking Around ": Dalton (Jon Abrahams) & Blake (Robert Ri'chard) <br /> > With those characters, it makes it slightly predictable who will die and who will live. Of course you know who goes with what I just typed. The movie can be predictable (in fact, I had a good idea that would just die by seeing the trailer), but it was still nice. It may look stupid (why is there a sugar mill in the middle of an abandoned campsite that wasn't in the beginning), but it's very easy to watch. The comedy and gore was the perfect amount for poorly-attended filmmakers, who didn't do it well, didn't get me wrong (less than "final destination 2"), but it worked very well, as hot as the fire came up, but the temperature can still burn the "Wax".
