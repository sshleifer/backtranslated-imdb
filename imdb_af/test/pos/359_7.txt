As the second last of Chaplin's Essanay films, CARMEN is a parody of Cecil B. Demille's drama with the same title. It is so clear that Demille's famous film did not impress the comedy king, which he later recognized in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> Parodies were not a new experiment for Chaplin. He has done several of them, his prehistoric past and his new work, and will continue it until the end of his career in films (for example, in a KING IN NEW YORK). <br /> <br /> Chaplin does a very good portrayal of Don José, and Edna Purviance's is as good as Carmen. Do not act as we are used to; Charlie is not the sweet tramp, and Edna is far from an innocent little woman, but it was not Chaplin's intent. A BURLESQUE ON CARMEN is a somewhat strange Chaplin movie, very different, but does include good material. <br /> <br /> The main story, though very differently structured, is like the original drama. Don José is in love with Carmen but is not alone in the field; "Carmen, Carmen, the beautiful Carmen, loves all men under 96," but he has the great advantage of being an officer, and there we are; It is the famous story of rivalry, love, greed and honor, seen from a humorous perspective. Thanks to Chaplin and Purviance's performances, and the wonderful, wonderful music by George Bizet that I greatly admire, it could have been a comedy masterpiece, it's time taken into account. It could have been. But unfortunately, although it's a good, good comedy, I don't feel it's fair to claim people who claim a BURLESQUE CARMEN is far from a masterpiece. But it is important to keep in mind that it has nothing to do with a lack of talent, but rather because of business conflicts. When Chaplin refused to sign the Essanay contract again after completing his last film for the company, POLICE, they took revenge by changing all the screens back. Chaplin originally worked out of CARMEN. Thanks to this, the movie is somewhat confusing and has some senseless scenes that are annoyingly funny, and the movie was rather a Ben Turpin feature. Turpin played Remendados - as a Chaplin card. Of course, Chaplin was in despair when he discovered what Essanay did, and had to stay in bed for a few days. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, a BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is highly recommended for Chaplin fans and fans of beautiful music.
