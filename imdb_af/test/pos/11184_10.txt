I just wrote one review on IMDb before that, since I consider most games to be unworthy of time and effort. The curse of Monkey Island is different. <br /> <br /> After impressing and impressing Monkey 1. and 2, I had great expectations for the third edition ... and was not disappointed. The first thing that struck me was the much improved graphics. Don't get me wrong, for games made respectively in 1990 and 1991. Monkey 1 and 2 were pioneers and provided the goods, but CMI is rising and delivering a great cartoon game that is fun and satisfying. . All scenes and settings are carefully crafted and well thought out, and perfectly match this type of game. The animation / CGI is a mix of realism and exaggeration; a fantastic combination in this case. <br /> <br /> For me, the writing is very important in the success of the previous two games. The CMI writing is smart, appropriate and above all absolutely hilaries. At this, the script is now sound, unlike the previous two, where speech in the text format at the bottom of the screen is displayed. Dominic Armato's voice is perfect for Guybrush: Sharp, clear and slightly naive. All other voice talents fit perfectly into their characters, especially Earl Boen who is the voice behind LeChuck. I loved every character through the game: not just their personalities and whites, but the way each character is wonderful and characteristic animated. While the soundtrack is about sound effects, it's a noteworthy mention. The soundtracks for Monkey 1 and 2 were both monotonous, and in spite of that, it was very effective at giving atmosphere and representing a change in mood. CMI's soundtrack is once again a step. Each scene is complemented by a catchy, subtle, playful and pirate (if it is a word). With a change in setting or mood, the music also adds to the entertainment and entertainment that the game offers. <br /> <br /> The whole idea behind Monkey Island is to solve puzzles and problems to progress. It may sound easy, but is actually devilish in many places. Some can be turned off by the level of logic and the amount of thinking that goes on in Monkey Island, but in reality it makes the game even more fun and fun, and also adds to the repetition value. The option of "The Curse of Monkey Island" or "The Curse of Monkey Island: Mega-Monkey" (which is harder and more abundant of puzzles) fits players of all abilities and also gives good reason to play the game at least twice. No matter how hard you choose, you get a different game every time, with many speech options and other puzzles to solve which doesn't affect the outcome of the game, but for fun. The most entertaining part of the game is Ship Combat, and the sword "battles" that follow. It was especially well thought out and made the game quite worthwhile. Add to this a wonderful story that is not violent and suitable for all ages who will love you and want to get to the end. <br /> <br /> Finally, a unique special mention should go to the designers. of this game. The way in which every complex puzzle and problem is invented is simply amazing. While picking up items and items during the game, you can't see how each one will help you progress, but with a little thought and perseverance, they offer themselves, and therefore the CMI designers need to be highly regarded. <br /> 10/10 for the best game I've ever played (not an exaggeration)
