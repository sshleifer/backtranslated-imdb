The most beautiful factor that lies in this masterpiece of a movie is not the beautiful protagonists. It is also not their excellent acting and hissing chemistry. <br /> <br /> For me this is the miss-and-scene of the whole movie. The settings, the lighting, the props ... add everything to the mood for the love between the main characters. A smelly smoke from Chow's cigarette tells us his state of mind. The ever-changing Lizhen's recent parents reflect the limitations of decision-making, the ruins of Angkor Wat, with the weakening relationship of the two leaders. /> <br /> The excellent use of miss-and-play gives the film just the right amount of feeling needed to flesh out the intricate nature of the character relationship. The film leaves the audience fruitless longing for more.
