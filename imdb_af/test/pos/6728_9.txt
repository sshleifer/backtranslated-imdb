This movie "chased me" as I saw it when I was about 8 years old. I didn't know what it was called, so it's so nice to finally find it. I remember being pretty scared because I was just looking at a tin mine in Cornwall when I looked at it, so it may suggest me. Luckily I didn't see any dead children there, but I found this movie really disturbing and frightening when I was much younger. I never forgot it, though I couldn't find it. I seem to remember that the films of the children's film are generally good, but they don't show them any more. I also remember programs like The Children Of Green Knowe in the same era on the BBC - equally disturbing in its own way.
