Can a mentally challenged black youth be a catalyst to unite people in a South Carolina town? The answer seems to be that, despite his disability, James Kennedy understood much more than what he got credit for and became a game in the sports field. Also, the movie says how many people we overlook with problems that can be helped if we just had the patience, Coach Jones told the young man because of his own fault in his heart. <br /> <br /> "Radio", directed by Michael Tolllin, is a formula film inspired by a true story. Yet the movie is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances the director of his wonderful cast was able to get. <br /> <br /> Coach Jones is instrumental in getting the young man called Radio because of his passion To collect them, involved in sports, a passion he has discovered in this disabled man who is only in his young life difficult to beat. From a poor background, Radio, lives with his mother who protects him and asks the coach's intentions. Radio is seen by schoolchildren as a mascot, first his sunny mindset wins him acceptance of everyone because he is a good person without our evil in his body. <br /> <br /> The movie owes much to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. He makes a big pair as the coach and Radio. Mr. Harris, one of the best actors of our time, is never boring in anything he knew with his presence. He gets the essence of the principle coach who sees the possibility of making something that botheres him from his past. Cuba Gooding Jr is also at best portraying the mental young man. <br /> <br /> The supporting role is excellent. S. Ephata Merkerson, one of the best actresses of her generation, does interesting work as Radio's mother. Alfre Woodard, another good actress plays the high school principle with style. Debra Winger has just a few scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> "Radio", while it is sentimental, will heat anyone's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people in our society, we know nothing. about and how fast we should judge them. Michael Tollin puts many ideas into the right perspective for us.
