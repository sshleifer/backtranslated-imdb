I just got it and it's a good movie !! I loved it! Although Jane Brighton's voice at the beginning is so annoying because of her braces she doesn't open her freaking mouth ... but you have to watch, because it's a good movie !! The things he says here are so funny and very cute !! and I'm sure Aaron will probably say some of the things in real life, because I don't know, it looks the same !! ha ha there is a part in tha movie that is really funny ... its winning jean's little sister meets him ... but i can't tell what happens because ill just see you for yourself !! I went to see Aaron a concert and it was so much fun !! n he had so much fun ... I still can't believe I met him !!! I have photos if anyone wants to see them !! Steph
