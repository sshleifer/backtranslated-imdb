OSS 117 was nice from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to define why one movie touches you or not, and I will not try to analyze such a perfect comedy, so politically untrue that even academical paper should be dedicated to it! <br /> <br /> Everything is outdated, from women's clothes (sigh!), Mambo dancing, the "heroic song" ... ("Bambino" sounds like an Italian Canzonetta sung in ... Arabic :)! ). Hubert is physically imposing, but silly like hell. From all the 007's he looks like Sean Connery, but is definitely more sima because he's ... stupid, speaks his thoughts all the time, giggles, even some homoerotic fantasies and there are rumors about him. In short, as an anti-hero he knocks :)! Sometimes he just raises his eyebrows or frown, and that's all it takes to make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Bénénice Bejo is the true queen of that movie. Gracious, insidious but with ideals. Aure Atika, on the contrary, is reduced to a femme fatal species. It's amazing to see her as "sexy bomb", you. <br /> <br /> You can't compare it with "Austin Powers"! I agree with Amazon's D. Hartley (Seattle, WA) if it's respect for the genre. <br /> <br /> What's your favorite scene? One of my favorite scenes is the "fight of the chickens" with the masked villain. But the really perfect one is when you talk to the cocktail, how they all feel confident. This scene alone makes the comedy genre worthwhile.
