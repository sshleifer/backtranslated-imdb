I had a chance to see this movie on an early screen in Brea and I've been crazy about it since. The film is based on Shakespeare's twelfth night which I have read and loved and on stage several times, and I certainly liked the references. But whether you like Shakespeare or not, it doesn't matter - the movie is on it. It is super funny, witty and charming. Amanda Bynes is hilarious and so was David Cross. Actually, the whole cast is great - I'm just a great David Cross fanatic. The role play is hot and the soundtrack kicks very cool tires and some that I haven't heard before, but I know they have a CD that comes out, so I'll definitely buy it. Everyone in our audience laughed from start to finish - all age groups. !!!!
