It's an excellent Anderson production worth comparing with the best episodes of UFO or SPACE 1999 (first series). Of course, this is not an SFX exception or Star Wars pseudo-mystical trip party, but a subtle, slow-paced movie, but it has the spectacular, ominous and unpleasant atmosphere of the best Anderson productions: for lovers of 'cerebral' Scientific. Lynn Loring's voice is absolutely terrible. SFX is good for this kind of product and acting is also good. Two astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun, but crash home ... or do they? Oh, videophones! Sometimes now and then as the next "everyone's gadget next decade", but another 40 years later. The device of the Earth's twin planet on the opposite side of the sun also comes back in Gamera tai daiakuju Giron (1969), so who copied it?
