I remember years ago, BBC1 showed this movie in a very cut shape. I found it on video a few years ago and watched it again. The film, though slow and slightly strange (the mountain men look very strange), was the atmosphere honestly effective. This is one of my favorite slasher movies and I have no idea where an unencrypted version can be found. Currently erased everywhere (except the US where it was accidentally placed on a horror compilation!). It's a pity you can't get this movie because it was meant to be seen. Wrong turn (the recent Stan Winston-made movie) is a big part of Just Before Dawn. One of the better 80's skate movies and deserves to be seen by a wider audience.
