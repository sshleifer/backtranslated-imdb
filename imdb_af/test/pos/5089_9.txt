Nothing dull about this movie, which is made up of fully realized characters with a depth to them. Even the broken martyrs have body language. Jannings's performance is brilliant, everything wants, wants and needs. A Henry VIII as he should have been. Henny Porten is perhaps more noble and pure than Anne Boleyn, but she plays the part as written: A victim caught in the jaws of a large (big) baby. <br /> <br /> Sparkuhl's cinematography is great in repair, the senses sensual. Lubitsch lets these characters breathe and reveals their corruption to the smallest of meannesses. He takes his time, trying to get the patience of an audience to get used to being turned away by action, but time is worth spending. Slow down your heartbeat and watch this slight miracle of the German silent movie.
