I'm not usually going out of my way to look at romantic comedy, and maybe I'll see in the future after Return to Me. The plot was simple and no secret to publicity. You don't have to be Einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes. What you can do is relax and let yourself be thrown into a world where the "chemistry" is abundant and the good guys win and you can just laugh and have a good time. I love this movie .... and have the DVD on order!
