Peter Lorre turns into one of his best performances as a Hungarian watch to come to the United States to make a new life for himself and ever bring his girl across the big dam to be with him. Lorre's contagious optimism and bright prospects come out very effectively, which makes performance even better if he hides his face in a hotel fire, and when no one gives him a chance to work, he becomes reluctant to live a crime. . Lorre's series as an actor is rarely as clear as in this movie with his jovial, benevolent immigrant, after his depressing, melancholy, disgruntled self seeking the truth behind what he believed America had dedicated him to his pure, intelligent , better-than-your-average hood, to his sympathetic relationship with a blind woman with whom he falls in love. The story is good, has some interesting twists, and gives Lorre many opportunities to shine. Director Robert Florey does a quality job behind the lens, and all supporting role-players help the film with Evelyn Keyes who gives a particularly good turn as the blind girl. I loved the end - and the truth - that shone in Lorre's character despite all the negative things that society did to him. For a little B-picture, The Man Behind the Mask, good movie art is his time.
