Spoilers: This movie has problems, but eventually it gets the message. I liked it because it ends the way things really end. The good man tries and tries, gets his heart broken several times, but eventually there is no typical hollywood ending. It ends the way such things always end, or at least always in my own and friends' experiences. Anyone who thinks that is the end is not how it really happens, as the first comment was, and believes the girl would come to realize she is an asshole that treats her badly because he doesn't care about her at all no. is naive or living in a more perfect world than I am. I give it 7/10, extra points simply because it was not afraid to end up on a sign, give no real resolution, just the main character who stayed in the heart, confused and alone like so many men of innumerable generations before.
