As a big-hard Monkey Island fan, I flee this one will be terrible because Ron Gilbert didn't make it. Boy, I was surprised! Although not as good as the first two, it has the comedy I wanted. I was a little nervous about the new graphics, new SCUMM engine, and just the fact that it was on a CD. But it all came together, and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters. I especially enjoyed Sword Fighting returning. And the whole story about finding the big unleavened ring was just incredible. Go ahead and try out this two-CD adventure. And now we can rejoice because Monkey Island 4: Escape from Monkey Island really comes out very quickly! This Autumn!
