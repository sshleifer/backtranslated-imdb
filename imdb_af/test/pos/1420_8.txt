A brief history of time is not just a documentary at the beginning and the end of the universal and reality as we know it, it's a story about the man and the genius known as Stephen Hawking. It is his story that reflects the story of time and change in the history of the universal. The style of the documentary / editing style of the interviews begins and ends with a quick blur to black. Almost like cutting between segments and interviews, the documentary gives you a strange feeling, as this is the viewpoint of Stephen Hawking and not the eye of the camera. Running time is just a little longer than an hour. It's a short story, then the topic can be spoken for days and days. An interesting and proud story.
