I stopped looking at "The West Wing" after Aaron Sorkin stopped writing and manufacturing. It just wasn't the same. Imagine my excitement to see a movie he wrote again. It was a long time - the American president, some good men. His screenplay was a beautiful mix of humor and tragedy. He made a compelling story credible and at the same time weighed on me. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was incredible as a small Texas congressman whose voters only wanted lower taxes and wanted to keep their guns. Not a hard job, so he had a lot of time to fool around - and he did. His office staff seemed to be at the Playboy Mansion. As he said, "You can teach them to type, but you can't teach them to grow tits." Despite his sexist stance, which just suits a Texas congressman, they were completely loyal, especially his aide, Amy Adams (Junebug and the former Hooters girl). Add a rich Texas social site that's been done in Afghanistan perfectly played by Julia Roberts; and a pain-in-his-boss ass CIA agent, beautiful by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you have a movie worth watching. Excellent writing, and fantastic acting, and a story to tell. What do you want more from the movies?
