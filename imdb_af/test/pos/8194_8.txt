For a feature film, the plot now follows history - or at least historical gossip. But then the Chinese, who know the story very well, will once again portray it from time to time, it will never tolerate it otherwise. Attention to detail is wonderful, especially for everyone who has read Sima Qian's account in the historian's records. Indeed, Jing Ke, according to Sima Qian, has made an attempt at Qin Shi Huang's life at the request of the crown prince of Yan for unification. Sima Qian explicitly mentions the General Ventilator's head and the dagger rolled into the card, as well as the dagger thrown into the copper column. Although Jing Ke is not described as a stranger to sword play, he is hardly the invincible warrior portrayed by Chen Kaige. Jing Ke is indeed the movie's worst link. In fact (again according to Sima Qian) he was a heavy drinker and spent his visit to Qin as long as possible, with the ladies of Yan spending a lot of time before the crown prince finally brought him. . He was short-lived and did not look after death, although he was willing to accept it. Chen Kaige's Jing Ke is afraid of death, but not his own. He is the classic relentless killer who has become disillusioned pacifist. His love (or perhaps just love) for a woman and sorry for a few hundred children who have buried Zheng alive (not even two thousand years of hostile convex historians claim that Qin Shi Huang did it, though there is a legend about him bury 460 Confucians to their necks and then handle them) is enough to kill this former killer. The melodrama is not convincing and the character just ends boring. The acting here is not clumsy, but not very interesting, as it is the character. As for Lady Zhou, in all the many stories I heard from Qin Shi Huang, she never showed up. Anyway, Gong Li is known enough that Americans heard of her (thanks to Zhang Yimou) and there had to be a love interest, so here she is. It is a pity that her performance is almost as woody as Jing Ke's character. She did much better (in Qiu Ju for example) to be subtle; here she just manages scarce presence. But all this is trivial compared to the extraordinary play of Li Xuejian and Zheng himself. Qin Shi Huang is rather for the Chinese who Milton's Satan is for us: accept as a villain, but a noble one. Qin Shi Huang's achievements have been radiating for two thousand years now and Li has taken on his frightening will without harming his humanity. Li's performance is enough, but the size of the film is huge, though photography is deliberately murdered. It feels old. The score is sufficient, barely moving, but very suitable for the action. Although I only saw it once, I believe that Chen Kaige should get more credit for his camera work than other reviewers allowed him. The opening credits are exciting. If five stars are his absolute average, I give three more to Li Xuejian's play and Chen Kaige as an actor, writer and director.
