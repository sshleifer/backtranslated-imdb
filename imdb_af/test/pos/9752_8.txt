I found this movie to be educational, entertaining and very moving. I was impressed when I learned how much Justice Arbor contributed in her time in Kosovo. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is highly rated and it is good to see her again in a Canadian production. Other easily recognizable stars are Leslie Hope (24) and John Corbett (Sex in the City.) <br /> <br /> While the story line of this movie may not be quite factual, it left me with the desire to learn more about the word of Arbor. A great movie for inspiring young women. <br /> <br /> I say the movie is a "must see."
