Great movie. Good acting, a wonderful writing. It is exciting to find out what people think and how they respond to the situation in which they are involved. A pity for the end; A 'page' of the text of how Nynke's life goes, instead of moving images, was a poor choice. I hope this movie attracts many people; It is worth the effort!
