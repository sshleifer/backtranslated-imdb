It's an incredibly compelling story, telling with great simplicity and grace. The story itself is the object of the film, though the scenery is beautiful. The play is understated, even excellent, because the characters themselves come in all their eccentric simplicity. <br /> <br /> This artwork is unlikely to be appreciated by those who see "coincidence" without apology. It takes work to be brought into the story, but once you get involved, the capturing is complete!
