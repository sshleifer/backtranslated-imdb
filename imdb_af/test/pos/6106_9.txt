Margaret Colin stars as the main figure in this story; As I watched it, I remembered her in Adrian Lynes' "Indifferent" as Diane Lane's neighbor in a Tony NY environment. <br /> <br /> This movie was surprisingly good and Diane Stillman earned credit for an accurate portrayal of class, crimes and crimes, which actually occur in exciting neighborhoods (the thought lapses!). It is really not too dramatic; the audience lives through her misfortune, the pain it caused; denial; and the ultimate resolution. <br /> <br /> It's more than just a matter of "what's a good person", as Colin talks to her husband .... a person's character is defined by a single act; and should they be condemned forever because of their actions ?? The questions are pertinent; It is also amusing to see several cinematic references to Martha Stewart (this is the difficult, difficult mother), and Colin is sometimes called friends by her as a "perfect host, with perfect genes" .... (gag); and a scene in which Colin is confronted by the police (the "friends" also betray her later) .... <br /> <br /> The denial and facades of American society are addressed; (Oh, murder does not occur here, similar to the theme in "Season in Purgatory", by author Dominick Dunne, about the true murder of Martha Moxley, in Greenwich, Connecticut); Colin is aware of her crime; but consciously finds herself enduring the facade until she finally breaks; rent or buy this movie; she is an underrated actress who does pretty well in these roles.
