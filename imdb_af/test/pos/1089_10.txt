I love the way he experiments. Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to watch as much as Satya and the company were. Jatin's new arrival also played his part and Nana Patekar was at his best. Suchak was really annoying, but I think he fits the character he plays - he really had ugly teeth. The story has a lot of progress and no songs in the movie make it better. I just wish he would sign Urmila for his other upcoming movies. I think they are the best director and actress combination I have seen. I haven't seen Naach yet, but I'm looking forward. For some reason I find Antra Maali not so exciting to look at the screen - unlike Urmila.
