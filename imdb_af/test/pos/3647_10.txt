In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from rubbish bins to a stoep on a ship carrying a certain Canarian bird and grandmother, his owner. Uh Oh! Tweety and Ouma once again offer many obstacles to the cat's efforts to get the bird. Sylvester also gets sea sick a few times. And the second time the caracal cats go to the spot on the ship that has something that cures its ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So can Sylvester fire! I will stop here and say it is another excellent cartoon arranged by Friz Freling and the popular cat and bird duo. Tweety's S.O.S is highly recommended.
