I watched this movie on a big screen a few months ago. I didn't know what to expect, and for the first ten minutes I feared I might not enjoy this movie. It started very slowly, in silence and almost banality, which was less exciting when the sound was very bad and the subtitles were sometimes impossible to read. <br /> <br /> But I certainly do not regret going up look it. This is one of the most beautiful Bergman movies I have ever seen, at the same time human, relentless and psychologically so convincing. <br /> <br /> Rarely did I see actors playing so wonderfully, with such intensity on their faces: Lew Ullman's interpretation is memorable and Sydow is also excellent. <br /> <br /> There is always psychological violence in Bergman movies, and this one can be the most physically violent of them all. The tense relationship between man and woman develops in parallel with the physical violence that surrounds them ... <br /> <br /> Finally, this sober, violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly striking human depth. An excellent Bergman. <br /> <br />
