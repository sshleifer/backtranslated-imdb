This Royal Rumble had the message to struggle today. Gimmick and image are more popular than wrestling ability. <br /> <br /> HBK vs Edge. Pretty good match. A lot of heat for Edge that just started as a heel and what better way to go with HBK in a game. It's a little slower at the end than usual. Overall this game gets a 6/10. Undertaker vs Hedinreich. Not a good game. Undertaker had to wear Hedinreich through this game, which really got lost and screwed her moves. It became interesting to see Raws Gene Snitsky and later Kane comes in this game. Overall, the fans were more interested when this game ended. 2/10 Kurt Angle vs JBL vs Big Show. This game was initially slow, but got pretty good when Angle managed to speed up the game. Kurt Angle has a very good struggle and proves he is the best wrestler in the game. JBL and Big Show played a slow game. The end of this game was bad. Over all this game was a 5/10 mainlly due to Kurt Angle. Randy Orton vs HHH. Good game, surprising heat for Randy Orton who was face in this game. Randy proved he could go the border with any top star. This game also marked the first match. HHH struggled where someone did not run and save him from a loss. About all this game was about a 6/10. <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble match was OK. Some surprises. Some are not so good surprises. I was very upset that Kurt Angle was not given enough time in this game. But over all these games, a man I never thought would have been pushed so quickly. I won't tell you who wins. I give this game an 8/10
