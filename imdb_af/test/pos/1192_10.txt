I won't say anything about music, because this topic can be so deep that it can be a great separate review. Let's focus on movie that is brilliant. No doubt, one of Forman's best works. <Br /> <br /> The simple story about love, friendship, freedom and ideals ... oh yes, the ideas even pacifists are ready to go to war ... <br /> <br /> There is not a single false word, single fake character, a single false feeling in the story, because love, freedom and friendship are not something complicated for the characters of the movie. These things are not something that "everyone can see from different angles". These are not things that many thoughts need to understand. Their love is simple, their friendship is simple. Their ideals are as simple as the word "simple" itself and that is why these characters are so deep. <br /> <br /> Berger, the leader of a hippie played by Treat Williams, is a man who lives to live and that is the greatest happiness for him ... he has his ass - (as he is in one of the scenes in the movie sings and it's enough to make him happy with his property. <br /> <br /> Berger never accepts that something can't be done ... and its right ... If he wants to go to a rich guys banquet in his dirty old clothes and big long hair, he'll doing it ... if he wants him to go to another state to just see his friend, he'll do it ... he never thinks twice ... he just does it. <br /> <br /> How? Why is he so powerful? The answer is simple: because it's FREE. <br /> <br /> Just watch the wind move the hair into this movie and you'll understand it all, maybe you'll even free yourself.
