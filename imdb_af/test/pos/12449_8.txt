This is one of the nicest teenage movies I've ever seen (and I wanted to be released to video). It was released the same year as another great comedy in which Tim Matheson played a role, "Animal House" (probably why it was overlooked). <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable parts of this movie will definitely be the soundtrack that could and should have a formal label release. The soundtrack features a lesser-known 70 act called High Inergy, whose song "We are the Future" played a film role in the film's Prom scene. I remember buying the group's album "Steppin Out" as a child, mainly because of the appearance of the girls and not necessarily for their musical talents. <br /> <br /> The closing song is one of the best ballads I've ever heard, and I can still hear it in my head. I wish I knew the name of the group so that I could find somewhere in cyberspace. <br /> <br /> If you like movies like "Over the Edge" and "Rich Kids", I think this is one you will also enjoy.
