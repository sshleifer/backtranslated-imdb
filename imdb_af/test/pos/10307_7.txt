The movie's subject is tempting and very real. This happened. One can debate artistic freedoms taken by director and screenwriter. The subject is what makes the film tick - nothing else. I watched the movie for the first time at the real Phoolan, shot in New Delhi and served as an elected member of parliament in India for years. By the way, she was not the first untouchable elected to parliament, as some reviewers have said. The so-called "untouchables" have been elected for decades in Indian parliament in reserved constituencies. <br /> <br /> While Shekhar Kapur as director is a hero to many India because he has made commercially accepted international films - - "Bandit Queen" and "Elizabeth" (and a tolerable kiddie movie called "Mister India ", accepted by average Indian audiences - and even Oscar nominations for Elizabeth, I do not place as a top-notch film director from India. He fails in every department as a director except perhaps he succeeds in getting the above-mentioned achievements from his actors. Subtleism, finesse, charm are not easy to find in his films - melodrama brims in them. <br /> <br /> His idea of ​​using Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's vocal version of the song in the early part of the movie was Perhaps his single great achievement on the unbeatable "Bandit Queen" soundtrack. And then maybe the creaking doors during the gang rape order. Otherwise, the movie looks like a spaghetti western with sex and violence, less the good music they associate with them. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a nice Indian film director who makes realistic international quality cinema - it's not Shekhar Kapur's movies you should see; These are the later works of three Indian filmmakers Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mrinal Sen, and Girish Karnad and of course Muzaffar Ali's Umrao Jaan. It is a pity that none of the directors had the financial support that Kapur and their films had to give an international view. Sen's Oka aria katha, made in Telugu, or Satyajit Ray's Sadgati based on Munshi Prem Chand's Kafan, is more complete than films for an intelligent viewer dealing with the condition of the untouchable in India. Sen did not resort to graphic sex and violence, but merely recommended them. Of course, Sen's nugget didn't make headlines, while Kapur's attempted them. <br /> <br /> For Kapur's credit he is articulated and uses his limited talent and modest resources in the Mumbai movie industry to take his products out of home. For that trouble, I greet Kapur. But "Bandit Queen" will remain a major subject in anticipation of a sizeable director to handle it.
