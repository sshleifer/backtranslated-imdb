I also remember seeing this movie as a youngster at a local small theater that hosted foreign films every week. It was the daring adventure of everything that has remained in my memory ever since. <br /> <br /> Especially the impressive was the scene with Noel Purcell as the old sailor, Paddy, who drank too much, saw appearances or heard and died of terror in a cave. I've always heard of Noel's career decades later because of my view of him. There is also a young Cyril Cusack as the learning boatman, James, with designs on the lovely Jean Simmons, when Emmeline grew up. <br /> <br /> Want to have a video of this haunting movie and remind me of it. Where do I send my request?
