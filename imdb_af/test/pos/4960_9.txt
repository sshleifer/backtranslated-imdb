I really wanted to write a title for this review that didn't come down but still described my feelings for this show. I can see now that this is not possible. "American Family" is one of the best shows I've ever watched on television. Several reviewers on IMDb mentioned the word "nice" when describing this show. Never a word more appropriate. The cinematography for this show is stunning. Every scene and shot looks like a masterpiece. The lighting, camera moving, scene composition and colors ... I have to remember myself watching a TV show and not a moving picture masterpiece. Lee Holdridge and Nathan Wang's score brings tears to my eyes. And most of all, the acting work by the all-encompassing incredible cast is honest and sincere. I don't feel like I'm watching performances ... I feel like I'm watching the real life. If only real life would be this beautiful. <br /> <br /> Indeed, "American Family" has raised the quality entertainment bar on television. I recommend this show to anyone willing to see it. I can easily attend CBS to enter this show, but I have to say that it doesn't matter to me who air it. I'm just glad it's there for everyone to see. That's why I thank PBS for not allowing this view to disappear in anything. <br /> <br /> I need to give special recognition to the way each season's finals ended. The first one was pure creative shine and it moved me to tears. I waited to see if season two would end up in a creative way, and sure enough it did. Again, tears. <br /> <br /> Thanks to all those involved. You really made a special artwork with this show, and I really mean it. It is a pity that we have only two seasons, but a miracle has nothing.
