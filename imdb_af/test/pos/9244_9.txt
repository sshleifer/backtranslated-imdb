I found this to be an entertaining version of the challenges an independent filmmaker can face (something I never thought of). The movie kept my interest all the time, and I actually laughed aloud once! I'm not a movie maker, so I know nothing about the technology, but I am well edited and flowing smoothly telling the story. As an indemnity I contributed to this attempt to provide music for the soundtrack, but I was not involved in the creation of this movie and I could not tell you anything about Repo Man except I remembered how it returned is when I'm not really a sci-fi enemy). I enjoyed the comparisons of the movie made from punk rock files that make punk rock music. My wife went with me to see the movie and she didn't know anything about it and we had a good time.
