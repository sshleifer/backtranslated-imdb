Red Skelton (in his first starring role) plays Wally Benton who plays 'The Fox' on a radio show. He writes the murder mysteries and as 'The Fox' solves them. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone. He kidnapped Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girl (Virginia Gray). He tells Benton to write out the perfect murder ... or his girlfriends get it ... <br /> <br /> Very funny and enjoyable movie. Quickly moving (it's just 77 minutes), a good writing and perfect casting really puts it. Skelton is very good at his first role - very funny, fast, attractive and intelligent. Veidt is excellent like the evil Jones. Rutherford and Gray are great fun as Skelton's friends. All three of them play perfectly apart - their oral sparring is the highlight of this photo. Also nice to see Eve Arden in a small role. <br /> <br /> Worth it.
