BIG VET LIAR, in my opinion, is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral seriousness. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - "MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE") and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - "ALL THAT") played those tricks on Marty (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE), I really smiled and felt. That's what I like most about this movie. In fact, everything that happened after Jason's essay landed wrongly in Marty's hands was hilarious. I especially loved Jaleel White's cameo. When I first saw him, I couldn't be sure, but when I asked my mom if it was him, she said, "Of course!" Before I upload it, I would like to say: "As I said earlier, there is a moral on this story, and it's always the truth." Finally, if you are a fan of Frankie Muniz, Amanda Bynes, or Paul Giamatti, I recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a morale.
