I thought Nick Gomez's gaze on New Jersey's avid streets, where the motorcycle jackets were full-length, was both challenging and entertaining. It's just as good as movies like Boyz n the Hood of Menace II Society of Above the Rim. I thought the actors and scenarios were suitable, it had a sharp realistic feel to it and was very atmospheric, either with or without exception. I love this movie a lot, an underestimated jewel I got on TV and glad I caught it. Check out this movie if you get a shot. If they do not have a DVD, they should release one. Well done, Nick Gomez. IMDb Rating: 5.9. My rating: 9/10
