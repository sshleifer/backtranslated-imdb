It was a good movie in every sense of the word. It tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is rather intolerant of any deviations from the norm. It criticizes many Indian practices which find themselves very oppressive - such as arranging marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, the valuation of women in terms of their baby capacity, the binding concepts of service and so on. The core of the film is a touch of love story that goes beyond such limitations of society that the two protagonists find. The film is well behaved and sincere, completely credible from beginning to end, unlike most Bollywood movies. The main flaws of the movie, as I have seen it, were the first that the two lovers did not necessarily draw one another by a natural affinity for one another as much as being trapped in dead marriages without passion and no rewards. It may play a role in the sexual awakening of the characters, but most people who are in the same situation will not be homosexual. It is clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are fairly heterosexual. When Radha does her play at the end of the film with Aashok, she makes it clear that "without desire, she was dead" and the implication was that if he so wished, he could have completely fulfilled her, and then Sita was very disappointed when her husband didn't look her. Such situations do not change people in homosexuals - they may seek comfort in others in the same position, but in the film it is not clear at all that they are lesbians from the beginning - rather the opposite. Some people are bisexual, this is true, but most are usually heterosexual or homosexual. In the case of the ladies in the film, both had insensitive jerks for men. . . If this were not the case, would they of course have the need to express their desire for a relationship that they would not otherwise have considered? The film ignores it. The other error is the name of the characters. . . the names Sita and Radha deliberately seem to be shocked and outraged (think a film in America depicting a gay relationship between a man named "Jesus" and another name "Paul"!) by using make names related to different Hindu writings. The film is strong enough to stand on its own and I don't need any such devices. Anyway, the mistakes don't take much away from the power of the movie. It is indeed a very pleasant and powerful story. The images and characters will stay with you for a long time after you leave the theater.
