I wanted to watch this romantic drama (World War II) for a long time and now I can only say that it is a true masterpiece of Russian theater! <br /> <br /> Soviet films are known for their excessive propagandist approach, but fortunately this one has been released - with interest firmly on the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a vibrant girl, condemned by the outbreak. of the war for which he would like volunteers, but from which he will never return. The girl (a remarkable performance by Tatyana Samojlova) is also loved by the young man's cousin and when she does not receive a word from her boyfriend, he gives to the latter and marries him. However, he is an aspiring concert pianist who is bitter about the war and has defeated his chances of success. And because she also knew that the girl was still devoted to the soldier, she started to neglect her. Eventually the word reaches the girl of her beloved's death, but by the end of the film she learned to accept it as a sacrifice for their homeland and is happy to live with her memories of him. <br /> <br /> The movie features some great camera work that makes the screen space extremely sensible. By making regular shell, diagonal and high or low angle shots, it gives great force to the unfolding emotional drama. Individual rows are equally impressive - especially two: the spectacular scene, frenetically edited and piled up to begin, in which the girl saves an abandoned boy by trampling a truck; and the young man's premature ruin in an unfortunate front-facing, undoubtedly one of the best of his kind I have ever seen (with the sun moving away from him, symbolizing the life exhausted from his body, as he does the wedding day he will never have!). Also noteworthy is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home, which has been devastated during an air raid; Just as her final violent capitulation to the concert piano - which she is trying to resist by repeating him in the face - occurs in a later air attack and makes extremely effective use of a set of wavy curtains! <br /> <br /> Disappointingly, the R1 DVD of this outstanding movie is a bald-bone affair (the RusCiCo edition has some additions, but being an export tends to be very expensive and hard to find to start!); Criterion released it in conjunction with another war-themed Russian classic, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER (1959) - which my friend at the local DVD extradition told me is coming ... <br /> <br /> The only other movie I watched from this director, is the Arctic epic THE RED TENT (1969, though via the much shorter version of the US version!), An international production based on true events; Given the unmistakable artistic quality of the taps, I regret its famous documentary, I AM CUBA (1964), a few times when I was in Hollywood last year. In addition to receiving a weekly theater job, it has been on TV more than once, accompanied by a feature length "Making Of" !!
