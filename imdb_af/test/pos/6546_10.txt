It's one of my favorite movies of all time, if you're not in cars, forget about it !! This movie features one of Aussie's largest muscle cars, the XYTHO. Yes, so the play is not the greatest - it has never been made to win an Oscar. The car action will come back for more and more. There is a cool collection of 70's muscle cars and an Awesome '57 Chev - with a really cool cat plug! There is also a very cool song sung by Terry Serio, the lead actor. The acting is pretty funny when taken lightly, but the band smoke and drag racing is the main focus of this movie. Big fast cars with plaster of steel (NO PLASTIC CARS), and some cool streetwear. I only recommend it to people who are in cars and not someone who is looking for good acting.
