Simply put, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable. The film is less of the raw science of Darwin's beliefs and focuses very strongly on his relationship with his family, especially his wife, Emma, ​​and daughter Annie. <br /> <br /> Toby Jones gives a wonderful turn such as Thomas Huxley, the great defender of Darwin's beliefs, and the rest of the role play, is the task of sharing screen time with Bettany and Connelly. <br /> <br /> But these are the two carrying the movie. Their true chemistry emerges from beginning to end, but develops transcendence as Darwin wrestles with his demons. The scene where Darwin tells the end of the story of Jenny, the orangutan, to his dying daughter, Annie, is utterly poignant. The world premiere heard at the TIFF was spellbound. Bettany's performance will be recognized as one of the best of the year in short order. Just as wonderful is Connelly's job of playing the religious wife of a man who killed God in Huxley's words. <br /> <br /> The movie is slowly moving throughout the spectrum of Darwin's grief and welcomes every detail of Bettany and Connelly's acting. <br /> <br /> Brilliant.
