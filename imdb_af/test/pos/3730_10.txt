Great movie. Post-apocalyptic films kick ass. This one is no exception. Keep up the pace and interest without a conversation (mainly through good character development). The battle between Reno and the hero was strict. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval weapons to show how primitive and cruel mankind became without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and the end was a little space, that is, I had a difficult time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence. In summary, donkey character kicks off progress, design, story without the pillow of dialogue, and most importantly, the esteemed devastated beauty of a post-apocalyptic desert.
