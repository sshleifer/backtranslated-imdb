This is the kind of movie you initially choose to make the numbers out of video rentals ..... just to discover a subordinate, entertaining and enjoyable movie! The opening sequence of the police arriving at a dark and rainy home, where the "woman" committed murder ....... or is it? .... and the rest of the movie is trying to unravel what really happened. ... OK ... the movie is a little "campy" ... but has good editing and dialogue ..... professionally acting ..... often humorous ...... and the very last scene with the facial expression is one of the best of its kind ...... definitely worth watching ..... deserve at least a 7 or a 8!
