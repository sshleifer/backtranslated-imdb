Surprised to know the director (Sebastian Gutierrez) was a young Venezuelan (28) and was bored with so many predictable films. I was delighted with the script that spread so many small stories and clues. Targeted with black humor and taste, I love the tension between the many Boggart Rickman and the very natural but beautiful Thompson. Every member of the gang deserves attention, Gil Bellows at its best. Gugino is remarkable.
