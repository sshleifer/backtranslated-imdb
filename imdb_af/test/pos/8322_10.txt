As John Grierson pointed out, "The documentary genre can be defined as follows: the creative interpretation of reality" <br /> <br /> This fantastic 180-minute documentary marks the first time a computer-generated dinosaur project respect the intelligence of the viewer. <br /> <br /> When I saw Jurassic Park, which I expected with great excitement, I was very disappointed. Of course, the dinosaurs were great, but the storytelling was unnecessary. I thought, "As if they made a documentary on dinosaurs, without crying children or bad words, just made dinosaurs as realistic as possible to marvel at what once was reality." <br /> <br /> My dream came true. The BBC has made an exciting documentary version exploring the different era of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> This part is for all the people who seemingly disagree with the fact that they are at many points regarding behavior, skin patterns etc. Of course they should. Nobody was there. I think it's fantastic that they can imagine something so realistic. The guess is all based on the knowledge of many paleontologists, and this leaves the viewer with a pretty good idea of ​​what it was like. If you want to stick to what we know, just go to a dinosaur bone museum. That is why I included the Grierson quotation at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it hates its creators.
