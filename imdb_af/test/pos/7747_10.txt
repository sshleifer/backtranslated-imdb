I thought this movie was fun. I have never really watched old movies and this one was a very good first date movie. It had warmth and heart and spirit. Was kind of cheesy, but in today's movie industry cheesy is cute. I gave it a ten and I strongly suggest you rent the movie, buy it or see it anyway. Gene Kelly was very dreamy and a bit sarcastic and you knew the character thought he'd get it all. The female lead was thrown perfectly because they sparked two personalities and you wanted to keep on seeing what would happen. The grandmother in the movie was invaluable. The perfect addition to a great old movie. I love the fact that it was black and white and Gene Kelly is so nice with all the kids in the movie that you can't help him. See it.
