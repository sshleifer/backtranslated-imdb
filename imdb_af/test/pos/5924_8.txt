1st view 10/10/2009 - 8 out of 10 (Dir - Billy Wilder): Spectacular version of Lindbergh's famous flight by James Stewart as Lindbergh and Director Billy Wilder. There is not much background built into this story, but it is good because Wilder really makes the event remarkable, as it comes directly from Lindbergh's perspective, as he used his book as the basis of the movie. This early movie about flying should also be one of the best about the act itself. Stewart speaks and thinks of himself in flight giving you so much insight into what Lindbergh has gone through in this 33-hour solo flight across the Atlantic. And he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before - which is great !! There is some background on how he bought the plane and got financing, and some flashbacks on his life during the flight, but the movie is mostly about to flee. The story is also beautiful and photographed and is a joy to watch despite its age. I appreciate the fact that they did not throw in much fluff and just let the story go. Well done throughout. It's a classic movie to be seen by everyone.
