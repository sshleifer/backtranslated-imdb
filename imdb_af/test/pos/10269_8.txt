One year after 'Love Your Neighbor' she sits I.T.V. debut, follow the route taken by 'On The Buses' and 'Steptoe & Son' by graduating on the big screen, in a photo made by Hammer Films. It starts with a moving patriotic speech peering at the virtues of England's green and pleasant land, then slashing a shot of Eddie and Bill running a street and arguing furiously. It escalates into a strange sequence of white and black neighbors who vandalize each other's homes. At least the original theme song is retained (even if it is sung by someone other than Stuart Gillies). <br /> <br /> The local newspaper - "The Gazette" - holds a match to find the best neighbors, the winners land a Mediterranean cruise. Barbie suggests Joan to enter. The thing is, can Bill and Eddie be friends long enough to win it? This is the most important part of the plot. The film is mainly episodic. One piece is lifted directly from Season 1, namely Bill and Eddie go to the club as if they were on 'union business'. In fact, they are going to see a stripper (not meet two girls). Another part of the movie broke Bill, along with other black factory workers (in the series he was the only one). Eddie helped to multiply by several wrinkles (including smuggling through gates into beer kegs). While another (apparently inspired by Powell and the manager's "For the love of Ada"), Eddie's mother-in-law (beautiful Patricia Hayes) looks friendly with Bill's father (Charles Hyatt). <br /> <br /> The climax after Episode 1 Season 1 again appears in an expanded form. Bill again puts paint and a towel to scare Eddie, but his friends go with him and dance around a drum that contains a bare Booth so they can pretend to cook and eat him. Eddie must come home in the nude (surprisingly, there is less nudity here than in Episode 2 Season 2). The movie ends with the Reynolds and the Booths who win the 'Love'. Your neighbor's match, and the cruise together, but there's an unexpected turn with Joan's sex-crazy brother Cyril (James Beck - "Private Walker" from "Dad's Army"). He works as a steward. <br /> This is your typical '70s sitcom-in-movie, with all the bugs that usually occur in such movies. The lag is scattered, and the interest drops after about half an hour. The film is complemented by familiar faces such as Melvyn Hayes (played as 'Terry', a character from Episode 2 Season 1, played at Leslie Meadows), Bill Fraser (as factory manager), Anna Dawson, Andria Lawrence (who seems to have been in every 70's British comedy movie, mostly cast as Nimfomaniacs), and Arthur Engels. The director, John Robins, was also responsible for the film 'Man About The House'. <br /> <br /> The finest moment - while Eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory, Bill paints his face black. The first thing he knows is when the manager's secretary screams in fright. The tables are turned!
