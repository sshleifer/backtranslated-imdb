A criminal short-lived performance that continued three movie-downs (Naked Gun 1, 2 & 3) is fast, in your face, a fast-paced comedy that has more hits than misses. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen plays detective Lieutenant Sergeant Frank Drebin, an incompetent detective, who, through the cases with the capable assistant of his boss, Capt. Ed Hocken, bumbles a fumbles. <br /> <br /> The story lines are at their best, but it is deliberate, as the goodness is not in the storytelling, but in the weaving of a continuous spate of jokes with some really strange and wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> The jokes themselves come in many forms, whether it is puns, slapsticks, puns or background gags, most of them hit the spot, though some fall a little flat. It is inevitable with this 'gag every few seconds' approach that some will fail, but the relationship is good. <br /> <br /> The characters are a pleasure. From the guest star of the week dying in the opening seconds of each episode, the scientific scientist who is cruel and unusual experiments on children shines to the shoe, which is a form of oracle. heart catcher. <br /> <br /> Although not very successful, it quickly developed a cult. Much of the show's relative lack of success was at the forefront of their time and too sophisticated for the target audience, their head. none other than Matt 'The Simpsons' Groening. And he must know. <br /> <br /> Dated by today's standards, if you can see through that aspect, you're doing a surprise.
