The main actress Yuko Tanaka fulfills so much in the extraordinarily meditative "The Milkwoman", a calm look at missed chances in the life of a 50-something woman, indicating her routine with genuine motives. Played in the picturesque, tranquil city of Nagasaki, Akira Ogata's unconventional romantic film is so less a straight melodrama as a deliberate introspection of its characters' surrender to their present lives due to a tragic past that is being forced upon them. choice for which they did not ask. <br /> <br /> Perfect with the required global power exposed to a mindless routine, Tanaka Minako Oba, a middle-aged woman who, in front of her workplace at a supermarket, takes it on herself to deliver bottles of milk among the inhabitants of the hilly Nagasaki. One of the houses she is constantly passing to deliver such a delivery is that of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a local government employee who cares for her terminally ill wife (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita were high school lovers who have since divorced their parents with an elusive event. <br /> <br /> His film begins with the preliminary narrative of a young Minako who does not want to leave Nagasaki, Ogata does so with the narrative, patiently held with Minako, like him, fully assisted by Tanako's underestimates but highly effective performance, she follows - whether she has fallen with her aunt (Misako Watanabe) with her aunt to be single, or when they have the innumerable footprints of their hilly village to disperse milk - as she and Kaita gradually that keeps them apart for years. Such unhindered development should not suit viewers weaned on fast narratives, but for the rest, it is a hearty introspection that becomes powerful and emphatic.
