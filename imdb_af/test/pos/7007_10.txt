From the first 10 seconds of Pitch Black I was addicted. I walked into this movie and thought it would be just another cheese sci-fi movie. Instead, I found a highly entertaining, side-by-side seat, an exciting action movie. The movie goes beyond your basic special effects movie. The actors are wonderful, Radah Mitchell (High Art, Love and others.) Like Fry is really a joy to watch on the screen, while Vin Diesel as Riddeck is so fascinating that you just die to hear him speak again. <Br /> <br /> The appearance of the movie is breathtaking, the contrast of blues, yellows and oranges due to the three different suns is wonderful. Followed by the full darkness of the nightfall. I would highly recommend a lover of Alien movies or Radha Mitchell (which is why I am going to see it) to watch this movie. I'm sure at the end you'll look at the dark in a whole new way.
