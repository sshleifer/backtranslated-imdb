Have the pleasure of watching a new independent movie called "Half empty." I usually go with my husband to the local theater and feel as if we are being held up to the latest Sequel, or Prequel who throws Hollywood with us. It was different and amazing ?? So much more entertaining than anything Hollywood uses to use millions of ads. When my husband and I go to the movies, will we be entertained? and "Half empty" just as well as the movie did it in a clever way that made me feel like my trip to the movie was worth it. It is a funny, human and surprising sometimes musical story that cleverly entertaines in its simplicity. I especially enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom. It's almost like an operetta. That particular scene reminded me of a scene in the Phantom of the Opera when 4 of the artists not only sang, in a friendly retort against each other. I'm not a movie force but this movie is nicer than any other great studio movie I've seen lately. It's silly, funny, entertaining and amusing. Totally delicious ?? what I expect from movies, but rarely do they deliver "Half empty."
