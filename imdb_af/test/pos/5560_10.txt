Farscape is the best sci-fi show time, for one main reason, everything about the efforts of the show is doing very well. From a technical point of view, the music is original and perfectly equipped for the show. The special effects are abundant and higher quality than almost any other thing you will see on your TV. The acting is also good, too many shows today use only the American market of actors for their performances. Remember the first time you saw the matrix and you said, wow, where did that agent Smith come from? It's the same feeling you look at Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Lani Tupu, Virginia Hey, and especially Wayne Pygram. These Aussies are wonderful and come through in this great show. <br /> <br /> The plot is unmatched. The next closest thing I can think of is Babylon 5 during the shadow war seasons, but it does. It is a good surprise to look again at all the episodes sequentially, the intricacies of the interpersonal relationships of the characters being well written and executed. The overall plot is original and thoroughly entertaining. I'm always itching for the next show. <br /> <br /> The comic episodes are funny, the drama episodes touch and the action ranges are tense. The start of the second season had some great comic episodes that made me laugh out loud, something that seldom happens while watching television that is not South Park, Sealab 2021 or Seinfeld. The drama is even harder, whether Crichton meets his mother or faces the characters of your death, everything is done with heart and intensity. Finally, it goes without saying that the action is tops. This is sci-fi. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of science fiction in the slightest, if you enjoy good television, if you like good serialized plot, you owe it to yourself to watch Farscape. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Ben Browder owns.
