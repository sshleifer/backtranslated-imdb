I have to admit that I was a great fan of almighty David "The Hoff" Hasselhoff since playing in the 80-year-old TV series Knight Rider. Whether it is his extraordinary debut as a libidinous high school basketball player in the hilariously raunchy "Revenge of the Cheerleaders" or his brilliant portrayal of a brave prince in the schlocky sci-fi jewel "Starcrash", the Hoff proved time and again. that He is a simple, shameful underrated actor. The Hoff is here as Gary, a cynical and skeptical photographer who, along with his repressed virgin friend Leslie (handsome brunette Leslie Cummings), is investigating a dilapidated haunted house located on a remote island off the coast of Massachussetts. Throughout the centuries, they do research on witchcraft and the hotel's last owner was an actress who allegedly practiced the black arts. A well-known family also points out on site to check the hotel. Soon, all sorts of people start off in various horrible ways through the mysterious Lady in Black (an effective horrible Hildegard Knef). <br /> <br /> Allowed, the rest of the cast gives the Hoff a run for his money: Everyday Linda Blair projects her simply lovely flair as a spooky pregnant woman who gets in the wind to get busy ( natch!), legendary jazz singer Annie Ross taps it with a cheerful aplomb as a sniffing old bat (poor Annie gets excitedly alive after she has closed her lips and hung her upside down in a chimney), and the beautiful blonde Catherine Hickland is harvesting significant sexual appeals from every hasty pore as a lusty slut. Fabrizio Laurenti's skillful direction, a properly creepy atmosphere, Gianlorenzo Battaglia's slippery cinematography (the Steadicam's fluid tracing shots are especially nice), the nice special effects, Carlo Maria Cordio and Randy Miller's enthusiastic, scary score, and the gory, sadistic violence is all in the end. But in the end it is the incredibly dynamic and charismatic presence of one and only Hoff, who makes this choice a piece of Italian horror cheese such a winner. He takes off his shirt once (hubba hubba!), Is sprayed with blood and - - WARNING: Great * SPOILER * before - even at a pleasant creepy end. Produced by none other than Joe D'Amato, this photo overall prizes as good, messy fun.
