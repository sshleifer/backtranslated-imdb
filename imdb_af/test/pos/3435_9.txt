`Skenbart 'is one of the funniest films not only to come from Peter Dalle, but also from the Swedish film industry itself. It's a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere of the days before Christmas in December 1945, which does it very well. Almost the entire plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train, a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, killers, alcoholics and the failed literature critic 'Gunnar' was played by the famous actor Gustav Hammarsten in Sweden. The lead role 'Gunnar' is the kind of person who, although his intentions are for the best, seems to be dragging everyone close to him in a very strange way in a disaster and a lively hell, especially for a Finnish war homemade , wounded soldier played by the extremely funny comedian Robert Gustafsson. On the train is also a doctor who cheats with his mistress on his wife. Together they planned to kill the doctor's wife traveling with the same train without any knowledge of her men's intentions. Will the doctor's wife kill the plans to kill her and will all survive the unfortunate fellowman 'Gunnar'?
