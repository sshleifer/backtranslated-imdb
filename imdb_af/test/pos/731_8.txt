As a later patron of the row-in-theaters (1970s-1980s), there are many movies I've seen and forgotten. This is one I could never forget. Despite the low budget, movie style of exploitation, the story was done very well. The isolated therapy asylum, where patients work out their fantasies to help heal their phsycosis, the accidental murder of the chief doctor, just as the new nurse arrives at the scene, the (supposed) assistant doctor taking over, the various crazy patents, revelation that the assistant doctor is actually a patient himself and ultimately the salvation of the young nurse by the simple Sam, who murdered everyone else in the house, so that she could escape unharmed, made for a great story keeping the film together. I emphasized the word STORY because it makes a good or good movie. No matter how much blood, gore, nudity, sexual issue or outrageous behavior you put into a movie, if the story isn't good, then the movie isn't good. The movie credits show clips of all the actors, including the old hag with the final line telling you to come out and never come back, which is a good ending to this movie. If it's on video / DVD, watch it and enjoy it.
