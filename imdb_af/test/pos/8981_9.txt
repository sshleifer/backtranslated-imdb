It doesn't happen very often, but sometimes one man can make a difference - a big difference. <br /> <br /> George Crile's best seller, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, is a fascinating and eye-opening account of the most unlikely "difference maker" imaginable. A relatively dark Congressman of the Second District of Texas, "Good Time Charlie", was more known for his style of freedom than his libertarian law. Equal and debauchery (even for a politician), Charlie Wilson served his constituency well, because the good people of Lufkin just wanted two things, their guns and left alone. It's Easy Street filled with its facial beauty, known as Charlie's Angels. <br /> <br /> When asked why his entire office staff consisted of attractive young aides, his response is a classic, "You can teach them to type, but you can't teach them tits not growing. "No reason for that. <br /> <br /> But even the most ravenous rapscallion has a conscience that underlies somewhere, and for Charlie Wilson, the unimaginable atrocities committed in Afghanistan have betrayed him to gather his entire political skills to the total defeat of the Russian army and possibly even accelerate the end of the Cold War. Know chance, huh? <br /> <br /> Under the capable direction of Mike Nichols and a clever, quirky script by Adam Sorkin, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that backs the scenes of three colorful characters from Charlie's Team. <br /> <br /> The screensaver consists of three wonderful actors with four (4) Academy Awards and nine (9) nominations between them. Charlie is beautifully depicted by Tom Hanks in a solid, slightly understated fashion that is under his best work in years. He is assisted, attacked and remembered by Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston social site played by the still-gritty Julia Roberts. Hey, why did the bikini scene tell the world differently? With all accounts, Mrs. Roberts does well and keeps her own, but the script never gives us a hint of why Kabul and the country are so important to her character. Perhaps the two Afghan dogs usually know from her side - but we as an audience never do. Regarding the third member of the "team", Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene he appears as Gust Aurakotos, a clever street maker (ie not Ivy League graduate). CIA score content that knows the score - both in the agency's board and in Wilson's bedroom. <br /> <br /> For the Mujahideen to be successful, the main help the US can offer is the ability to shoot the dreaded MI-21 helicopter gunships that govern the air. It takes money, a lot of money, and finally, "Charlie's Team" becomes secretive in Congress to fund the $ 1bn for advanced weapons to arm the Afghan rebels. These include top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets, as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices. Nasty, nasty things. <br /> <br /> That kind of multi-billion dollar illegal activity can take place behind the doors of Congress is really worrying. Every American must watch this movie or read this book because it sees a really scary aspect of the political political scene that is rarely seen outside the walls of our own government. Oh mom, I wish it wasn't. <br /> <br /> Although the initial outcome for "Team Charlie" was an unqualified success, the unimaginable, unforeseen end result is that these sophisticated weapons are now being used. against our troops by the Taliban and others. Since the funding was completely "hidden", the young generation in this part of the world had no idea of ​​the fall of Soviet repression and the end of Russian barbarism was the direct result of US intervention. Yes, as soon as the Russians left, we did help - zip for schools, zip for infrastructure, zip up to maintaining meaningful relationships with the Afghan people. Consequently, the overall result is an unfortunate disaster. It's like the forerunner of the "Mission Accomplished." <br /> <br /> As Nichol's film shows so remarkably, "The ball you put in place can keep bouncing off even after you lose interest in it." Mike Krzyzewski knows it, Eva Longoria Parker knows it, Little Lateesha in Lafayette knows this but the typical American politician. So we're going from good guys to bad guys because we couldn't let the world know we're the good guys. Talk about a Vang-22 (another Mike Nichols movie). Perhaps Charlie Wilson said it best: "We bought the endgame." <br /> <br /> Weather.
