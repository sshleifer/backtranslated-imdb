In Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's "Strangers On A Train", Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of ​​two killings. The rather intrusive Anthony suggests he can kill Haines' unfaithful wife and Haines can kill Anthony's dominant father. The lack of connection between the murderer and the victim in each case must ensure that both crimes remain unsolved. The tenor of the conversation leaves the more comfortable Haines with the impression that the proposal is not quite serious. Complications occur later when Anthony Mrs. Haines's wife murdered in an amusement park and then pursued Haines to keep his side of the bargain. <br /> <br /> The differences between the two men are clear from the beginning. Haines is a professional tennis player, respectful and fairly modest about his achievements while Anthony's life is going nowhere and he admits to being thrown out of three colleges for drinking and gambling. Haines is in a relationship with a senator's daughter whom he wants to marry. Anthony interpreted it as a cynical maneuver on Haines' part to give himself a shortcut to a career. The character differences are also visually enhanced. Anthony often lives in shady areas and travels in a boat called "Pluto", while Haines is often seen from the more fortunate perspective provided by low camera angles. <br /> <br /> There are a few striking visual sequences such as: - <br /> <br /> (1) The murder of Haines wife shown by the reflection of her glasses falling to the ground while struggling to free herself from Anthony. <br /> <br /> (2) The depiction of Anthony alone, dressed in black and very small against the large white Jefferson Memorial building. <br /> <br /> (3) The event where all the spectators at a tennis match move their heads in harmony follows the action, while one head (Anthony's) remains cold in a position to watch Haines. <br /> <br /> (4) The scene where the roundabout is wildly out of control and eventually spectacularly collapses. <br /> <br /> Frequent use is made of "double" throughout the story, for example, Haines and Anthony were originally introduced as 2p. Flights from feet come from their taxis and go to the train. As the train pulls out of the station, there are 2 sets of tracks each offering a choice of 2 ways forward. The 2 men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double whiskeys. The Hitchcock cameo sees him struggling aboard the train with a double bass. Haines feels double crossed when his wife waives on a deal they had for her to see a lawyer to arrange a divorce. Haines's wife goes to the 2 boyfriend's amusement park. When Anthony confronts her before the murder, he lights up his cigarette lighter and produces 2 reflections in her glasses. Anthony later became very upset when he met the Senator's younger daughter whom he considered a double for Haines wife. Anthony also feels double crossed when Haines refuses to continue with the second murder. When traveling alone in a train to Metcalf, Haines sees 2 men in the same wagon who accidentally kick their feet in the same way that he and Anthony had. <br /> <br /> The action in the movie goes out to a big pace and the performances of Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (as Senator's younger daughter) are particularly strong.
