1891: Stalwart, moral righteous military doctor Lieutenant Claude de Ross (solid Claudio Cassinelli) and several other shipwreck survivors were on a remote tropical island fist-controlled by the relentless and sadistic Edmund Rackham (played excellently for the delicious slender hilt by Richard Johnson), who lives on the island with the festive Amanda Martin (a voluptuous show by overwhelming Barbara Bach) and her ominous biologist father Professor Ernest Martin (a wonderfully dull depiction of Joseph Cotten). In addition, De Ross discovers that Professor Martin is in control of a dangerous breed of fish cattle exploited by Rackham as slave labor. Director / co-author Sergio Martino tells the lively and absorbing story at a constant, funny pace, offering a palpable exposition of the lush and remote tropical environment. He does an expert job creating a creepy and mysterious atmosphere in the ghostly opening of the third, also decorating it with a nice line of dry humor, leading the exciting action-packed climax with a considerable rip-roaring aplomb. While the central premise is obviously inspired by "The Island or Dr. Moreau," the story is given many fresh and intrigue because of Martino's inventive story of such diverse elements as voodoo, the lost underwater city of Atlantis, mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption , buried treasure, unscrupulous genetic experiments, and even some exciting rough fiction between Ross and Rackham during the exciting conclusion in a completely dynamic, imaginative and often extremely entertaining whole. The sound that plays through the solid role qualifies as another significant plus. Cassinelli makes for a nice hero, Johnson sets up his juicy villain with a lot of lap-banging aplomb, Bach rates as a proper pick-up girl in need, and there are neatly supporting contributions by Beryl Cunningham as sinister voodoo priestess Shakira Franco Iavarone, superstition Jose, and Roberto Posse as troublemaker Peter. Giancarlo Fernando's sumptuous widescreen cinematography offers a wealth of striking visual arts, while Luciano Michelini's throbbing tribal score becomes the funky place. The amphibious humanoic fisherman creatures are also beautiful. A very fun movie.
