I love this movie, almost as much as the original version! Which teen does NOT go through what Scamp is going to find independence by getting more and more distant from your family? The songs were nice and the character designs were wonderful. .Lady and Tramp look almost exactly like they did in the original feature. They did a good job on the voices of the two, and also the fact that the original voice actors are probably dead. But I think they should have given more lines to Lady, Annette, Colette and Daniel. Oh well, at least they had common sense to keep the same landscape of the original film.
