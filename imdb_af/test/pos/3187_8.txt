I'm trying to buy a DVD / VHS copy of the movie somewhere, "Isn't that shocking?" I was 7 years old when I saw this movie and I lived in town where it was filmed. Some of my family's items were used in the movie as props and some of my friend's homes were used in some of the screens. The filming took place well in the town and surrounding community. I first saw the original movie and I'd like to get a copy, and now I can show my family the movie. I did extensive inquiries online with no luck and I wondered if anyone would have any ideas for trying to get a copy of this movie?
