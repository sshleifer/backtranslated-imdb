It seems to me that many people do not know that Blade is actually a superhero movie that is the same as X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the containers. What all these heroes (and in the case of the X-Men heroes group) thought was that they were all created in the wonderful world of wonder. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who raced vampires because of a personal resentment and eventually came up with Dracula himself and he lacked a better word boring. So, indeed, it sows that the character is erected and never actually used in the Wonder universe. At least until he was rediscovered. <br /> <br /> David Goyer had a genius stroke when he took Blade's character and turned him into a leather-clad dark knight. He can't take all the credit, and many of these should also go to Stephen Norrington, who is the best of character with his clear visual style. The Blade character (Wesley Snipes) is pretty amazing in this movie and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness. Snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in extracting the duality and inner demons of the character. However, he is a pretty rigid actor, both in voice and in posture, and is just interesting enough for one movie (clearly seen from the inferior sequels). Kris Kristofferson is also good and really brings the pained character from Whistler to life with energy and sense of timing. However, N'Bushe Wright is rather weak as a leading lady who makes her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is pretty funny and manages many with a minor character. German, Udo Kier, must also be mentioned, as he brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race, probably born from his experiences of playing Dracula. Stephen Dorf offers the best acting in the film and his cool performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screenshots I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story is good and I feel, renewing the vampire genre (something not done since Robert Rodrigues' From Dusk Till Dawn) by adding many contemporary elements and retaining the comic book feel . By saying that the movie has a comic book feel, it doesn't mean the movie is unrealistic. Far from it. There was a lot of effort to make the movie look as real as possible. Including the effects that are pretty good for their time. I found that the vampire "fabric" is a very good touch. Instead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies, Norrington has chosen to spontaneously breastfeed the vampires, which looks good. The fact that overall effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film that otherwise fell flat on his face. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before, Norrington has a very clear visual style that has set itself apart from the directors of the next Blade movies. Del Toro is almost as skilled, but I prefer Norrington's style. His style gives the film a very special look, but most importantly it gives the film atmosphere. A very tense dark atmosphere that works well in keeping with the main character and story. Along with the visual style, the music that works well adds a lot to the movie's atmosphere. <br /> <br /> All in all, Blade is a very entertaining movie that probably had an 8 of me, but a few annoying errors (which can't be disclosed without spoiling the movie, enough to say, many of them are near the end of the movie), the movie with a high 7 should fix. <br /> <br /> 7/10
