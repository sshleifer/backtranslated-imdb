This was the first movie I gave a 10 to years. If there was ever a movie that needed mouth-to-mouth to promote, it is. A $ 4 Mil box is a shame. People don't know what it's all about. If you have an appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, this is just the reason to see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and that's good too. You hear books and movies realizing that they're dealing with salvation. After you have seen it, you will never be able to forgive such a trivial use of the word. Yes, it is neat, sexy, home truth, bizarre and in your face. Isn't it the best reason to watch a movie? Those who get my meaning won't stay away to see this week.
