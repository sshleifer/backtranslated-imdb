so. I was totally in love with this movie. Gaga for that, even with all his plots ... but the one thing I really found disturbing was the connection between the two best friends in Tim and Kyle. While the author of the movie gave us such a brand new moment between the two, and their sexual experimentation / confusion, does he give us a plot twist that makes their half-brothers? (Although the subject was not educated in the film ... and left unexplained and inexplicable) I just thought it was in bad taste, and the fact that it wasn't even discussed is even worse. (Oops, we've created a taboo ... let's not address the situation now, because it won't really be.) Otherwise, a spectacular movie
