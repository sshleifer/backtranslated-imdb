This is one of the peripheral stories told by the Animatrix. It is not directly relevant to the war. One glorious plot of movies, but Trinity, pronounced by Carrie, appears in it. It features a private detective who is hired for big money to search for a hacker named Trinity. we see his search that contains other PI's, just one he meets, which apparently got angry with his own experience trying to track the Trinity. finally he makes contact with Trinity which he assumes to be a man of course - tell in the narrative and something that puts us firmly in his own perspective despite what we already know - in a hacker classroom and solves a mystery which urges him to catch a train. he forgets his hat, but in a moment of ridicule his faithful cat throws him so absurd that it is hilarious. <br /> <br /> He meets her on the train, but the ruse is revealed when agents attack; the agents used him to get Trinity and Trinity tried to free the PIs sent to her, which he obviously does not know and which is not explicitly mentioned in the animation. Often, there are many interesting back stories, subplots, developments, etc. but don't show you more than the core story and a limited viewpoint to create an extra air of mystery and plot. <br /> <br /> Almost everything in this short is in black and white, the music is reminiscent of film noir and the cute, old-fashioned but dedicated detective is the perfect star for a film noir title. The trivia section of this title's entry on IMDb also provides some references to this title for hard-boiled literature, something that also lends it, a genre of mysteries for detectives, gangsters, etc. which is easy and challenging in challenging conflicts. Animated appetite by Studio 4 Â° C and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, this is a pleasant variation on the regular matrix story.
