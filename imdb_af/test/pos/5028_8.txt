It makes it pretty much ... corny. MacDowell's inability to act is sometimes painful, and Hurt needs money to take such muted roles, but I still enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Why? In a single word, Travolta. He is BIG in this movie. However, I can't give the movie a high score, but it certainly does get better than it seems to be.
