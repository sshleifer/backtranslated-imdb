This was on strange film. I liked the adventure of it, though it was aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character killed a federal officer. Then he is on the run a refugee. They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. They seem to have just made a movie for a more mature audience or made it more family-friendly. <br /> <br /> This was on strange movie. I liked the adventure of it, though it was aimed at children.
