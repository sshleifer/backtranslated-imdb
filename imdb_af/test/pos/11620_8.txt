"Subconscious cruelty" should be one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Sometimes it is extremely grim and greedy, so supporters of politically correct mainstream horror refuse may not bother. The movie mixes many amazing visuals with many sleaze and gore.It is very strange, dirty and disturbing, so fans of bizarre theater will not be disappointed. My favorite segment of "Unconscious Cruelty" is "Human Larvae" which shows us a distorted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister. The birthplace is particularly nasty and not easily forgotten. The last segment "Right Brain / Martyrdom" should be considered believed. It is incredibly hard and defamatory with scenes of genital mutilation and creepy torture. We see Jesus Christ caught by three naked women who mutilate him, ripen meat from his chest, lick a wound on his knee, and cut on him. There is also a Jesus image with a swastika projection. Subconscious cruelty is an unforgettable movie to be seen by fans of extreme theater. Look it out.
