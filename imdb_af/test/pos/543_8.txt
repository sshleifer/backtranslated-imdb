Girl movie? Of course .... been done before? Many times .... Predictable? Yes ..... Worth watching? You bet! I was delighted with Sarandon and Portman's portrayals of other stock characters in a well-known story line. I'm a big fan of mother / daughter stories. What makes the difference between the good and the swakes is the achievements and character development. Although not the BEST of his genre, I will buy it and watch it again. I felt the characters were credible and the acting was better.
