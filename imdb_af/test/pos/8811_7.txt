Cardiff, Valais. A lot of 5 friends are deeply bored in this town. There is Jip working in a clothing store. Coop, an easy DJ. Nina, inseparable from her best friend, Lulu and Moff. The week is hell for them and they are just waiting for one thing: the weekend. By now they have come out to a nightclub and to the sound of technology, no music, they experience different drugs, especially ecstasy. Then they usually go to a friend's party. At the end of this great time on Sunday, the feelings are as follows: fatigue, melancholy, just the memory of a crazy night ... Surfing the wave of the notorious success of "Trainspotting" (1996), this debut film written and directed by Justin Kerrigan brings and develops a new variation on the idea of ​​hedonism. That means: having fun as much as possible, knowing that you have a short time. Indeed, as I wrote before, for the 5 main characters of the movie, the week is hell and the weekend is the only time they can free themselves and have a wild time without the single touch (except, Jip in one sequentially speaking The positive aspects of the shooting: you are numb, you are not pressured, you are like an astronaut orbiting the earth, Kerrigan's relentless affirmative style addresses the spirit of hardship and freedom of care of the 5 main players from as much as possible from a hedonistic week-end, in addition to getting the festive atmosphere in which his movie baths, Kerrigan is not afraid to include dream series that represent his characters' fantasy or embarrassment. Human Traffic '(1999) also served by a special bouncy soundtrack.The amount? A perfect symbiosis between the sound and the music. Eventually this week-end euphoria presents the opportunity to create an Ordinary drop image of the popular social classes, studied the British cinema a lot. <br /> <br /> Notwithstanding, when a movie (conscientious or not) uses the fame of another well-known one, it rarely coincides with the luster of its predecessor. "Human traffic" is in this state. There is little ingenuity at the narrative structure level and the introduction of characters and one can notice some useless deviations (Jip who goes into the nightclub in the manager's office and tells him a cock-and-bull story so Moff is able to enter the club, but it is not used because the latter succeeds in getting around without problems). One can also blame Kerrigan for reflecting on the dramatic sides that the story can take. His film can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia, and the dramatic connotations of this second pole are not practically explored. It's a pity! It could have conveyed the following message: even in the happiest moments, there can be something terrible preparation that they can flop. The same remark can also be said if Coop is jealous because Nina is an old spoil. <br /> <br /> It may not be the last big movie of the nineties, as it is billed on the DVD cover, but "Human Traffic" is taken as a good and vivid little movie featuring the styles exchanging fashions of the late twentieth century, a will to have fun without misconduct and problems. An ideal movie to start any party or before going to a club.
