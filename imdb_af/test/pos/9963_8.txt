Venice, in 1596. You are separated from the good Christians. Basanio, a young but poor Venetian, loves the righteous Portia, who is a rich heir. So he came to his friend, a dealer, who named Antonio three thousand ducats to travel to Belmont. suggest Portia. All the ships and merchandise of Antonio are at sea. So he turns to the lender Shylock, one of the Jewish faith. He doesn't like Antonio because he splashes on his face. He offers Antonio a three-month loan with no interest, but if he doesn't pay the money at that time, he will have a pound of his flesh. Also Shylock's daughter, Jessica, with Christian Lorenzo. The Venice dealer is based on William Shakespeare's play, which is thought to have written. between 1596 and 1598. I read the scene last summer and now I saw the movie, made in 2004 by Michael Radford. I like the play, and I don't quite agree with the accusations of being anti-Semitic. Jewish character does not appear as an inhumane monster, even th He is ready to cut a piece of Antonio's flesh. There is a lot of depth in his character, which comes out in his speech, asking, "If you bump us, we don't bleed?" and so on. There are many more people in Shylock's character than in one of Antonio's, which boasts the good Jew. All Pacino is unbeatable as Shylock. He gives such a strong performance. Jeremy Irons is also fantastic like Antonio. Collins Collins is. most beautiful and brilliant in the role of Portia. Zuleikha Robinson does good work as Jessica, and Charlie Cox as Lorenzo is also very good. Kris Marshall plays Gratiano, and he does a good job. In the role of Nerissa we see Heather Goldenhersh. Mackenzie Crook plays Launcelot Gobbo.As Shakespeare usually plays, this one also contains the most brilliant dialogue. The film paints a fantastic depiction of the era.It deals with some major issues, in a Shakespeare way.
