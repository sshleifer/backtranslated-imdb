The combination of wonderful special effects and oscar worthy plays makes the Vindicator one of the most important scientific films of the past year. For some reason yet unknown to me, this gem has been found in a bargain, why some worthless people have the right to make a modern classic dirty by trading at a bargain, is beyond me. I have never been so shocked by a man in can of foil and random outbursts of fire. Forget about Terminator, Robocop, Aliens, and other movies that have just broken this masterpiece, the vindicator is an unstoppable force.
