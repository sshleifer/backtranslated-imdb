I think this movie is actually entertaining, though not some features that are essential to these types of movies. First, when Doug and Chappy start their mission, they take off with F-16B, and during the battle scenes, they are sending F-16A. The second thing I don't like about this movie is the ever-repeating F-16 she has the right to escape from missiles. Why haven't chaff and flare been shown in any movie yet? Thirdly, when you almost see the F-16 almost empty, many missiles appear again ... the models used to simulate the destroyed aircraft are also not good. However, I think the use of IAI Kfir as an opponent aircraft was very good, much better than the F-5 shown in Top Gun (but this movie is not as good as that masterpiece). <br /> <br /> A funny movie, I love planes and I've seen it more than 3 times.
