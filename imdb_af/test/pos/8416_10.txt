It was very refreshing to watch this beautiful movie. The director maintained focus on the major without risking the side plots (the doctor's family or stories of other hospital patients), which is so typical of Bollywood compound products. He kept the story simple to understand and made sure that all the actors were true to the characters they were supposed to portray. The rustic manners of the grandfather in the clinic, the cold and ominous behavior of the surgeon, the zeal of the social worker, gave the movie a sense of authenticity. I am also pleased that the director has not been tempted to add songs or special effects and reduce it to the level of Anand or Safar. A few scenes towards the end of the movie, such as the boy who visits other blind children and a blind worker's workplace and also the final scene where the boy claps at the sound of splashes and birds chirping, make sure your eyes is misty. /> <br /> Many Bollywood players do not realize that Oscar committee members appreciate the simplicity of the subject and the authenticity and shortness of the movie more than the brilliance and brilliance. Shwaas is definitely a better name than Lagaan, which deals with a topic that has already been beaten. No MPAA member will willingly suffer from 4 hours of jingoistic drama and many songs and dances. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to more movies by director Sandeep Sawant in the future.
