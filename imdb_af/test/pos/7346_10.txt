The relationship between the main characters I thought was very realistic. How the two are ultimately involved is credible. It doesn't have the whole "oh yes right" that most Hollywood movies have. Not to mention how they caught the sexy, beautiful and painful side of the trapeze. I am a trapeze student and I love being shown how difficult it is on the body, hands and yes, that dust fire is brutal! Definitely a must see for the relationship as well as the art made in the movie. I love it! I'm happy with the way the movie ended, but I definitely wanted to see more. Make sure you stay through the credits for a special surprise. Great scene!
