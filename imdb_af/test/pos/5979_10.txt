Shepitko is the wife of Russian filmmaker Elem Klimov, who did not deliver the best-known 1984 film, COME AND SEE, widely regarded as one of the most realistic war films. This is, according to me, the striking poetic intensity. inner complexity of this even larger Russian film, which not only examines the graphic outer horrors, but finds truly inspiring images that focus on individuals or small groups of characters that reflect the absolute madness in these people. Its end is simply inspiring. Bullets fly and bodies die in a rifle guard over the opening credits where the intensity of the film is never generated throughout the course of time. It focuses on grim faces, worn-out soldiers with nothing to eat, a feared population of occupation, hungry children with petrified mothers, all throwing into a vast landscape of endless white snow. As taps fly (1957), it has a Russian army in refuge, a traumatizing shock early in the war when they were almost wiped out. The Russian countryside is dominated by German Nazis who terrorize the citizens, steal what food they have and force them to become their informants eyes and ears. Which Russian soldiers are hidden under the bushes, but are forced to send food expeditions to neighboring farms. This film follows two soldiers who are on a near impossible mission from the beginning, as there is little food left over in winter. One is healthy and fit, Vladimir Gostyukhin as Rybak, while the other, Boris Plotnikov as Sotnikov, is delayed by a tuberous sounding cough and finally a bullet in his leg which immediately causes him to die, but his partner saves him completely . Pushing through the knee-deep snow and crawling on some points, with insufficient protection against the harsh elements, such as so many other Russian films, nature itself becomes their most difficult enemy. <br /> <br /> Spoilers !! Everything is reduced to a matter of survival. When they reach their destination, the farm was demolished and left in a rubbish state, which moves to the German occupied territory where the next farm is manned by an elderly Soviet co-worker who fears Nazi retaliation. The partisan soldiers think him a coward, but go on, where they are eventually imprisoned and brought to a Nazi camp in a nearby town and held captive, along with a proud and protective mother (Lyudmila Polyakova) they helped hide them. Tarkovsky stalwart Anatoli Solonitsyn appears as Portnov's interrogator, a Russian teacher from a nearby academy became Nazi sympathizer. Russians' torture and execution of co-Russians is the depth of war depravity and Solonitsyn is brilliant in the despicable role he is excellently suited to. From what we can see, Nazi officials are jovially close to each other. He is an outsider, even among this group, instead seen as a kind of abominable black-tapping entrepreneur who regularly sends men to their graves. The audience is not spared to see torture on Sotnikov, which offers nothing but contempt, while Rybak speaks freely and hopes to save his life, but both are condemned to die, although Rybak gets the chance to save the German Empire. as a police agent. The mother, the elderly co-worker and a child are added to this group. They spend together last night together, discussing the merits of a soldier's mission, a patriot, a mother, a coward or a co-worker. Each one is individually driven by a desperate need to survive, but Sotnikov offers himself as an unselfish example, trying to confess his guilt to save the others, where the appropriate chosen title reflects his spiritual salvation. <br /> <br /> The next morning, Portnov looks generously amused and ridiculed for their sudden willingness to speak, but saves no one except Rybak. He changes sides to keep his life, and rationalizes in his mind that, if he lives, he has at least a chance to escape. But there is no escape from this concern. What happens is shown with beautiful delicacy and poetic grace, as we testify to the betrayal of the war without a single shot being fired, as the execution is changed by suspension in a public spectacle, where the residents are at the point of " a gun is forced to testify. The pace and disturbing intensity of this movie is relentless, as there is never a moment without threat, suddenly shot by Vladimir Chukhnov (who died in the same car accident as Shepitko), with perfectly compound landscapes and many camera movements. It is close to portraits, especially those of a fiery young boy at the end who see the convicted men making a surrealistic connection with the next generation without any words spoken, emphasized by Alfred's psychologically horrible music Shnittke who, like the Transcendent, but furious, disturbing monolith music from Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). The sound design of this film is highly advanced and uniquely modern, with the use of screen sound constantly exposing the raw nerves of every moment, dogs barking, wind blowing, bullet fire, near Nazi conversations in untranslated Germans or sadistically laughing at their helplessness, what just blow up the frightening tension to insane heights. In many ways, like Dreyer's THE PASSION OF JANE OF ARC (1928), the full insanity is exposed here, the inexorable realizing that you have no choice, but you have to make one anyway. The nightmare inner thoughts at the end are spoken wordlessly, where the nobility speaks of the dead volumes, where voices in the heads of life remain like an explosion of eternal echoes, but only silence fills the sharp, wintery air with a sadness reverence. and a profound sense of loss.
