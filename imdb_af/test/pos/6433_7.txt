I rarely watch short films as they only appear on late night television and are not made known enough to know which short films are worth it. Since the room is an extra feature on The Hitcher DVD, it has given me a great opportunity to see a high quality short with Rutger Hauer in excellent shape. <br /> <br /> Artistic shot in black and white, The Room explores a man's obsession with a room he has overtaken in the early stages of adulthood and expressed in a documentary / maintenance style. The dialogue is very poetic, typical of a man expressing his feelings for a woman, but is also accompanied by barriers and occasional shortcomings in fluency. It adds great realism and depth to Hauer's performance, which is perfect as an eccentric man with most of his life behind him. <br /> <br /> The piano music Harry (Hauer) hears from the room is constantly in the background and Hauer proves he is more than just a psychotic Hollywood bad guy with this role and perfectly his more sensitive side show. Mattijn Hartemink is also effective in the flashback scenes like young Harry with a silent role. He shows how affected he is by the music and his disappointment when it gets away. <br /> <br /> The end is prophetic and leaves you in a reflective mood longer than many feature-length movies. A very good effort.
