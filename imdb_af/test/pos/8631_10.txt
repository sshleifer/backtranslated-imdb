Although copies of this movie are hard to find, if you can get it, get it! !!! I believe it was, except In The Navy, Abbott and Costello's only musical. Although they have twisted the plot a little, (I've never heard a version where the butcher acted with him), you still enjoy the tribulations of the slightly idiotic, but lovely Jack, and the greedy butcher, Mr. Dinklepuss. A little reminiscent of DuBarry Was a lady, this turbulent movie will roll you to the floor - just to get up and dance like Lou Costello sings. (I don't know why they didn't do it in other movies.)
