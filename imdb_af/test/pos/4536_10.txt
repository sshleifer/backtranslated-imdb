This is one of my favorite comedy movies. Chris Farley is hilarious like the accident, and David Spade is perfect for playing the straight man to Farley. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between the two is brilliant. The scene where the two of them are in the car is a classic at the Superstar at The Carpenters. <br /> <br /> Chris Farley was a great comic actor who had incredible potential - unfortunately he will be missed. /> <br />
