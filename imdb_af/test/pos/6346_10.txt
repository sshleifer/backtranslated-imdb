I saw Lonesome Dove, Dead Man's Walk, and The Streets of Laredo, and now The Return to Lonesome Dove. If you are hungry for more after watching Lonesome Dove, it will fill your stomach. Great thrown, good story. Definitely a second to Lonesome Dove. I will buy this movie to add to my collection. This is the best, or at least my favorite performance by Jon Voight. He is Captain Call. Lou Gossett Jr plays Isom Pickett is not someone I messed with, he's a bad ass with perspective. William Peterson is also doing a good job. Rick Schroder is back as Newt with an anxiety-filled show reminding me of his stint on NYPD Blue. My only problem with this movie (and it's actually stickers) is that I had the impression that Call was "the first man to graze cattle in Montana," and it is clear that Dunnigan had been there for a while. A little inconsistent, but easily overlooked if you lose yourself in the fantastic story. I especially love the apparent character growth of Jasper Fant and July Johnson. I watched this movie several times and am ready for another sequel.
