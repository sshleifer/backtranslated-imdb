What looks like a whimsical Porky's rip-off seems like a ticking film about being young and in love. <br /> <br /> The story is about three friends, Gary, Ricky and David, spending their weekend school hours looking for sex. When a new girl arrives in town, Gary's head falls over her heels in love. <br /> <br /> The movie goes from a messy sex movie to an investigation into teen security. It's funny and sad at the same time. It never quite gives the love story formula made in every movie. You know the guy meets girl, husband loses girl, you get girl back in the final frame formula. That formula is set aside after the man has met. Maybe that's why I liked the film so much. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is especially good and the end is a definite tear. It can also be one of the most realistic ends I've ever seen in a love story. <br /> <br />
