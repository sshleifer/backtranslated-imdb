Frankly, I just enjoy watching James Caan. Great actor. With such simplicity you know exactly what he thinks. A real pro. <br /> <br /> I watched the show from the beginning and found it different. This is something unique in Hollywood - a new idea - not a 3rd version of a current hit show. /> <br /> I also find the show fun and exciting. I like the pacing - you are never bored. I especially like the riddle in every episode - the way it unfolds. I am a great mysterious fan and have read many of the great secrets, but I find the stories well written and the outcome is seldom obvious. Also very interesting to me, probably because I am not a player, are the various disadvantages that the 'gamblers' pop up. I was fascinated by the number of schemes people robbed Las Vegas. The music: I like the music at the top of the show. Perfect for the show ... Set the tone and atmosphere. Just wonderful. And of course there is James Caan.
