It's a very cute movie. I had a massive overnight (girls 10-11) and they absolutely loved this movie. They watched it twice! Don't let the rating fool you. You need to be 13 or older to evaluate a movie on IMDb, which eliminates the movie's target audience. If you have a girl (or son) between 7 and 13, I guarantee they will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Kind of a generation overturned "Notting Hill" in high school. Aaron Carter plays a well-known pop star who fails his private teaching classes. His mother sent him to a "regular" high school with the ultimatum, "passing high school or no summer tour." With the advice of his manager (former pop star David Cassidy), he is friendly with the smartest girl in the school (Alana Austin) with plans to deceive her. Search for the humorous and informative Janitor (another former pop star Lief Garrett).
