I brought my brain to another movie that reminds me of this one. I really can't come with one. I think that's because most movies dealing with this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style. There are some fantastic kids out there, all better known as the US TM, but I'm sure, but they're meant to provide information and your emotional surface response through intellectual means. This DVD may look more intellectual in some ways, but it really isn't. Perhaps it is philosophical, but it passes the information mode and goes directly to the same place as a piece of music. It makes you feel, but sometimes you don't even know why. You are taken somewhere on a wave of feeling somewhere. If you see it, note how well it is composed. It may not be for everyone, but it is for anyone looking for a rare cinematic creation that respects you.
