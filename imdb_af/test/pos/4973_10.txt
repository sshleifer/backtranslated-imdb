It's a wonderful Western story with great veteran actors who made this movie great fun to see and enjoy. Glenn Ford, (John Parrish), "Midway", 76 tries to play a low key after fighting in the war and playing the role of the pacemaker for the moment. John Parrish decides the town is far too rough and tough and goes to Barbara Stanwyck, (Martha Wilkison), "Crime of Passion," 57, who is Edward G. Robinson's wife (Lee Wilkison), "The Red House", '47. Lee Wilkison offers John Parrish Fifteen Thousand Dollars for his farm and John turns off the offer. Lee Wilkson decides to change his son, Brian Keith (Cole Wilkison), "The Wind & the Lion", "75 in more ways than one. There are romantic scenes between May Wynn (Caroline Vail), The Caine Mutiny (54) and John Parrish and some hot encounters with Dianne Foster (Judith Wilkison), Three Hours to Kill (54) who hates her at Lee. If you love Edward G. Robinson and Glenn Ford movies, it's a movie you want to see and enjoy from start to finish.
