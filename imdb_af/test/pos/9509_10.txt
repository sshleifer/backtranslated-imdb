I've seen movies come and go in my years and if I see a disaster movie, I hope I won't be disappointed. And with this one I was not in the least. The story of a whole country sinking into the sea was a wonderful concept written by sakyo komatsu, a novelist with intense theories on where this earth goes. In addition, the characters were, and although I am not Japanese, I didn't need a translator to give the idea of ​​how people in their most desperate needs can get together for common good. The special effects blew me away, I was literally at the edge of my seat and watched the tidal waves, lava flow and earth explosions that had to fill months of work. As for the play, I thought yes, it was at its best, emotions ran through the movie and I cried to the strictest scenes. For moviegoers, you don't have to speak Japanese or understand to watch this movie, you can get the idea and feel of every person and character to understand it well and follow it as you are there. Shed my head to Shinji Higuchi to guide it, I hope he can blow his work with another mind. As I said .... Fantastic Film.
