** 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. <br /> <br /> Another classic horror movie is made with dunder-headed teenage acting in spite of grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price movie House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage schoolgirls and makes it invaluable wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to wash the whole house, the movie is a typical classic horror remake such as Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was made later, despite creativity and the movie has just been a gore picture. Director Serra showed light enthusiasm with his direction, but still worth watching. My final rating 7/10.
