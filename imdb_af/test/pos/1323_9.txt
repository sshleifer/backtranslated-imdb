Mishima is one of the greatest films ever made. Now, I think Paul Schrader is the best scriptwriter of all time, but I don't really like the movies he did with what I saw (except this and Affliction), but it's a wonderful, disturbing and highly 3 -dimensional character study. It follows the life of Yukio Mishima, Japan's most famous author, combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories. I don't know how, but Paul Schrader manages all the artists in a very artistic way. The acting is great, so is photography, and a perfect score by Philip Glass. Although the first show is confused, it is one of the few movies that get richer with each look. Actually an underestimated jewel of a movie.
