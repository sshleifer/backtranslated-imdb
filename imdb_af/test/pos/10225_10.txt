This movie is a perfect example of Barker's cinematic gifts to the horror / monster genre. I thought this movie did a good job of keeping the feel and look of the novella and comics (or even the comics could come second, I forgot). This movie is made for Barker fans. It helps to read the book in advance, but it's not as important if you can follow a movie. I saw anyone reading this film, watching the movie and watching the movie again. You might find a new respect for the movie. I became a big fan of Barker at this movie, and after reading the book, I immediately loved the movie. There are great cameos, makeup, writing, directing, etc. in this movie. This movie does something that most monster / horror movies fail, show the monsters. They are there in full color, not hidden in shade, and take most of the screen time. Unlike other movies that use quick cuts or trick relief to hide the creature, this movie celebrates the grotesque and throws it in the front as the good man. Two thumbs on Clive. We are waiting for the thief of Altyd :)
