Oddly enough, the Independent Film Channel showed this movie a week after it showed KARATE BEAR FIGHTER - even though the bear movie was second in the trilogy and this movie was the first !!! What did they think ?! While all three of these films are thought to be based on the life of this great Kyokushin Karate master, you can't help but think they should beautify the story - especially in this first movie. Certainly, the man apparently fought and killed a bull and later a bear. He actually fought and killed many bulls during his career, but in the early fifties, at the end of the film, the hero actually fights about 60 guys and kills many of them brutally. I just can't imagine that it really happened. So I checked some and found that while many of the details are correct, some of these movies are pure stack! Yes, he killed a man in self-defense and YES he followed the widow and her son and worked for them for a year - trying to forgive them. But the end of the movie is great to watch, but swinging. To see one of his rivals get a stick through his head and all the other evil details could not have happened, otherwise the Japanese government would shut down Oyama to protect society! The film is entertaining and the battle is excellent. There are no complaints about the action or acting. The only small complaint is the camera work - which is a bit messy during some of the battle scenes. Despite this slight complaint, it's a pleasant movie. In many ways, the dream karate master theme is reminiscent of the Zatoichi movies - it's also fun to watch, but much of the exploitation is really impossible. <br /> <br /> FYI - There is an Englishman version of this movie titled "Champion of Death" and I just saw it. It's not a bad dubbing, and it was letter box (a big plus), but I still prefer the caption version.
