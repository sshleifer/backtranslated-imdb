Sergei Eisenstein's most famous film has really resisted the test of time. The story of a mutiny aboard a warship in 1905 had the feel of Soviet propaganda, but did a good job showing the conditions that led to the uprising. The scene on the Odessa steps must remain in someone's mind. <br /> <br /> Well, so, "The Battlehip Potemkin" wasn't really the first movie to use, but they did a good job here. Certainly, any movie history class should show this movie. This is a great historical drama (although I will admit that I do not know how accurate it is). A 10/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and now we had to learn that "Potemkin" should be translated as "Potyomkin".
