There is not much of a plot to this movie. There is a rich baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for negligence. Not much more than that, but .... IT'S NOT! <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter, because you have a few real actors who give their life to the dialogue, and because of the cast you have hysterically funny scenes and even if you're not laughing , you have a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Matthau plays Charley, whose wife has recently died, and who finds herself the object of several women in hospital. He is delighted to taste everything on the menu. Then he meets Anne Atkinson (Glenda Jackson), who is initially a patient in hospital (their first scene together is very funny) and then they meet again on a television panel show where they disagree on almost every topic being discussed. <br /> <br /> Charley starts like Anne and vice versa, except that she's a lot of monogamy in the men in her life (her husband was a fraudster) and they decide to give it a shot - two weeks from faithfulness. <br /> <br /> I won't give up anything else, but I want to mention the chemistry that Matthau and Jackson have on the screen. She is usually not the first person to think of a romantic middle-aged comedy, but her touch with comedy is very light and pleasant. She agrees with every step of the way through Matthau, who is more charming than ever. He doesn't have to Sensitive or mr. To play Macho to get the girl, he just has to be himself. <br /> <br /> Art Carney is a riot of himself as a practically senile doctor. The scene where the baseball team owner's ashes are buried at the home plate is invaluable. He also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with Richard Benjamin. Richard doesn't have much to do in this movie and more often than not, it's just the straight man for Carney and Matthau; The role does not estimate his considerable talents, but he had to have a good time making this comedy. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended ... 8/10 <br /> PS /> PS. FYI - Matthau presented Jackson with her first best actress Oscar, and Jackson presented Art Carney's best actor for his role in 'Harry & Tonto'.
