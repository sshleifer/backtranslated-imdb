I chose "The English Patient" for an extra credit assignment for history. I thought this movie would be incredibly boring. Instead, it became one of my favorites. It depicts life in World War II fairly accurately, and the love story is incredible. The love story made the movie so incredible. I felt this interesting feeling, passion or something. It showed me how to watch the movie over and over again. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes are wonderful actors and the way they played their characters is wonderful. Looks great together and actually seems to be in love. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie to watch as a leisure activity or an assignment.
