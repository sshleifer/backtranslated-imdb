OK, most of us agree that this is a poor remake, but at the same time it is another movie in its own right. Don't get me wrong, 'American Werewolf In London' is a better movie, but 'American Remake In Paris' is also a decent movie. <br /> <br /> First, the only real deal is the TITLE, 2 US wallpapers and WEREWOLVES. In addition to the three things, 'American Remake In Paris' stands on its own quite well, with its special combination of humor, action / adventure and horror. Most of the people who say this movie is better than the original is the youth of today's generation who think any movie made before 1990 is the total crap. While those of us who grew up in the 80's could appreciate older movies and what they added to the horror movies today. What many people do not realize is that without the old classic movies, including the B&W, horror is not present. Now I get a bit of the beaten track ... <br /> <br /> An American Werewolf In Paris is a good attempt to create a classic weather, but it will never exceed the original one. Having said that, it's still a very entertaining movie to watch and I recommend it. I give it a 7 out of 10. Perhaps it's a bit generous, but I have seen much worse attempts to try to create a classic weather.
