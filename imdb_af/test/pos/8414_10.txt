James Hacker did not expect him to be the next prime minister. Unlike in America, the party in Britain is elected, while we, Americans, vote for candidates regardless of their party. In spite of the differences, Paul Eddington CBE's ministerial performance, the premier, almost overnight, played by senior advisor, Mr Humphrey, by another knight, Nigel Hawthorne and veteran actor Derek Fowlds also returned to the scene. Instead of pleasing some people, he should please the country rather than his constituency. Now he has a hard work to do even harder than before. Now he has to approve the honors list and also regularly work with her Majesty. Hacker is not the hacking type. He's rather than the one we want and doesn't want to change and turn into a villain or an evil dictator. Now we see the Prime Minister's position and deal with all the pleasant things as well as strikes.
