I saw this movie on my local cable system under the title "Beyond Redemption". I was looking for new material to watch, as most of the reruns did not interest me one Saturday morning. I've always been a fan of Andrew McCarthy and Michael Ironside, so I chose this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Personally, I enjoyed the movie. Rich Roesing, who commented on the film spoiled for him, seeing scenes of the movie on the back of a video rental box, is well-founded. I didn't have the disappointment of knowing the movie in advance. This led me to the movie being higher than the average score listed on the page. <br /> <br /> I like teams, and this one was no exception. The movie made me guess until the end. I was surprised at the end! <br /> <br /> The moments of reflection and remembrance of past experiences by the main character during the movie just added to the tension. His responses to those memories gave the film a feel of the humanitarian but conflicting side of police work. The struggle with his faith is also a welcome addition. <br /> <br /> If you like thrilling movies, but also movies that feature on the character's personal, flexible side, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie on your local cable or satellite system's guide, watch it! <br /> <br /> However, if you are looking for a rental video, follow Rich Rush's advice and get someone to watch the video. before you see it.
