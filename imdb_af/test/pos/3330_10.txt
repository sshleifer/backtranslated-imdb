This animated short is a remake of one of Tex Avery's earlier shorts for Fred Quimby at M-G-M (Dog Gone Tired). An escaped culprit (here only known as Joe) who just broke out of Alka Fizz Prison, tries to keep one step ahead of Droopy (known as Sgt.McPoodle of the Mounties), but always manages him in one way or the other. another. It's easily one of the most split, funny shorts that rolled out of the M-G-M animation studio. It manages most to laugh at the shocked reactions Joe has when he meets McPoodle (including some equally distorted sound effects - i.e..car horns, screams, elephants, etc.). As with any Avery M-G-M, it is short, awkward, waiting for kinetic pacing (along with some nice, surrealistic siggats, that is, you are trying to run away from McPoodle and actually run off the side of the movie). Pop this one into your DVD player and laugh yourself.
