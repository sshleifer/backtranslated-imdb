I didn't expect this movie except a B movie gore party. Fortunately, I was presented with a very well-made film, which built up the tension and managed to keep it throughout its course. It was an impressive achievement. The acting was solid and creates characters that you care about and relate to; and while some may find the movie slow, it has forced you to think about what you would have done in the same situation. In addition, there was a fine camera work and the directors teamed it together. An excellent attempt then, it's worth your time as you prefer development and tension over gore.
