It couldn't. <br /> <br /> From the cut dialogue to the super special effects, this movie was a joy to see throughout. The immediate feel for the bitterness of the Antarctic, the affinity for the basics built up before the real action warms up and combines the clever final to make this one of the most memorable and enjoyable films around. <Br /> <br /> Against a long list of movies trying to exploit the theme of visitors from another planet, the thing comes out and laughs. Who can forget the perfectly timely dialogue and the different special effects? Special effects that are much more impressive than the computer generated images we see today. I saw one of the nicest aspects of the film as the way we were slowly introduced to each crew member, and the way they all had distinctive traits. It wasn't just a senseless carnage-com-slasher horror movie. This movie felt. Emotion. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend this movie enough. I still have nothing to see in the class that comes close to matching, let alone better, the almost perfect acting and timing used in this cunning cinematic performance of cinema.
