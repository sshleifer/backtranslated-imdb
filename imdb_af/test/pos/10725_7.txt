The child actor earns a lot of credit. It was a pretty poor field for the best photo that year. I think "Apocalypse Now" had to take it, but the Academy probably felt it was too violent and strange, and Vietnam was still too recent. Meryl Streep was incredible, as always, a very untouchable character. I usually do not compliment directors, but I really liked that little bit with the elevator doors. Degree: B
