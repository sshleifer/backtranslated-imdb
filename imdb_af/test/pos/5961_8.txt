Excellent Exercise on Multiple Plans: <br /> <br /> - The colonialism spirit that has not yet ended has in France <br /> <br /> more generally the boring attitude of superiority of all Western people. <br /> <br <br /> <br /> The good idea is that, despite all these messages, it's a funny movie, lots of jokes and gags, very light and sparkling. <br /> <br /> Special mention to Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo. Definitely worth seeing. Wonder how it will be appreciated in the USA <br /> <br /> It looks like it's a success in France, so probably another version will come.
