<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 5 years ago, if you were to watch an Australian movie, you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians . general is represented as nitwits who live off the land, say words like 'cobber' and generally the classic underdog. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Australian film has evolved over the past few years and is it out today? classic 'such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People. <br /> <br /> In this evolution of the film we also find Two Hands. <br /> <br /> In Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town. Pando, played by Bryan Brown, is a Sydney Mob boss. He is the king of organized crime carrying staffs, wearing a stump and helping his son with his origami. He is angry, but really. As she is mob, keep the gun on someone's head in one scene and then play board games in the next. They are respected and if they ask for favor, you do not say. <br /> <br /> Give Jimmy, played by Heath Ledger. Jimmy is your average Aussie man in his early twenties. He's a good guy who wants to make a name for himself without getting on someone's bad side, so when Pando asks Jimmy to deliver $ 10,000, Jimmy accepts. <br /> <br /> Things start to get exciting when 2 teenagers manage to steal The money while Jimmy is on the beach. So now Jimmy is $ 10,000 in the dept for a big mob boss. From here we start all the related stories with Jimmy and his attempt to see a bank robbery to recover the money, Jimmy and Alex (Rose Byrne's love interest), trying to find Jimmy and, of course, the two teenagers and their new prosperity . The concept is being deepened by the narrator, Jimmy's dead brother, Michael, who was murdered earlier by Pando and his gang. <br /> <br /> In the end, all the storylines were very well connected with a surprise to shock and bump the audience. I thoroughly enjoyed it. <br /> <br />
