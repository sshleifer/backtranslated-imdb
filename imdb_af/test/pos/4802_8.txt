you know I've seen many crappy hong kong movies in terms of production and were good. But walking out of Time was wonderful. <br /> <br /> I think what made it so good was the fact that Andy Lau and Ching Wang have such a great chemistry. The movie is really fast but doesn't slow down enough to watch. It's good too, we don't want a heart attack, lol. In terms of intrigue, they are plenty of other things that concern you. Lau has a few good moments as he uses to personalize people from the underworld. The film also has the best oriental supporting role since the home of Flying Daggers. <br /> <br /> The movie is great because it is so unpredictable and makes you wonder at every corner. Definitely a good rental with tons of comedy, action and excitement divided into one, 8 out of 10
