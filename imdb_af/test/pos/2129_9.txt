This is a nice show with nice music, lots of dancing, very big sisters / little sister interaction (almost everything positive), and many wishes awarded. There are funny moments that older children and adults will enjoy, as King Randolph exclaims: "They're just shoes!" And the moments like Princess Genevieve comfort her youngest sister, Lacey, after a blunder. <br /> <br /> The animation may not be as good as Disney, but it's still very good. The facial expressions are nuanced, especially for Genevieve, King Randolph, Duchess Rowena and her servant, Derek the butterfly, and little Princess Lacey. My only issue on the animation is in the dance series where the dance princesses become absolute copies of each other without the slightest deviation - even the three latest copies fit the dance perfectly. I would like to see a little more individualism in the dance, as these girls are not professional ballerinas or dancers. <br /> <br /> The resolution of the story is cleverly managed to get rid of a villain without actually hurting her There is some violence on guard in the story, and the villain's monkey is for other animals in the story important. <br /> <br /> My 4-year-old daughter loves this movie and has watched it repeatedly and I found it quite acceptable for her to watch.
