I accidentally hit this movie on Cinemax while channel is navigating. I must admit that what was attracted to me was Christopher Walken. And the environment was the kind I wanted, so I started looking at it. Initially I expected a serious drama movie, and it looked like a while ... until I started giggling here and there, and before I know it, I laughed so hard at the movie. I really like how subtle and light-hearted it is but still have a huge impact on the audience. The plot is very simple, and it's far from hard to try to be funny like many Hollywood comedies, but it almost made me roll on the floor. A must have for a nice rest, or anytime in that case.
