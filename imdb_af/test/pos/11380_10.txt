This is an absolutely masterful stroke of genius by Paul Thomas Anderson, author / director of this movie. It really explores the pluses and minuses of the world of pornography and effects on your world-living actions, literally fueled by sex, drugs and rock n 'roll. Some of the best works include Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Don Cheadle, Philip Baker Hall and others.
