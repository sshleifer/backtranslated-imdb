This is the promise of the trailer I saw and with which I hired Hitch. Exactly, a serious movie viewer will not expect much more from this title, but Smith, Mendes, James and Valletta have surprisingly managed to achieve a theater performance that can sum up the end of the film metaphorically on their rap dance floor routine. : Their characters have formed an effective combination that can lead more than a good laugh with this Sunday afternoon DVD, with the exception of your date is not a beautiful French-Swedish director-of-the-60 movie. <br /> <br /> PS: The scoring techniques are all TRUE, especially the "cocktail girl" routine!
