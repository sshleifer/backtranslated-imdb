This series, while being idealized and fixed, has the peculiarity, sultriness and kindness that comes from life on an island. <br /> <br /> I lived in Hawaii for a few years and found some hilarious, quirky and fun people in some remote (non-touristy) areas. <br /> <br /> Every time I see the reserves of this series, I compare my memories of experiences in out-of-the-way parts of Hawaii with the memories depicted and fictionalized in Key West. <br /> <br /> This series is not real TV. I hate reality television. <br /> <br /> It is from the era when people still wrote creative TV shows. Give me a "young writer" who inspires their inspiration from the "angels in the spray, wizards in the palm trees and elves in the shells" every day.
