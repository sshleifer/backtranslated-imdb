_Saltmen_ is a long film for his genre, and often the pace is much slower than expected by Western audiences. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed it both in terms of interesting topic and the beautiful images this movie contains. Some of the scenery is truly breathtaking and there is plenty of interest that most _Saltmen_ should survive with minimal use of the fast forward. <br /> <br />
