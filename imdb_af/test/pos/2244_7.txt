Age of Steel follows the previous episode, the rise of the Cybermen, which in some ways was excellent, lacking in others. RotC has some positive elements, most importantly Tennant's excellent portrayal of the doctor. In fact, his kind of folly gives this writer the shadow of Tom Baker's Doctor, with his kind of subconscious, aside (as when the periods of Mickey look the button in the Tardis), he brings his own lofty superiority to la McCoy's Doctor as he let events surround him. Some reviewers and supporters whose pieces I have read are a bit shocked at the fact that such a young actor portrays someone who has to be over 1000 now, but I disagree. Tennant's doctor indeed "wears the weight of the world on his shoulders" as he points out in this episode, and he can see this in his almost smaller characterization, as he eventually confronts Lumic / The Cyber ​​Controller in the climax. His world-tired, rolling "anothermania cherewega" kind of attitude is refreshing, especially after Eccleston's excellent pseudo-working class, characterizing the character, more the man of action than Tennant's pseudo-doofus. Tennant's best moment may have come to an end when he recovers the Tardis with his big goofy Baker-esquire grin as the Tardis start again. Here we are beginning to get a feel for this new doctor, a little more than the average person's different personality facets that are divided into 13 different people. some contradictory, some more fun than others, but all form part of a whole. These aside these two episodes were acceptable but poor. The concept of the revival of the Cybermen is very much welcomed, and they look fantastic, but the plot that includes a parallel Earth where this action takes place does not seem right. The truth of man's confidence in technology and their need to serve it, as the doctor points out, is probably excellent, but it can easily be placed on the current Earth or within it. Some other weak spots are, as others have pointed out, the ease with which the doctor and the company come from the tight spots, viz. the ray of death of the Tardis component, the seemingly endless array of uses of the Sonic Screwdriver (my wife laughed when they used to burn the rope at the end, she barely looked at Who, so I had to it has been traditionally used as a plot device to remove the characters from situations where there is no other escape, unfortunately use it. Some wanted the acting, especially Mickey, who really needed his appearance and the supporting role. Lumic was creepy, as he should have, his voice even sounded Cyberman-esquire. The score was terrible, but with the volume of the music the scene is often washed out. Overall, I found Rise of the Cyberman more entertaining, although the second half was mental. Building what we knew was inevitable, but the decision was disappointing. Too much unlikely to escape, no development of the supporting role, and not enough Tennant in my opinion. This new show is outstanding, and Davies takes it in a good direction, but the dialogue (beyond the doctor's) needs to be strengthened, as Mickey's secretions illustrate, which was pure ham.
