It has to be acknowledged that Harold Lloyd's best work ended in 1928 with his last big quiet comedy "Speedy". Then he becomes healthy movies (like Chaplin and Keaton and Laurel & Hardy and WC Fields) and does it better than Keaton, but not as good as the other three. Chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as a producer (but he played his films so there were five years between productions). Laurel & Hardy was under the patronage of Hal Roach, so production standards for their pants and audio films were pretty good. Fields first worked with Mack Sennett, as with Paramount, and then released. Lloyd has the route Chaplin has taken, but with less success. <br /> <br /> He made his own films, but unlike Chaplin, he didn't have his own studio. His first two choices were not good either (especially "Feet First"). But he started choosing more wisely and "Movie Crazy", "The Cat's Paw" and "The Milky Way" were all good choices. These three (and possibly "The Sin of Harold Diddlebock") were his best audio companies. They are all entertaining, but no one is on "Safety Last", "The Freshman", "The Kid Brother" or "Speedy". <br /> <br /> Of the top four audio films "The Cat's Paw" are the most controversial. Ezekiel Cobb's solution to destroying the city that prefers him is mayor very much to the taste of 2005. Or is it? When a film is made, it determines what politics is: "The Cat's Paw" is from 1934. The second year of the Roosevelt New Deal (itself controversial for heavier government involvement) saw films like Gabriel over the White House and "The Phantom President, "where our leaders have done foreign constitutional actions to evade the nation of internal enemies (and to force disarmament over the globe). Even Cecil B. De Mille came in this act with "This Day and Age", where a lot of teenagers used rats to force a gunman to confess his crimes. <br /> <br /> For us, using force to force anyone (even a lot of goons and messengers like Alan Dinehart's gang) to repent is repulsive. After all, the Supreme Court has protected us from confession under coercion. What we forget is that the reforms we think did not take place until the Warren Court and the Civil Court made them. For example, although Mr. Justice Sutherland's opinion in the Powell case ("Scottsboro Boys") of 1932 was guaranteed that every criminal defendant had the right to advise, Gideon v. Wainwright did not extend it to ordering the attorney to defendants until 1962. Miranda case, with its well-known anti-self-incrimination warning, dates back to 1963. Nothing like that was needed in 1934. <br /> <br /> If you study other movies from the period up to 1954 (and even until 1960) tricks are used to get confessions - Kirk Douglas confesses his crimes before the witnesses in "I Walk Alone" while Burt Lancaster " keep a gun on him. When Lancaster departs, Douglas cuts confession under force, just to see the gun is loaded. Suddenly he realized that (legally - in 1948) he confessed without urgency. Hate to say this to any civilian liberals reading this note, but what Cobb / Lloyd does to Dinehart and his poles at the end of the "Cat's Paw" was not just legal but would have led to their imprisonment in 1934 . may call it heavily, fascistically or terribly, but it would have worked legally when it was invented.
