Wicked Little stuff was a great movie. I would say on some parts that it looks really amazing, and others seemed to have just not enough thought to put in the characters' actions, but overall it was exciting and entertaining. don't understand why this movie's rating is so low. I don't understand why all the Afterdark Horrorfest movie's ratings are so low. These are B-Movies people and nothing more. They offer great entertainment and most of them do not have many mistakes. It's definitely a look, because you won't be disappointed with the outcome. Wicked Little Things is one of the best 1st Annual Afterdark Horrorfest movies, and compared to many other movies in the series, this is one of the best overall.
