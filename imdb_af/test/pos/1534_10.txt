Even the trailer for this movie makes me cry, like the first time I saw this movie. Not for people who are easily upset by intense material! The best performances by Alan Rickman and Madelaine Stowe, no doubt. This awful story of a society with the power to kidnap and torture it for citizens, whether anarchic or the author of children's books, will cool you down. I saw it when it came out of 1991 and I remember every frame. It still scares hell out of me today. It happens now. <br /> <br /> Apparently IMDb needs ten lines to satisfy their criteria for a movie review. IMDb may want to get a flu! Some of us are a little more concise about writing opinions.
