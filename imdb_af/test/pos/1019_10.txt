Well, I love this movie !!!!! I watched it over and over. It's so hard to tell who the attacker is. You keep thinking it's one person, then another, then back to the first person, then another person. It's so exciting, you want to find your TV in the end to see who it is. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and left at her home. She was in the hospital and started telling her how she was raped. It's from her encounter with her steady boyfriend, to her teacher who enjoys her, her former boyfriend, all other stories, all suspects. But who did this? <br /> <br /> I love the acting, they have a lot of talent in it. The tension is great and the settings are excellent. When it comes, watch TV. *** 1/2 stars 10/10
