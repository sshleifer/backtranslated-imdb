I hope so and how can I get involved? <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic and ripe with laughter, adventure and an all-star, 80's cast! <br /> <br /> What happens if you join a group of jocks and sorority, a group of debating nerds, a band of misfits and some couselors? <br /> <br /> A laughter that will beg you! <br /> <br /> David Naughton stars as Adam, the "yellow team leader", a kind and hip college counselor who helps students with everything to get the classes they want first. <br /> <br /> His nemesis is Harold, the leader of the "Blue Team", hilariously played by Stephen Furst of "Babylon 5", the not good loafing son of a rich, former university jock with enough trophies to make a hall of famier jealous. <br /> <Bring these two to each other and throw a "red team," a "white team," and a "green team", an incredible "view" at an observatory, effects of mining wave fraud , a super tour at the Pabst B Lue Ribbon beer factory, and a hateful old housewife under other adventures, and you have all the things of a night to remember! <br /> <br /> Watch for appearances by Michael J. Fox, Eddie Deezen, and director Andy Tennant In one of the last movies he performed before becoming a director and you have an all-star, hilarious cast. <br /> <br /> The only side to this movie was Debra Clinger's performance as Laura. She is very exaggerated, but the rest of the movie is so good, she can simply be ignored. <br /> <br /> I own this movie and can never see it enough! <br /> <br />
