I was really surprised when I first saw Iain Softley's movie; It differs in so many ways from the usual Hollywood mass production. The plot itself is simple - Kevin Spacey plays a mental patient. Prot claiming to be of the planet K-pax that came to Earth through a ray of light. Dr. Powell, played by Jeff Bridges, tries to help him solve his disorder. .. First of all, I have to admit that the cast was chosen perfectly: Kevin Spacey is really brilliant to portray the intriguing character of Prot, who is always in the fine line to convince us that it is real and then we wonder whether he is cruel Or not ... Some of the jewel tones include the one where Prot innocently eats the whole banana (even the peal) while in session with dr. Powell is; or the observatory where he shows his knowledge of the K-Pax system to the astounding astronomers. Jeff Bridges on the other hand is the subtle, rational side of this movie, and he delivers it perfectly. There are quite a few other actors of excellent actors (such as Saul Williams' convincing performance as Ernie) who really work this movie. <br /> <br /> K-pax has everything, elements of comedy; Sci-Fi, even psychological thriller (about the Prot's identity), but most importantly, it can be categorized as a heart-warming drama. The main premise of the movie is quite complicated, but the director never lets it go, he always keeps it credible and yet two-way interpretable. The camera and photography have an important role to play, and the main idea of ​​light travel continues. There is a lot of emphasis on light shadow play, lightning settings. One of the memorable scenes is where Dr. Powell has a crystal figure in his office, which keeps light in a beautiful way while he suspects all the time, can the idea be true? <br /> <br /> Subtle and slow pace, intriguing and pleasant, K-pax is truly a gem to watch, one of the kind of movies that may not be for all tastes, but those who see it can fall in love. along with it.
