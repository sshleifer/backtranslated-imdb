The story line for this game is very jerky where it seems that game writers have been trying to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in Tales of the Soul. It is said, this is the only problem I have about the game. <br /> <br /> The beginning FMV is spectacular with breathtaking scenery and interesting new devices such as the ability to create and design your own character and their own. Martial Arts discipline. There is even a second story that shares Tale of the Souls' uncomfortable Story design. <br /> <br /> Parts of the FMVs during Tale of the Souls are also interactive where you can determine the fate of your character to a degree that is an interesting feature. <br /> <br /> With the many combinations of characters you can create, the varied paths you can explore in Tales of the Souls and the Chronicles of Sword Story, this game will hold any Beatem-up / RPG fans have been amused for a while!
