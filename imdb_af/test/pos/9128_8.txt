How good is this movie? Apparently good enough to recreate it in 2011. Jean-Pierre Melville, who gave us Le Doulos and The Good Thief, wrote and directed this film. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost a silence. These are men with few words, preferring to speak their actions to them. There are some good actors in this movie. Alain Delon (The Leopard), Yves Montand (Jean de Florette, Let's Make Love) and Gian Maria Volonte (El Indio of a dirty dollar and a few more dollars). The movie does not shine on them; They are together for the ride Melville has for them. Melville makes the movie; they make it better. <br /> <br /> You see Melville's work in the Ocean movies, but they just get the idea. It can't make it work like it did. A great loss in the seventies, but his work remains for us pleasure.
