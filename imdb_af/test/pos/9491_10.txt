I bought my first Zep album in 1974 (at 17) and then chopped. This DVD is now in my music collection proudly. It's not often that a group of 4 can boast of virtuosos in their series, but here we can. Each member made their own contribution to the group, but on the stage the electricity they generated was greater than the 4 individuals. This masterpiece covers the band's entire career from Led Zep 1 to Coda and it is captivated on this DVD, as each concert shows how the band has grown over the years. Recently, my copy has disappeared, but I'm happy to say found in my 17yo son's room, as the new generation just discovered how good these guys were. It's a must have for anyone who appreciates rock music. Long life Led Zeppelin.
