I saw Borderline on the AMC a few years ago. I've been looking for it since. It was haunting: visual, texture, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I don't care where. I will never blow the curtain in the wind. I still remember how I tilted my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what happened when the movie was over, but I think life is like that. It didn't bother me. Unfortunately, the injustice of the eventual rejection of an innocent character really strikes me. I loved the faces, how the camera was on them. The camera looks at the set with the unattended eyes of a daydreamer. Borderline was really for me in a way that movies are not. It was exactly the lack of explanation, color, sharpness that made it enter my consciousness like a thief in the night. I love this movie. One day I'll own it.
