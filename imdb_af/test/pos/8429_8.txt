I'm a big fan of the 1995 version, which I've seen many times and consider a subtle, excellent movie. This version of 1971 I bought yesterday, a little hesitant, but now that I've seen it, I'm glad I did, because it's better for the book and Austen's insights. The 1995 version has more dramatic power, mainly because it increases many characters. In the 1995 version, Lady Russell is smarter, more manipulative, less real looking for Anne; Mr. Walter is even more vain and vain; Elizabeth is nastier; Mary is more abominable; Mr. Elliot is smarter; Lady Dalrymple is much more stupid - but I think the characterizations in this 1971 version are closer to the book, Austen's vision and the right people of the time. The 1971 version also contains more of the key lines and scenes from the book, especially the key scene in the field where Anne Wentworth hears talking to Louisa (or is it Henrietta?) About the importance of character power. I found the play more subtle and enticing than many of the critics are here, but the acting version of the 1995 version is more powerful. I agree with the critics here that the actress Anne plays is too old for the part; I watched her entry on IMDb and she was 38 at the time of the filming, when her character was supposed to be 28. I thought her acting was subtle and effective. Wentworth is of the right age and I found him very convincing. In particular, this 1971 version of Wentworth has much more of its sense of humor and plague; The 1995 one, much more of the sense of power a sailor would have, and more passion. The admiral in the 1971 version misses the horror presence and the human warmth of one in the 1995 version and has no sense of the power that an admiral would certainly convey; I found him the one really weak element in the production. I agree with others that the scene of the "falling" scene was timid, and it was unconvincing that she would have been so injured by such a small fall. However, she may hit the back of her head at the edge of the stone walkway, which if it would really cause a very dangerous injury and make the scene more convincing than the scene in the 1995 version, where she falls further but is evident from any sharp edge that may cause a major head injury. About the costume that some have criticized, I am not knowledgeable and cannot respond, but I will note that none of the fleet characters (Wentworth, Admiral Croft, Benwick, Harville) in the 1971 version wear their uniforms while in the 1995 version, all carry their fancy uniforms consistently. I suspect that the 1971 version is accurate, and it always bothered me a bit in the 1995 version, the officials are always in uniform when clearly the nation is in peace and the officials are detached from active service. My dad and grandfather were career US Navy captains who ordered airplane carriers and submarines, and they didn't spend every day during leave or leisure in their blues dress. I doubt it was another 180 years ago. The uniforms give the 1995 version a lot of singing, and I prefer it, but I doubt it is precisely historically that these officials carried their uniforms so often. Finally, it is true that the production values ​​of the 1971 version are much less than the 1995 version, but the year (1971), the TV format and the budget, we cannot blame the artists. Contemporary viewers who can make a mental allowance for the lower production values ​​can find this version worthwhile to appreciate.
