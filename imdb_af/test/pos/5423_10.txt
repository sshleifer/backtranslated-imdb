... the world never knows. (The film that had the Oscar's best animation is the year, Anna and Bella, very good, but it's not a big cut. Both are available on the world's largest animation compilation, a comparison. ) <br /> <br /> "Track" and his director, Richard Condie, have received so much attention that there is little for me to add. However, I would note that the movie contains one of my favorite single "shots" in an animated short, the one where the man opens the door to release the cat. I don't want to give away the real events depicted here, but the first time I saw the shot, I was from one mind to another, then seconds later to another. That shot has never deceived me like that. For this shot, and for the way Condie builds up after those moments, the "Big Track" deserves the tag of "masterpiece".
