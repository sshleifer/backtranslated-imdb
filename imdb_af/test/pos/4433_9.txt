After visiting the Kimbell Museum in Forth-Worth, Texas, USA, with the art and architecture (also of the adjacent Modern Art Museum), and having a wonderful conversation with the expert bookstore woman, I have this DVD bought with quite high expectations ?? and was not least disappointed. <br /> <br /> The thematic approach, dramatic tension, revealing interviews, archival material and beautiful architecture are also blended into a coherent whole to explore the life of late iconic Louis I. Khan. . <br /> <br /> The documentary begins: contemplative classical music games, archives are scanned with a reflective shadow face that has been moved over, blurring letters symbolically referring to a train window that leaves a background landscape? a journey, focus and out of focus, the search eventually leads to an article in a newspaper. Nathanial Khan reads the New York Times cover where his father is commended as the best American architect who lives and announced his death. <br /> <br /> "When I first read the word of death, I have to admit that I am looking for my own name. I was also his child, his only son. I didn't know my father very well. Never with my mother. married and he never lived with us. He died when I was eleven. <br /> <br /> So many years later, this illegitimate boy is haunted by unclearly fragmented thoughts and feelings about his father great professional and public figure, but whose mysterious personal life escapes him and touches him to the point where he intends to do something about it. <br /> <br /> "For years I struggled to be content with Being with the little bits of my dad's life I allowed to see, but that wasn't enough. I had to know him. I had to find out who he really was. Then I went on a trip to see his buildings and to find out what was left of him there. It will take me to the other side of the world, looking for the man who has left me so many questions. "<br /> <br /> Thus, the documentary two by a slow systematic discovery of the world-renowned architect, teaches us: 1) his ideas, buildings and architectural perspective, and 2) his families, colleagues, people's lives he touched and the human perspective <br /> <br /> The DVD also offers more insight into a Q&A with the author / director and additional footage containing such wonderful Louis I. Khan quotes: "All That All say is the truth. That's their truth. It may not be factual. "And" A good idea that doesn't happen is not an idea at all. "<br /> <br /> This movie is a voyage of discovery. Self-discovery and discovery of a man, a great man, but a human being, imperfect as we are all. We know him by the eyes of an admirer and slightly bitter son, but with openness and objectivity to really explore without making easy conclusions and without judging. <br /> <br /> Through important interviews with people interacting with him in different capacities We were slowly putting together pieces for the final interview with this man from Bangladesh, who really seems to be bringing it back with visceral and meaningful remarks. <br /> <br /> Brilliant architect, brilliant documentary.
