Who is the man ~~~ What is it that I hear? A resounding cry from Kevin? Well, if you didn't shout for the "ordinary suspect," I'd prescribe your medication. Anyway, it's not a first class movie, just a very well-proclaimed story, it's almost believable. Because it's an alien, you probably wonder what the? All acting is top notch and also the first I have seen a balanced, sarcastic Alien. Just fine is everything I can say and almost for the whole family (if not for the scene later in the movie). SEVEN STARS
