I think it's the kind of movie you love or hate, and I'm really not the kind of film artist. My mother rented the other night "mullhuland DR" and I almost ran out of the room, huh. But I love this movie. <br /> <br /> One night we recorded the "Beat" when we ran the band and accidentally got a good movie. Save the tape and watch it a lot. I finally got the VHS to add to my collection. I watched it many times and at one point copied the poems. I even tried to prepare one scene for my high school drama class. She said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words. She refused to do me. If it upsets my drama teacher so it can be so good :) Honestly she never treated me the same. <br /> <br /> I like the acting, it has become very true and honest. It wasn't clean and polished, but it was better than that. It was true for life, how someone would really act and show emotions, not how Hollywood does it. It was wonderful, especially by the one who plays Rex. <br /> <br /> The story was original. Not only are the characters drawn into his world, but you also do. Not your typical person meets inner children and saves them by knowledge film at all. Simple caring and friendship make things a little better. <br /> <br /> The only thing is that even in the 80's, more rifle and less simple things like rock were thrown, but that little innocence didn't hurt it. film. <br /> <br /> I think it's a must see. You will also love or hate it, but it also impacts and it makes a good movie that you will remember and speak later.
