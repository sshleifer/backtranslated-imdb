I was very impressed with the latest production of Mick Molloy. As a fan of her, I was used to a different kind of humor than here. He chose wisely with a more subtle broad style of comedy in Crackerjack, rather than his usual low forehead, in your face. It is, sometimes, inconsistent and uneven, but a decent script works past it and makes for some entertaining performance. Directed by Paul Moloney (who is almost every Australian TV series imaginable), Crackerjack tells the story of Jack Simpson, a block belonging to his local bakery club for the sole reason for parking. When the club hits financial difficulties, it is forced to compete competitively in an attempt to raise funds to save the club from a poker machine yard. A well-known and successful formula, which is well handled. There is no denial that the film is owed to the success of Molloy's great casting. He had a good report with Samuel Johnson and excellent chemistry with Judith Lucy, and while the character probably isn't far from his own personality, you can't help but wonder why he didn't try his arm on film. earlier. To relieve the experienced role, beautiful Frank Wilson and Bill Hunter support, and often steal their scenes. They are two fine actors and the couple move with ease through their roles. If it wasn't for the big success of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Crackerjack would have made it at number 1 at the Australian cash register, but if you look at what he is going to film and who is involved, it even made number 2 ' an excellent attempt. All in all, a witty, feel-good movie. Great role, great crew and good soundtrack combine to make one of the better Australian movies of 2002. 7/10.
