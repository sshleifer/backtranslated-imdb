Yes, you can look at Babette's Feast as a kind of blow to Puritan Christianity, but it is much more than that. The surface story of how a prestigious Paris chef leaves Paris to one of his revolutions through the middle classes and throws ashore in the country in the north of Denmark in Jutland, is simply the fat that makes the deeper story possible. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist, one of the small armies of people driven from the arrow to pass through the ages by greasy politicians, flowery, greedy and arrogant, killing the beauty of profit , something politics always does, suits National Endowment for the Arts, which institutionalises only creativity for propaganda purposes. <br /> <br /> Babette is on her last legs as she arrives in the small town where two virgin sisters live on their diminishing herd of dedicated to their then father. They live on salt cod and black breadworm. <br /> <br /> Babette shows these simple pious people that God is in pleasure and sensuality as well as behavior and spiritual purity. She also shows them how this spiritual purity can lead to the control of irregularities, something we all know in these days of the neo-authoritarian in the government who would limit our personal freedoms because they somehow made a crime against the state, or as they would tell us, humanity. <br /> <br /> Babette cooks a warming French meal to celebrate the 100th birthday of the late minister. The daughters and their flock think the devil comes under them and vows not to notice the food or drink. <br /> <br /> It is at this point, in preparation for the meal, that Babette's profits make it into a French lottery, which I start tearing. It is a poignance that arises compared to the daily vulgarity and mendacity that flood our consciousness from morning to night through the media and power-mongers that maneuver to take advantage of all of us here in the dark. <br /> <br /> The simple sophistication of Babette's artworks in the face of all the pretentiousness shown in our modern society, and it hurts to see it so wonderfully in this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> It is with Fanny and Alexander (Bergman), my favorite movie ever, but I can only see it once, because like a rare bottle of wine serving Blinis and fresh oysters, it is something which should not be over. <br /> <br /> A great, good movie that must be in every library of the film lover.
