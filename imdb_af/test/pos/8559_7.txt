H.O.T.S. is not for those who want hardcore porn. Instead, this film is a forerunner for many sixty-cult classic college / frat films such as REVENGE OF THE NERDS and PORKY'S and a pointer to the world-renowned animal house. A good time if you played a huge 70s / 80s. Playboy-type chicks and a chick-banging dick comedy - but nothing to mention if you want to use it as a snake material. <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. is an "unauthorized" sadness of sexy outcasts who fight against popular and trendy Pi girls. This one has pranks, a Jemima-ish home caretaker, and even an overheated robot that looks relatively nice when boobies are your "thing". <br /> <br /> Well ... I like tits as much (or probably more ...) than the next man - but with all the slosy sh! I can't help but see some hardcore scenes to make this one really worthwhile. I knew it wouldn't happen, but I still wish that H.O.T.S. has a little more sex and a little less cheeses. Not just as noteworthy as NERDS, PORKY'S, or HOUSE, but are a look at fans of those kinds of movies ... 7/10 <br /> PS ... and I forgot - this one has plenty shower -Dragon Danny Bonaduce is probably the best part of his career outside his "reality show" ...
