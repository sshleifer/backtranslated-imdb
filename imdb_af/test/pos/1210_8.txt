This event defined an era of wrestling entertainment which, in my opinion, is not equal today. The colorful characters - in their stereotypical clothes - have brought a special charm to the show that has since been raped and overstated by society. Wrestling then had a bit of innocence. A child could see it without watching an episode of Jerry Springer. <br /> <br /> Looking back now (I was 5 right now), although I loved both Warrior and Hogan, I think I enjoyed Warrior more because of his mysticism. Hogan was the brand-name hero who destroyed an impressive public image. The Ultimate Warrior, on the other hand, was a masked man with few words - an out-of-the-limelight hero to another audience. <br /> <br /> This rivalry was as exciting as a child because of this Duality in me makes it out for every fighter. I had a place for them. Because there was also bloodshed in this long, heavy battle, the game was high - at least for me as a child. On a similar note, because of Hogan's defeat, it made him more human. I remember feeling sorry for him. <br /> <br /> All these emotions played in the young boy's seaport make Wrestlemania VI such a good time to see this game.
