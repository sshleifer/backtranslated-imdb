I remember a time when the only thing that existed was where clubs, drug pubs and parties. This movie came out a few years after I started to climb. If I never discovered the harder side of things, this movie couldn't make sense to me. That night when I watched it for the first time, I was totally blown away with some friends. I have never watched a movie that has so close to the reality of where I was in my life at that time. Almost everything I could somehow link to. There was never a character that I could completely relate to, but more a combination of all in one way or another. My friends are no different and I remember everyone who says they are where we or we are. We all went out the weekend, exactly what the crew did in HT. We came across as we watched and when the movie "came down", I remember actually coming a little further. It was pretty depressed in our room during those "lows". That's what is so good about human traffic. It's really the whole situation. <br /> <br /> It's a unique movie in the way it's not printed, but then it's not quite character-driven, though the characters are important. It always seems to be based on the situations. Situations as a group and as individuals. Every character is lost in life for their own reasons. Yet, everyone responds in the same way to the lostness. work any job to make money to pay for the weekend and escape it all. For them it's their vacation. But the reality is you can't really escape. Another situation they all have to face. <br /> <br /> Me and my friends, where none of these guys are. We all have our own things going on. Human traffic helped us explain what we didn't understand about ourselves. It does it in a way that doesn't speak to you. It made us feel that we were not the only ones like us and that the lessons learned where many others went from all over the world. it was not until my lifestyle of party popping changed to career driving, that I would fully understand this movie. Today I watch HT, every now and then (just as I have) and remind the old days. No other movie can do it. I was peter popper, I was jip travolta, I never went to never land with my chosen family. I want $ 200 in my back burner and I got the lot! No problem!
