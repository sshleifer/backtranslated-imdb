From the golden era of British movies, it has my voice for one of the funniest of all time. I watched a mocking audience at my movie club yesterday, and I was amazed at how well the comedy lasted (made in 1950!). It's really about the expert timing and unspeakable play of two of the best actors Britain made: Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim. Adapted from a play by John Dighton, this farce is quickly handled by Frank Launder, director. The plot is simple: A ministry fault makes a girls school at a boys school. I will always laugh when I think of this movie.
