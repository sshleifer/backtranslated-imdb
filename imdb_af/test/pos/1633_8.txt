Where the Da Vinci code introduced us to dr. Robert Langdon and his attempt to solve puzzles, make the Angels and Demons the forefront by offering a great puzzle with an 8 hour limit. <br /> <br /> With a film by award-winning actors, Ron Howard does a great job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci code has thrown you so many corners so fast that a quick break in the bathroom would make you a bit confused. I didn't feel it was with Angels and Demons, the plot was straight ahead and the action helped the interest level. Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was easily my favorite character in the movie. His depiction of the elitist, but misunderstood rank of the Catholic Church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor). There is not a huge amount of Tom Hanks time, as the film focuses more on storytelling than character development, and it felt good to me that I had more than enough introduction to the first movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found Ayelet Zurer's character, Vittoria Vetra, an unnecessary five-man assistant in the quest, as her lines were slightly limited and looked like an afterthought. She plays a key role in the beginning of things, but soon disappears in the background of Langdon's "famous" more than the necessary partner. <br /> <br /> As such, the plot is one of the organizations that the Catholic Church in the past had been wrong (there were quite a few) who sought revenge in the most artistic way. Some men of the church are kidnapped and executed at specific times until an eventual end to the church itself. Dr Robert Landon is brought in to decipher the clues and teams with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who testifies to a colleague in the hands of the church's enemy. <br /> <br /> Music remains relevant and cinematography beautiful, I can handle these many things, but it definitely makes Angels and Demons work. That is the conclusion. It was by far one of the most wonderful surprises I saw in a movie, and I was impressed by how unattended I was when it hit me. Like any other, I appreciate a good wrap-up and this film turns it straight and drops a nice bow on it. Needless to say I left the scene with the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> If you are religious and uncertain whether this film will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that when the DaVinci Code painted Catholicism as a shady group of sadists, English and demons painted them with a much lighter brush. The church is shown as a collector of good men made to suffer from the sins of evil and deceived men who wear their colors and even some who infiltrated their modern ranks.
