To be honest fellow IMDb reviewers, I really enjoyed this show. The reason? Well, it didn't try to be more than it was; I mean, a sitcom with regular expectations, with a familiar and repeated plot, funny and talented actors, and clever jokes aimed at a post college audience. <br /> <br /> That's what Grown Ups is about: Try Adult but in a funny way. <br /> <br /> Jaleel White is funny as always and delivers some witty and hilarious sex-oriented jokes. The humor is many 90's without regard to the trends of the new millennium and that is the main reason for my view why the show did not succeed. It held in the 90's. <br /> <br /> Oh yes and ma'am. Ribisi was really funny and beautiful. <br /> <br /> My favorite show should be the one that bites Karma at the ass! Not a cult classic, but I'm sure it's part of regular early 2000's nostalgia.
