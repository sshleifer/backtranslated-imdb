Any World War II film made by a British production company in World War II has no respect for me. The confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart is in At Dawn We Dive: As a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspects of World War II and especially the naval war, I am in favor of depicting subs and action in the North . Atlantic and especially those that include the German side of things. For those who are not concerned with the target priorities, an attack on an enemy warship is the biggest event that a submarine can encounter and such a scarce event will develop similarly to what we see here. The pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming back from the Ealing, Rank and British-Gaumont studios. First of all, I prefer his styler, more cerebral approach to his humanity and realism, much better than any over-manufactured Hollywood movie ever. It reminds me of Powell and Pressburger's The 49th Parallel thanks to the powerful convincing Eric Portman, a favorite of mine. John Mills receives a second invoice and a smaller font in the titles, so it's obviously meant to be mr. Portman's movie, but the whole scroll shines. As far as the title series is concerned, am I the only one who is totally charmed by Gainsborough Production's beautiful pre-CGI Gainsborough Girl?
