I only saw this movie in 1980 and it touched a chord reminding me of a more innocent time. The opening story, music and paintings by Norman Rockwell set the tone for me. You also like the movie or hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was the best of his kind and portrayed Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in a very innocent and pleasant way. This movie is at the top of my favorites, it is a pity that it is no longer available on DVD or VHS. The end was also wonderful. John Hancock did a wonderful job of capturing the essence of time.
