The Kid Power Hour contains two segments: Hero High and Shazam. Let's start with Hero High. <br /> <br /> Hero High was meant to be a new Archies cartoon, with their superhero identities: Pureheart the Powerful (Archie), Captain Hero (Jughead), Superintendent (Betty) and Evilheart (Reggie) . However, Filmation cannot get the right to do so, so they tackled it a bit and tackled it. Here is the outline of characters: Captain California (Archie), Glorious Gal (Betty), Weatherman (Jughead), Dirty Trixie (Veronica), Rex Ruthless (Reggie), Prince Samson (Mr Weatherbee) and Miss. Grimm (Miss Grundy). The show features live action sketches, as well as cartoon adventures. The humor was the typical Lame Filmation jokes, but at least it had a sense of fun. It was enough for children, but not quite up to previous standards. <br /> <br /> The other segment was Shazam!, which was very loyal to the comics, unlike the previous live action program. All the great villains made appearances, as well as the whole Wonder family (including fairy tales, in at least one episode). Uncle Dudley has the right WC Fields voice and shadow character, as well as his constantly acting "Shazambago". Burr Middleton, a veteran of 70's TV shows, such as Fish, voiced the Big Red Cheese, while Alan Oppenheimer (Rudy Wells in the early 6 Million Dollar Man episodes and voice of Skeletor in He-Man) Sivana treated it. <Br /> <br /> The Marvels always felt for them, so little change was needed for their adventures, to meet the Broadcast Standards and Practices requirements (the sensors). As such, the stories were very imaginative and inventive. Among the villains that appeared were: Sivana, Black Adam, Mr. Atom, Mr. Mind, Aunt Minerva, Ibac, and the crocodile creatures. Mr. Tawky Tawny also made his debut on the screen. <br /> <br /> Hero High will be released from BCI, but Shazam! is still in limbo, as well as the live action show. Hopefully the proposed movie will help to release them on DVD. It is worth watching and earning DVD treatment.
