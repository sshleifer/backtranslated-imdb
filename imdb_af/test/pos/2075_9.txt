If you want to see Shakespeare's masterpiece as a whole, I suggest you find this BBC version. Indeed, it is about four and a half hours past, but Jacoby's performance as Hamlet and Patrick Stewart as Claudius is worth it. <br /> <br /> It never stops me wondering how clear "Hamlet" is when you see it. in its length and order as determined by the Bard. Every movie version of "Hamlet" clipped its structure. Olivier focused on Hamlet's uncluttered, Gibson, on his steps. Jacoby can draw all of these aspects of Hamlet's character along with Shakespeare's complete script. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't Hamlet kill Claudius right away? Hamlet says, "I'm very proud, revengeful, ambitious ..." Hamlet is extremely upset, not just for his father's death (and presumably murder), or his mother's marriage to his uncle, but also, and mostly because Claudius agreed. the throne of Hamlet. He is furious with his mother to marry Claudius (marriages between royal family are not unknown, for political reasons), but that her marriage strengthened Claudius's claim to the throne before returning from Wittenburg to claim it for himself . He is therefore impotent to do so. And that's true even after hearing his father's revenge revenge. He can't just kill the King, or he'll lose the throne by doing it. He must "out" the king's secret and here's the tragedy! At the moment, Hamlet is successful in disclosing Claudius's debt. He has the opportunity to kill him and not. WHY? He wants it all! He wants revenge, the throne, and the condemnation of Claudius's soul in hell. Hamlet TREATS Himself in classic tragic form. His own HUBRIS is his withdrawal. He kills Polonius and thinks it is Claudius and the rest of the play spirals to the final death of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius and Hamlet themselves.
