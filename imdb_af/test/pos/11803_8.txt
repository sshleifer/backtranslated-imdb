"The Cure" is a very touchy and dramatic drama. The film focuses on two neighborhood boys who become good friends. One of the boys has AIDS. The boys initially become good friends despite Erik's concern. The film shows the boy's journey to discover the "healing" in Ohio according to the National Examiner and how it affects their relationship. The acting is great (I've never seen Annabella Sciorra's better), and the movie is just getting lost. I couldn't stop crying with the shoe scene. This is a good tearjerker. Keep the little ones close. 8/10
