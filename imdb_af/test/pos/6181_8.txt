It's all about what you want if you want it. And the message from Bluebeard's eighth WIfe is to be careful what you want, whatever you desire. <br /> <br /> Most men have heard the stories about what happens if your sexual frustration isn't relieved. and a certain part of your anatomy turns blue. Misogynic pirates set aside Cooper plays a very rich man who is very used to getting what he wants when he wants it, and just learns that it wasn't what he expected and never teaches his lesson until he walk in the festive Claudette Colbert. Through a twisted (in soul and in practice) business deal he ends up with the intention of covering her, but she will not literally have it and frustrate him at every turn and corner and room, and tourist attraction. <br /> <br /> The movie has definite French sensitivity, which means it has strong double-skinned and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge that you are not accustomed to (and may not see) in either Cooper either Colbert. The whole reason I watched the movie was because they were "likable" actors, and the whole point of this movie is that they are unlikely, or at least nice people who developed unlikely features to protect themselves, they think, of the world. <br /> <br /> If you can accept it on its own, you will find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated movie ... and as we have said, it is what it is all about. Such a movie with such a wheelchair comes only once in a ... ummm ... blue moon.
