It's not as good as the movie, which said it's a cute children's show. Well, so did the emperor again become a shit and a selfish spoiled brat, accepted it and enjoyed the cartoon as something entertaining. It has lots of jokes for the parents and still keeps the attention of children. It also boasts two of the original voice actors from the movie. Earth Kitt was in many movies, but I'm sure many people know Catwoman. And Patrick Walburton (sorry if I spelled wrongly) who also appeared in many movies and TV series, but is most recognized as The Tick. It's really a rare and wonderful combination. If I do nothing else, I suggest watching a comic book fan, at least watch one episode just to enjoy the dynamic duo. In summary, entertaining children's show, with many jokes for the grown-ups to laugh with. If you are looking for educational value, it is not your view. If you're just looking for something funny, it's a good Saturday morning choice!
