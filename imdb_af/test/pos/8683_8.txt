All I can say is, I expected a wick movie and "Blurry" surprised me positively. Very nice teen movie. All of these kinds of situations are normal in school life, so all I can say is that it all reminded me of my schooling and sometimes it is good to watch these movies because we entertain and travel back to those golden years when we were young. Let us also think better in the way we need to understand our children, because in the past we were just like them in the present time. Try this movie and you'll be very happy. At the same time you will have the guarantee that your time has not been lost.
