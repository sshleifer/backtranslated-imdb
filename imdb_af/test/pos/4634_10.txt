If you're a "child of the Eighties" like me, you probably remember this Disney movie in 1981 - one of Disney's first PG rated movies and Michael J. Fox's screen debut. I remember watching this movie over and over on HBO when I was in the middle school, and I just recently got a very old copy of it, since Disney hadn't been producing the movie for years. Needless to say, it's a real movie to watch. Five college teams analyze clues in a night race around Los Angeles, and try to reach the finish line first. Look for the cameo of Paul Reubens. From the cheese music to the disco scene with the bold twins, it is an essential 1980s movie that you will love.
