Somewhere on IMDb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all time (Spielberg, Copolla and others are mentioned there). The biggest argument was Spielberg and whether he was a good director or not. The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a master technician, most of his films don't have depth. Saving Ryan is really out of a technical point of view, but his message is boring and although it is very entertaining, it doesn't matter to you. AN is the best film I've ever seen, because it combines good shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things, from the war in general, the clash of civilizations, the state of the soldier in war (is a soldier a hero or a killer Brando says he is not, the French lady says he is both ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they are trying to argue whether these points are true or false. But a big movie, and a great art in general, is supposed to spark arguments, not to solve them. Maybe Coppola is right, or maybe he's not, no one holds the truth anyway. You can watch this movie for its outer beauty, wonderful scenes, great acting and memorable quotes and you'll be completely satisfied. But what really makes this movie is a masterpiece of its inner quality. You can't help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary. But Copolla and Moore face similar problems, but while Copolla is out of objective, Moore takes a very partisan position which is really the point of a documentary ... It's really a shame that a movie like Fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious award like Cannes. But anyway, if you want to understand a bit of the Vietnam war, the war in Iraq, World War II and any war in general, you should definitely see this movie and not the other ...
