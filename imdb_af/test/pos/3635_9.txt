In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is his mother's youngest son who has been calling for five years continuously. Being a young man, he falls in love with Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen-year-old teenager who dreams of seeing the world and becoming an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates in a sensational television program and promises to travel in the fifty years or die for love with a deadly machine he invented it. Fifty years later, Antônio (Paulo Autran) tries to try what was wrong in his journey. <br /> <br /> "A Máquina" is one of the best Brazilian movies I've seen recently. The refreshing and original story is a poetic and magical love festival that will excite the most skeptical and difficult viewer in unique romance. The direction is excellent; the script is wonderful; the cinematography and colors are wonderful; The movie by Gustavo Falcão, the icon Paulo Autran and Mariana Ximenes is fantastic, with wonderful lines; The soundtrack features some beautiful Brazilian songs that highlight Geraldo Azevedo and Rento Rocha's "Dia Branco". Spreading this movie overseas, please help me and rent it or buy the DVD, because I know you will love the story that will bring you into tears. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Máquina ?? o Combustível e o Amor" ("The machine? The fuel is love")
