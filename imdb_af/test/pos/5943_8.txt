What a pleasure. It's really a parody. Only French people can do that kind of thing without being rough. And as a result, you're spending a lot of time watching Jean Dujardin play dumb. Most of the movies are on his shoulders, and he has them wide enough to make this movie a good one. He has the perfect way to overdo the James Bond kind of man, for example, he is not for Mike Meyers in Austin Powers. The dialogues are also good enough to keep the spectator's attention, with many silly jokes, it's really perfect. Both women with the chapters in the movie compared to the main character, and it was a challenge. There isn't really a plot in this movie, but that's not what is expected in this movie. You just want to laugh for one hour 40 minutes, and that's exactly what the movie is going to do. It deserves the success it has in France
