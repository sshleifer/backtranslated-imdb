Heya Denver fans! The animation is also a cartoon's classic and also one of my favorite (and yes, it is also broadcast in Europe including my small Central European country, Slovenia!) :) Oh, how am I going to miss the 80's cartoons! ! Honestly, they were better than today's children's performances. More imaginative, creative, full of fun with good morals, more substance, great storyline and excellent character voices. Computer animated shows today do not have all these features. So all of you who agree and want to bring all the shows back so that today's kids will see the entertainment that these cartoons brought to us, please sign on the side posted and sign a petition for a repeat of the 80's. best cartoons! <br /> <br /> http://www.thepetitionsite.com/ 1 / our-want-an-80s kids cartoon kids display channel <br /> <br /> Carpe Denver! =) <br /> <br /> Lay
