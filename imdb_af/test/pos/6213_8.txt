Let's get it out of the way, so those looking for this page are looking for information about anything related to the word "Tits" (and you know who you are, googlers): it's in no way pornographic. On the contrary, if it has value as masturbation material, the filmmaker has honestly not done a good job, as the goal is to keep it on the subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and society and health and so on. Indeed, I would be a bit wary of the one who got it on DVD or, if ever playing again, last night on HBO or Cinemax and used it as a pleasure. You might as well go to the supermarket and get some ripe melons and take them home and push them and you get the idea. <br /> <br /> No, it is semi-serious movie - meant for low night vision, but it should not be just for the late night types. It is intimate in the essay but not in tone. All the women, in all their variety of shapes and sizes, and varieties, and even with one man thrown in with false breasts, have something of value to say, from life experience in the simplest way. When I say semi-seriously, it is thanks to the several small segments the director feels she should throw in, with the archives of old "how-to" videos about puberty and sex and breasts and super-rare cartoons with the bells flying about. It's not a problem, but an asset: we need a few small visual ways to go between these interviews. <br /> <br /> Nothing is held back, and we consider it feminism in a liberating form: do not need to be covered, and even if they choose not to wear their tops, they are still open, like a natural part of their body that is an object of sex, surprise, comfort, discomfort, curiosity, motherhood, and unhappy cancer. In the latter part there is another brave step, because we see a woman who survived her cancer with just one breast. You know you're mature and an adult when you can see this woman who somehow goes on with a semi-normal life with one breast (the most bittersweet moment is when she says if a fairy tale grandmother said she can have one wish to have two full breasts, she must think about it), and you sob or go "eww, rough." It's the test, people. <br /> <br /> It is not shot under the best of circumstances, but again for TV, it is modified with a tight fit. It is never dull, and we never feel like someone is back, especially if a man can hear the hard truth, such as breasts may not be erotic, or that some men may have a flat breast. Brushes: A documentary is about myth analysis with real faces and breasts and thoughts and hearts laid bare. If it's worth being a "I was alone" session, then, more power for you, I think, though it's not the intention.
