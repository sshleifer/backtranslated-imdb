An Opera diva has an accident, which leaves the door open for her suppression to take over. Betty (Marsillach) is now the star of Mac Beth, but someone hiding in the trenches has an opera of his own. He gets his kicks to tie up Betty, place needles under her eyes (so she can't close) and kill the members of the opera company in front of her. <br /> <br /> "Opera" is definitely one of Argento's more ambitious films, such as mixing it with Shakesphere's Macbeth, the fact that the opera performed in the film is Giuseppe Verdi's version of Macbeth is, but also Argento, just like Shakespeare uses the rawe as a sign of death and accident. And as the ravens surround the castle Dunsinane, leaving the death of Macbeth's rogue, the ravens in OPERA play an important role in the downfall of the killer. Just as in the old play, the murderer acts on the admonition of his lover. But I don't want to say so far that OPERA is meant to be a remake of either The Phantom of the Opera or Macbeth, but the agreements are too subtle. This is just a typical Argento masterpiece, and thus he gives this otherwise basic thriller a lively tone of Gothic mysticism. Although this movie has it down like the heavy metal soundtrack just doesn't fit with this movie and the final scenes in this movie are a bit strange. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Opera" is something of a flawed masterpiece, but still good.
