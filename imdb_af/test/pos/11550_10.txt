Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best movie and camera guys in the business. So it should be no surprise that Pola X is an almost perfect filming of the most awesome story ever. Seriously. If I could get into my video monitor, I would have thrown Pierre within an inch of his life. No one has the right to be absorbed that self and that is stupid, both at the same time, except perhaps Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. After spending 134 minutes with Pierre, I needed a large glass of brandy. I've never been so angry with a main character. Okay, this is Pola X, a beautiful movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes I've ever seen in any movie .... which means another brilliant movie filming .... and I'm talking graphically here, casually . Pola X will beat the hell out of you, but make sure you do it if you decide to see it.
