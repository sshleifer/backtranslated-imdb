Surprisingly well-activated, well-written film about hard rockin 'but decent young man who gets so much hoped ticket: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. Not far-fetched, the film tries to keep things in perspective and doesn't go over the top; It certainly makes you think twice about those deadly adolescent fantasies to be in the music business. But the script follows, despite solid dialogue, a proven, formal pattern, and is captured by its own cliches in the final act. I enjoyed it much more than the pure fluffball "Almost Famous". It has a nice, bitter edge to deal with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish can make it more memorable. ** 1/2 from ****
