We still love the movie and soundtrack "Valley Girl". I owned it on video for eons and took out the original soundtrack. I have several friends with whom I meet and we have '80's Raves' - parties where we get together and play 80's music and run "Valley Girl" on the big screen - and we're all in our 30's. We have an AWESOME time. <br /> <br /> It's all great, as you know?
