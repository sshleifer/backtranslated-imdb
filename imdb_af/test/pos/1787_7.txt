Follow up until 1965's "My Name Is Barbra", and shot in a brilliant color, "Color Me Barbra" has La Streisand alternating nostalgia, clown comedy, female romantic anxiety, and deceptive gravity for a mal-quilt hour or show- biz razzle enchanted. She is a cut and a femme fatale, a sprite and a mystery. With her Egyptian eye makeup and ever-changing hairstyles, she is also a chameleon. Her voice is rich and moving, even though some of her songs ("One Kiss," "Yesterdays") are not. The circus sequence is not as intriguing as the museum tour (with the notion of Barbra becoming the images in the paintings, an idea that works better than you might think). The circus medley (built around songs with the word "face"!) Is zealously cute without being really enchanting. Yet, it's a lively, jazz-like special - not as emotionally disappointing as My Name Is Barbra, but definitely a dying sophomore effort.
