SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> 15 PARK AVENUE: My Humble takes this movie <br /> <br /> Now, for a viewer of the cinema that is so poorly limited to mine, niche films like Parklaan 15 To make my senses too tasty. With this thought, and a soft sense of embarrassment that I haven't already seen the whole movie, I watched this movie last Saturday. There are some similarities to other works such as the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch). Of this movie, at least 3 concepts are borrowed: - <br /> <br /> a) That (at least some) truths are relative b) The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam is going into a car as the opening credit role. It is unlikely that the car ride Betty and Rita undertook in Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the object of investigation is a place that is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in Aparna's film. C) The incident that revolves around the mad beggar, again reminds the whole 'look behind Winkies' that involves a bum, but while that scary creature is a personification of something and that 'something' as well as the character per Se seamless linked to other Lynch works (note the fractured long hair), the effect of the beggar in 15 PA seems to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message <br /> <br /> The other movies, of which 15 PA are also borrowed, are Blow Up (especially the last scene is a throwback to the truth vs. perceived truth post that is presented at the end of Antonioni's masterpiece). Of course, the professor and schizophrenia corner also brings a beautiful thought. Although, although the subject here is high eyebrow physics and Shabana, who confesses it, it eventually accidentally becomes the brilliant contrast to the outrageous hallucinations of Konkona's character through those many prophecies. In an outstanding scene in the movie, some of these elements are placed together and the scene cuts back and forth from the 'real' world of Shabana where Quantum Physics and Relativity theory justifies the finite and composition of the universe, after the artificial construction of the 'believe believe' world of Mithi But for all their differences the sisters are alike. Both are unable to form long-term relationships - one out of the question and the other from nature. So, Mithi's pain to reject Joydeep in love is in harmony with Shaban's inability to form a special bond with Kunal (Dhritiman) or Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I'm coming to myself. Viewers tend to see this movie in one of two ways: - <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 1: "It was Shabana long ago." There is a certain part of the audience thinking that way. But the explanation is not only too far-fetched, but also confronted, as it would mean dreaming so many other characters (ie all the characters she suggested as visualizing Mithi with her). Hypothesis 2: "There was a real Mithi and the end is a metaphor." This POV says the movie's essence is summarized in a dialogue in the film, in response to a statement by Joy (Rahul Bose), that Mithi is looking for something she will never find, his wife, Laxmi (Shefali Shah) , philosophy that we are all indeed looking for the illusory utopia, the end of the rainbow in which happiness and contentment seem to be <br /> <br /> There are other lesser possibilities that are not so much embraced by our knowledgeable audience not, like: - <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 3: "Shabana and Konkona are alter egos of the same person." Hypothesis 4: "Shabana is also an image of Mithi's imagination" Hypothesis 5: "The old, haggard, perhaps angry, beggar is the true protagonist of the story." <br /> <br /> Are these hypotheses worthy of even tested? Well, your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> "Why is Park Avenue 15?" Contrary to popular perception that she thinks of Park Avenue in NY, I believe she got the name of the brand of a semi-popular bathing place. Remember, Jo Jo's profession as "Prime Minister of Shikakai", which, as you may know, is a popular ingredient used in the manufacture of shampoos. The prefix '15' is used as it was on December 15 that Mithi got engaged to Joydeep and after his outing she remains forever in a time shift. The film has its fair share of defects. Lack of use of a strong background score, which can really extend the story into movies like this, some messy dialogues that are unabated by some forced dialogue. Inconsistent performances (Shabana and Dhritimaan are excellent, though IMO) by some of the role players although many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted. Shefali Chaya's sudden uncertainty about her husband seems to be an unimaginable dimension in the plot. I give it 7/10 as it made me think, but not higher, because I can easily find his sources of inspiration and have experienced it before (and mostly enjoy it). I've already thought of similar lines. So, the experience after 15 PA is bound to be some degree of novelty. Where do I come from? I gave 9.5 / 10 to '36 Chowringhee Lane '(although rumors still exist that one Satyajit Ray ghost regulates it), 7.5 to' Paromiter Ek Din ', 7 for' Mr and Mrs Iyer 'and 5 for 'Paroma'. At an existential level it has not used my interest, not even as much as a "Truman Show"
