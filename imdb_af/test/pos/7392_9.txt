I think this movie is different from most movies I've seen. It was somehow exciting and no matter what others say, I was surprised at the final solution. Certainly did not see it! Although sad, it's worth looking at. I can't think of any movie that would be like that! Actors knew what they were doing. If you say this movie sucks, you probably say what most people would say. But if someone says this movie is alive, I absolutely disagree. And Norman Reedus should be noticed more. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm freak, but I liked it very much. It was kind of mess, but what cares? I'm tired of boring and ordinary movies.
