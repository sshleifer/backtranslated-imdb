Just finished Zombie Bloodbath part one on the amazing Zombie Bloodbath Trilogy DVD from CAMP Motion Pictures. Zombie Blood Bath 2: Craze of the undead is the next. Now this one made me a little confused because of some plot holes and some confusing twists and turns here and there, but it's a better movie on many levels. Director Todd Sheets really shows a big leap in style and talent between the two films. Once again, it's not for people who want glamor and Hollywood-style Horror movies, it's for people who keep their zombies bloody, raw and grainy. The story I could tell was basically about two robbers trying to steal an elderly couple in 1945 to find that the couple are members of a cult. One man is simply killed and the other, one in control, is basically inverted and crucified in a scarecrow. They are standing in the nearby field, still alive, but dying. Cut to date and a bus full of college kids break off near a farmhouse. At the same time, a group of prisoners escaped from a nearby prison. Both groups end up at the same house. The house was the one who combined the elderly to live in and when one of the prisoners breaks down the scarecrow and takes it jacket, causing the scarecrow to wake up and bring back the cult members from death. Wow. And that's all in the first half hour. There is also another plot in the town where a number of serial killers took certain workers to a deli hostage. It actually works, however, as the people trapped in the house finally escape and end up in the same Deli. Most of the twists work pretty well, but it is clear that the movie was just too complex in some places for its own good. It ends up in a giant revelation with the remaining heroes finding a delivery truck or something full of meat eating bacterial vials. Of course, they throw it at the dead and cause some great melting and a few heads to explode and then we get a strange thought. First, let me say that although it wasn't always easy to follow, I had another good time with this movie. It was nice and the acting was pretty good for a low budget effort. It was clear that Todd Sheets was really trying to bring more to the table than a typical zombie movie, and in that respect he succeeded. It had better special effects than the first movie, a great pacing and some cool music and visuals, plus there's a real shot of a lap from inside a mouth, as a knife is trapped by it. Care has been taken here and it shows. The weakness lies in the dissertation and in some of the lower performances. Again, I recommend listening to the commentary track. It was even better than the first one and I learned a lot. Like finding out that some of the screens were shot at the Super 8 movie for effect and that the movie came back from the lab and they couldn't use it. And they've been filming the movie when they got the movie back, so some confusion comes from some scenes that aren't in the movie. I also learned that Todd Sheets really has a passion and love to make Horror movies. It shows. The movie is a good example of no budget cinema that could be rewritten once more, but still with more style than most DV movies I see. Not as nice as the first movie, though a better movie technically. I really admire Sheets as one of the true innovators and trailblowers in the field of DV theater ... and this one is a great addition to the cheapo zombie genre!
