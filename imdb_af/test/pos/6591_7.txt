Ernesto is a man who makes a living to push other solid citizens of their hard-earned money. Along with Manco, an older man with a lot of experience, he pulls out hijackers that allow him to make a decent living, but it doesn't make him a rich man in any way. Give Federico, an older man who has more experience in the art of deception. Together with the younger Ernesto, they prove a winning combination. It just goes to Pilar, Federico's former love interest, to appear in the picture. <br /> <br /> This Spanish film directed by Miguel Bardem is light in tone and pleasing to go through. Other, better-made caper films are made with very clever pieces than this one, but the movie is easy to take and sometimes it has very funny situations. <br /> <br /> This viewer will see Federico. Luppi read in anything, even the phonebook! He is an actor's actor. We had the privilege of presenting him in the Buenos Aires stage, excellent work for his international film career. As Federico, he does what he does best. It is impossible to suggest someone better in his role. Ernesto Alterio, the son of Hector Alterio, is a young actor who promises to have a good career. Victoria Abril makes Pilar fun as she gets involved with these men. Miguel Alexandre, a veteran actor, is also good as Manco.
