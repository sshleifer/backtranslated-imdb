Jean-Pierre Melville is a director I recently became familiar with (I have to see Bob le Flambeur and Le Samourai again to fully understand them), but in Le Cercle Rouge (The Red Circle), presumably based on saying in Buddhism) I realized I had been watching and absorbing a crime movie for quite some time. Although his film has a dialogue, it is mainly to keep the plays of the film, based on the plot. That kept me informed, even in seemingly everyday scenes / rows, was the emphasis on the characters' movements, or behavior patterns. Melville explained his story, and he is careful to take his time to tell it (it may seem boring to someone, but he seems to be working as he places emphasis on the weight of characters / environments on plot) . <br /> <br /> Just look at each of the four main players: Alain Deleon as Corey (just released from jail, scheduled a new lift), Gian Maria Volonte as Bird (escaping and on the lamb of hand-held custody, met Corey with luck), Yves Montand as Jansen (an elderly pro with years of experience with weapons, a friend of Vogel), and Andr√© Bourvil as Mattei (an experienced investigator, who is on the lookout for Vogel) on his tone with internal matters). Each of these actors plays their parts with precision, debauchery, and they each have their own kinds of moments that indicate to the audience their personalities as criminals and police. For example, the hoist ranges give a few tips, such as how bird feels cops-a-feel of a female statue while leaving the halls, or how Jansen leaves a bottle and just has a flute of content (and what does this man dream about create). Even Corey's movements with a photograph of a woman arouse interest. <br /> <br /> As absorbent and cool, the story becomes, and so great is the skill to make it happen (via the cinematographer Henri Decae, the editing and musical score by Eric Demarsan), it's up to the people the screen It gets fascinated, in how they stay true to their nature and ideals. Not a movie that is being missed by French new golf enthusiasts, and today's crime movie buffers may want to take the 140 minutes to clear the atmosphere of Melville's work. A suave piece of movie-making that still ranks as one of my all-time favorites.
