I enjoyed it very much for TV movies. I was channel surfing, and came at the beginning of the movie. Son, I'm glad I stopped. This movie has a real hot cast as well as a semi-credible plot. There is drama, comedy, action, and best of all, the human nature aspect of this movie is what makes it good. I hope it comes out on Video because I will buy a copy. Rating ... 9 out of 10 stars
