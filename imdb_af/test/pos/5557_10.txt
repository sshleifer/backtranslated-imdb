Faqrscape is really one of the shows that has everything, great acting, great role, great writing, sets, chemistry, muppets ... it has everything and then a few except a house. This fantastic series seems to be all but ending. TPTB seems to think it's a series of sequential single set shows, when anyone who sees, knows, is an ongoing, one-epic, love story that has an end to be seen. If you've never watched Farscape, do a favor and watch it out on DVD when season 1 will be released in October. And Season 2 is the best there is! Watch the reruns on the SciFi channel to catch up and then start the new season in January to March when most performances are in the hiatis and be sure to watch. If everything goes well, we will end!
