Many people make fun of Steven Seagals' acting abilities. And I really see why if I remember. Well ... ok his other movies are acceptable (regarding his acting!). <br /> <br /> After reading reviews about The Patriot, I didn't expect anything from this movie. I hardly came through Fire Down below and I read a lot that The Patriot was even worse. So I was very surprised at this one. In my opinion, this is one of his best films. If it had more action sequences and a few more fighting tones, it would be best. I like the story directing and the actors. Cammilla Belle was just incredible. She will have a good film career in the future. The few action scenes were made very well. And Steven Seagal was very credible in his unusual role.
