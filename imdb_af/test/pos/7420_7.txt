Terry and June were, in my opinion, one of the classic British sitcoms. You knew what to expect - and it's not that typical! :) Unlike modern sitcoms with completely confronted plots, this display is still a fresh air. How do you love to see or hear comments about bodily functions or to leave a family PERPETUEL for breakfast or a family with impossible teens. And there is the secret: Terry and June were based on a middle-class couple living in relative harmony, instead of today's teams with the 'de rigueur' dysfunctional family (made to look hip). Personally, I voted the "Bridge to Far" as one of the best. Terry's antics reminds me of Basil Fawlty. Sometimes they become almost indescribable! <br /> <br /> Terry and June are highly recommended. Get your tea and cookies right!
