John Carpenter shows how much he loves the original 1951 by giving it the greatest respect he possibly can. The only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoid core of John W Campbell Jr's short story. The secret of the success of this version is the unbearable tension that builds up when the group of men becomes suspicious of each other. The pressure of literally waiting to be taken over takes a terrible hold. Writers manage the shocks as well as the riddle needed to keep the movie heading in the right direction. If it's a terrible scene or "in the shade", the movie is a perfect merger of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is about to try for a group of men to keep it under force, and Carpenter's score is a wonderful horror pulse that closes the feeling of punishment and paranoia through the film. The film is excellent, a solid compilation of actors led by Carpenter fave Kurt Russell, while the effects used make the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it is the end that the crowning glory is, an end that does not come down to the norm and is incredibly suitable for what goes on before. Let's wait and see what happens 10/10.
