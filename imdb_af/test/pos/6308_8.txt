I saw it the week it opened four years ago and I really didn't know what to expect at the moment to be unfamiliar with Sorrentino's work. He created a very intriguing and finally moving account of a strange character, one for which the phrase "life for life" is no longer applicable. It provoked me at every turn and I was constantly surprised by the story. I really enjoyed the pacing and the way I was gradually given the pieces to find out what was going on. Tony Servillo is wonderful, just like Magnani. It opens with a brilliant stylish wide shot and ends with a very moving image that captures the film in a sublime area. I thought for a long time of the main character and the position in which he was and his final fate and I didn't shake it for weeks. I recently bought the movie and the final scene he thinks of his friend gets me every time. I still don't have to talk to anyone who saw it. It is a pity that it did not reach a wider audience as if it were the direction of Italian theater, it could only be a good thing.
