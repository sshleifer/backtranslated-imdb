It was 1983 and I was 13. I spent one night looking at Valley Girl on HBO when my parents worked. After I ended it, I immediately wanted to talk to someone about it. It turned out my best friend also watched it and it became our favorite movie. Every weekend we looked at it until we could recite it. We woke her parents up late at night and laughed hysterically. We worshiped the main character, Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I'm not saying it's a good classic. Although it is personal to me. And I understand that the whole Valley Girl is getting annoying, but it was the 80's. But deep in the heart of the film, it's a love story and a well-known but good one. Meisie meets son and there are sparks from both sides, a direct connection. Julie's friends don't like him. He didn't fit in, didn't go to their school, didn't have money. They love her better with her ex-boyfriend, the soccer player, even though he's a while. She made the ultimate sacrifice - her own happiness for her friends' happiness. And she has these really cool supporting hippie parents. It's one of Nicholas Cage's first movies and his first starring role. One minute he is absolutely hilaries and the next incredibly touch and romantic. His friend Fred is also funny. If you were a teenager in the 80's, you will love this movie, or at least it will bring back memories. It's no longer my favorite movie, but it's still one of my favorites, probably in my top 10. I'm eagerly awaiting the release on DVD if they ever release it. You can go to Deborah Foreman's website to sign a petition to get it out on DVD and there are 2 soundtracks of the movie you should have if you want music from the 80's.
