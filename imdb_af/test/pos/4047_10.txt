It's probably one of my favorite movies. It tells the story of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age. So it was bought by her father. She falls in love with the Bell boy, named Kai. On her birthday, however, the Snow Queen (Bridget Fonda) arrives at the hotel that owns and abducts her father. Gurda then goes to Kai and follows him through the four seasons in an effort to save him. <br /> <br /> I thought it was an excellent adaptation of the story with good performances by all role players. It has wonderful special effects and the story fits very well and is easy to follow. I think it's a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. I watched it every time t went on, as it came out and never tired, so I gave it a 10!
