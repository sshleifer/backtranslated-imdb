Nightbreed blows my mind the first time I've seen it. And it kept quite well over the years. The sets and sample effects work are of the best I've ever seen. No one I know saw this movie, which I thought was in the box because of the lack of interest in horror in the early nineties. It plays like a dark, horrific fairy tale, and is much deeper, then you think, with a strong message against bigotry, presented by a rich mystical past created by Clive Barker. What is struggling is the movie ends on a very cool follow-up letter, which we will probably never see. My only wrath is that Craig Sheffer is at best just a sensible actor, and the project might have benefited from a better actor in that part. Just a small complaint, although Sheffer does well. I had a similar problem with Scott Bakula in Barker's Lord Of Illusions, not really a terrible show, but I just didn't have it in the role, as much as I would have other people.
