Toy Soldiers is a good action movie, but what really stands out is the amount of effort accurately portrayed by screenwriters and directors to portray US terrorist forces. Just look at the end credits - there are more than a dozen US military officials and officials listed. The film accurately portrays the FBI as control over the hostage situation, but turns it over the US Army's Delta Force (which is called in the movie because the Pentagon is denying their existence at the moment) after the President's Posse Commitatus Act of US code. The American armies at the end are accurately dressed and armed for the time being. And even using an AH-64 Apache for air support - which may look a little over, is not very unrealistic. Much more expensive and honestly better films portrayed US counter-terrorist forces with far less accuracy.
