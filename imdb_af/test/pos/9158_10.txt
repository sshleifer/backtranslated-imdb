As I recall, my family made a point of staying home at night. "Nichols" was on (Mondays? Tuesdays? NBC?). It was an excellent vehicle for James Garner, very well written, large ensemble cast. His character likes the "Support Your Local ..." movies: Retired gambler with mysterious past settles in the town and has adventures every week. In fact, it was pretty obvious that it was the same character. It was just a charmer of a TV show. A sleeper, like "My world and welcome to it", which may have been its contemporary - I forget. I wish these shows will be made available on DVD. It was just good TV. Maybe "Briscoe County Jr." Come close, but just a mile.
