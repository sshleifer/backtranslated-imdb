To be honest, I was totally inspired by the original concept of 'Sleeper Cell.' After watching the best part of the series on FX Channel (UK), my Sky lost meaning, I missed out on the important final. But what I saw about it, I assumed it was a good story line, good acting and if I didn't look '24', I thought it was great, and it was confirmed for a second season. <br /> <br /> One of the best TV shows I've seen. Much more realistic and credible than "24." Excellent character development and plot line. Don't believe Islam, but give a thoughtful and judicious approach, which shows the difference between radical terrorist Islam and true Islam. Everyone should see this show! <br /> <br /> Stringy xx
