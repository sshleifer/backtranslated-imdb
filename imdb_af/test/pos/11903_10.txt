Finally, a gangster movie is worth watching! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tily must be nominated for her role as a difficult murder of femme fatale! <br /> <br /> This movie is flying like a bird, just a quick non stop Gangster Mayhem! <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tily is just as beautiful and bad in this movie. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to find Faye Dunaway, stay alive! The movie in this movie is so equipped with their roles. <br /> <br /> A real cool soundtrack rides alongside and you are swept into the Spanish soul of this movie. <br /> <br /> The story was originally deep and poetic. <br /> <br /> <br /> This Flick has lots of Substance and never rest. <br /> <br /> The gang of the Spanish Fire just set everything on the screen on fire. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa is a joy to watch and a movie star. <br /> <br /> Come back and enjoy the ride.
