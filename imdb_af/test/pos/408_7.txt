There are 3 of these movies, all produced in the same way and each very amusing. Red Play Radio Keys Wally Benton, also known as The Fox, played in solving real-life crimes with his fianc√©, is played by your typical war girl next door viewer Ann Rutherford. Many of the one-liners and gags are stupid and probably in the 1940s I was expecting. But just as much has made me laugh aloud, which was the least unexpected. Red Skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence, surprisingly I say because I grew up with a much older version of the man whose charm didn't really play well in my formidable years. I have to get these movies going, although you're in the mood for this kind of nostalgic prize. I almost threw in the heart, but in truth people are being wasted and beaten and I dare say, the tension is sometimes above average. As with most movies of this era, it gets a PI (politically flawed) rating for reasons you can suggest. Quarter time is funny, so I think, and again this is movies. Look at one, look at them all.
