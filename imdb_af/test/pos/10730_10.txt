Certainly when I saw this movie at HBO, I was a bit bumpy to follow the plot, but it gets my attention when I see Dustin Hoffman in it. Honestly, I'm not worried about watching old movies, but in the long run it changes my point of view. As this stirring film made me experience, I tore my tears again and suddenly my tears rolled into my cheek and then I lost a heavy sigh to realize the impact of what I just saw. Kramer vs Kramer was indeed one of the best classic drama movies I've seen long ago, even though I couldn't imagine myself touching it. The story was highly emotional, but not so saturated. The characters were not unrealistic for their roles; they have features that viewers see in the movie, such as the role of Meryl Streep. She was a mother who had honestly acknowledged her mistakes, but then she was confident of raising her emotional motives to get what she wanted in a righteous and square struggle. Dustin Hoffman was very outstanding, I can't even understand how this guy can play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role that is completely different, then it did well. Although I have seen the movies many times, when I sit and watch my house scan, and get Kramer vs Kramer a while, my experience will be another valuable moment.
