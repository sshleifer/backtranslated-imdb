I don't understand why it was so underestimated on IMDb. This movie is just the perfection. The better adjustment of all times of Tarzan's myth! As French I can say that it is the better role of Christophe Lambert, ridiculous in many movies, but here is absolutely wonderful, charismatic, incredible! The plot is great, well said, the story is great, the direction, the atmosphere, the music, everything is perfect! How to believe these sequences with the Elgar music is simply perfect. <br /> <br /> Greystoke is really an amazing movie, underestimated here, I don't really know why, but much appreciated
