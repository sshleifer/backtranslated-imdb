I played this game exactly after watching the trailer in the old magazine advertising CD. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting and dark atmospheric (lacking in current games / movies). The game is settled somewhere in the mid 90's in the spooky mysterious mansion. You play as Adam Randell and your quest is to free the soul of your deadly father. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the game is criminal, but many different types of games. Lots of action, different puzzles, quest, mazes and many more interesting places and characters are presented in this old classic game. <br /> <br /> The game will only run on Windows 98 and there is no patch for Windows. XP.
