I heard interesting critics on this movie. I believed it was a love story, but I wasn't sure what the plot was. When I finally saw it, I found myself in the midst of a love affair between former Isabel (Isabel Ampudia) and the junkie Rufo (Sebastián Haro). So, a love story, but probably not what I expected. <br /> <br /> The movie is focused on Isabel as she struggles to return to society. She doesn't want to return to her area and finds herself without a home or anywhere to go. So, while experiencing the first freedom of liberty only after she was released from prison, she found Rufo, an old acquittal of her, who, while in bed, became a junkie and lived on the streets. She did not go where to go, and without money or feasible source of income, she decided to join Rufo at his residence: a covered area on a lonely street. <br /> <br /> The story moves in itself. It explains how the impossible relationship between Isabel and Rufo gets deeper to the almost final turn of the movie. Definitely, the movie is worth watching. Sebastián Haro is beautiful in his role of the junkie. A person who is capable of being both an innocent and gentle person and a relentless street scam. Just depending on who's dealing with him. I believe his role. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I don't believe the role of Isabel Ampudia. Although the movie tries to show the bitterness in her through several scenes, she is unable to believe me. She is in a way too sweet and too honest for what can be expected of someone in the same situation. <br /> <br /> The movie is trying to show a love in a desperate situation. It's a nice movie. But the feeling I get when the movie ends is that Isabel, with the way of thinking and acting, could never get into the situation. Her role, partly because of the writing, partly because of the acting, is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I especially like the end, so I increased my rating one or two points. I liked his bittersweetness and the fact that it sometimes happens is that the survival instinct is beyond spiritual considerations other than love. <br /> <br /> Summary, an interesting movie, but it has remained a punch to be a "must see" total.
