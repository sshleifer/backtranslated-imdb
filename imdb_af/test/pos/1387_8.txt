Okay, I'm not going to agree with the previous comments that criticized this show. I think this show is fantastic. (I mean when Jasmin Weber was still on and Franzi was still alive!). And I was surprised to learn that it was categorized as a soap, because it didn't look the same and felt like soap in America. Soaps here are absolutely horrible! At least GZSZ movies in place, contain real music and more acceptable story lines. In addition, GZSZ's actions are largely credible, especially with Josephine Schmidt and Felix Jascheroff. (Plus, soap actors are some of the most difficult workers in the business as they have the most demanding work schedules). If it is ratings, it should do something right; Soaps in America are shown daily and have historically always had rock-bottom ratings. Give GZSZ a chance! Trust me, that's good!
