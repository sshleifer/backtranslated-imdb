I had a terrible day, but this movie grabbed me and I couldn't put it to the end. And I forgot about my terrible day. and the end ... by the way ... where's the sequel !!! <br /> <br /> Of course, the budget is extremely low ... but ... see what they did with it! it reminds me of a play ... they basically work with a tent, an "escape speed", some guns, uniforms, camping tools and a "scanner" thing. this is for props. Perhaps it is even a good thing, forcing the acting and writing to step up and take their rightful place in film, because the centers of work, rather than effects, have excused CGI battles ( starwars). <br /> <br /> The CGI is good. It's not exactly 'seamless' ... but imho still works. why? Because there is not too much of it, and what is there is not 'takeover' with an army of bonds, home people trying to get hold of everything they can do in the lap. it asks the imagination ... these are some relatively simple things, with decent composition (especially the heavy cargo ship shot. there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds ... which follows the entire length of the ship ... Over the past 10 years, this must have been a record for creating a sci-fi series series, having an action series lasting longer than 0.75 seconds, and a few links with the story. It may look old or not state of the art, but it doesn't seem stupid and it doesn't take away from the story. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, except that the characters die too quickly. to get to know them. The captain was big, but a few of his screens could have used another task. I also became confused with his character, which she lost cool and bumped into a body, I think like captains are calmly cool and in control ... what happened in that scene? Did the other crew worry about losing it at that moment? did he feel he was losing control? <br /> <br /> Now, as for the plot .... mostly it's good ... why? Because it doesn't try to explain itself. It just doesn't happen. It's called 'the planet', it's a mystery, does it get? No one knows why there is a statue, and they do not find out. The mysterious cult? The strange scientist with the tattoo? What do you expect to find out in less than 90 minutes? It is not war and peace. And, thank you, it's not star wars either. No midichlores, no 5 minute exhibiting boring dialogue that has no purpose in the story. The characters are stranded and can only find a few basic things. It's not a star chase where they find out if it is Leonardo Davinci or a child like a space walker. It's mysterious, and I like it. I don't know why, maybe I can identify with these guys more, as they don't know what is happening, and I don't ... they don't talk very spooky or talk what happens. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would argue that one of the worst moments is when the "traitor" turns to the crew and tries the reason for the planet, the cult, and so on. to explain. It happened to be the worst dialogue, imho, in the whole movie, and it interrupted the flow and some of the characters seem unnatural in that scene. <br /> <br /> OK, sometimes I feel it was a little too mysterious. Like, why did the man roast through his eyes with lightning? It was strange. Just strange. The 'hamlet' ends ... again, I'd like to know these characters. And would it have been so difficult to have a 30 second rescue scene in the end? It's not a series show, it was a movie, and we like closing in movies, even if they can have a prosecution. Imagine that with no flight of angels will Hamlet sing you to rest. <br /> <br /> Anyway. What can I say. It was worth paying the dollar I paid at the 'red box' machine at the supermarket. It was also a better story than starwars part 1 2 or 3. As I said, it sucked me in, wanted to know what's going on and I couldn't stop looking to the end.
