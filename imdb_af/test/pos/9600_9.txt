Can't believe Bostock's Cup is not available on real video or DVD. I only saw it once, taken on a dodgy copy of the TV and despite not being a footy fan, thought it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The well-known slope of wherever it was, the clueless coach driver ("Ponty-it, Ponty-dat", "I'll take the next exit"), the useless plot; It all got it. In the US I am desperate for some good British humor, but not quite enough to spend the amount the production company is asking for. Let's get it on kosher DVD pronto.
