Even for sci-fi this movie the movie is a bit out there. Good, more than a little ... My first thought after looking at it was that I just thought. <br /> <br /> Don't expect this movie to expect another Darko. Darko fans never like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, come over. <br /> <br /> Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel foolish because you don't understand the 'deeper meaning' the first time you see it. To be honest, I had to see The Box twice before I liked it. <br /> <br /> The deeper meaning (saving you a lot of sociological psychobabs). People serve themselves, we make decisions that can destroy our lives and do not open an email without a return address. <br /> <br /> Summary: Creepy old man tells Cammeron Diaz if you press the button, I'll kill someone you don't know and give you a million dollars. Of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy guy you get a case of money. Then the movie takes a dip in the unusual. To save my fingers, tap ... To push the button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien creatures, in an extensive experiment to satisfy the morality of humanity. <br /> <br /> I like: The willingness of the movie to ignore the generic movie guidelines. It's different. Its intense. It has a deeper meaning (though its philosophy is 101 material). It makes you guess. Not a Hollywood ending! <br /> <br /> I didn't like: Why would any creature with technology to inhibit another life form make such a ridiculous scheme? Which god like alien has the patience for this? Diaz was good, but was there a need for the country accent? They live in Virginia. <br /> <br /> I give it a 7 because Kelly didn't pay much attention to detail than to his other movies. Overall good movie.
