It's a good movie, no doubt, but with some strange aspects. Without spoiling it, it only finds 3 places: a Sicilian farm, the boat and Ellis Island New York. All shots are near, so we never see a broad whip of anything. I wonder if this would save money? No street screens anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in the vicinity. And the music ... that was going on Earth with Nina Simone songs, decades before they were out? I could also have done business without the milk river ...... But before you think of me as a pure abuse, let me repeat it, it's a very good movie, with sad moments, wonderful photography, great characters and more accuracy than the usual (American) attempts at the immigration experience.
