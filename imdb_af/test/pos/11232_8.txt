When Northfork made a debut at the Cannes Film Festival, many people didn't like it because they felt it was boring and too slow. While I agree that it was slow (one of the slowest movies of the year), it wasn't boring at all. As Roger Ebert said, there has never been a movie like Northfork. "I don't usually agree with Ebert, but for once he speaks the truth. Although John Sayles' Sunshine State may have some of the same immediate themes, nothing I have ever seen or known can even compare to the striking originality of the Polish Brothers Northfork. <br /> <br /> Northfork is a perfect example of how many times it is better to take an extra few minutes to go to an art movie instead of the latest Jack Black movie. The plot is not a cut, cookie cutter plot; it is just as strikingly original. A small town in Montana named Northfork has a dam nearby that is about to take off. That is why the whole town must be evacuated. However, some people just don't want to leave. In a silk plot, a young orphan (Duel Farnes) is very sick and sad; He is cared for by Father Harlan (Nick Nolte). The boy suggests himself as a fallen angel, so to speak, who helps him through his illness. <br /> <br /> Although much of the movie is straight, it can take a while for David Lynch. money. There are strange weather patterns, a strange, wood, big dog thing and symbolism that makes Fellini proud. It's not as general confusing as a Lynch movie, but it's rather strange. That's what makes Northfork so good: it's so out of the ordinary and yet so simple and plausible. <br /> <br /> Northfork has a magical feeling: it's almost like you're watching something you're not quite sure What it is, but you feel captivated by it. As I said earlier, I agreed with Ebert on how this movie is different from any other. However, I don't agree when he says it's "not entertaining". He continues to say it is "encouraging". Perhaps he thought he should give it good reviews because everyone is different, but instead of how slow it was, I still thought it was very entertaining, something that many dramas can't do now. <br /> <br /> Northfork may not be the fastest movie or most popular movie, but if you can get there, you'll be very surprised, as I was. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> Valued PG-13 for short sexuality.
