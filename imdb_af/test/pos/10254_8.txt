... Instead, consider it a great upcoming story about African American men in the mid-1960s in Chicago's ghettos. For anyone under the age of 50, "What is happening" is a light-hearted, rather exciting, sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted for four years (1975-1979) on a group of young American high school children living in a working classroom. I really enjoyed it - it has no connection with this movie. "Cooley High" started out as the basis for "What's Happening", but its serious nature did not register well with the test audiences, and it was redesigned as a comedy, although the credits on What's Happening still read that it was based on this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie starts to light, but touches many aspects of life that are unique to the turbulent 1960s and other aspects of timeless growth. The guys are about sex, betrayal, unemployment, hopelessness and even early death. The end is very powerful and serious, and the movie has a good Motown soundtrack. Highly recommended. Unfortunately, this movie is not new enough to be played on premium cable channels and not considered old enough to be regarded as a classic movie and also played in the few places for those movies.
