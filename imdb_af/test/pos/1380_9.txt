I buy it for a dollar! <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for a dollar and I've seen much worse for many more !! <br /> <br /> This is a Scottish sci-fi movie by Mark Stirton and according to the Making of (hysterical by the way) the production costs only $ 8,000. It won't pay for half an hour in Hollywood! Nonetheless ---- This is the best fun movie to make. If you do things well, then you are doing a pampering. It's a rough character with rough voices and hard curse. I don't mind but my girlfriend has a friend !! The actors do a good job and it is interesting to see people I have never heard or seen. This meant I didn't know who would die first. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie because it's the latest of the latest visual effects, look at a Star Wars. The effects here are OK, but a little in space. But the samples were done very well when a little predicted. <br /> <br /> Stirton doesn't do an incredible job and I want to see her take a real Hollywood movie. The least was not predictable and I almost fell off my chair when one man shot his head !!! OK, so it is a little derivative of other sci-fi, but for this budget it's a wonderful effort. And anyone who thinks of making a sci-fi movie for 8 g's is easy or happening a lot, nothing knows about the film industry. <br /> <br /> Good points for a good movie, extra points to work so hard, extra extra points for a very interesting make. No standard bull here, all the problems of production are in making it as lost in Mancha just with a movie at the end. But why is there no comment? KEEP SCOTS!
