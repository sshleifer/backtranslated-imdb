If you watch this strange adventure movie, it's hard to believe that it's directed by the same man, giving us such a high quality Giallo classic as the Strange Fish from Mrs. Wardh and the Scorpion Tail case, but it must be said that despite being low quality production values, Island of the Fish Men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than it goes. Like many Italian films from the 1970s, it is a finishing touch to a successful American movie, the one this time, the critical island of Dr Moreau. Sergio Martino's film takes ideas like mutation, greed and adventure and forms it into one slightly compelling film, which is what it lacks in coherence and logic with a load of mostly interesting ideas. The central plot follows a boat crashing on a small island. It soon becomes clear that not everything about this place is normal, and it soon appears that half of the population has changed into "fishermen" - a cross between a man and a fish that is purely selfish. .. <br /> <br /> The truth about this movie is that it is much nicer if you ignore the trashy production values. The central monsters look completely ridiculous, and much of the movie takes place on sets that look like they cost a few pennies. But the movie is well shot, despite this, with the underwater photography a particular highlight and the pace of the film is well done because the film never gets boring. The way the plot comes together is not exactly genius, but it takes a lot of ideas and I've seen movies on plots, with far fewer thoughts in them than this one. The biggest place in the movie is definitely the lost city of Atlantis. To be honest, I'm not a massive fan of adventure movies, and so you don't see this lost city being called a lot - but it's always nice to see it in a movie. The central island location is good because it offers a suitable environment for the story and the film also provides the right amount of secrecy, as Martino uses the voodoo theme well. Overall, it's not exactly a classic and there's definitely a lot worse trashy adventure movies out there than this one.
