The movie that we gave John Waters is one of the funniest movies ever. Yes, it may be gross, but it is full of hysterical moments that no one has ever done. The notorious dog scene must be one of the highlights of the theater. Not a movie for the easily offended is one of those movies where you always see something new. Divine achievement is worth the reputation. Mink chairs are hysterical. This is the film responsible for the Farrely brothers and the entire Gross-out comedy genre. I know it sounds a bit harsh but think about it. For these comedies, much of the mill was running and almost identical. After this movie comics come strange and strange, but in a good way. I'll give it 15 out of 10 if I could.
