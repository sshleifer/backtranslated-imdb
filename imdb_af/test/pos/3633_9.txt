Years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The Machine). As I read this book again and again, I could never stop becoming more and more fascinated by the imagination of the author and the wealth of Brazilian culture. <br /> <br /> Knowing the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorite books! Well, fortunately my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art. <br /> <br /> I can't remember any other movie that can bring tears into my eyes because of the beauty. of the text. Also, I can't remember such a powerful show as Gustavo Falcão's. <br /> <br /> You can see and feel how colossal his love for Karina is. You can realize that he will move mountains and do something for this love. <br /> <br /> See this movie, look it through the eyes of the child living inside you, surprise yourself!
