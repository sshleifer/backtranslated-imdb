A group of friends broke down in the middle of nowhere (one had a flat band, the other's jeep won't secretly start). One of them takes the ties to a run-down service station and that is the last one to see from him. When the remaining fours are looking for their friend, they come across lovely Mr. Slaves that help to fix the jeep, and offer cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally descending, secure home busy. by very realistic looking mannequins. He goes with the one guy in the forest to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house. Before going, he warned them not to leave and go to the house behind his loft; He warns them about "Davy", his brother, who is left and not there. Of course, one of them decides to look for a working phone and is never seen again. Is this Sleeping? Is this Davy? The mannequins ?? Tourist Trap has the usual horror requirements (jiggly big boobed girl, goody two-shoe girl, curiosity becomes the better of people and never works out!), But it stands apart from the rest of the 70's genre in the end. an end. I started to feel sorry for Slaussen (Chuck Conners is a fantastic, creepy, over-the-top show) at one point in the movie, and you almost see Molly's character doing the same. It's a gem if you can find it; I took it off the cable when I was younger, and I got a VHS copy that was far too expensive, but it was worth it. Fans of Tanya Roberts will also not be disappointed. Best part of the movie for me was the scene with the soup (and crackers !!) <br /> <br /> I gave it a 7 because some of the movies are still hard to explain.
