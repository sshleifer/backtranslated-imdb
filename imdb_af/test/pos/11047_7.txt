Anna Christie (1930) <br /> <br /> Anna Christie has some fantastic parts, and some amazing shows, yet it should be even better than it is. It has drama. Some of the scenes are really atmospheric, and if the inside shells around the table are oblique, other shots are really exciting at night and at sea. Then there are the almost historic, vibrant scenes that are located in Coney Island (even a short jogging trail), and the episode where two women sit behind a network in separate beds, and halfway visitors can throw balls at them. test over, and the women (thinly dressed) egg the men are on are strange sexual emergence in some way. All the time, Garbo (in front of the crowd) has watches. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garbo is what makes this movie more than just a very good early talkie. She plays all sides of her character. She is concise and skeptical and in some kind of inner anxiety. She laughs and cries, withdraws and pushes out. In some ways, it's a prominent, remarkable movie (directed by Clarence Brown, which has a whole host of key films of this pre-code audio era). <br /> <br /> Although based on a successful Eugene O'Neil, this is a bit of a struggle, as the actors sometimes seem to be stepping down. Marie Dressler is great in the exaggerated way she has almost branded. And then there is Greta Garbo, who really has a natural presence, even though it looks like she is too much, but sometimes, but sometimes it is the other. Garbo is, of course, known as a silent actress, and this is her debut. Audiences loved her enough that she made a German version the following year.
