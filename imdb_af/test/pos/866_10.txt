I honestly don't know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review, so I have a difficult time describing these shorts. Let's just say there is a good amount of gay sex, some necrophils, some incest, a good amount of masturbation, and several artificial ... members. And I loved it every minute. <br /> <br /> Not that it's ALL raw humor. It's not. They mostly disappear from fart gags, with the exception of one sketch titled "Pizza" in which they use one very well. "They" are 3 / 11th of the short-lived sketch comedy group on MTV called The State, David Wain, Michael Showalter and Michael Ian Black. <br /> <br /> The trio go on adventures, usually play themselves and meet strange and unusual people, people who are often more normal than they are. The supporting role is also fantastic. Paul Rudd, Julie Bowen, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Sam Rockwell all appear in various sketches. They are also joined by The State alums such as Joe Lo Truglio and Todd Holoubek. The musical choices are also very well placed. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed these sketches over and over, but they are not for everyone because they are mostly rather vulgar. If you want smart humor that is not afraid to push the boundaries of good taste, then I strongly recommend it. If you liked Nat Hot American Summer (directed and written by Wain and Showalter) or The State, then you should really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I think it can only be ordered online. Check out their website and stream some sketches to get an idea if you really want it, and then find how to buy the DVD.
