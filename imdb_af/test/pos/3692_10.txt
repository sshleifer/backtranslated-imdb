My husband and I both loved this movie. First, my husband was skeptical and asked how many points he had got through this one. But after a few key screens he was completely sucked in and by the end he was convinced it was one of the best movies. Kathleen Bates has never been so nice and the rest of the role is just fantastic. Thanks for this beautiful movie.
