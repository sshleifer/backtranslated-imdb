Grand Champion is a little old fashion at first glance. Andrew Morton at the Fort Worth Star Telegram said: "If Walt Disney came from Texas, he would have made Grand Champion. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't have the video and special effects, but it does. heart and soul. The kids are wonderful and the variety of stars is incredible. I bet Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts are proud to be in a movie that their kids can actually see :) (G rated) <br /> <br /> This is a masterfully crafted "simple" little movie made in Texas by Texas Barry. Tubb. Take your kids, take your kids friends, take grandma too ... they will all enjoy it and you will too.
