I watched the longer version and couldn't get my eyes off the screen. 219 minutes passed and yet it seemed that only an hour had passed. The characters were very credible and entertaining, and photography was excellent. The story got me in and kept my attention. I'll definitely see it again. this true story at its best ... not Hollywood's ordinary cheap strain and skin deep glitz. I've seen quite a few reviews on this movie. The movie seems to be the movie or the price is vague. Basically, this is a good movie that has received unfair hard reviews. watch it for yourself with an open mind. If you like westerners, historical timetables, although historically inaccurate, you'll enjoy the movie. Outstanding !!! 10/10
