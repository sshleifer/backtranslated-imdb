For the first time I saw all the rivers on TV when I was a child and loved it. It was great to see a mini-series set up and filmed in a place so close to home. To stay pretty close to Echuca, I loved going to the historic harbor to see the rowers. The first one I ever walked out was the Pevensy (Philadelphia in the movie). I like how it takes time to unfold the events. Nothing feels rushed as most movies are today. The acting was fantastic. All the Rivers Run was thrown perfectly and I just love the Philadelphia crew. Mac is always amusing to look after a big night with his trademark raw onion sandwich. Easily enjoy a 10 out of 10 and is one of my favorite mini-series of all time with the Dirtwater dynasty.
