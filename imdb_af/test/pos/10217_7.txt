I say from the beginning, I'm not a particular fan of this kind of movie, but Nightbreed holds me some fascination with a message about perspective. <br /> <br /> Back in the old days, the people who would have been resident Midian had called zombies the dead. And according to Clive Barker giving us certain human members, this Craig Sheffer is born with the potential to become part of the world. <br /> <br /> Psychiatrist David Cronenberg first looks like the moderate professional has used himself a fanatic mission to escape the world of Nightbreed. He hit the police to kill Sheffer, but Sheffer went to a cemetery called Midian Cemetery where the Night Break came and lived underground. <br /> <br /> Sheffer also left a girlfriend, Anne Bobby, who still has feelings for him even after he was killed and now one of the undead. She tries to be a bridge for mankind in her own little way. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker's creatures are a very gruesome lot and don't love people. But it is easy to see that if the people leave them alone, the Nightbreed in turn does not interfere with them. <br /> <br /> Your sympathy is definitely in the Nightbreed, especially after you act as a fanatic such as Cronenberg and Redneck police chief Charles Haid. <br /> <br /> For a long time, Clive Barker has been a gay man and some suggested that the Nightbreed be a metaphor for gay people. I can see where it comes in, especially since there are many people who do not even think of gays as anything, because they are so learned. <br /> <br /> Permitted Nightbreed is pretty bloody with lots of free violence, but it also reminds you and I do the way Clive Barker turns traditional theology on its head and makes Craig Sheffer a kind of messiah the Nightbreed creatures.
