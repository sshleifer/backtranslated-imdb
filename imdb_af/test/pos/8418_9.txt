I am a Maharashtrian, a teenager who lives in the 21st century, and it is clear that I am not much into even Bollywood, let alone Marathi movies. Yet, when I looked at Shwaas, it left me with a unique feeling, one that is capable of generating only an extremely effective movie. <br /> <br /> It is a fact that the movie, like most Indian movies, only has its true and complete effect if it is considered in its original language. Much of the emotion and meaning of the movie is embedded in its Marathi dialogues, which, however, are difficult to try, cannot be translated effectively into English. <br /> <br /> Shwaas investigates in detail the relationship between a grandparent and a child. And this makes this righteousness complete righteousness. Dialogues such as "mazha parsha pan laakhat ek aahe" (My parsha is also one in a million) improve emotion. Anyone who has carefully observed the grandparent-child relationship may be related to the situation portrayed in the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's definitely worth watching. It's a movie that has left a big impact on me. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
