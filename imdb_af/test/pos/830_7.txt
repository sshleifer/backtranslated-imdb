I enjoyed it. There you go, I told you again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a few times more. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer movies like this, like Die Hard 4, which holds the box and gets critical praise just because you have an old old savings America. Van Damme moves well for a while of his age (47 I think), which produces kicks that remind one of Kickboxer. If you like old school action and explosions, it's the movie to watch. Van Damme's best works. <br /> <br /> Van Damme and Steven Seagal movies are released theater where I live, so I never miss the opportunity to watch our old school action stars on the big screen.
