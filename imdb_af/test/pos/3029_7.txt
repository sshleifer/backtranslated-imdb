This film is definitely a matter of style over fabric, but the style is good and definitely more than unique on its own to make "The Cell" an unforgettable and above average movie. <br /> <br /> "The Cell" looks beautiful with impressive sets, costumes and makeup. Yes, it is a real eyecatcher to see everything. The movie has a few dreamlike rows that are certainly strange, but also very beautiful and imaginative to look at. This movie is a perfect blend of an art house-type movie and a typical Hollywood thriller, accessible to both fans of the genre. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty far-fetched and doesn't always make sense. As a result, the movie is not always pleasant and fun to watch, but as I mentioned before, the style compensates for this. The style makes you look to the end and offers the best moments of the movie. <br /> <br /> Vincent D'Onofrio is unforgettable as the serial killer with a twisted mind. Vincent D'Onofrio is really used as an actor and this movie shows his talent again. I'm not very happy about Jennifer Lopez's decision. I know she can act in some of her movies, but she really wasn't fit to play the main character in this movie. Her character wasn't strong enough and she was overshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. Yet I felt that Vince Vaughn was also mistaken in this movie. He didn't play the role well enough and no, I didn't say that because I was just used to seeing him in comedies. The rest of the supporting role is good and still gives some credibility to the movie. <br /> <br /> Howard Shore's musical score was also surprisingly good and was similar to "Se7en" as at times. It fits the movie well and has some extra mood and atmosphere from the scene. <br /> <br /> It's a far from perfect movie and the concept is far-fetched and not always handled in the right way. Still "The Cell" is a perfectly viewable movie and may even have a bit of a look, due to its style, originality and creativity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
