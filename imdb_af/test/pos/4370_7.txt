Backwards is a wonderful thing. Very surprised when it first appeared (which inspires the famous review 'Me No Leica'), this predecessor of Cabaret can now be viewed in comparison and it is not half bad. It's certainly not classic, but it has its own evil charm (the movie version of "Cabaret" follows this plot while the stage version has slightly changed the plot). One must of course resist the temptation when Laurence Harvey's Christopher Isherwood (who holds the original author's real name, God knows what Isherwood was thinking of it), describes himself as a confirmed bachelor 'and while Harvey is a completely inadequate' Hero ' , (he is virtually unbeaten), and Shelly Winters deceived as Fraulien Landauer (the part Marisa Berenson played in "Cabaret"), Julie Harris is a wonderful Sally (that's a beautiful piece of comic play) Anton Diffring is first class as Fritz, the German Jew in love with Shelly's character. Of course, if 'Cabaret' has never taken it up, you might ask yourself, would it ever see the light of day. Being revived cannot really be celebration, but it is quite acceptable.
