This is the highlight of horror movies this year. "House of Wax" is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. This version really shames the Vincent Price version of the movie. I only know some of the young role players in the movie. The Ever Hard Paris Hilton; The pain in what you know is more seductive than ever. At least she didn't try to copy her civilization. Well, if she likes doing horror, she's better than "Wheel of Fortune's" Vanna White. She beat Vanna HANDS AF! And the scene from which "House of Wax" was made was no joke. The house was made of wax, and the victims could get away there before the crop was washed like their friends. The two twin Bo and Vincent (the distorted twins) were maniacs of the get-go. The parents raised them well, except for Vincent. And I think they are even distorted. How to get to the other pickup, but not as bad as the other two. It's another story in the book. I think he should follow his heart, not the other twins that Ambrose used in a tourist "fall" for unsuspecting victims. This movie is like "The Phantom of the Opera" meets "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". And this movie is one of the fearsome one in 2005! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
