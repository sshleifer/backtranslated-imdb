At today's standards, the DI may look a little hokey. Lee Emery's version is more accurate. I graduated in 1964 in Parris Island, SC. Jim Moore is so close to the right thing you could put on the screen in 1957. I can't comment on the plot, but I thought the end was unrealistic for MCRD. PVT Owens is like many who found him in a much more difficult situation than he had negotiated. Like so many, he joined the Marine Corps for all the wrong reasons. My Drill Intructors was more like GySgt Hartman and TSgt Jim Moore. Much more. The DI is more Korean Era and Full Metal Jacket is more Viet Nam Era. Today's movies allow that kind of thing on the screen. I have the DI in my collection. I just found it on DVD recently.
