My favorite show of all time! Yes, I thought it was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first lover I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny, except when it was serious, and just a good performance. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after February 1996, and maybe it made me more of the show than I needed. For me it's more the epidemic (now it doesn't seem right!) To say goodbye to someone you love, and KNOW you will never see them again. And I still think it is because as far as I know, there are no plans to release it on DVD anytime soon ... yes, life is mean! I definitely found it (although you can find a strange episode here or there ... but I never liked the bootleg copies of things much.) <br /> <br /> So much of my sad life. : (.... Most children in the 7th grade do not need strengths as Alex gets them to get through life (unrealistic - surely), but then again, how many villages have super-evil chemical plants that are prepared to do Anything for "Progress at ANY cost"? This show was fun to watch! Although I agree, the diagloge is a bit over developed (and even a little bit of Politics Correct sometimes). My favorite parts were when the kids would have some reason to break into the plant (a video tape or something like that), such as a child's version of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (which I almost yelled for the same reason for the game series years later). Then you have the plant's "security" team trying desperately to find the "child of the accident" ... very common dudes (at least when I first watched the show ... they look more sympathetic now for me.) I rather feel sad for Larisa Oleynik, not sure if she is forcing this to type her ..... but this is what I will always remember her. <br /> <br /> Oh and VAT, the actor who plays Aaron Peirce of "24" also here as a school coach or something .... too cool! Perhaps he can get the producers of the show to get Larisa in the next 24 season. I just bring it on 'cuz Jack Bauer is my other TV hero and I just want to overshoot things, lol :). Both are in California, so I'll just keep dreaming ... I can see now, "Let me stand at that suspect for a few minutes. No, I don't need a car battery!"
