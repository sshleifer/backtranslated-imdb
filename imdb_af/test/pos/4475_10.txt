What an amazing story and what a beautiful movie! Hat is off for Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film carries the passion that the characters experience so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. I watched as it was interested, and I almost kept my breath as the story evolved to its inexorable end. The performance of this film was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts and leads us to understand the strange platonic, absolute, thus possessive bond between two beings not meant to be part of each other's world no. Both are capable of love, but ironically, it is the more "evolving" one who is dependent and possessed, cannot accept the other's freedom. It is one of the most fascinating and intriguing views on the many forms of love, and an incredible study of how oppressive and destructive human love can sometimes be. <br /> <br /> Only a rudimentary thought will associate this story with any kind of bestiality.
