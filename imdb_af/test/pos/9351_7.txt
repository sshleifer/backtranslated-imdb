** SPOILERS ** Actually based on the novel "The Brick Foxhole" about a gay man murdered by a GI based on his sexual orientation. The movie "Crossfire" is about a violent anti-Semitic GI that speaks of Jewish beliefs because of its own failures and frustrations in life. Who, of course, feels threatened. <br /> <br /> Finding him at a local Garsgars pennant is the latest US serviceman Montgomrey, Robert Ryan, Joseph Samuel, Sam Leven, and gets a little too much. sarcastic, friendly to him. It seems that Montgomery is a little offset by Samuels because he talks to his best friend and friend Arthur Mitchell, George Cooper. Samuel is also going through, which Neanderthal Montgomery cannot do, to the sensitive young CI in the arts, he is an artist and painter on the outside, about war, World War II, the war that just ended. As well as the shaky peace, if so at the start of the atomic bomb, it now follows it in this very dangerous and unstable world. What really surpasses Montgomery is anything else about Samuels, of course he is Jewish. It's more than enough reason for the racist Montgomery to enter Samuels. <br /> <br /> Samules invite Mitchell to join him and his ladies friend. Lewis, Marlow Dwyer, living at his apartment. few drinks and continue with the very deep and stimulating conversation they started at the bar. It seems to be very jealous and hurt Montgomery, along with his unashamed, but somewhat clueless, in what Montgomery's plans for Samuels are, friend and fellow GI Floyd Bowers, Steve Brodie, later that night untouched to Samuel's place. <br /> <br /> With the party that has already ended, with Mitchell and Miss Lewis away, the two very drunk GIs are irreversibly the place. The fact that Samuels, in Montgomery's sick and anti-Semitic mind, drove Mitchell away from him, made him whip in a white, hot madness. Montgomery and Bowers break into Samuel's house in his well-stocked beverage cabinet with Montgomery and take a few whips against Samuels 'strong objections, of Samuels' vast and refined wines and spirits, much like the watered and inexpensive liquor that they unashamed Montgomery is used to throwing. It will soon lead to a violent and brutal attack on Samuels by the malignant psychotic and drunk Montgomery. Bowers is cold on the couch from all the liquor he consumes, killing the poor and innocent man. <br /> <br /> The movie "Crossfire" then goes into a long and tedious, since from the beginning it is clear who Samuels killer is, investigating why Samuels a wounded and decorated World War II veteran, got the press heart in the battle of Okinawa, Montgomery was murdered, as he really was interested, yes, to find Samuels killer, who is actually himself. This so-called voluntary action on Montgomery's part of stunning him to be the man who killed him. <br /> <br /> Montgomery is so ridiculous and even somebody who is very clever of him, stupid in him, constantly opens his big jap and explodes anti-Semitic and racist signs and grunts over murdered Samuel! It just gives suspicion to himself and no one else. I guess the guy just couldn't help it. <br /> <br /> It's not enough that Montgomery killed Samuels, who was one of them in his sick mind, "he even murdered his friend, the terror of death when he was involved in Samuel's murder. Bowers, who, in the racist way of thinking of Montgomery, is one of us, just because he was scared, Bowers would talk to the police to save his own sorry neck and drop the Montgomey into Samuels's death. > <br /> Capt. Finlay, Robert Young, does not take long for the detective to see obvious lies and deceptions by Montgomery, and then erected him through another GI "friend" of his Leroy (William Phipps), who was the butt of all his stupid and racist hilarious jokes, erected the arrogant, which returned Montgomery to the scene of his crime, killing Bowers, where a trap was set up for him. was all the captain, Finlay needed Montgomery to panic when Montgomery saw that the gout was up, and take it straight for it straight into the crossfire of a police ambush. <br /> <br /> Dated a little now but very hard hit back in 1947 when it was released. "Crossfire" addressed the horrors of anti-Semitism when it was under the cover and out of sight, almost every second World War film about the evils of racism in the US and in Europe. Even after World War II and with what happened to the Jews. When it had to be the full and honest exponent, the film went public, which earned it so fair.
