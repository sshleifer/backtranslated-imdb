I don't know what some people think when they said this movie was bad. It was wonderful. Classic Bruce Campbell, yes, it was low budget and the special effect showed it, but that's not what you see a Bruce movie, because you look at Bruce. Ted Rami was also excellent. I found this movie screaming and entertaining, and I still break when I recall Bruce on that pink moped. Now, I will admit that this movie is not for everyone, if you don't like B-movies, you probably won't like this one if you want big budget effects and make actors clear. But if you like a slap stick and the wall sci-fi plots this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Greet the King Baby!
