In the line of fire we give a wonderful cat and mouse game. Clint Eastwood is plagued by John Malkovich in this sounding movie. Malkovich says he is going to kill the president and deliberately calls Eastwood and pushes his buttons. He asks Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Malkovich brings a cold but very intelligent mindset to his character. Everything he does, he's doing for a reason, and he's not ashamed to kill. Eastwood must overcome the suspicions of his superiors to catch Malkovich, but no one wants to listen to him. The result is a movie that crackles with tension, which increases after a tense ballroom scene at the Bonneventure Hotel. Wolfgang Peterson saves the tension and we feel every turn.
