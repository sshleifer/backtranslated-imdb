The Paul Kersey of DEAD WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film. Remembering the 1974 film, you will remember that Kersey was a "Conchie" during the Korean War and that he was physically ill after committing his first performance. Ten years later, Kersey seems to have learned unarmed struggle and how to handle anti-tank weapons in its spare time. But I will overlook the gaffe, because DW3 is the best of the successors, the lowlife shots are shot dead, burned alive, broken their teeth and thrown to their deaths by middle-aged housewives armed with livestock brushes. Yes, I know the gangsters are multi-ethnic and they deserve credit, but even if they are not racist, they still kill scum that deserves everything they earn from Kersey and the innocent citizens. Who needs Mayor Rudy when you have Paul Kersey, a firearm rocket and a lot of old age pensions to recover the streets of the criminal creep. Paul Kersey I greet you sir
