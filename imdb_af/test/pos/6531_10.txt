I'm probably a bit too old for this movie, 16, and to be a guy, the story is a bit too young, but I really thought it was a cool movie overall. All the girls in this movie are so hot and really nice actresses, from Alana to Adrianne, to Deena, to Kimberly, to the cute girl Alana's little sister, Rachel. I'm not a big pop star fan with the loving songs, but I thought Aaron Carter did a lot of work here and looks like he's really in this movie and it looks like it really looks. My mom loves all the older flights she grew up with, so it's cool too. I thought I liked a lot of people and wondered if I would see them again? A successor will be cool. I rented it, but I can also buy it, as I have a ton of DVDs and would like to go back to see what I missed. But I couldn't buy it at Blockbuster, so I don't know where to buy it now, but I'll investigate it. Anyway, I'm a 16-year-old man, I've already said that, but I'll take it completely. It's really good for all ages. I think even my little half-sister, who is 6, can see it. It's so cool about it, it's something that all ages can see. I'm sure it's done deliberately, but it really works. Girls can dream of being with Aaron Carter, and guys like me can dream about all the hot chicks in this movie. There is something for everyone.
