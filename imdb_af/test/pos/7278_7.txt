After reading the horrible reviews of this movie, including commentary, it is quoted by Colin. I almost didn't bother to add this movie to my Firth Film collection, but the Firth Fan, which I am, made my plot better! <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It had tension, drama and plot and V.sexy Colin scene. The plot kept me right to the finish and I felt that once at the opening scene of Jennifer Rubens the actress played her role convincingly. Colin was as brilliant as ever and it is great to see him playing a character from the 'Dark Side', a 'chill went down my spine' and after watching it, I can't wait to see Colin's recent movie 'Traumatone doesn't look out on DVD. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe it's not a movie in your face, so to speak and one couldn't sleep on the plot, especially at the end when there was a lot going on But that was what I liked about it, the acting was subtle, not overdoing it (like a lot of tension teams), it chewed the movie more and more to watch. One could not guess what Colins character (Ross Talbert) or Jennifer Rubens character (Jamie Harris), and there were quite a few surprises in the store, I sat at the edge of my seat. right through, with a pillow handy! <br /> <br /> Personally, I am very happy to have watched Playmaker and I will definitely rewind and watch. I think any Firth Fan will benefit from watching this movie, if they don't like the plot, just look at Colin ;-))
