It is typical of people complaining about something if they have nothing about it. So it's about a gay man who falls for a straight woman. First of all ... It's a real story so you can't say it's not credible. It is a gay man who is written like that. The whole thing about this against the gays is just stupid. Personally, I think it was the best love story I have ever seen. And I'm very pro gay. I think it shows that true love is about personality, not just watching and sex. And it has nothing against anyone who is gay, straight or bi, as opposed to so many other shows. Perhaps we're doing this in Europe, because most TV here is a bit deeper and makes you think more than American TV ... Plus, we're not scared of the show. <br /> <br /> If you want something funny with one of England's best (Lesley Sharp) and you want to see a decent credible love story without too much juice for you. I know I love it
