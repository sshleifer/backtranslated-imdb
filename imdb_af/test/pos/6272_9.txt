This film should be quietly released on the other side of the world, perhaps even in English. Hopefully no one understands a word, and there is nothing to understand in this movie! Haahaa! Call me a note, but I think this is one of the best movies ever. Why would I come to the conclusion? Because it's my national time to sabotage bad movies and this one asks for it every moment! Once I became a fan of Myster Science Theater 3000, I have no doubt in my mind that they would find it and use it. Really! The version they got was not a movie of "Cave Dwellers", even from the movie itself. They seem to be ashamed to use videos of their OWN movie!). I can't say I recommend buying this movie. I'd rather recommend getting the MST3K version. Sure to find it anywhere MST3K DVDs are sold, don't miss out!
