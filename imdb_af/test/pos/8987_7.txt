This movie starts out as a college T'n'A flick, but gets pretty ugly after the main character's sister gang rape is by a gangster driving a bus. It has a pretty good fit, and James Van Patten does a good job in this Cannon tax deduction. It was the first movie I've ever seen at the Parkway Drive in here in Toronto. The main feature was "Alphabet City" and "Young Warriors was the added feature. Out of the 2 movies," Young Warriors "was much more entertaining and memorable. If you're a fan of blowing, this one would be a great addition to any make collection.
