Camp North Star, an extraordinary camp counselor, Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray), wants to lose battle for decades with champion Camp Mohawk, an ivy league-type venue where only the rich children can attend. Meanwhile, as Tripper tries to look for love, he looks intentionally with the red-boat Roxanne (Kate Lynch) while other teenage counselors contract and also head-over-heels. The film is underway at the Camp Olympiad when opponents are squarely in competitive athletics matches with Tripper that they will fail fatally another year. The film also shows the growing bond between Tripper and a quiet, lonely, puppy dog ​​Eyed Rudy (Chris Makepeace of "Vamp" fame), whose father is often gone. Rudy doesn't seem to fit in with the other kids at his age and he seems to spend most of his time running in the morning with Tripper or taking his peanuts at Blackjack. The movie usually contains a high score of fellow teenage camp counselors. There are hottie advisers, total nerd Spaz (Jack Blum) with his burnt glasses and bad acne, beek-nosed "Hardware" (Matt Craven) who likes to blow things up, fat child Fink (Keith Knight) who is often his face stamping, including in the movie. There is a basketball game where weak Spaz can hardly weigh the ball against opponent Mohawk, much less shooting an accurate shot with poor Fink throwing down, mid-side knee-jets flying over the backyard. There is a campfire coupling (with a rambling scary story by Tripper about a hand-held killer) and boys are talking about the beautiful ladies. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know it's desperate to sometimes try to express every laugh. can and sometimes say goodbye to sentimentality (like the screens with a sad Makepeace and Murray), but just as much as this recent look, I giggled myself. I'm likened and can't help it. It's a summer camp movie through and through that just wants to entertain you. I can't explain or amaze the overwhelming joy that flooded when I see a sleepy Murray's reach out of the lids of the summer camp roll. It will start soon. His intercom jokes are especially amusing. But, the movie is, let's face it, a series of funny vignettes with Murray yolk endlessly. There is nothing wrong with that. However, the film cannot survive without it, can it? Hard to think of this movie without Murray in the lead. It's a happier time and I think nostalgia of the summer camp experience plays a big part in why our adults still warm up with "Meatballs". And poor Morty (Harvey Atkin), the head of the camp who wants so bad things to run smoothly and beat Camp Mohawk for a change, is the constant source of Tripper and gang entertainment, as they often play gags on him. Especially when he sleeps on his bed! Great enthusiastic throw that seems to have as much as we do.
