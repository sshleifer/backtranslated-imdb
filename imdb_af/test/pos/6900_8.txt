OK. Finally, a horror movie that was well done. As soon as I heard the music, I knew that much effort had been made to create what I consider to be an almost masterpiece of good ears. Zombies, whores, liquor, digging snatching and more. A good role, well-acted, well-directed, well-written --- there was almost no error. Even the American actors with Irish / English accent really did. I thought the actor Larry Fessenden became known to me. That's the missing tooth. Eventually I realized that this man was the lead in 'Habit' a movie about vampires in NYC. I thought he was excellent in that role. Now I wonder if he is an American or not. His accent was so convincing in "I sell," I thought he should have grown up in the emerald island, not in the US. Well, he's a born and great New Yorkian. A great actor - really made the role of his own in this movie. Nothing beats an abomination in the early 19th century Europe (like the old Hammer flicks.) I encourage someone who wants a good time to watch this well-crafted movie.
