Everyone who worked on this movie did an AMAZING job. It's honestly one of the best lesbian movies I've seen in a long time. The acting, writing, cinematography, music, visual, everything were all. As an avid fan of the genre (both lesbian movies and gymnastics), I was so incredible with this movie. It really gave me as much as I expected about the board. To hear the Q&A with the role players and the crew was wonderful, the main actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and gracious, it is enjoyable to see people who can be talented and not lose sight of what is really important is not. And the writer did a hell of a job as well as directing and editing was wonderful. Thanks for making a good movie! Thanks also for the rule over 'if you are going to hit a label on yourself, it would be bisexual.' I'm so tired of movies where characters who have a relationship with both sexes are passed as gay or straight, it's great to see bisexuals to get recognition for existing and part of the gay community, and that was nice that labels were not. even needed in this movie. What an end! Just when I thought it couldn't give me any more, it did. Beautiful work and my thanks to everyone. I'll spread the word, it's definitely a movie not to be missed!
