<br /> <br /> This movie has some impressive action scenes. The humor and action are well mixed, although the intensity of the film does not sustain itself to the end. The last scene is a slight anti-climax in terms of action quality and astonishing screen explosions. The humor doesn't look as ridiculous as in many other Hong Kong movies, and this movie is quite different from most American action competitions of the past year. Lau Ching-Wan acts as a typical, intuitive police hero who mocks invalid orders from incompetent police chiefs. The dialectics of the film are based on the superhuman coolness and relentlessness of the drug, which humiliates the police force, while providing a serious dose of lead poisoning with a variety of machine guns. Leave many bodies in his wake. Yu Rong-Guang is particularly impressive as an ultra cool, ruthless gangster in this Woo-like piece of action where tough guys really die.
