The numbers don't lie, 109 people voted for this movie. It says a lot about the status of one of the most intuitive insightful comedians of the late 20th century. And for those of you who know the work of Bill Hicks, if he lives today, does he think what he should say about the boy's president of his homeland? That his short career remains unrecognizable is a sad situation and this film, or rather explains these two films why. First, you see how his talent was clear from the start, from time to time those who knew Bill Hicks always said he wasn't just funny, he was also unique. The film also shows how the quality of its material was too challenging in the entertainment industry. His drink also contributed to his career problems, but it is less evident in this film. And then the second movie is a complete show. If you've never seen or heard Bill Hicks, it's a great introduction to the person and his dark but intelligent humor. Especially because the topics are almost 14 years old, but still ironic, it is underlined by the fact that many of the events happened under President Bush. <br /> <br /> See them together - first the biography and then the performance - make you aware of how talented this young man was, how quickly his life has passed and how the American media can sometimes act as the big big homogenizer. Let's make sure nothing is too challenging, nothing will be too interesting. And the result? Well, as the man himself said, going to sleep America, your government is in control ........... In his lifetime, at least in Great Britain, this artist was recognized for his talent and was successful there . 11 years after his death, 109 people at IMDb can say something about the movie. After seeing them both, I hope you understand why more people should listen to Bill Hicks.
