I've seen some of Fred Carpenter's movies on Showtime, Pay Per View and Video / DVD, and I have most of these movies, especially with a few beers, (EDDIE MONROE) and "MURDERED INNOCENCE" my favorites. I recently saw a promo DVD of "EDDIE MONROE" and everything from the movie to the storyline and regulated everything smoothly. (Doug Brown's music score was sensational.) I enjoyed Frank Sivero ("Goodfellas", "New York, New York" and "The Wedding Singer"), he is an incredible and very underrated actor. But I especially credited Oom Benny's performance of Paul Vario, I credited his performance on the IMDb and I found out that it was his first lead. Where was this man! Give Fred Carpenter credit for the discovery of Great New Talent, it's just a matter of time you will see this man costing Pacino and DeNiro. As I mentioned, Carpenter knows how to entertain and when you work with a limited budget, it's great what Carpenter can produce. (I read the VENT MAGAZINE interview and Carpenter has never made a movie for more than $ 400,000.00.) Before I "EDDIE MONROE" I saw "Rocky Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd" both good movies. "Eddie Monroe" went on a trip to a surprising end due to a very good screenplay, good screenings of the whole movie (Craig Morris is a movie star and the main actress Jessica Tsunis was hot!) Great cinematography, direction and Doug Brown's music score. As I said, I recently saw "Rocky Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd", if I wanted to comment on the two movies, I would like the same thing I said about EDDIE MONROE, the only thing two very much Good movies didn't mean "Eddie Monroe", they didn't cost a few hundred yards. Big movie and I didn't even drink a beer.
