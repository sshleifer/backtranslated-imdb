I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, or Richard, so I have to go and see how the movie portrays her. I think a better person to ask if it would be accuracy is her brother Richard. But from what I saw and learned from Karen, I felt her pain, share her grief, and she was a very special person I grew up with. I know I wasn't born until 1965, so I didn't get to know her much as some of your older fans, but I certainly grew up listening to her music and I have good memories of her music. I remember the song about the "Radio" (every day, so well, etc.) And I remember, "We just started! In fact, I memorized many, many of her songs, and some people (many) tell me that my voice is almost identical to her (I'm not joking) I was also anorexic at high school and part of college (1978-1987) to be exact and weigh anywhere from 82 pounds to finally 120 pounds in 1987. I have developed some very serious health problems that helped me identify with the actress Karen portrays in the film, and the mother (Agnes) was much like my mother in many ways and I could feel the pain what Karen had to experience because my mother was often uncomfortable, critical and disapproving, since Agnes (if true to accuracy), the film was useful to identify and get to know Karen, a more personal note not only by her music to hear, but to see what she went through. depicting 2-3 hours and telling every detail perfectly, so I should say there is probably no biography that is correct. I'll give this story an 8! I wish I knew Karen personally! I would have baptized to meet her !! I would have loved to shake her hand, give her a hug or talk to her. I feel her warmth and love every time I hear one of her songs and she is greatly missed.
