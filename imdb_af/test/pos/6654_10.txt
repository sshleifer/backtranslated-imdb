"How can a name, not even a real name, break your heart?" Here's how. There are some movie versions of a celebrated novel that responded better to their source material than Anthony Minghella's film by Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain. When you read the book, you will be able to feel most of the great scenes that the soul has suddenly recreated. Personally, I cried many times while reading the novel, and most of the evening, we tore the tears. <br /> <br /> Surprising range, beautiful words, good acting and good music. In the interview on the DVD accompanying the movie, Minghella talks about the multiple layers of the story. Everyone works. One of the best movies I've seen and an invitation to one of the greatest novels of the past ten years.
