There was talk on the E! Hollywood Special about making dirty dance which is still being considered by many women, including a dear friend of mine in her fifties to be one of her favorite all-time movies. Perhaps the music, the dance or the melodrama is the plot of Baby Frances a dancing sensation with Johnny Castle. Of course, this film created Jennifer Gray, whose biggest role so far has been the ferocious sister in Ferris Beuller's Day Off. Patrick Swayze is thrown perfectly when the heart hits the front man who literally wipes baby. Dirty Dancing has everything to hit a Broadway or West End smash. It has the love story, the music and all sorts of dance. Jennifer and Patrick can relive their roles easily. It's nice to see Jerry Orbach playing a doctor instead of a police officer and Kelly Bishop as the mother. It all took place in the Catskills in the sixties, where many Jewish families had vacation in the area during their summer holidays. At the end of the film, it is sad to see that the hotel owner, Kellerman, is affected by the next generation. It happened anyway! Most people prefer cruises and travel across Europe than spending the summer in the Catskills. The old big hotels become Indian casinos. Bring Broadway Dirty Dancing alive and well. After all, they can do it for Footloose and Saturday Night Fever, it must be a no brainer! I know this movie is one of the favorites you don't get tired of watching at 800 times. There are people who have probably seen this movie - a 1000 times. Somehow looking at the making and the story behind Dirty Dancing I made myself thirteen years old for my childhood. Dirty Dancing may not be the greatest film ever made in history, but its universal appeal continues to attract crowds and repeated viewers such as the 800 club whose members have watched it so many times. At least I look at all the uneasiness of Baby's first days and her first true love with Patrick Swayze as a heart, Johnny Castle. No one could have proposed this picture as a big hit, then with the sixties music, two soundtracks and even a tour in the late eighties. I hope they bring it to Broadway in a musical. It will work for the audience to be part of a movie. No wonder it still attracts children and even adults, especially women of all ages to look over and over. Well, Australia and London both had Dirty Dancing productions. It looks like it will come to Broadway in 2007, just in time for the 20th anniversary.
