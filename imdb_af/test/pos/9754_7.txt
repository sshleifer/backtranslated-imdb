HUNT FOR JUSTICE is a Canadian television drama that made it on DVD and that is reason for gratitude for those who are hungry for educational dramas that inform us about facts of current history that are somehow buried in the media. The film is not a Hollywood production, but it also tells many of us the act of heroism of Louise Arbor to bring about the trial of the Yugoslav Slavic president, Slobodan Milosevic. <br /> <br /> Louise Arbor (veteran Canadian actor Wendy Crewson) is a Canadian judge appointed by NATO as prosecutor of the main war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. The film began in 1996, when Arbor traveled to The Hague to jeopardize the political obstacles that prevented the Tribunal from jeopardizing the war criminals in the Yugoslavia war in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia. crimes against humanity in the form of genocide, extinction camps and other abominable abuse. Progress to bring the criminals to justice is hampered by generals (including one played by William Hurt) who fear a major World War if precautions are taken. Arbor, with the keen help of her translator, Pasko Odsak (Stipe Erceg), her staff, including Keller (Heino Ferch) and the unexpected assistance of British captain John Tanner (John Corbett), continues to focus on the impossible task of bring all responsible persons. parties to justice on three specific events. Two of the three suspects are caught, but during their trials, each one meets his end. It only leaves Slobodan Milosevic himself, and Arbor and her colleagues are successful in bringing the war criminal into 1999. <br /> <br /> There are several adjacent margins in the narration of this well-documented story, stories that make the point in history more personal. Some may find the movie image of corpses and prisoners and death camps too strong to look at, but they must bring the film home to their destination. Wendy Crewson has the power to manage the message. The message that war crimes may never go unpunished. There is much current history to be learned from this film: writers Ian Adams, Riley Adams and M. Lovetta condensed the information and also made it dramatic. Director Charles Binam√© balances the docudrama with the story progress, never forgetting that he has a story of intrigue to also tell. HUNTING FOR JUSTICE is worth watching! Grady Harp
