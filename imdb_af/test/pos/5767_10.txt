It's probably the funniest thing I've ever seen. From start to finish, it's perfect in timing, atmosphere, punch lines, background music, battle order and every other possible aspect you can think of. To be honest, I find this movie as funny as their (Rik & Ade's) sitcom "Bottom" - maybe even harder. I always laughed all over the movie and can only recommend watching this movie ... But if you see it without knowing whether the type of comedy Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson had previously done, you think it's funny to everyone - but I can understand the people who do not understand it well. THIS IS HUMOR PEOPLE !!! (People are beaten with frying pans, guys running around with red rubber underwear, green vomit, filling the corridors, guys being kicked in the b ****** s and getting candlesticks in the eyes - HOW CAN NOT BE funny? ??) 10/10
