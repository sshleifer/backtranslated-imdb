Watching John Cassavete's debut movie is a strange experience, even if you've seen improvisation movies before. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is the roughness. Straight, it goes without saying that some characters screw their lines. But then you step back from the situation, because you sink deeper into these people's intimate exchanges and you ask yourself, "Do I ever stamp on MY words?" The answer is of course sure, we all do it. It is a pity that most of the gaffes get into the picture early in this regard, because you have sunk about 20 minutes so deeply that you will not know if a bomb went out behind you. <br /> <br /> The next thing you see ... or maybe you see it hours or days after the movie ends, it's never been a significant plot, but the themes and poems of the dialogue and characters never leave you. In fact, dealing with the role-play in everyday life of these characters is always there, but it is so ephemeral that they are not even aware of how it informs their opinions about themselves, their self-awareness, their perceived status, or the fate of their relationships. <br /> <br /> The title is appropriate because you get a full spectrum of blacks, whites and gray ... and not just in the character pigmentation of the characters. Leila Goldoni (truly remarkable here) is an African American / Caucasian, her two brothers are white and dark African American. The irony is that they exist in what is undoubtedly the "hippest" most tolerant atmosphere of the time ... knock-driven upper-west Manhatten ... and there is still conflict within and around themselves. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever seen a movie with such a subtle delivery or technique. It's much like absorbing a very large piece of gallery art and then cutting it out in bliss, as you think back to the images that triggered it later in the day. <br /> <br /> Great mastering and extras on the Criterion disc. Probably the first real experimental independent film ever made.
