I have never heard of this Aussie horror about Michael Elliott's enthusiastic review; In fact, after reading it, I decided to see if the DVD was available on my local lease and that was (although a German edition, that is, the R1 extras), so I chose to immediately release the movie. look. <br /> <br /> While not going as far as giving it full marks ?? just a few titles they get from me, let alone an obscure modern movie ?? I must say I was very impressed with BLACK WATER. Rather than looking back at previous crocodile films, such as ALLIGATOR (1980) and LAKE PLACID (1999), it recalls the memory of two who see a small group of people traveling, getting lost and satisfying themselves. the elements and creatures that inhabit the place? namely LONG WEEKEND (1978), itself a small but impressive Australian production, and OPEN WATER (2005). <br /> <br /> The compact, simply plotted film includes a few and the woman's younger sister who decides to go fishing in a remote and banned part of the Australian wilderness, known as the crocodile area; very soon (in fact, before even 15 minutes passed!), their boat was chopped and the guide killed by a crocodile ?? so our happy adventurers get a tree in the hut. The DVD Talk reviewer believes the movie suffers too much time in this one place? With the three arguing about what they should do, trying to get the boat, a way out of the jungle through the trees (just to meet nothing but water) and the occasional attack by the monster. However, I think the makers take the situation as it goes without slipping into the tedium: it is because of the striking tension and, as Michael said, the credibility of the characters (especially the two women), but also the fact that the crocodile here in recent memory makes one of the frightening and most memorable (I wonder how they have it to perform)! <br /> <br /> I also agree with Mike that the movie really contains effective shock moments ?? the alligator jumps out of the water to take a bite at the petrified heroes; His head suddenly appears before the women as they make the boat; Although one of them reaches the vehicle, the monster can pick up its massive weight and get into the boat. At the end, as the same girl can get a gun (on the broken body guide), load it and lie in wait for the crocodile to appear. The latter sneaks out behind her (for the time being, the creature is donated to the shyness of the shark in JAWS [1975]). With this in mind, the final is just as spectacular-pleasing (though on a distinctly smaller scale) than that of the classic Spielberg blockbuster ?? even if it has a negligent succession. Another definite asset is the movie's slender score ?? which is generally pretty beautiful but just gets in the right moments. Immediately, the BLACK WATER emerged as a fresh air in the face of the demoralizing slump in which horror theater had fallen; For this reason alone, does it deserve greater exposure to remind us that there is still hope for our beloved genre (without the real necessity of using the gimmickry of a CLOVERFIELD [2008] to pay attention)?
