This movie is roasted by the boys at MST3K, but it's actually a neat and nasty piece of low-budget film noir. The plot is stiff, the characters are credible (within the well-boy-get-obsession-with-bad-girl genre), the pacing is solid, the climax is well handled and the film is enhanced by various fine characters. In fact, most of the time, you want to hit the protagonist with a brick, but he is pretty scary when he plays the master brain. The screens between him and his father are very powerful, in a minimalist way. Sure it's depressed, but that's the point. Good movie.
