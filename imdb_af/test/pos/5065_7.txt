The reviews for RENDITIE were generally not favorable, so I waited until it moved to the local discount theater to see it. The film tells the story of Anwar El-Ibrahimi, an American-Egyptian scientist who was plucked from his international flight and fled to interrogation after a strange coincidence committed him to a recent terrorist attack in an unnamed North African country. Not as bad as I feared, it's an interesting and exciting entry into the "pleasure-of-the-news" thriller genre. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film asks difficult questions about American methods to learn Information from political prisoners: Is the previously unbroken line of (open) cross over suspected terrorists about what our country should do? Does it provide useful information to help save lives? If so, at what cost? What kind of monsters do we create as innocent people are captured and tortured? By punishing torture, what kind of monster do we become as a land? It's always disappointing if a movie with such a challenging material is messy with some of the details that make good movies. For example, I would like to empirize with Anwar's wife, who spends the entire film tracing him, but the only identifiable personality feature she has given is an advanced state of pregnancy. RETURN also seems to imply that Arab women who do not go with their fathers' regular marriages just ask for trouble and there is a poor concept book kept by one of the main characters of the film. The information that interests him is urgently needed at that moment. I laughed aloud as the moment had to be filled with fear. <br /> <br /> The film has a good central performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and strong (but short) appearances by Hollywood veterans Meryl Streep and Alan Arkin, as well as impressive innings by Omar Atwally as Anwar El-Ibrahimi and also by actors Moa Khouas, Zineb Oukach and Yigal Naor, all of whom I would like to enjoy in future films that have nothing to do with terrorism. Good luck to them. The five or so stories that follow are woven well together until the filmmakers bring in a slight but effective twist that ultimately indicates to the never-ending cycle of massacre that violent attacks of terror are being drawn.
