This is probably one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. It has action, but not these bulletflies, good guys - bad guys, Van Damme stallone action, but quick, realistic and nervous action, it has a plot, because until the end of the movie you don't know how it will end, it has characters, helpan quinn, donut sutherland and ben kingsley is just perfect, and it has tension, this movie just won't let you go before you see its end. <br /> <br /> Although there are only a few characters, I have not found it hard to pay attention to the story, and for the story it is basically (not too empty clancy - difficult but simple and raw) and realistic. <br /> <br /> If you are in a movie with a good story, a little action and a good play, watch it and I promise, you won't break away before you see it end. The whole end of it.
