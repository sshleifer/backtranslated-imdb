For the record, I'm a curly fan through and through. But I have to say that Shemp wasn't really that bad. Yes, he might have had the same kind of slapstick that Curly had, but in his own way he was hilarious. At least he wasn't as bad as Joe Besser. <br /> <br /> In BRIDELESS GROOM, Shemp plays a music professor (Stooge? Professor? Yes Right), who recently inherited half a million dollars from a dead uncle, and Moe & Larry have to prepare him for a wife at 6 o'clock that night or no money to marry. <br /> <br /> It was one of the Stooges' first shots with Shemp, before recovering their material. material. Maybe it's not surprising that Shemp was part of the Stooges before Curly came in the picture, so of course he was in it. The slapstick gags are hilarious, especially this one scene with Moe and Shemp in a phone box. Essential Stooge short to be honest.
