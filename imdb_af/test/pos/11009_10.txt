It is an interesting fact that metaphysics by Plato and Aristotle forms formal logic and abstract ontology about the science most people are not interested in. But then, about a thousand years after Aristotle, the computer began to make human thought and the people who refused to reflect questions from people other than biological, physical and chemical people suddenly became paralyzed because they couldn't handle the consequences these computers would bring "overnight". R.W. Fassbinder's "Welt Am Draht", along with Tarkovsky's "Solaris" and Godard's "Alphaville", is probably the first film to take the philosophical questions of emerging computer science as the basis of a story told in a movie. The confusing questions about identities and realities are cleverly built in various interwoven criminal stories that the audience really tries to follow because it is interested in resolving the issues. Fassbinder was a master to sell highly abstract content to his audience by including theoretical knowledge in practical, palatable forms. The basic problem to understand is that an identity defines reality, but on the other hand, reality also requires identity to observe it. The idea of ​​a person with multiple identities is only for us from the point of view of psychiatry. Logically speaking, the only reason we only have one identity is the fact that our logic has only two values ​​(right and false). Now take a logic with just another value, ie with three: Then, as you can easily see, you already have three identities. What happens, when, let's say, Dr Stiller is killed? Then it is quite possible that only one of three identities is abolished and the other two remain and can save the individual from death. Another question is, if a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities. However, the idea of ​​displaying such sets of identities in a downward or downward manner as in the elevator scene in the hotel is misleading, as identities and thus realities are not structured in hierarchical fashion, but in a Heterarchic way. Strictly speaking, there is also no "artificial identity", since each identity is defined over two objects that share all their characteristics. Therefore, the idea of ​​assuming that each individual has only one identity is nothing more than a result of ancient two-valued logic (or a second identity implies that a person exists and does not exist at the same time) ). But now look around and see that one and the same object (which is by itself self-identical) is viewed in its own way by each subject. If each box then sees an object differently, it would not be possible for the single individual to open the boundaries of his bivalent individuality corset, with the result that different persons could exchange their different individualities? Fassbinder will pick up this topic five years later in his masterpiece "Despair, a journey in the light".
