It was probably looked at this TV movie that was interested in the debate whether "Anna" was really Tsar Nicholas's daughter Anastasia. Since I saw it, I've made a point to watch several documentaries and also buy a book. In spite of the evidence discovered since the release of the film, sometimes I think she is. It is the power of Amy Irving's play in these 2 parties, which is somewhat liberal with historical facts, but packed with tear-dramatic drama and Irving's convincing performance. <br /> <br /> I wasn't aware of Irving before that, although I have to see her without realizing it in "Carrie" (another favorite movie). In "Anasasia" I never felt for one moment that "it's just a movie". For me, this woman was Anastasia, and then one with her in the railroad vehicle met members of the royal family, I knew that hell or high water had to see the second part. I just wanted to see how she would prove she was what she claimed, and as the story progressed, I had an intense hatred of Rex Harrison's character, although I admired him as an actor. <br /> <br /> When I see the movie again in the TV guide, I convinced my Mother that we should see it, and then she thanked me for being so eager to part 2 see. Then I bought the video and can recommend it completely. "Anastasia" is one of those rare TV movies you just have to watch for the sheer pleasure of seeing the best acting I've ever seen on TV. It doesn't matter whether you believe the legend or not.
