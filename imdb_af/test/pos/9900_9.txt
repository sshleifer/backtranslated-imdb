Morris and Reva Applebaum were Broadway's toast in its infancy. By ninety, Morris is a widower. He begs his sons, the psychotherapist and the BMW car dealer - and his daughter, the TV writer / producer - to attend a party in his honor, after which he will exploit himself. Letters-minded creatures that they are, they take what he says at face value. He leads them, his grandchildren, and some others, including an African-American Jewish psychiatrist who thinks about Godfrey Cambridge, with an ingenious chase through Manhattan if they try to stop him or reject him. <br /> <br /> The comedy works completely. The performances are excellent. Peter Falk is in top form. This movie earns more than an audience: it deserves popular success.
