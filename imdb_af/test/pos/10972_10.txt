MANNA FROM THE HEAVEN is a great movie that is both predictable and unpredictable. You know that the characters after finding out that the so-called "Gift From God" was actually a loan, repaid the money and that everyone would eventually be happy, but how they got there is not so obvious. The scenes are often funny and sometimes appear when the characters evaluate their lives and where they go. Veteran actors are more than just a nostalgic movie. Frank Gorshin, Shirley Jones and Cloris Leachman prove they can play more than Riddler, Mother Partridge, or Mary's friend Phyllis while Jill Eikenberry and Wendie Malick play other characters than they saw on their TV series. Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is at the same time touching and funny, without making fun of nuns or the church. If you are looking for a movie with a tremendous role, some good music (including a Shirley Jones version of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an uplifting end, will try this one. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
