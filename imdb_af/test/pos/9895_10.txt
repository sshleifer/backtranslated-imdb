A wonderful story to be seen by all families. The story, acting and production values ​​are all first time. I highly recommend checking out! <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is wonderful as an aging actor who wants to decide when he will die, so he can continue to know how things will end and not a member of the audience. to New York to confront him and try to change his mind There are, of course, unresolved family issues that need to be addressed, and the writing and actors handle them well and with good humor. <br /> <br /> The story is about A Jewish family, but it can easily be over any other family, well, maybe not a WASP family, the brothers and sisters have problems with each other and also with their father, I love writing and directing, All in all, a humorous and touching movie.
