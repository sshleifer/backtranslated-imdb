I think it's the so-called South Gothic. <br /> <br /> These are stars Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci and Justin Timberlake. Timberlake does good work, to my surprise, I didn't expect it from him. <br /> <br /> If you are lost and you cannot find your home, it is the black snake sound. </ <br /> <br /> The people in this movie are definitely lost in many ways, psychologically and emotionally damaged, betrayed by those who trusted and loved and filled with great pain. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson plays a blues singer / musician - whose wife had been slaughtered with his brother, now left him for his brother. He also stopped a child he had hoped for with her. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci's character is a sexually abused woman when it was young - it changed her into a self-destructive nymphomania; so men can treat her badly. <br /> <br /> The story lies in the intersection of these two characters. It is a love story, but not a sexual love story between them - the older black man and the young white woman. <br /> <br /> This is different from most Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
