When the episode was made and broadcast, Eisenhower was president. Kennedy was President-elect. <br /> <br /> As far as the episode is concerned, it was an acceptable episode, if not a little serious. "The Professor" does not show much scope here, and the whole thing seems a bit rushed (many episodes of the TZ do not seem to fit the time slot, some look as if they are plugged and rushed, some with little or nothing to do it) in half an hour, and some are of course fit). I think you're expecting just a little more tension than going back to some rooms and intoxicants. But overall a decent episode. Indeed, the "what if" motive of time travel is a sophistication in itself and sets the table with basic interest. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, as many TZ episodes were not quite as good, and a little better.
