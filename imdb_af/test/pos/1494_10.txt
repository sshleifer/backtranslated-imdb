... the last time I laughed so much. This is proof of the talent of Rowan Atkinson that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality - without ever speaking a word. The success of the program rests on Atkinson's shoulders, but he wears it with ease. Despite the fact that the show ran for only one season, anyone who was even vaguely in contact with pop culture recognized the rubber-facing social tartar. So great is the talent and effort put into the show. Sometimes Mr. Bean is sometimes unpleasant, sometimes encouraging, an innocent, unhappy guy who is also malignant. The brilliance of this character cannot be put into words, but you must see for yourself. <br /> <br /> The show is almost too depressed, as in the notorious New Year's Eve sketch, or when Bean celebrates his birthday by going to a restaurant alone and offering himself a congratulatory card by himself signed and an interest that he does not really want. Yet there are times when you can't help but feel impressed with the inventive methods by which Bean finds himself in trouble, as if he has many clever ways in the mentioned game or when he changes in swimsuit without taking his pants off first! Whatever your reaction to Bean and his unorthodox lifestyle, you should throw delicacies as you watch. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to point out that although "Bean" is classified as a children's program, it is just as enjoyable for any adult with a sense of humor. Because the more "adult" jokes are about the heads of the little ones and the intelligent slapstick (yes, there is something like that) is funny, no matter how old you are. Bean is the best definition of a family program. It is just a classic and it always brightens my day.
