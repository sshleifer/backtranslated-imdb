Many scenes and dialogue are exuberant, but when you pick it all up, that is, the machine's daily cycle, from the print run to a depressing bar to a depressing burlesque hall to print the smoke-filled poker games and to get home again, you get a strange sense that someone is trying to give a faithful representation of the junkie's life around 1955. Whether it is Sinatra, who of course grew up against this kind of character in Hoboken and in numerous ties, or Preminger, who uses the soundtrack and the Frankie-Zosch subtext to leave the addict's inside world view on the Hays Code cage bag, you get a good companion on the waterfront, filmed almost exactly the same time. Kind of a faux-realistic work that realistically wonders how deeply the drug culture is embedded in American life.
