Be prepared for the trip to Haneke's "La Pianiste". The psychological illness of the main character, played wonderfully by Huppert, goes beyond any limit you can expect. The most beautiful part is that you feel compassion for the character Erika. Trash sexuality (no nudes scenes), perversion, masochism, turbulent relationships ... Haneke gives us a rough meal, hard to digest; Sometimes the only way you can escape the extremism of some scenes is to start laughing. The "mise and scene" may not be the most enjoyable part of the movie, it has obvious austro-Germanic, sometimes Scandinavian notes: static, long scenes, but never boring. The wine institutions, the French language used, make the whole like a European blend. The permanent Germanic music background (Schubert) was chosen beautifully. In addition, both the Cannes best actor awards are well deserved: one of the biggest shows of the year by one of the greatest French actresses ever.
