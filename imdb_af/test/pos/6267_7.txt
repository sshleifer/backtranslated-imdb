A great movie about a young Chinese man, related to Western technology and an Englishman trying to make his fortune appear in movies in China. It's a very interesting story that is supposed to be based on real events, although I assume it's more fantasy than real. It has a fairy-tale quality that you rarely get in real life, and it also has 8 people credited for the screenplay, so they have to make things right and left. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie This is how magical film was to people who have never seen it before. It is not a particularly deep film, which briefly touches on the loss of tradition and the infringement of Western culture, but is mainly just a pleasant little movie. It's actually a movie I really enjoyed, which has already disappeared for 15 minutes. Light as a souffle, but I enjoyed every minute.
