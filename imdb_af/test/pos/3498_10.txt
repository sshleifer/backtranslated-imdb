I don't see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor. You must get your head out of your tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! If it's not your "cup of tea," to speak it, then look at what it really is - a damn, funny movie. Perhaps they worked out DID to make another drug / T & A movie, but in this case they really hit the spot. It is especially funny for the Ali G fans, because he delivers everything we got from him and expects of him. So I say GREAT UPS to Ali G, and if it's not your thing, don't cry! BATTY BOY!
