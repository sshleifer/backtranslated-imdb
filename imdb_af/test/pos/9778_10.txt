It should be one of Australia's best productions. I totally disagree with the comments made by 'RamiNour101'. <br /> <br /> This series shows the depth of Australian company and the lengths they have gone to help each other. Episode Five 'Eddies Birthday' is a good example of this and it absorbs the Australian spirit. <br /> <br /> The music used throughout the series only accentuates the situation facing the men, their homes and their loved ones. The many amusing versions of The Road to Gundagai capture the spirit of the men and the fact that they never forgot home and that there were few elements like the song of a song they took home for a while. <br /> <br /> What the comment is about being racist towards Japanese people is the only thing to say, that you can't change what has happened. The Japanese treated the Australians very poorly in Changi and to suggest it would otherwise be very misleading. The comment on the accuracy of the roadmap is also false. These six stories told in the series consist of real P.O.W experiences. <br /> <br /> The actors were excellent; best, in my opinion, Matthew Newton. His performance as David in the first episode was astonishing. From a city boy, to be another nameless face for his prisoners. We see him change dramatically in the first episode due to his violent attack in the jungle and in further episodes we can see how that one event changed him, he is more aware of what is really going on and is always one of the first to help other members of The Secret Nine. <br /> <br /> Stephen Curry also deserves a mention. His performance in 'Eddie's Birthday' is incredible, going from the group's larchin, to being sick, weak and unable to care for himself. The exhibitions of the company in this episode touch you on an emotional level and take pride in Australian. <br /> <br /> I studied World War II at university level and found this series, if not physical truth, spiritual truth, as it captures the true spirit of what it was to be an Australian soldier. <br /> <br /> Well done to John Doyle to capture the spirit of Changi.
