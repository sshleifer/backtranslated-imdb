This is one of the better-feel good movies of 1999 with Kate Capshaw leading an all-star cast over a small town and a love letter. First, the scenery is beautiful and everyone who sees this movie and doesn't want to move to this place is crazy! For the film, Capshaw is beautiful as the main actress who captivates the emotional roller coaster. Tom Everett Scott is charming as the "author" of the note throughout the film, and the exquisite Ellen Degeneres is hilarious! Blythe Danner and the actress playing the bookshop seller are also fantastic. Although it was unsuccessful, the film is wonderful because it is short and sweet and good as very romantic. 10/10
