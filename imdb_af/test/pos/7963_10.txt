How often do we live our romantic life as on the big screen, with dry affairs and passionate encounters? Almost never, as I see as the normal life around me, there is something to judge. Romance, as mentioned before, is almost never earthquakes that leave or seize you on the top of the world. <br /> <br /> Romance, in its daily form, like millions of times around the world, is a slow, subtle and quiet affair. Something that grows in you, ever so slow, probably without you, even slows down and takes over your being. No one can tell me if I fall in love. For if anyone did, I would not believe him, for no one but I would know. And even then it is just a feeling, a certain knowledge that you feel this exalted emotion. That you want nothing but the best for someone, that you will never want to see it, suffers a moment of sadness. That you are willing to take a great deal of pain for them. I will not go so far as to say that I am willing to die for your loved one, for we are all human, and we do not know what we are capable of being in the face of death until that time. moment. <br /> <br /> Is love between the main characters of the movie ever so subtle and underestimated, not less noble than that between Romeo and Juliet? The undisturbed emotions, the uncovered feelings, carry much more than any repeated shout of "I love you". The restraint shown by the main actor has always been as sharp in the scene as he seems to love his love of the cafe, but he never moved to make himself known to her, but only heartbreaking to look at. Would most of us be inflexible enough to stay hidden because she knew her emotions and feelings would not be possible? <br /> <br /> On another note, how about my own death? While I can claim to be seriously ill, I can't honestly say I've ever come near to death. Will I be so calm, put all my affairs in order and give instructions to others to record what I leave behind? I guess I'll be calm because I will have little choice in the matter. Can I be so selfless? Again, the answer must be negative. I can empathize with the fear, knowing that your life is forfeited, the fate has given you a deadly blow, and the future events, no matter how little of them, are no longer under your control. <br /> <br /> Life is nothing more than a series of small events, the culmination of which may look like retrospect. But very rarely.
