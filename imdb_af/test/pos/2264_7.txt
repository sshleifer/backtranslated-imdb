In America, Jewish Jonathan Safran Foer (Elijah Wood) collects personal belongings from his family for memory. A few moments before his death, his grandmother gave an old photo of his grandfather with a woman named Augustine in Ukraine. Jonathan contacted the Odessa Heritage Tours, a family agency in Ukraine, to lead him to the location where the photo was taken to find Augustine. Along with interpreter Alex (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather and a strange dog, they travel in an old car looking for the missing past of Jonathan's family. <br /> <br /> "Everything is lightened" is a strange movie about a strange young man with the compulsive behavior of collecting family souvenirs not to understand those who are the past of his grandfather how his life could be if his grandfather didn't move to the US. This bizarre vegetarian character meets a dysfunctional Ukrainian family who owns an amateur travel agency specialized in helping Jews find missing family, and together they have an almost surrealistic journey through the country of Ukraine. The film begins like a comedy, with a sarcastic black humor, ending in a touch and tragic drama recommended for specific audiences. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Uma Vida Iluminada" ("An Enlightened Life")
