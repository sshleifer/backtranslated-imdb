When his elderly mother, Emily (Jeanne Bates), is attacked by her housekeeper Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and becomes a cannibalistic monster, TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep that old mom satisfying her hunger . /> <br /> Although the above summary of the summary images of trashy, over-the-top, 80's horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, it seems that Mamma is actually a refreshing, original version of the werewolf / vampire / zombie mythos (exactly what Emily is, is never really clear, but it's not nice!) as well as touching the close bond between mother and son. Clay's dedication to his mother leads him to abandon all his other responsibilities, including his work and his relationship with pregnant girl Alice (Mary Beth McDonough), while Emily's love for Clay eventually leads her to self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film can be sharper, with more attractive direction and better effects (the shots of the creature are kept very short of not disappointing) and some more experienced members of the player frustrate with terrible cheese performance (Yes, Brion James and Stella Stevens, I refer to you); Fortunately, however, the strong emotional undercurrent in the well-built story is enough to ensure that Mom is an effective, compelling and occasionally shocking story. One that I do not hesitate to recommend to those looking for something else.
