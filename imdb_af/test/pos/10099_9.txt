Each praise word briefly went short of the height of this movie. This movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be a bit confusing at the first show, but it will definitely explain a little about what's going on and you really want to watch it for the second time. But after the second show you start with the pieces and then you will know how wonderful a movie can be. <br /> <br /> A word of advice for blower-flickers stays away from this movie. It's not your dumb ass teenage movie, in which you just turn off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big bs and lots of blood. <br /> <br /> If you want to increase the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it alone with a wonderful home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, without any of your sickly friends joking at a very tense situation crack. And don't forget to turn off the light. <br /> <br /> My points on different aspects: - <br /> <br /> Direction = 9/10 Acting = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Sound Effect = 9/10 <br /> <br /> Total = 9/10
