Ahhhh, 1984 .... I was young and stupid and just developed a taste for those exotic cigarettes while living in a squat in Manchester's Moss Side, with the incredible case of cockroach infection. <br /> <br /> After some of those doobes, this show was ROTFLMAO material - I was a keen fan. Then I look at the floor (or at the walls or just over anywhere) and see my own collection of "little armadillos" that remains. <br /> <br /> Not sure if it was the chemical enhancement, but I remember thinking that the exaggerated surrealism of the show was fantastic - that was my second favorite thing on TV at that time (# 1 was the season of Luis Bunuel movies shown by Channel 4). Radical art continues! <br /> <br /> You should also show that theme! .... I swear I'll never drink again.
