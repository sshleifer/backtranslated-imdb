I'm trying to look diverse in my movie. I can easily come to "Pride and Prejudice" if I come in "Disappearing Acts". Love Jones is my favorite time, this is the standard by which I judge a modern urban romantic comedy. Shot very well, the shot of Nia and Darius riding Lakeshore Drive on the Motorcycle is one of Classic 3-second movie shots of all time. Of course, nobody will ever remember it. When it came out, it was a new paradigm for modern urban film production, good actors, no guns, and so on. The movie industry has tested me to some extent, you will occasionally get Drumline, or Roll Bounce, or Tyler Perry's "Why did I get married". So when I see 'my people' in a very professional and attractive way, I appear in Love Jones. There is no best movie ever made, for many people and opinions. But this is my personal best. My favorite line of Love Jones "Baby, I just want to get up and talk !!"
