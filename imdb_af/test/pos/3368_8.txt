I wasn't sure what to expect from the box. I'm a big fan of Darko, but also saw the mess that came from Southland Tales, whether it was a studio that didn't know. With the box I was pleasantly surprised. It was a throw back to classic scientific paranoia films shining on much greater ominous events, but on an intimate character base. The slow build and the ghostly tension were very effective for the tone and theme. of the whole movie. Any change in such a pacing would have resulted in the typical Hollywood or MTV style, which would not only serve the purpose of this story correctly. All of the weird look-out / acting extras thrown to the low-end score, to the minimal explanation of what exactly happened, added a very focused thread of underlying fear and the shrinking sense of hope for our greedy meaning , main characters. It was something well thought out and implemented by Richard Kelly, from the first act to the end. Richard Matheson's short story, on which it was based, the Twilight Zone ep, which was another one, was one of the morality and greed that was still the central elements of the box. To be only 8 pgs long, it would not expand as a feature with dust, but would do it with style, originality and leave the viewer over the film. Many have and will compare it to DARKO for whether it is so deep or not, but I found it to be a completely different movie, thematic and emotional. The tone is completely different, just like the messages and intentions of this movie. Where Darko has left us internally, THE BOX leaves the viewer with more external questions about the world around us. Knowing man's nature will the test of the pack ever come to an end? Good performance, great flu visuals, and threatening atmosphere add to the slow cold ride. It's not for everyone, but for those who get where it comes from, it's a treat.
