It was seen last night at the 7th annual NYC Home Film Festival - a rather noisy place that stopped for this lovely and touching dual-film movie. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two, older and blind, the other, twenty-one helping her with her job - is well established, and its depth is clear. <br /> <br /> There are no car hunting, explosions or staggering special effects. - just the sometimes difficult but rewarding task of reaching out to help and be helped. <br /> <br /> See if it's possible!
