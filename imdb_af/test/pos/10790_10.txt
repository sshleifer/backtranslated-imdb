Never seen an Oliver Stone movie before, or any movies with Eric Bogosian, I didn't know what to expect from this movie. After the idea of ​​buying it for a while, I got it free as a supplement with a Sunday newspaper and I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of Barry Champlain, a talk radio host who can be incredibly rude to his callers, often placing them in their place before realizing what is going on. Although it made him a popular radio program host, he also earned him many enemies. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie was extremely impressive with not one dud actor in it. Eric Bogosian is brilliant as Barry Champlain, the appalling radio host with Alec Baldwin turning into a strong show like Barry's boss, Dan. It also contains Michael Wincott's voice (my reason to see it). <br /> <br /> The story was really well written, because you feel like Barry more, despite his arrogance. His uneasy life is revealed and you see how vulnerable he really is. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to everyone, as it is fascinating, and more importantly at many levels, two of which were inspired by the life of a real-life radio and the fact that actually get radio program hosts, and callers, like those that actually appear in the movie. High recommendation and 10/10. <br /> <br /> Be yours, Cat Squire
