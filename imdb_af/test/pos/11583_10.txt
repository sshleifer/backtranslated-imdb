The sea inside (2004) **** Javier Bardem, Belen Rueda, Lola Duenas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Joan Dalmau, Alberto Jimenez, Tamar Novas, Francesc Garrido, Jose Maria Pou, Alberto Amarilla, Nicolas Fernandez Luna. : Alejandro Amenabar) <br /> <br /> An inspirational story of a living death; Bardem is wonderful <br /> <br /> The true life account of Spanish quadratic Ramon Sampedro and his petition for his desire for euthanasia by the right to die cannot be considered a source of inspiration, but this film is just that. <br /> <br /> Sampedro (played beautifully by Bardem) was a virile, energetic young man when he lost the function to his limbs after a tragic dive accident (which was in the backstroke with a visceral shock to the senses yesterday). has been told) and for nearly thirty years lies paralyzed in bed while his loving family cared for all his needs. Although his ability to move was zero, his thoughts were very active and proven to be an inventor, poet, writer, and artist who kept his mind busy until he no longer thought to live in his handicapped state any longer. <br /> <br /> Give beautiful but also plagued with a crippling illness attorney Julia (the ethereal Rueda who fits beautifully with Bardem as if they are actually soulmates) being used to see through Sampedro's last wish to end his life and becomes an aid camp if he ever opens her like no one else. Not too long has passed, and Julia begins by examining her past and discovering many letters hidden by his family. When Julia confronts Ramon with this, he is reluctant to discuss something with her, but eventually he agrees with her that it can help and the project becomes a book in the making? a memo / biography through free style poetry and prose. <br /> <br /> The film is a heartbreaking story of the human spirit and how love ultimately overcomes heart pain in many forms, including Ramon, the unlikely love he shares with a complete stranger, named Rosa (Duenas ), a single mother who sees him on TV one day on his bike to his remote farm in Spain to get to know him and possibly change his mind about ending his life. <br /> <br /> Filmmaker Amenabar, who along with Mateo Gil fascinating script, leaves imagination in the mix when Ramon presents himself to leave his bed and leave his bed and fly over rural landscapes to the ultimate sea where He had so many years ago the cruel perversion of the fate that had laid him in prison for three decades. The movie is not a complete downer with a shrewd white and sometimes humorous tone that does not dilute the impact of the story's final act. Kudos also does the remarkable makeup work by James and Jo Allen doing a tremendous job of aging Bardem's live for an aging man to get an Acadamy Award node. <br /> <br /> Bardem and Rueda deserve Oscar nominations as two in common and despite the fact that Rueda's Julia is married to a loving, doting man, that made some people like that, it is impossible impossible they were never together to start with. It's just one of the cruelties that's true, but it's not by definition the movie as a whole; It's a must see and one of the best of the year.
