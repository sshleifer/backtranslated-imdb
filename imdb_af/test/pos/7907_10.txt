My cousins ​​and I have seen this movie since we were little. I don't know exactly what this movie is about, but we have tackled this impressive movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories. <br /> <br /> I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who loves good healthy movies, because that's exactly what it is. The things with which the four children enter themselves are absolutely hilarious to look at. It's an old movie, but don't be fooled. It is one of the best movies out there that show such strong brothers and sisters for each other.
