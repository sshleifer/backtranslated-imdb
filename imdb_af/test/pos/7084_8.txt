One True Thing proves it's the characters that make a movie. Streep will certainly receive an Oscar nomination for her role. A beautiful drama, One True Thing, is an excellent example of filmmaking in the late 1990s. There are still people out there who care about making and watching movies, except for the big block busters with million dollar special effects. It's not the best picture or anything ... don't be stupid. But the amount of emotions delivered by both the actor and writer hit me like a shockwave. I cried twice in this movie, which says a lot to a 24-year-old man.
