Man, is it great to see only Young and The Restless star Melody Thomas Scott than anything other than Nikki Newman! A doctor with a brain, no less! And great to see her like the beautiful Lorenzo Lamas instead of Victor Newman! <br /> <br /> Mel plays a college professor of microbiology going to the islands with her son for spring, just to find herself a prisoner of the island infected with a rapidly spread virus. Helpful to her is the lurid character of Lorenzo, who has a daughter, just her son's age. <br /> <br /> Like Lorenzo, Mel shines with a bit of the younger couple's record. Speaking interesting points in these times of chemical and biological terrorism. Worth to see, especially for Y&R fans.
