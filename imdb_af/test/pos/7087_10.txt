Written by someone who was there, you could say, but only if you were there. Excellent achievements by Meryl Streep (of course!), Renee Zellweger and William Hurt. <br /> <br /> Many people said it was a dysfunctional family. I think every family is dysfunctional when they have this kind of torture. Being NOT dysfunctional will be dysfunctional! You lose your family as you know it, can anything be worse? People should see this movie, so when faced with this nightmare, they might be able to change how they do it. Maybe they'll see that the father denies himself valuable time, he'll never get a chance. Perhaps they will realize how difficult it is to die, or to see someone you love to die. They didn't miss much of the nightmare, it's hard to forget.
