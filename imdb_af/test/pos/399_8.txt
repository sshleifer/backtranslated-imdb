Usually Anthony Mann made westerners with "the big guys" - James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda. . . the A-list cowboy stars. But in this B + movie he tackled something very different and achieved quite a bit of success, which apparently was a true Western being. The main character, played by Victor Mature, is a hiker / mountain man. They are usually arranged in movies - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson, that kind of thing that the hero is not a typical mountain man, but a clean cut heroic figure hanging with real mountain men. Not here. For once, a true mountaineer - vulgar, crude, animal - is the central figure, and it is something to see that gives adults one of its better later roles. The real characters are provided by Robert Preston, excellent as a self-absorbed Custer-type cavalry commander, and James Whitmore, poor man's Spencer Tracy, as one of those old timers who feel themselves between prisoner and Indians on the one side. and the oncoming power of civilization on the other. Even more impressive is a very young Anne Bancroft as the officer's wife, who was initially wiped out by the sheer grandmother's creepy character, and finds her own entrepreneur, as she begins to realize she is attracted. to him. Rarely if ever a remote border fort was so accurately realized on the screen, without the romantic surprise John Ford gave such a place in his masterful Fort Apache. The battle order is large-scale and especially violent and especially impressive when viewed in widescreen format. Good performance, and underestimated film, everywhere.
