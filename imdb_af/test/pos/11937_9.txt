I think Toy Soldiers is an excellent movie. This is one of the only movies that, apart from some well-known actors, has an unknown role that can actually act. In my opinion, the plot is fascinating. It keeps your attention without an outrageous story that might not happen in real life. I think everyone will enjoy this movie. Sean Astin always looks the perfect movie to showcase his talent in the show. He is much underestimated and does not get the recognition he deserves. Other movies he was in other actors were in the spotlight, but this film and Rudy really show him because he is the main character in both. I hope he will one day receive the awards he deserves for his performances. If you want to see a good movie, check this one and if you are a Sean Astin fan, you will definitely like this movie.
