Towards the end of his career, Jack Arnold, a very effective director who has given us such classic 50-creative features as "It Comes from Outer Space", teamed up with "The Creature from the Black Lagoon" and "Tarantula". The former soccer star made the leading 70s blow-up movie head runner Fred "The Hammer" Williamson for a few movies. He has the lovely, undoubtedly Western "The Black Bounty Hunter" and this refreshing, fresh, smart and highly entertaining 70-action variant on your standard 40's film noir Williamson showing a beautiful combination of dry, self-humorous and relaxed, mitigating confidence as Shep Stone, a cheap, enjoyable and forever in debt former Los Angeles police has private investigator. Stone is so difficult for cash that he uses a bar as his business office and only scarcely meets the one-day penny-ante low-paying small business that the police do not want to bother. While catching the pavement for one of these deceptively simple actions (Stone is trying to find a guy's runaway teenage daughter hiding somewhere in Hollywood), he finds himself elbow deep in a complex, dangerous, seemingly bottomless criminal plot that " A scattered Jesus includes freak religious cult, various deadly hippie dopers, a sordid porn ring, a priceless missing gold dot that belongs to a legendary silent movie star, a deadly underground drug trafficking operation, and a growing number of fresh bodies. <br /> <br /> The missing pessimism of Arthur Penn's beautiful pale "Night Moves", "Black Eye," still lacks the highest as a highly fortunate, sly skill of Robert Altman's masterful "The Long Goodbye" successful hip'n'flip 70's turn on 40's mystery suspense thrillers. Arnold's capable direction keeps the pace moving at a beautiful, steady clip, with occasional exciting mano-a-man-naked knuckle-fighting tones and excellent use of several colorful, slick LA venues. The relaxation park in the movie's conclusion is particularly effective. . Mark Haggard's and Jim Martin's script provides a good amount of reasonably complex and often truly surprising plots. And the expected series of spectacular secondary characters is an interesting oddball cluster. Rosemary Forsyth has a special, powerful lesbian model agency owner. (Forsyth has the best line of the photo, with Stone first meeting him, "I'm a whole bunch of women"), Teresa Graves of the "Get Christie Love" TV award boasting like Stone's loyal bisexual girl (the movie's accidental, non-Jewish representation of both Foryth's unconventional femme fatale and Graves' equally atypical bout-Friday is one of his strongest assets, and Bret Morrison, who in the 40's had the radio's "The Shadow" as a sloppy pornographic filmmaker. All in all, it is a modest but sure winner.
