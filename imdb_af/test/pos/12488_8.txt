A good, humorous mix of music halls (first and foremost) and the police procedure riddle as the suspects' stories begin to fall. The final exposure of the murder can come as a surprise if you do not watch closely. A Gritty looks at Paris from time. You can ignore the final scene (the Hollywood end). Louis Jouvet is the best of the police inspector who apparently just goes through, but is really on top of things.
