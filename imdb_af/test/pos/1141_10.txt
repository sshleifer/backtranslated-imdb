I went to this movie, no idea what to expect. I actually took a date about it in the theaters when it first came out. We both thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped to discuss someone to discuss it after I saw it. <br /> <br /> I only recommend watching this movie if you appreciate non-mainstream movies. It's not as irreconcilable as Liquid Sky or as imaginative as Forbidden Zone. The original plot is very easy to follow. There is a very subtle humor. <br /> <br /> Here's a quick summary of the plot if you're totally lost: A big brother type of government holds tabs on everyone in society. Suddenly a new person appears and there is no data on him (he becomes insane). He may or may not be the second coming of Christ. The excessive government goes into a madness to find him and discover his true motives. The ruler is also obsessed with immortality. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are wild and others are quite low key. We follow the main character as he meets all kinds of people in society. <br /> <br /> I didn't need my consciousness to enjoy the movie, but I know some of my friends helped it. <br /> <br /> Split is also filmed about Santa Cruz and San Francisco.
