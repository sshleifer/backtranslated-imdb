If you were ever in Ukraine, this movie is absolutely hilaries. From teens who wear gold chains, to hip hop listening and dancing on the side to take jokes about airbags in cars and waitresses in complete shock at meeting a vegetarian, this movie really takes bits of Ukraine you will never know unless you have gone no. there. I cut most of the movie and cut my head and thought, "Yes, that's exactly right." It's great fun if you understand Russian too, because the captions don't always do it right. The actors are so credible and Elijah Wood does a good job of playing a socially immovable Jewish child. My favorite character is definitely Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., the grandfather's "see eye" which is actually a psychopathic border collie. The characters are so eclectic and nice that you believe they are real people.
