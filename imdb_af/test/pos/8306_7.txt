Due to the fact that there was no CGI in 1976, I felt that the movie was rather lethargic. The studio productions were very good and very extensive. The background effects were very credible and always appeared as if they were part of the whole set. The actors did not do so, taking into account the assumption that the film was set in a kind of Jules Vern atmosphere where imagination and possibilities of future exploration were unlikely. Looking at this movie in 1976, I would probably have wondered about the ability of man to build a machine that could travel to Earth's core. I still wonder why today we are not all flying in our cars, but I'm pulling off. McClure and Cushing have their funny moments, mostly from their facial expressions, which, of course, make the movie a little champion I loved. The 'monsters' remained to be desired, but the story had a good foreground, though I feel as though another kind of thing could be more credible under the circumstances. All in all, carefully looking for his time and fun.
