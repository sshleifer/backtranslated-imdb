Batman Returns is considered quality as one of superhero movies. His predecessor, Batman, is by far the biggest and most thought-out comic book genre. For one to say that Batman Returns was disappointing, he or she did not fully watch the movie and consider Danny Devito's play as Penguin. Devito and Walken offer a few memorable moments. The story of Batman is supposed to be dark and Tim Burton fulfilled how the cartoon depicts Batman. Batman Returns offers comic relief, action, excitement and fantasy; and it should not be regarded as 'crap', although we are all entitled to our own opinions.
