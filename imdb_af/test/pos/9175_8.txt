A Chick movie that guys still love - Yes! Great. Now I can have fun, enjoy the girl's company and not feel like I can't wait until the movie ends! Light - but funny. Good stuff. Whatever you do, don't miss the DVD extras. It is also a large blind date file. Will Smith do it well - even if it's in the light, it's fine. The film is a bit slow in pacing - don't expect too much action - laughter is there - and so is the message - but timing is a bit slow. Use the low moments to whisper or kiss - it will pick up. The end makes the feeling good moments worthwhile. Most of them expect a light hearted card - and watch some great action by the supporting actors - they make the movie. The plot twists are predictable - but it's a date movement, so the fall of popcorn comes from the kitchen - and don't let it break. Add more dates to this movie - she will want o see what is next in line. Remember Hitch's advice !!! <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
