There was somebody in my family (not who it is because of personal reasons) who thinks that Mr. Bean is always so stupid in whatever he does on the comedy series. Imagine how I felt at the time. Shock immediately. <br /> <br /> There are more reasons than one why I love Mr. Bean. As one of the earliest shows on local television here in my country where I grew up for the first time, it's just one of those things trapped in my head. There were even my friends once and I talked about some of the selected episodes and we just laughed together. <br /> <br /> It is always stupid, funny, and hilarious in what rubbish Rowan Atkinson like Mr. Bean will do in every episode. Although it may occasionally appear from the repetitions here, it never brought back the childhood memories of me. In fact, I dare say it's the very first show to show me the kind of shows coming from the UK as I grow up. <br /> <br /> The comedy series ... definitely really evil, as the British can say.
