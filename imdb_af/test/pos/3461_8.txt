I was amazed and touched by this emotional movie that made me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. I think too few people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope at least some will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked to their physical disability, who (as a team) defeats the medical cheap system and fights for their rights. This movie shows a side that some of us will never understand, not too exaggerated, but emotionally presented. Hopefully, this movie will help us understand some of their desires better and realize how important it is to have a friend in the world, especially if you can hardly express that fact.
