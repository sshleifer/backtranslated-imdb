It's a special movie if you know the context. Antonioni, in his eighties, became lame. Mute and half-paralyzed, his friends - who are incidentally the best in the film world - have arranged for him to lead a last significant movie director. The idea is that he can think of a story just by looking at it. So we have a movie: about a director depicting stories through simple observation. And the case of the (four) stories is about how visual imagination defines love. <br /> <br /> The film comes by giving us the tools to make it through our own imagination. The result is pure film world: every person (except the director) is beautiful in aspect or movement. Some of these women are ultralovely, and they exist in a dreamy, misty world of sensual encounter. There is no nuance, no hint that something exists, but what we see; No desire is at work other than what we create. <br /> <br /> I know of no other movie that manipulates our own visual desire so successfully to create the world we see. He understands something not to touch. No one understands Van Morrison visually as he does. Morrison's Celtic space music is based on exactly the same idea: the sensual contact that implies, but does not physically touch. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's redhead appears appropriate to the shopkeeper and she also leads a slender movie on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Ted's Evaluation - 3 or 4: Worth watching.
