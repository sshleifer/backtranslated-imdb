My kids, DD 7 and DS 10, enjoy the movie so much that they go squirming in their seats. It was good, old-fashioned, rated G, family fun. This movie is made for children .... someone really understands them. <br /> <br /> Seeing Julia Roberts, Brice Willis, Garth Brooks and the other stars was great. <br /> <As someone living in the city, the fiction "Big Texas" is modeled, I can say they did an honest and accurate depiction. The children look like children, not like superstars. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone supports this movie to send the message to Hollywood that we need more movies like this. Go look, then spread the word!
