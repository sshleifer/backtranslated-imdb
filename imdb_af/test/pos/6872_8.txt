HOUSE CALLS was an amusing 1978 comedy about a widow's doctor (Walter Matthau) who now wants to play the field but can't help but is drawn to a patient of his (Glenda Jackson) who refuses to. another notch on his bed post. Matthau loves the woman, but does not want to make the commitment she demands. He agreed to run her for two weeks only and then decide whether to commit or not. However, other complications make it difficult for Matthau to make a decision when the two weeks rise, even though he is clearly in love with the woman. Matthau and Jackson have surprisingly effective chemistry as a tailor and are strongly supported by Richard Benjamin, Candice Azzara, Dick O'Neill, and especially Art Carney as the inept and senile chief of staff at the hospital where Matthau is employed. Matthau even has a short scene with his real son, Charlie, who appears as Jackson's son. This engaging comedy is still very good after all these years. If you've never seen it, it's worth the rent.
