I agree that this is one of the very best episodes of the whole series - my only distraction is the somewhat astounding appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this - if you weren't for the first time of this episode, you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's dad. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker - your preference) it only takes you from the scene. Yet, he is an excellent commander as well as opposite to our captain and this episode is highly written and well done by everyone. There are excellent points on both sides regarding the cost of war against the price of peace and it reminds one of the best of World War II and later the era of the movie. This is not my favorite genre, but I would definitely recommend a fan of this to see this episode through the filter. You will see it stop. I will never understand why Sci-Fi gets so little respect - the best drama is to put ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.
