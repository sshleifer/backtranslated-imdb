As a big fan of Dostoyevsky, I was always disappointed with Hollywood's half-hearted efforts to enter the Russian romantic aesthetic environment, such as Yul Brynner and Dmitry Karamazov. I thought the whole problem was badly decisive, but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and changed my mind. When he gave an intelligent writing to work with, he suddenly became alive and he was as noble, sexy and confronted as you would ever want a Neurotic Russian officer! So he was better off Dmitry than Major Surov as he was as Dmitry. But this is because author Tabori actually gave Yul, as the Conflict Russian Officer, the kind of confronted Russian officials lines worthy of true literature, and it has real meaning and pathos in them. For example, a representation of folk music, he says, "You hear a man crying in the dark. And if you listen carefully enough, you know what he is crying. You look surprised, Lady Ashmore. you may have heard, tractors and marxism are not the only thing the Russian cares about, there is always time for music. "<br /> <br /> Brilliant !!
