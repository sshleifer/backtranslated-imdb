I have 2 complete sets of life time, this is my favorite movie of all time. Love all actors and actresses. Awesome photo. Dear Patrick Swazy. This is the film that has shown its true talent. But yet he does not get credit for the performance he has preformed! Many credits have been missed in these movies. Love how they portrayed the dry and dusty monologues of the civil war. To portray it in one of the greatest love stories of all time, and through all lovers of life, what does a true friendship mean? .How divided 2 divided countries. But while all the delights remained, though the war divided divisions and shipping relations. But to the end they stayed us the viewer, how true freelancers can still stay to this day! Simply the best. One with the wind does not compare to this movie. Patrick Swazy at his best. After the movie for a hundred thousand times. I became a big fan of Swazy. And since then, he has followed his career. Keep all his movies after making North and South!
