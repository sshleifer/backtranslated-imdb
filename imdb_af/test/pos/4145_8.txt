If film is about the vision and real life, this movie is quite perfect: NUOVOMONDO talks about immigration in the US from Italy at the beginning of '900, but it also speaks now, when emigration / immigration is still a focus. <br /> <br /> Being a visionary film isn't rich. <br /> <br /> On an extra level, Charlotte Gainsbourg plays a star. A Good Challenge for the Academy Award 2007 <br /> <br /> After the first Crialese's effort, "Respiro", an emotional but intellectual movie, he taught Fellini and Taviani's lesson to just two Italian masters to name. /> <br /> Plot fight, target accurately, maybe just a little less melodrama will be more effective. <br /> <br /> As ALPHADE (challenge for the Oscar next year) by Almodovar is a mature movie by an ever brilliant director, NUOVOMONDO deserves it more, because of its good effort to create a European movie for American scene. <br /> <br /> That's it!
