I loved that the mood was light and airy. I loved that the main character guaranteed his future, and that his roommate was "straight" from all people. I loved having addressed the dynamics of how the members of the men's group dealt with each other, as it was directed by a lesbian, the whole theme of masculinity was placed, mocked, dissected and questioned. What makes a man? What makes a straight, gay or bisexual? You're not really sure if our main character has decided who he really wants; he lives in the moment and throws caution to the wind. These and other reasons love me for this movie.
