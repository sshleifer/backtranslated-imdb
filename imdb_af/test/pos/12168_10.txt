It is quite a thing that three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers can be simultaneously informative about gay & bi-sexual relationships, and their struggle! <br /> <br /> "Pool Days" are about the discomfort of adolescence, and the mutual attraction between an older man and a younger one. A story about experience and vulnerability! <br /> <br /> A friend of Dorothy depicts a general dilemma that many gay and bi-sexual people experience at some time in their lives: the intense attraction to someone who is heterosexual. Sensitive investigation, this story really made me feel! <br /> <br /> "The Disco Years" shows a different version of a no-win situation: get involved with someone who is not only confused about their sexual orientation, but is also afraid to be exposed than anything but straight! A very empowering story for those of us who have been treacherous in the hands of a sexually confused and scared person! <br /> <br /> While these three stories will appeal to anyone who has an iota of empathy towards others, they will empower those who gay, bi-sexual, or seeking themselves psychologically. Each story elevates in its own unique way!
