Isabel just went out of jail. She's decided not to return, but life is hard for ex-condemnation, especially if they're homeless, like Isabel. When she finds the one her boyfriend Rufo, she can see a light of hope, but Rufo is now not just a junkie, but also an AIDS sick. This does not allow Isabel to surrender, because if there is a will, there is a way and she will fight for her future, to have a normal life, with a home and a family. A very difficult and up-and-coming film that is unaware of most Spanish theaters is actors, and the story is very touching. Perhaps better treatment of the secondary characters is the movie better, but it's really good. I strongly recommend seeing it, but be aware that it's not a Disney-happy movie, it's hard and dramatic.
