Wrestlemania 6, is an entertaining Wrestlemania, if not a completely successful one. The Ultimate Challenge, of course, is the price of admission alone, but again as with very early Manias, there is too much stuffing in between. The crowd appears for almost everything, and as always, we give the reliable Gorilla & The Body announcement team. With a Face vs Face game as the main event for a Wrestlemania, was absolutely unprecedented at the moment, it just made things more tense. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> Koko B. Ware / W Frankie Vs "The Model" Rick Martel. For a 3 or so minute game, it's as good as it gets. I wish it was a little longer, but what I got was pretty damn good. Martel wins, with the Boston Crab. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Tag Team Championship. Demolition Vs Colossal Connection | C | / W Bobby Heean. Great Pop for Demolition. Contest itself is pretty boring, I often had trouble paying attention. Andr√© didn't really do much, so in a way it was more like a 2 on 1. There is good talent involved, and it is a pity that they can't produce better. Demolition wins those titles, with Pattened maneuver from the top down. Crowd blows the roof from the front. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> Earthquake / W Jimmy Hart. Vs Hercules I have what I expected here, a standard boring filler game, with earthquake doing its thing. I'm not really a fan either, so it didn't take much interest in me. Quake wins with his seat. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Brutus Beefcake Vs Mr.Pefect / W The Genius. Deafening pop for Bruti. Really good game, unfortunately not enough time to develop further. It kept my interest and remains one of my favorites on the map. Beefkoek wins the post with a crunch head, much after the crowd's approval. <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper Vs Bad News Brown. GREAT POP for Piper. Nothing more than a boring noise, it doesn't know what it wants to be. Some entertaining antics from The Hot Rod, but nothing else. Remarkable to Roddy who paints himself half-black and calls himself "Hot Scott" <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> The Heart Foundation Vs The Bolsheviks. Record breaking, but other than that, nothing to see here. Harts wins with, The Hart Attack. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Barbarian / W Bobby Heenan. Vs Tito Santana. Average for the time it got, but still viewable. Crowd was rather dead for it, except Heenan's interference. Jessie's hilarious cracks, about Tito's food is more entertaining than the game itself. Barbarians win with a nasty, flying clothing line from the top. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed Tag Match. Fabric & Sapphire / W Elizabeth. Vs Macho King & Sherri. Great doll for Dusty, and an even bigger one for Elizabeth, which looks absolutely stunning, I might add. I thought it was OK. At least it was alive, but nothing good. I'm not a fan of Dusty. Dust and Sapphire win when she rolls up Sherri. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> The Orient Express / W Fuji. Vs The Rockers. Rather, the crowd is anemic for this, surprisingly. Certainly not, but with these guys involved, it should have been better. Continuous focus with Fuji detracts from the game. Print tips by counting out when Janetty is nailed to salt. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> Jim Duggan Vs Dino Bravo / W Earthquake and Jimmy Hart. Duggan like an idiot, brings out the American flag in Canada. Duggan also gets solid boos, but this can also be due to Bravo's Canadian heritage. Crappy game everywhere, I don't care about Duggan, but that's not why it's sucked. Too short in the end, to really matter. Duggan wins when he beats Bravo in the back, with the two at four. Duggan gets splashes for his problems. <br /> <br /> Million Dollar Championship. Ted Dibiase | C | / W Virgil. Vs Jake Robers / W Damien. A few slow spots, but when I said everything, I had a good time. Two solid wrestlers gave it all, led to an entertaining match. Crowds get Ancy noticeable during parts of it, but by doing the wave. Dibiase wins by counting. Jake had the last laugh, giving away his money, much to the crowd's delight. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Big Bossman vs Akeem / W Slick. Nice doll for The Bossman. Too routine and too short to mean something. Akeem was a gimmick, I was never too fond of. Bossman wins with his grinding. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Rhythm & Blues segment was almost a failure. Crowd wasn't in it <br /> <br /> Rick Rude / W Bobby Heenan. Vs Jimmy Snuka. For a stuffing game, before the main event, it wasn't bad. If it had time to go, it would have been. Rude victories, with the unwavering awakening. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> Title For Title. Ultimate Warrior | IC Champ | Vs Hulk Hogan | WWF Champ | This one is all about the atmosphere of the crowd, and the divided crowd reaction, for the most part. Warrior got a pretty decent doll, but in my opinion it was a little underprivileged. Hogan dwarf it completely, with her. It is one of Wrestlemania's best games in history. With two people, who are not really well-known, struggling there, they managed to create a wonderful match that has been spoken over the centuries. I've seen it many times, and my respect level is getting bigger for everyone, since I'm not a fan either. Even the hard-hitting fanatics who crave pure wrestling can't type this one! Warrior wins with his splash. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining entry, if nothing too special. It's unforgettable for the main event, location and crowd, but it's not one of the best if you ask me. It is said that I enjoy it, and I give it my recommendation to fellow wrestlers. <br /> <br /> 7/10
