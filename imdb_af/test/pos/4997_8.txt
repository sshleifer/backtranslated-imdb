There were some harsh criticisms of Comanche Moon on IMDb. I think it's for three reasons. First, purists are disappointed that the mini-series isn't exactly like the book. Secondly, it's not as good as the original Lonesome Dove. Lastly, people who would like to complain about IMDb and the biggest movies in the world will have bad comments. <br /> <br /> I want to say that no movie will be as good as the book. That's just how it is. One day Dove wasn't as good as the novel on which it was based. In addition, the film by Lonesome Dove left out and transformed a few things. That's just how it goes with a movie adaptation of anything. So it's a useless argument if you look at Comanche Moon. <br /> <br /> I agree, it's not as good as the original pigeon. But hey, nothing is. I know people who lead their lives through the lessons they learned from Dove. If I compared every book I read, I watched and watch TV I watched by Lonesome Dove; I will always be unhappy. <br /> <br /> This is made for TV miniseries based on a prequel to Lonesome Dave (the novel) and follow-up to Dead Man's Walk, which is what you get. It's the best TV I've seen for years. It's a fun essay for Lonesome Dove. We learn about the history of the Rangers we know and love in Dove. Zahn does a wonderful job of recreating Gus McCrae. Elizabeth Banks and Linda Forenelli (sp?) Also do good work as characters that help fill in the past of the rangers and Newt. <br /> <br /> When / when it goes on again, I promise you'll enjoy It is more than a few crumb reality shows.
