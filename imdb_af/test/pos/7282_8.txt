I was pleasantly surprised to find a very enjoyable film that kept my attention throughout. I'm a horror fan and I almost see everything in that genre, but Dead Line managed to get me out. The pass is very clever and Andr√©s Bagg does a good performance as a desperate man. What's under the main plot? A journey to madness. How do you end up like that? Martin Sanders asks himself, while he sees a homeless man, alone in the street. Near the end of the film, Aaron Mandel's character asks the same question as he sees another homeless who does the same; Not knowing, but being homeless Martin Sanders, who answered the question from the beginning of the movie. The broken glasses in two are a clear symbol of fracture and division ... of personality. The end is jaw and you just know that a successor has to be made.
