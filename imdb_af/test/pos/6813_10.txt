What a show! Lorenzo Lamas again proves his talent as a policeman who committed the worst crime a good policeman could commit by being a good policeman. Then he shows how sensitive a policeman can be, and shows a variety of emotions like no other actor can, except perhaps in Terminal Justice. <br /> <br /> GREAT ENJOYMENT!
