Look for this movie after reading Tom Clancy's "Red Storm Rising" novel. Timeless masterpiece of the 13th century Russians invaded by the Germans. Film was made in 1938, under the command of Joseph Stalin to warn Soviets about Hitler and Germany. Battle scenes have been done wonderfully, indicating that you don't need computer animation to make a big battle scene. Probably Sergei Eisenstein's greatest work. Also see 'Battleship Potemkin'. Any history buff or poly-sci major should see this movie. 10 out of 10.
