Trapped this movie on TV and I watched it again. I told myself, it's been a long time since I watched this movie, so why not. And again, this movie made me excited. It's so easy, so visible and so humane that I don't know why some people like it. <br /> <br /> John Travolta shines like Michael (his dance and every move), an angel almost related to this word. He smokes, drinks and he eats like a wilderness, but he has a big heart. Along the way, Michael helps all the people he meets. Dorothy Winters (Andie MacDowell) in her song and finds a real man. Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) develops himself as a good and decent man. Michael even helped out with old Pansy Milbank (Jean Stapleton) - the last scene is great when dancing on the street. <br /> <br /> Travolta had great help in other actors. Andie MacDowell is so beautiful and nice, William Hurt is great as usual, Robert Pastorelli shows his talent. Jean Stapleton and Teri Garr are also good, but my favorite supporting actor in this movie is Bob Hoskins as the tabloid owner. <br /> <br /> We have now thrown a solid movie about people with a hot story and attractive. Don't take this movie seriously and I can guarantee you will have fun.
