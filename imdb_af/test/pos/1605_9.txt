From the first to the last scene of the film, the director Visconti shows his art to the extent that the film is guaranteed to remain cultural treasure, for God knows how long. It's perfect - like a movie, it's, but the story has a few shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Thomas Mann's novel is also a perfect piece of art, so of course it is impossible to get into another media. Visconti follows the story pretty much, and it is only when he allows himself to deviate slightly that the transition falls. And how wonderful the scenery is, the tension in the air between the characters, the hundreds of subtle signals and allegories, the almost unbearably increased ministry of Mahler's music. Nevertheless, the instantaneous anomalies disturb the plot. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just a victim of man's desire to make the flawless mistakes. Yet I will give one example that I consider essential. WARNING: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In Mann's story, Aschenbach eats the strawberries that are likely to contain the disease that will kill him. , after giving up his frustrated boy Tadzio boy in Venice. Can't get one joy, he settles for another - poisoning him. It is very subtle in the book, but it is there. The forbidden fruit, of a kind, but more of a sign of him, gives life itself. <br /> <br /> In Visconti's film, he also eats strawberries, but in a rather insignificant beach scene. The hunt in Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way. It also works, but does not have a degree of subtlety, and also the multilayer symbolism, which gives food for thought. <br /> <br /> But it's all forgiven, when the movie allows us to fascinate on beautiful scenery, become faces and constellations, and certainly as many other symbols as we possibly can consume - Tadzio's last gesture in standing the water is the equally sublime and mysterious finale.
