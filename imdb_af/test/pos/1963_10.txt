I just saw this movie for the second time. I only saw it in the mid-90s as a Vanguard Video selection. It kept the power. <br /> <br /> It is interesting from several aspects. One is that it is based on a true story. Two is a launch pad for two interesting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And three, it has Dennis Hopper in one of his better social misfit / psychotic characters roles. <br /> <br /> The film is also a study of how people act in different institutions. You have characters in one-on-one, family, peer group, school, general community settings, etc. The story is good to demonstrate how a person will behave in every environment. <br /> <br /> I wish I could find the details of the actual murder to compare with the movie. I saw a short while indicating that it was happening in California and that several schoolmates were taken to see the body. <br /> <br /> It's a good choice for a rainy video rental. Be prepared to feel untouched at the end.
