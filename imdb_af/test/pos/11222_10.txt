I recently attended Sundance as I have done in the past and was treated to the tiny pleasure of the bitter little Indians, the bunch of dark comedies and the now predictable portraits of dysfunction. But then I saw Mark and Michael Polish's "Northfork" and remember why I fell in love with the movies in the first place. 'Northfork' sweep over the screen with visionary courage and raking back to the original early work of Terence Malick and the existential landscapes of Antonioni. It's an impossible movie to easily explain one of its many strengths. It's enough to say it's a mature fairy tale with very low levels of meaning. It woke up my imagination and threw an impressive shadow over all the other movies I saw this year. It's a work of meticulous craftsmanship and a sophisticated writing not seen in most American movies. I plan to return to this movie when it comes to my neighberhood theater. For it is a seductive piece of magic and mystery, a haunting place where one can fight the plains of Montana in search of angels and the nature of heaven and earth. The film performs these bodies with conspicuous conviction, especially James Woods and Nick Nolte, who remind us of the nerve and the courage displayed in the course of their careers. Perhaps 'Northfork' will help us find a new golf American cinema where craftsmanship and writing are more than the exception. Seeing it as your way and taking your friends for the questions will be great and the thoughts and feelings that are spurred by 'Northfork' will wake up memories of a big movie that has been seen in your past and now hopefully with the arrival of the Polish Brothers.
