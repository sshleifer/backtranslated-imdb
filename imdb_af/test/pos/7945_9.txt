I saw this movie back in the early 70's and I was enchanted by Judy Geeson. For me, it caught the clandestine nature of Rod Steigers' undeniable obsession with the young and extremely sexy hitch hiker, played by Geeson. <br /> <br /> You couldn't help feeling a little sorry for the woman, Claire played brilliantly. Bloom. I was really disappointed to see that the original track may have been lost and there is little chance of it being released on DVD. <br /> <br /> I'm cheating anyone watching the movie, and it's a strong message not to be the same. absorbed by the three main character shows, and I would have liked it if it were nothing else, just nostalgic reason. <br /> <br /> Go back in time, about 35 years. <br /> A true classic.
