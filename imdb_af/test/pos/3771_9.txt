It's one of those rare comedies where you can try, but you can't help but giggle, chortle, guffaw and yes, even out loud. The main actor's performance as Hyde is pure manic genius. See if you can keep a straight face when doing his transformation. Strength. :) On the downside, there are times when the movie falls. It was longer than 90 minutes.
