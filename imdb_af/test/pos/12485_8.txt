Is this a murder mystery? Is this a police procedure? Is this a background course on ugly French music halls? Quai des Orfevres is all this, but more than anything else, it is an amusing comedy of infidelity, jealousy and love, established in post-World War II Paris. It can be surprising that Henri-Georges Clouzot, the director of such grim films such as Le Corbeau or such exciting nail brushes such as Diabolique and The Lords of Fear, is the director of this one. However, Clouzot was a sharp filmmaker. "In a murder mystery," he tells us, "there is an element of playfulness. It is never quite realistic. I share Hitchcock's view, saying:" A murder mystery is a piece of cake with raisins and candied fruit, and if you deny it yourself, you can just like a documentary. "Quai des Orfevres is a great movie, and it is not a documentary. <br /> <br /> Jenny Martineau (Suzy Delair) is an ambitious singer at music halls and dinner clubs. Seeing nothing wrong with using a little sex as well as talent to get a contract. Her stage name is Jenny Latour. And she really loves her husband, Maurice Martineau (Bernard Blier). Martineau is a sad bag, he is her companion and director, he is a bit naked, a little chubby and jealous of a mistake, then we have their neighbor, photographer Dora Monnier (Simone Renant), she is blonde, beautiful (think of Rita Hayworth She and Martineau have been friends since their children were together, but Dora is definitely not just a friendship when she looks at Jenny, then comes George's Brignon (Charles Dullin), a former, rich and dirty old man. what Dora often uses, takes 'art' photos of his young female protest he sets himself, and offers a movie for Jenny, and Prepare a dinner at his home to discuss the details. Jenny is more than willing. Maurice is furious and forbids it. Jenny shouts straight back to him, "You're jealous of the rich! Well, I want to share my dough. I'm all right!" "Your father was a laborer," Maurice shouts back. "So what? Under Louis XV, I would have been Madame de Pompadour! I warmed their tights!" <br /> <br /> And after Brignon died with a broken champagne bottle next to his bleeding skull, Dora was making things safe for Jenny. But wait. Insp. Antoine gets the case. Antoine (Louis Jouvet) is a tall, tired, middle-aged baby with sore feet. He saw it all. He served in the "colonies" with the Foreign Legion and returned with an adopted baby and malaria. The child is now about eight years old and Antoine pushes him. One of the first things Antoine discovered did not just break someone Brignon with a bottle, someone shot him in the heart. Who did this? For a long time, Jenny, Maurice and Dora make alibis, lie down and lie on some point of confession. How will Antoine discover the killer? Will we have a chance to see some good music venues sung by Jenny Latour? Everything becomes clear, but only with time and Detective Antoine's tenacity. We have many kinds of love that lead to all kinds of motives, from hair-triggering jealousy to longing looks. And everyone played with a nice mix of Gallic entertainment. <br /> <br /> Clouzot brings us to a Paris of seedy, but not threatening neighborhoods, to darkened music publishers where piano songs are played for buyers, to restaurants with discreet private dining rooms. Most of all, he takes us to the music hall where Jenny Latour performs regularly. We can see Jenny as she sings, with couples in the seats and some men wearing their coats and hats in stalls. And everyone smokes. The first third of the film actually takes place largely in this environment. With Jenny singing about "Her lovely tra-la-la, her lovely tra-la-la", we follow her out to try the song at the publishers to make a rehearsal for a bad performance with Jenny in " feathers, a corset, ribbed socks and not much else. <br /> <br /> Delair, Blier and Renant all do wonderful work, but Louis Jouvet does everything. He was a wonderful actor who likes to make movies. The stage was his world, and he only used films when he was the director and making money to fund his stage work. Jouvet was tall with a long face and broad cheekbones. He wasn't conventionally attractive, but he needed to dominate a scene. For a look at how skilled he can play comedy, look at Drole de Drame. He is a fascinating actor. At one point he says, "I chose you, Dora Monnier." "Me?" she asked. "Yes, because you and I are two of a kind. If it comes to women, we will never get a chance." Jouvet brings all sorts of nuances to that line, from angry regret to soft entertainment.
