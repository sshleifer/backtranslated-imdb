It is generally an acceptable fact that Marcel Carné's films from 1936 to 1946 are masterpieces and it becomes polite to say the rest are mediocre. This is an unfair opinion: at least two of the latter centuries are particularly noticeable: "Thérèse Raquin", his best post-war work and "les tricheurs". There is a strange evolution of the Prevert golden hour after "les tricheurs": in "les enfants du paradis" "quai des brumes" or "le jour se lève", true love is thwarted by the villains. In "les tricheurs" true love no longer exists: we are about a lot of young people who believe in nothing; falling in love with these youths uncomfortable. The adults are not the villains: Mic's brother and mother are friendly. people, but she is out of order. Many adults look anyway. <br /> <br /> In two hours, the characters don't stop to play, dance, listen to jazz records (a music that hasn't been quiet yet is part of the bourgeois culture) and drinks heavily . When two of them discover that they care about each other, it will be too late. <br /> <br /> The throw is pretty good, Laurent Terzieff as an existential synika and André Paris Petit and especially Jacques Charrier (who was married the same year as "les tricheurs") do not have the ambiguity they ask for . They are all smiling. , too sweet and nice to be credible. <br /> <br /> Strange, "les tricheurs" is marked "nouvelle vae"! When you know what the priests of this theater school (such as Godard) thought of Carné, this is really a good joke. But this disillusionment you feel throughout the movie is really disturbing.
