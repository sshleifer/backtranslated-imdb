I just voted excellent because this movie took two snapshots of Americana: one in 1970 and one for every year afterwards. <br /> <br /> Nothing really changed. <br /> <br /> Actually, Joe is a big stupid messy who is angry at his own idiot on everyone else in the world. It's not really a devastator, but the key to the movie is the big, corporate "never-wrong" guy who makes friends with this semi-trogious Joe, and he gets some sort of ... ratification from his fools and stupidity and sense to be wrong. <br /> <br /> Yet, few people would argue that the merchant's boyfriend deserved to die. And those kids didn't have to turn Joe and Compton off. And Joe and Compton actually came in the hash and the young skin until they fell off. A simple movie in many ways, except that in 1970 New York City was par after a battle zone due to Nixon's care, and all the money went to the Vietnam War. As I write it (2/25/2007) there is a "very long wait" on Netflix for this movie - which makes me happy because I think there are people out there who want to learn. It was a pretty good snapshot - not exactly, a bit of caricature - but pretty close to what it was then. And the scary thing is - things haven't changed that much. Certainly, there is no more welfare, but it just means that the wage slavery has won. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly how millionaires will complain about not having enough money, then complaining that $ 5.15 per hour is too much to pay their people.
