Along with Cops, the buck is one of Keaton's two funniest shorts. This makes it one of the best shorts ever made. It has a decent "plot" for a short, and it is a perfect line to hang some good gags. Keaton is wrong for an escaped offender (how the mistake happens is a classic) and then the authorities must evade. Best gags - the bread line and he is "lift".
