Frankly, I really don't understand why there was so much controversy about this show. It embraces the elements of the original while expanding it. The storytelling has been updated and while some of the episodes are a bit "fast", it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is perfect in the role. Easy as good as Tom Baker. <br /> <br /> Rose is one of the best companions, similar to Sarah Jane Smith or Leela. <br /> <br /> I like the concept that the timelines have been destroyed. - No more police with the doctor acting as president emeritus. And it adds something to the character to be the only one. <br /> <br /> The SFX is outstanding - especially when compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Take it away from me (And I was a great Dr. Who geek - I actually took notes while I watched the show from Dr. number 1 to Dr number 8. I have the terrible movie from cannon rinsed out) this is the best sci fi show on TV now, possibly ever. Watch it and buy the DVD.
