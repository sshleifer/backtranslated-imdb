These guys combine low-brow with a low budget. It is glorious. <br /> <br /> Look-if you want Bergman, rent "7th Seal" or something. If you want to see sex and sex exploitation, it's the one. <br /> <br /> I think Jane Jensen as Julia makes it all visible. She can actually act (very well), she is a complete dream boat, and she doesn't look above all else.
