I think it's definitely. The writing is of such a quality that English language beginner students have to model their conversations after the dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey and Bronson. Kathryn Davis (Deborah Raffin) (more on this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Me. Davis says, "I hope you like chicken. That's the only thing I know how to make," with which Kersey responds, "Chicken is good. I like chicken." If it isn't English Grammar 101, I don't know what it is. <br /> <br /> Another thing about this girl. Davis Character: Kersey sleeps with her on the second date after she almost throws her and tells him she wants to see him one last time "(this is just the fourth time they have ever met) before going to her sister's home In Binghamton, NY, moving away from the cribs, he didn't even blow an eye, while her body burned in the street just minutes later, and Kersey never even told her first name through the film. Never a "Come here, Katy" or a "It's a nice dress you wear, Kathryn" or "Be careful, Katie or the creeps will get you!" <br /> <br /> And while it develops "love" between the two, Fraker (Gavan O'Herlihy) keeps his watchful eyes on them. It is almost as if Kersey used her as a bait to get Fraker, much like he used the camera or the car. enough, when Fraker bites, Kersey bites back hard ... in the incredible series of events ever captured on film, the final fifteen or so minutes may just be by the la eight thirty minutes from Delta Force in their glory. And it gives Delta Force a lot of credit. In what other movie can you see Ed Lauter taking out Alex Winter to get Charles Bronson's back, a troubled gang leader who apparently calls a hotline to call neo-Nazi bikers to come to his aid, and busy Broadway Dancers wearing mesh dumbbell top positions as street points, all laid out on a soundtrack written by none other than Jimmy Page. If it is not the highest of the high comedy, nothing is funny. Truly, there are a thousand ways to explain the unintentional comedy of Death Wish 3, but the only way to really understand it is to look at it and judge for yourself.
