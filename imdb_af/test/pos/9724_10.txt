Series as a whole - Jim Henson's best work. John Hurt * is * the storyteller. Often, Oscar caliber is displayed, not surprising when you consider Minghella doing the writing. Oscar caliber always works. <br /> <br /> Saturday - Everyone loves 'The Soldier and Death', but something about 'Tomorrow' pushes it a iota higher in my favor. In the first ballroom scene, the costumes, the music - perfection. Hurt and the dog are typically semi-interacting with the story, but this time Minghella bumps it extra into the 'ring' scene between Hurt and Sapsorrow. The chemistry between characters is especially well-developed, more so than usual in the series, with reference to the friendship between Straggletag and the prince. Did you see it? See it again. Give more attention (to those of you who do not entertain this 22 minute piece of cinematic perfection). Never seen it? I'm so sorry. <br /> <br /> Luck Child - not as sophisticated as Somsmore, but very clever in its own right. This is a story about irony. Irony to irony, within irony ... I love it. Each character is done to perfection, with the exception of the ferryman. He did drama; Everybody did a romantic comedy. I forgive him. This is my favorite of the mainly comic episodes, "Somsorrow" and "The Soldier and Death" are examples of more dramatic episodes. Side note: Greek Myths. What the lack of Minghella subtlety (different writer) lacks makes it explicit in bravery, as it depicts the four chosen myths with more sympathy and respect and history than it normally is. Also check out the Jim Henson Hour if you can get your hands. For Storyteller adicts, it contains the man himself introducing the myths, the lion of the true bride, and ... no annoying opening theme! Half storyteller, half pure, unadorned muppet white.
