The best screen display ever by George C. Scott. The script by Chayefsky, the irony-laden dialogue, is near perfect ("Where are you practicing your nurses, Dachau?"). Rigg is wonderful as the rescue angel who saves Scott from punishment, just like the whole role. It's a hilarious and serious movie. It's a movie of the period, the 60's, but it's not dated at all. What it is about, the chaos and irrationality of the system and the common sense of the individual, is timeless. And the "We cure nothing, we cure nothing" monologue (rendered, actually screamed, as no one else could do) with references to cloning and other wonders of modern science could literally be written this morning. <Br /> <br />
