Ray is one of those movies waiting for you. You actually think about what you heard or think about what you read about this man and it doesn't even come close. During my first show by Ray I forgot I watched a movie. I felt like a can of river looking at this man's life through a window. This movie is so compelling, it pulls you in and it involves you every emotion you go through an emotional rollercoaster ride and when it's about you, you don't want to do it again so soon because it has that kind of emotional punch that other movies are missing. Jamie Foxx deserves his Oscar and is very fair, so his performance is spectacular and must be kept as the standard for anyone who wants to make a bio-picture soon. This movie is as good as it's subject, both earning the classic and legend titles.
