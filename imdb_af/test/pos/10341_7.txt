This movie still lives today and kicks in thanks to Alan Ladd's presence. It's one way, because the movie has a few interesting things to say, but bad in another because everyone who sees it expects sturdy Ladd to hop through his usual steps, which will be very disappointing. Without fanfare or introduction, Ladd is suddenly introduced in the third line. True, its role is an important one, but it is small and probably lost in the shuffle. There are many key roles in former journalist Martin Mooney's ambivalent script that comes out of all political alliances and ruthlessly denies the reform candidates. It is the beautiful and highly talented Joan Woodbury who connects the different parts of the wide variety. Unlike the usual Hollywood production, the plot actually goes into a series of jumps, just like the films later released by the French "New Wave", although it is easier to follow here, especially if you are aware that is the original title of the movie Paper Bullets. However, some of the movie's narrative and character switches are a bit disturbing, especially in the role Jack LaRue played. It has been wisely chosen to do the part in a strange, uninvolved way. One of Jack's best acting works, ever, but nobody will probably notice it!
