This perverse perverted and early 80-year-old teenage score can never reach the astonishing highlight of the deeply disturbing and criminal underrated murderous movie "Devil Times Five", but it is still a top opus killer child. <br /> <The sleek but useful plot centers on a trio of misfit tykes - two bratty boys and one spectacular bright eye, though an angelic girl - born on June 9, 1970 during a solar eclipse. When the strange antisocial trio, which comes in a dense, separate and exclusive circle, is ten years old, they suddenly die out and declare off-season on the indifferent, unsuspecting local jukle of the formerly sleepy and peaceful suburb of Meadowvale, California. . . Author / director Ed Hunt, the usually incompetent unsung hook that is responsible for such wonderful miserable clunkers as the wonderfully dull "Starship Invasions", the ominous Jesus Christ vigilante parable (!) "Alien Warrior" and the amazingly stupid "The Brain" a nice, solid and competent work here: the dead screens are abundant and fairly cruel (the arrow-by-the-eye gag is particularly nasty), there is a considerable smack of free nudity and soft core sex, good amount of tension is neatly created and maintained, a few beautiful dolls of dark humor give the arresting chaos, and the surprising fury really ends up jolting. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the top loader raises the proceedings to Jose Ferror as a small town doctor, the future "Jake and the Fatman" TV series star Joe Penny as an amateur astrologer, The Prey's Lori Lethin as the brave babysitter heroine, Susan Strasberg as a bitch school teacher, "American Ninja" Michael Dudikoff as a chowderhead jock, and Cyril O'Reilly (the lonely misanthrope vampire in the hauntingly melancholy "Dance of the Damned") as " a libidinous teenager who is being pocketed while just doing what you think with a few naked hot chick in the back of a parked bus. Billy Jacoby (who went in the late 80's direct-to-video thrash as Dr. Alien and Demonwarp), and Andy Freeman, and especially the honest, rich Elizabeth Hoy, is really dirty and convincing as the terrible trophy of chillingly evil and amoral rugrats. And yes, it's nothing but Julie Brown, the brass comedy that made a surprise. Top 40 sounded with the hilarious newcomer "The Homecoming Queen's Gotta Gun", as the beautiful, immature, full-breast redhead bimbo that is very long, totally weird but still hissing and prized naked striptease while dancing in her bedroom to a cheesy lightning! All in all, this baby is greeting as a solid and satisfying slasher item.
