Renoir's story of Paris, the Cancan, a washer and the Moulin Rouge. A more subdued but highly entertaining version of the opening of the Moulin Rouge. Jean Gabin gives his usual excellent performance. The Technicolor photography on the print I saw was beautiful. An easy evening's performance. chris w galla
