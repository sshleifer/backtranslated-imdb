Daniel Percival's "Dirty War", a BBC television production, was recently shown on the cable. The film has a documentary style in the way it goes to the people who caused the near holocaust in one of the great metropolitan of the world, London. In fact, this film, which was produced in 2004, is almost a warning sign of the events of the next year, in which terrorists put explosive devices into public transport that killed the innocent people in the wrong place at the wrong time. /> <br /> The movie impresses the pace the director and the production team have given the project. There are no dull moments in the movie, as we see the preparation by the terrorists and the people who follow their dirty work. Although the inevitable happens, it is wonderful to just think what the consequences would be if a true dirty bomb was planted in such a densely populated area. <br /> <br /> The last images of the movie have a cooling effect. The screens and the way the whole area is infected send fears of fear, and think how it can be.
