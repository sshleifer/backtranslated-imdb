Frank Sinatra has done so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it is difficult to postpone one as the best. If I had to mention the best thing he ever did, it would be his performance as Frankie Machine, the hero-addicted musician and poker merchant who is barely saved by the love of a good woman (played by an extraordinary babelicious Kim Novak). The "cold-turkey" scenes between Sinatra and Novak are scary and heartbreaking. The movie is almost perfect, from Saul Bass's title graphics to the groundbreaking jazz score by Elmer Bernstein. It may not be the kind of thing that someone thought in the 1950s, but it was a must see.
