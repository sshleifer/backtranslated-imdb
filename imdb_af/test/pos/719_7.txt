To summarize this movie: good for TV, but too small for the theater. I enjoyed watching this movie at home, but I won't see it a second time. The concept is good, but what ends in the movie is just a summary. The end had a "nice" twist, but it is still unsatisfactory. Perhaps it was the intention of the director, but it was not worked out as it should be. But then it's a good kind of movie again.
