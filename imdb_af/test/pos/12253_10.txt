TV news producer Jane Craig (Hunter) meets Tom Grunick (Hurt), an emerging news provider, at a seminar, and their mutual attraction takes them back to her room. However, romance is short, when it seems that Tom is in his own words, "not good at what I succeed", and Jane realizes he embraces everything she hates about where TV news is going. The rub comes when Tom announces he will join her news bureau in Washington. <br /> <br /> So Jane and Tom's initial appeal gets a second chance, but Jane will find her professional opinion of the man she's attracted to - and should she? Aaron Altman (Brooks) is Jane's highly intelligent reporter colleague and confidant. Despite his obvious talent, Aaron's career ceases because he does not have the confidence and people's skills - and the classic look - the success is what his new, less qualified and less intelligent colleague - Tom becomes. He is also worried that his good friend, Jane, may fall in love with Tom, despite her better judgment, as it is becoming increasingly clear that Aaron has her own romantic feelings for her. <br /> <br /> This central romantic plot is set within the trials and tribulations of a television news network office where moral dilemmas and ethics are rapidly emerging and where appearance and dramatic effect are becoming more and more important. <br /> <br /> That's where most of the bites come from with well-observed comments and scenes. One of the many moments is a scene where Tom meets for the first time at Network's leading anchor, Bill Rorich (Jack Nicholson's film role), and the camera focuses on their handshake. In a movie full of lines and dialogue, long and short, you realize a lot about these two men's characters from this one-shot two-handed shot. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between characters is one of the most intelligent and sharp, you will probably find anywhere on film and in such abundance. Brooks gets the best part from it, in line with his character, but even the shortest conversations that happen to be coincidentally and perhaps overheard by one or more characters as they move through a busy room must be listened to. <Br /> <br /> Hunter is a tour group in this role for which she was rightly (and not only) nominated for an Oscar and for which she would probably get it if it was a role in a movie that was not It's not part of what has become a closely related industry - and a strong performance of another actress in a more traditional feel-good rom-com. <br /> <br /> Brooks is also excellent as the constantly frustrated and Aaron Altman has sometimes seized. <br /> <br /> Fright, while having the appearance and the personality of his character not always convinced that he is reasonably dull, witted the character saying he is or is supposed to be. He displays a latent intelligence that allows him to make the most of his apparent limitations, which may be acceptable, but I don't think it's so bad. Except when he says he "stinks" or "doesn't get it", Hurt comes over as a bit smarter than that. Otherwise, it's an effective performance, in a role where his character is compromised by his intellectual limitations, but Brooks and Hunter are a little overshadowed by Hurt's performance. This is the only negative thing I can say about the whole movie, and who is to say that anyone else would want to do it better, or better off if I was next to Hunter and Brooks and their performances in this movie. <Br /> <br /> Support is provided by Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles and Joan Cusack. In addition, Christ Clemenson also plays the subsequent Boston Legal fame, and the shortest part of Joan's brother John Cusack, whose face you don't even see. <br /> <br /> James L Brooks provided us with great TV shows and movies, and this movie should be the very best of them. It may not have won Oscars, despite seven nominations, but it has won many other awards and Holly Hunter turned into a star.
