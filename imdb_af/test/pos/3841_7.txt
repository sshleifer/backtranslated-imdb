I only saw this movie once, a few years ago. But I remember it a lot. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers lie ahead ** An old famous opera singer has retired and she decides to give all the money she has to her cats. Her butler hears it and plans to get rid of the cats so he can have the fortune. He puts knockout drops in their milk. When they wake up, they find their miles away. They must return to their home before it is too late. With the help of an independent tomcat and other animal accomplices, while the butler escapes and his plan is filled. <br /> <br /> Could have been better, but it could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> My Score: 7/10.
