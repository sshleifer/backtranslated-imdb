I, a fan of Rupert Grint, rented this movie a few months ago. I thought it was a very well-written movie with a lot of good actors. It was entertaining and showed that Rupert Grint can play more than his best-known character of Ron Weasley. His subtle depiction of Ben and everyone's great acting made this movie very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Ben, a very shy boy with an extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. He finds one and becomes the one, I think you could call an assistant to Evie, a retired actress. Initially, it's just a way to make money for him. But after a while he and Evie seem to develop a friendship. Evie helps Ben break out of his shell and has fun and be happy with himself. In the end, they seem to need each other. <br /> <br /> Whether you're a Rupert Grint fan. Or not, this movie is a very entertaining one with some very cute and moments. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good movie with great and talented actors.
