OK, the show was a bit uneven, but I still loved it. I found the two main bunnies annoying, but Hamton & Plucky were always amusing. <br /> <br /> I really want the Baby Plucky episodes on DVD (or even VHS). Please leave it free! <br /> <br /> Specifically the episode "Potty years" broadcast on 11/22/91; the episode "Opsien" on 9/17/92 and the episode "Minister golf" in 11/92. <br /> <br /> They're the funniest bits of the whole series and even more than a decade later we're still referring to these bits! <br /> <br /> (I have nothing more to say, please reduce the minimum to something like 5 lines and reward us for brevity!)
