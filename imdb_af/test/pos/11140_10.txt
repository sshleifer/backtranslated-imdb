I am amazed by actress Bobbie Phillips and her wonderful skill as an action star! This movie is powered by her amazing acting and tremendous action skills. I'm a fan of sci-fi, but I have to say that this movie surpasses most of the science fiction movies in cinematography and mostly it is the use of an actress whose presence replaces the plot, which is good but nothing else is not. Although this movie seems to have been made for television, I think it's better than most cinema films of its kind.
