I saw it at the BendFilm festival on Friday, amidst a ceaseless crowd, not helped by a bad decision by the planners of the event, who chose a totally inappropriate short film to advance the movie. And it really threw the audience when modern love emerged after a light, whimsical short (name I forget). <br /> <br /> People !!! It was really stupid to mix it up with Modern Love - which is a serious drama movie. A movie movie. <br /> <br /> So the audience gets the teaser that is a comedy and then ... Modern Love. Hmmmm. Modern Love, in spite of my discussions (odd end, a little too tangential), needs a short movie that is similar to the strangeness of strangeness. Therefore, my advice to the programmers for next year is to plan more care for the show. <br /> <The people who look at Modern Love just didn't know what they were doing - they were headed down the road and it wasn't their fault. <br /> <br /> Modern Love has some excellent performances that play well against the tangential twists of the movie - a movie that "wonders about its author" rather than being performed in the normal way becomes a film written and shot. <br /> <br /> Bad audience was misinformed. Wrong session placement, wrong short film, wrong approach by well-meaning programmers, who, despite good efforts, need to see many more movies and travel to other festivals.
