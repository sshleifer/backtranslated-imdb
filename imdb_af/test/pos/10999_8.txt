The Squire of Gothos is one of the "wanderer" episodes of Star Trek, and therefore one of the most entertaining. The entertainment factor is generally fueled by the stance between William Shatner and the episode's hilarious guest, William Campbell. <br /> <br /> During an indefinite routine mission, Sulu suddenly disappears into the air and Kirk follows shortly after weeks. Spock immediately starts looking for his missing colleagues (though he wants to hate it, friends), while the two stranded crew members the mysterious, almighty, flamboyant Trelane (Campbell), the self-proclaimed Squire of Gothos, a being capable of create or destroy something that he wants by the mere power of his mind. <br /> <br /> At first sight, the plot may be recovered from previous episodes (frankly, there are any sci-fi shows that didn't have at least one God-like character), but the feeling disappears fairly fast thanks to the man's use of exaggerated humor, all of which is conveyed by Campbell's deliberate combat performance. His Trelane is essentially the Trek version of a corrupted child in the body of an adult, while his ignorance, the curiosity for the human race (his knowledge is very limited) probably served as inspiration for Gene Roddenberry when he reached the character of Q for the Next Generation pilot, about two decades later This episode broadcast. <br /> <br /> In short, the key to the appreciation of The Squire of Gothos is that "stupid" does not necessarily mean "bad".
