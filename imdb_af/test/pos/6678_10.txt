Just watched it and it was wonderful. Was in serious doubt about renting the DVD or not. So if you ... and like watching others as mindless action movies, please don't hesitate. Don't let the dull sheath leave you. The writing is one of the best ever. Inteligent, funny, original, touching and keeping you on the edge of the seat throughout the movie. I have already watched another movie, really sleepy, and usually I get bored to watch a second movie in one night, but one really made me wake up late and didn't have boring moments. It also reconsidered many things in life and gave me a very good feeling. <br /> <br /> The play is also great (one of Kevin Spacey's best roles). The visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well chosen. If I have to do something negative to say about it .... Well .... I really can't find anything ...... Enjoy! 10 out of 10
