This is the best comedy season. It's so understated! Clever spiritual humor, Great casting! Jerry Stiller is the jewel in the show, he is so incredibly funny and peculiar, just a comic genius! Doug and Carrie have good chemistry! I don't see it as the hype is about. Everyone loves Raymond. It's so overwhelmed with lame jokes that are mostly forced and just not the witty show, I can't remember laughing at more than one episode. King of Queens is a rare comedy that has all the right ingredients to make your serious stomach laugh, usually caused by Arthur Spooner. I think it's time this comedy gets the hype it deserves, not the lame Raymond & CO.
