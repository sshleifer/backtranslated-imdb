The inspiration of Disney's The Little Mermaid, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, is Japanese animation master, Hayao Miyazaki's next major work after the well-received Spirited Away in 2001 and Howl's Moving Castle in 2004. In Ponyo, his signature style of animation fantasy rich and kids characters are to be seen again. <br /> <br /> Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), the boy's lead role in the movie, discovers a 'goldfish' trapped in a glass pot while playing at the sea under the cliff. . He stays with his mother, Lisa (Tomoko Yamaguchi) above and above. Sosuke shakes the pot vigorously to try to get the 'goldfish' out, but the little 'goldfish' is stuck. He then tries to pull it out, but it just can't get rid of it. Sosuke puts the pot on the ground before hitting a small rock on it and immediately breaks it into pieces while suffering a small cut on the finger. He then carefully checks to see if the 'goldfish' is still alive. As he observes it, the "goldfish" responds by suddenly licking the blood of his finger. Excited, Sosuke hurries back home and puts the 'goldfish' in a small bucket of water hoping it will survive. This did and he called it 'Ponyo' (Yuria Nara). <br /> <br /> The above scene will indicate what's coming for the rest of the movie. These are the interactions between Sosuke and Ponyo. And this is one that Hayao Miyazaki has thoroughly portrayed. He must have a keen sense of perception and understanding of how children act before depicting this communication chemistry between the two main characters. The behavior of the children will also expand in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The love between Sosuke and Ponyo grew as the film progressed from the moment Sosuke Ponyo went to school in Lisa's car. The best moment came when the two were reunited after a brief divorce when Ponyo's father, Fujimoto (George Tokoro) repeated a magical seahorse the ominous Ponyo, before embracing her in a good-sized magic bubble. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, Fujimoto grew to refer horror to the pollution of the sea and to steal his life. But all that Ponyo wants is to be human and be with Sosuke, so for a second time, she accidentally escapes his father's precious shop of magical elixir in the sea, causing a storm of tidal waves and the small village in the process evokes. /> <br /> What is next is the adventures of Sosuke and Ponyo in the flooded town. <br /> <br /> Is there ever happy in this? Would true love dominate? You find out. <br /> <br /> Look at the art in Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, and there seems to be a deviation from Miyazaki's past's works. It looks strange because the environment, apart from the characters playing in each play, is not colored in the usual way as in Spirited Away (2001) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004). The aesthetic appeal is discounted from what appears to be colored pencil sketches. The objects and characters are not as detailed as before. <br /> <br /> It is strange if it is taken at face value, but from the way the story is written and told, the possible explanation is that Miyazaki allows the audience to see the movie with a child's tone, but allow the adults to remind themselves of a Japan when they are younger. This move could have prevented prospective filmmakers, a new thing for Miyazaki's work to see it. The trailer did nothing to promote Ponyo. However, taking the matter to Japan would be a different story if Miyazaki's credibility goes far beyond any marketing technique. <br /> <br /> In summary, however, the whole does not equal its parts. Apart from Miyazaki's ability to cast live and animated characters, the movie lacks elements of excitement and wonder when measured against previous works, resulting in a shortage of big-screen presence. <br /> <br /> The sparks of Ponyo and Sosuke failed to lift the movie in a big way, but moments of warmth, kindness and love can still be found in the recognition of the movie as one not for the children were made, but of the children who were all at one time or another.
