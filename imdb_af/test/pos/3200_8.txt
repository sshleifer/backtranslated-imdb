This short film (and the poem behind it) is one of the greatest metaphors I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The poem is beautiful! It describes exactly the feeling of a person who is chasing a dream and cannot realize it? but it also tells how to fulfill it! I see the "Story of the Cat and the Moon" as one beautiful metaphor for human relationships, passion and love. <br /> <br /> Technically, this is also a good job. Despite the fact that it is very simple, the animation in black and white gives a tone of allegory to the movie and to its message, but also of tenderness and nostalgia. <br /> <br /> In addiction, music also contributes to this poetic feeling. <br /> <br /> "Nothing else matters! I'll wait! She'll come when she can or when she wants to!"
