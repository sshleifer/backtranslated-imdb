This is undoubtedly the worst black and white war movie I have watched; In fact, the only Western director at this time to approach his intensity level and sheer visceral power in his work was Samuel Fuller. Incidentally, I attended a Ichikawa retrospective at the National Film Theater in London in September 2002, but could only get his work between 1960 and 1973. <br /> <br /> The movie is definitely as depressed as it is known to be; However, it also appears welcome in black humor. The "dead" man waking up to answer an inquiring soldier and immediately dying again, the deliciously ironic shoe order, an earlier eccentric telling the secret hero, what part of the body he should eat, etc. Incidentally, the script is written by a woman. Natto Wada, the directors own wife! <br /> <br /> Ichikawa is a versatile and productive filmmaker whose reputation may not be so high. It was during his peak years (1956-65), but his direction is often striking - the exciting pre-credit series (the hero is violently punished by his superior officer to be discharged earlier than expected from the hospital!), The death of a surrender of Japanese in the hands of a Filipino woman with a gun injury, the bombing of a hospital (with medical staff running away to save themselves, leaving the wounded soldiers behind to get their own limited pace), the automatic march in the rain of the disillusioned soldiers (who is also the aforementioned business with the shoes, actually remembers a similar scene in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN WESTERN FRONT [1930]), a hill full of the bodies of soldiers trying to climb it, the final, etc. One of the most important assets of the film is the beautiful cinematography of the unforgivable and desolate muddy landscape. <br /> <br /> The film is notorious for treating the taboo subject of cannibalism (nearly 10 years before it became a staple of horror movies), but Ichikawa's approach is not only subtle but highly effective: the flesh is actually referred to as "ape" while the hero is only seen once (and spits it quickly with most of his rotting teeth!); In fact, when the poor experience soldier (played by Mickey Curtis who, despite his name, was a Japanese pop idol of the time!) Welcomed racist, the land was spattered with blood. <br /> <br /> In the supplements, remember Ichikawa that Method-practicing chief actor Eiji Funakoshi (for the sake of the unforgettable depiction thereof) came upon the famine - with the result that production had to be forced for two weeks until he repair it! Donald Richie's upcoming interview favors the nihilism of the film about underlying patriotism behind such a deadly recent Hollywood prize as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998). <br /> <br /> FIRES ON THE PLAIN is universally regarded as one of his director's best efforts and from the various films Ichikawa I have watched is the closest in spirit to the BURMESE HARP (1956; another Character-driven war film, but with a spiritual tone, and also available on DVD of Criterium) and ENJO aka CONFLAGRATION (1958, which was actually a limited stage performance locally, as part of a foreign film week, a few years ago). Personally, I also have a particularly soft place for the directors' stunningly stylized color review, an ACTOR'S REVENGE (1963), which I actually caught twice in 1999 at the NFT and retrospectively mentioned the 2002 edition.
