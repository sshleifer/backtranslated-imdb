Certainly, it proves beyond doubt that Patricia Arquette is what she is promoting: an ACTRESS! This is undoubtedly her best moment of acting and she earns the credit for her work. Not in any of her other films, with the possible exception of Holy Marriage, she is completely credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Plot: A young woman finds herself in Southeast Asia and is suddenly thrown into political devastation. from the countryside. She is a witness of mass murder and totalitarianism and escapes. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you should see or you haven't seen Hollywood's best. I rank it 58 in the top 100 movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Thank you Bob
