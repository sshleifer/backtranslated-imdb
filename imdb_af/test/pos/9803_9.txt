This movie was a sad piece of cinema that helped show the darker side of childhood, and the little things Tom Hank's shape shaped. Using a very cryptic story, they could give you an idea of ​​what really happened to Tom Hank's character as a child. And while scenes like the flying machine have never happened, it helped to show how even denial can help tell the truth. In all good conscience, I could not judge this lower than a 9 out of 10, good performances by all the actors, and although not much understood the cryptic end where the brother was murdered by his stepfather, and Tom Hanks cover Use a hasty story about a flying machine, note the small details, such as the turtle he still has, even if his brother flew from it. Truly, a beautiful piece of cinema, and every actor deserves recognition.
