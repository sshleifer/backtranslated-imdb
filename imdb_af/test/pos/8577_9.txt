Personally, I think the movie is pretty good. It takes almost 8. I like the ethnographic aspect as well as the beautiful photography. Colin Firth's character is not the best, but he does better than decent work with the role. The heroine, played by the beautiful Nia Long, is a well-known movie heroine, trying to do what she thinks is best for her child - marrying a respected member of her expatriate community while she's "the bad "man - one who is not a member of her community (the" outsider "). Most of the film is about this mother's struggle: should she do what is expected of her, what she thinks is best for her son or should she follow her heart? I don't want to end. Let me just say that this is a good movie, with beautiful place shots, beautiful African dress (it's worth seeing the movie just for the women's brilliantly colored African clothing and headgear), and similar characters about the general. The actor playing Nia Long's son is bright and rich. The plot is a bit formal, but I like the movie. If you are a Colin Firth fan, you should see this movie. If you like nice flashes, see it. I think I will look again tonight!
