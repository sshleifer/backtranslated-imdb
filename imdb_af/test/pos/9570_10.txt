This is the best of the films (so far) that Christopher Guest created using his talented ensemble cast. Previously they made the excellent WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and followed BEST IN SHOW, they made the very enjoyable A MIGHTY WIND. As for their latest, for your consideration, the less the better said. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a documentary about dog shows and several participants in particular. You follow these few selected dogs from preview preparations to the big night where one of them is best chosen in the fictional "Mayflower Kennel Club". But none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts, but talent improvisation actors who parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world. Incredibly, although the characters are rather outrageous, there is a lot of truth to the personalities they parody - like decades ago, I had some experience with dog shows and it's a very healthy group of people! My favorites from the dog owners were the incredible high-pressure and tense yuppie couple who only exerted anger and volatility. I also loved the open-gay couple because they were terribly funny and clever. The best performance was probably not from any of the couples, but from Fred Willard who played the world's stupidest and least talented human history presenter. His comment was one-off and he often betrayed him as an incredible stupid person - how he became the announcer for such a sought-after performance is someone's guess. The other contestants were also quite funny - the affordable professional poodle handler and his rich owner, the country boy and his dog, as well as Winkie's "parents" who could scarcely scrape away to make it to the show. / <br /> Despite the improvised style of filmmaking, the pieces all fit together wonderfully and tell a very funny and compelling story - one that is NOT just for dog owners. Exceptional acting has made this one of the best comedies of the past decade. Smart and consistently funny. <br /> <br /> By the way, try to find it on DVD, as the extras were really worth seeing. While a little painful to look at, I loved seeing Harlan Pepper and his beach ball collection in particular!
