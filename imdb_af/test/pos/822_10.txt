This film was made on a relatively small budget ($ 10-20 million?), With almost no promoters from its distributors. I just knew because I am a long fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme and I always look at his latest films in the hope that they will at least be vigilant and apart from some real turkeys (Derailed, Second In Command) , they are . This movie has an easy plot to follow and Van Damme gives a good, humorous performance, but the film owes its credit to the battle scenes that Van Damme, Scott Adkins and the last one go with. The editing and camera work for most of the movie is pretty awful, but Isaac Florentine can definitely be a good fight scene movie. I am also pleased that Van Damme has worked better over the past few years (In Hell, Death of Death, To Death), but with the good acting, fewer martial arts came. In the shepherd Van Damme proves that he still has it.
