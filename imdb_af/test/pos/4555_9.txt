During my journey into a youth leadership forum, I was navigating channel until I found "Tommy Boy" on TBS. Since I've never seen this movie, I wanted to watch it. My roommate, who has already seen it, told me, "This movie is a classic." After I saw the whole movie, I came to the conclusion that he was right. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is constantly funny from start to finish thanks to the comedy duo of Chris Farley and David Spade. Farley is a riot as the title character, a spastic doofus that only lives through life as if it wasn't important. His slacker-esqe ways come to a halt quickly when his father (Brian Dennehy), a rich "Break Pads King", dies of a heart attack on his wedding day. As a result, Tommy, with the help of his sarcastic childhood Richard (David Spade), sets out to sell enough breaking pages to save the company. <br /> <br /> The main reason "Tommy Boy" works is the funny performances of the lead. Farley is the funniest person in this movie, the second funniest person is Spade and the third is Rob Lowe as the movie's villain who has poor luck. Another funny man is Dan Aykroyd as Ray Zalinsky, a well-known auto parts extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the movie works is the large number of jokes. Chris Farley has hilarious slapstick moments, and David Spade has funny funny comments and one-liners. The gags in the movie (relating to a deer and an airplane bathroom) are extremely funny, thanks to director Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3), writers Bonnie & Terry Turner <br /> <br / Tommy Boy is " a very funny movie, but for some unknown reasons, most film critics (including Roger Ebert) find it. terrible and unfunny. (I wonder when their sense of humor died.) I recommend "Tommy Boy" to those who are great comedies of comedy. Thank you very much, roommate.
