The big James Cagney, with large letters in large letters, does not appear to the second third of the movie and probably has less screen time than Dudley Digges, who plays the one-wild reforming school potential. But when Jimmy arrives, as a deputy commissioner of something or other, to reform reform schools, he cuts the air with his hands and jumps on the balls of his feet and spits out a beautiful Warners first National Dialogue with all the uses, and expects, panache. Psychology in this fierce ancient, one of Warners' efforts to claim its place as the "social conscious" studio, does not go deep: Digges are bad just because the script requires him to be, and there is the strange idea that youthful criminals will change swell children if they get a little autonomy. But it is in that savings, fast-paced style that the studio specialized, and it never gets bored. Frankie Darro, who has been in all sorts of problems during a short term as Warners' favorite Rotten Street Kid, is an ideal JD - an attractive, charismatic rope with a pug nose and a hate-filled stare that can wither steel. No child actor today can touch him.
