The Gilmore girls are about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Share everything, trust each other completely. <br /> <br /> I love The Gilmore Girls, but I'm not sure why. The mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter, Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson). He and Lorelai like each other can even love one another, but none of them really works on it. They have their little moments. There are a few other supportive characters, most of them very funny and with their pleasant moments. <br /> <br /> What I think most is to see the relationship between the young mother and the daughter becoming an adult. The dialogue between them is fast, sharp, funny and sometimes even touching. The band they have is beautiful. The Gilmore Girls make you good, so try it.
