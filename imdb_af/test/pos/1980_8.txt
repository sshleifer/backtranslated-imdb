This movie is awesome and sensible. But I think maybe it can only be appreciated by the hard RPG funs. It's like a game. One problem is that the plot is too spotty and has just too many turns. Those twists are excessive. Jude Law gives a very good performance. I really like him in this movie, just like Jerome in Gattaca and Gigglo Joe in A.I.
