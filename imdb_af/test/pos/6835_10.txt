But not too hip. And not to wisecracking. "Judas Kiss" nails the new noir thing right. Great pacing and a nuanced count around a revolving story filled with sex, betrayal and sure to make one linen. Inspiring work around. Kudos in partcular to HalHolbrook (his best work ever), Gil Bellows (Ally Mc-wat?) And Carla Gugino (best family member in the ages ... smart, funny and ultra hot) ... I give it a 9 out of 10) and that's because 10 has to be reserved for, such as Humphrey Bogart and Coen Bros movies.
