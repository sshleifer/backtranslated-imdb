I am surprised that of all the reviews I watched, nobody saw one of the main points of this movie, or at least how I saw it. It seems like a great homosexual fantasy, camp clothes, a renewed naked Ferdinand, a particular sexual tension between Ariel and Prospero, and as a final climax, fit a group of men in a tough sailor to the horn. This whole approach, once you get used to it, offers you all sorts of fantastic scenes and images. The face of an innocent Ariel is drawn to a disgusting naked Sycorax to execute her earthly and horrible orders. It's one of the darkest I've ever had in a Shakespeare movie. However, by the end of the movie I got tired of the style and the last hornpipe dance was just too much to take. Yet this is an interesting interpretation of the play.
