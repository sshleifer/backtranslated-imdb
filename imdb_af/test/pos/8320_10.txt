"Walking with Dinosaurs" is absolutely brilliant in all respects. Kenneth Branagh tells in a way that really makes you want to listen. The documentary document really sounds as if the researchers and writers have done their homework, it is so informative and it makes you addicted and never let go. The music is also brilliant, very dramatic when it needs to be. But the visual effects and scenery are what make this documentary work so good. The scenery is breathtaking, and the dinosaurs seem so, thanks to the simply amazing effects. It is so nice with such a good concept and not only attracts adults but also children. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a must see. Not only do I love it, but it's probably the best documentary I've ever seen. If it was something, it could have done with longer, except that it was perfect. 10/10 Bethany Cox
