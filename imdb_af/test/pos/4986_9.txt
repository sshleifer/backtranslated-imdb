One kind of western that I really enjoy is when the seemingly weak, who is reluctant to fight and answer the challenge of the stronger, eventually decides there is no other way. There is a good moment in this movie when John Parrish (Glenn Ford) goes into the salon and decides to stand up for the gun battle Wade Matlock. This is the type of scene that appeals to the audience. The violent men are, in my opinion, a great western, I will put it among the best. It makes great use of the wide screen, a spectacular landscape of the mountains. The women have an important role. Caroline (May Winn) is involved with Parrish, but you feel that she is just using him as a way to get out and move east. She wants him to sell the farm, whatever the price. Martha (Barbara Stanwick) is tired of helping her maimed husband Lee (Edward G. Robinson), but she will do anything to have an ever bigger farm and more power. Meanwhile, she betrays her husband with his brother (Brian Keith). Her daughter Judith (Diane Foster) sees everything happening, but feels impotent to respond because she doesn't want to hurt her father. Parrish unites all the small farmers and uses the strategy he learned in the army to go against the Anchor farmer. As he warned Lee, "Don't fight me, because you won't like my way of fighting."
