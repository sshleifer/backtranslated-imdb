I loved this movie when I was a kid. I saw this theater. Randy Edelman made a good composition of the soundtrack. David Seville is the Chipmunks father and recording manager. The chipmunks consist of Alvin, who is best known for playing the accordion, Simon. He is a bright and apprentice chipmunk & Theodore, who is the youngest and is always hungry. There is a lady known as Miss. Miller, who cares for the chipmunks and has 3 daughters known as Brittany, Jeanette & Eleanor, all have the same character as the Chipmunks. My favorite songs from this soundtrack include "Diamond Dolls", The Girls of Rock & Roll, and the touch of My Mother. Alvin really wanted to see Europe when Dave had to go there for business. The Chipmunks met the Chipettes who over the world in 30 day video game that led them to race each other to do the right thing.
