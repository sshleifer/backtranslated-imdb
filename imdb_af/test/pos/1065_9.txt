It finally looked me at seeing my VHS of Christmas in Connecticut which other movie this one reminded me. If it wasn't for the fact that the other was done 20 years later, I'd say it was a remake. <br /> <br /> Just as Rock Hudson was a fake fishing expert for Abercrombie & Fitch who had to get a bit on the job training at a fishing tournament, Barbara Stanwyck is playing a forty version of Martha Stewart. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a cooking columnist who built this whole image to live on a small Connecticut farm with a man and baby who cooks everything. these wonderful delicacies. Trouble is she is unmarried, childless, writes her column out of her apartment in New York and doesn't know how to cook water. But her writing is a hit with the public. Trouble comes when she is hijacked to cook a house Christmas dinner for a soldier who has the war hero, played by Dennis Morgan who will also sing some songs. Must keep the image at any cost. And her publisher Sidney Greenstreet loves the idea so well that he invites himself to dinner. <br /> <br /> So with borrowed farm, baby, and Reginald Gardiner who really want to make it with Stanwyck, she's trying to break it through. <br /> <br /> Christmas in Connecticut is now a Yuletide classic and deservingly so. The clues are warm and human and they get good support from the composite players. S.Z. Sakall as the Hungarian restaurant owner / friend of Stanwyck from whom she gets her cooking information, and Una O'Connor as the housekeeper, has a good chemistry between them. Reginald Gardiner and Stanwyck have no chemistry at all. It is clear to everyone except Reggie and he is funny in his stuffed shirt. <br /> <br /> Most people remember this movie as one of Sidney Greenstreet's few comedy companies. If he is not an illegal villain, a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon, Greenstreet is little other thing on the screen. Christmas in Connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to burles his own image and used it most. <br /> <br /> In a biography by Barbara Stanwyck she mentions that she enjoyed making Christmas in Connecticut as a welcome change from some ominous parts such as Double Disclaimer she recently did. One of the things that made the film so enjoyable was that, between director Peter Godfrey and Greenstreet, a few impromptu entertainment of film and crew would do with English Music Hall numbers. Made for a relaxed and warm set and the cast responded accordingly. <br /> <br /> Now if just someone filmed those numbers.
