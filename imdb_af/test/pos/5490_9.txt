I watched the perfect storm and thought of another Wolfgang Peterson movie that is much better - this one. Although certainly not based on a true story, In the line of fire is how to make a movie. It has a fantastic story with a good role. Malkovich won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance as the creepy killer with a grudge against the government he served too well. Eastwood is good as the tortured Secret Service and Russo is easy on the eye. If you didn't see it, definitely buy it or buy it as I did. Definitely one of the best criminals of the past decade. 9/10
