This kind of anxiety can only be within a young person who is seriously seeking his religion and his place in this world. As the text says at the beginning of the movie, these photos are dead: it's already the past and right from the moment the product was ready. But it is only for the manufacturer of these "products": Maybe for someone who is in the same mood (I think many people, at least those who are seriously interested in religion, go through the same terrible fear and doubt in their personal development). And, of course, this is the reason why art is made in the first place: identification and comfort among fellow human beings. <br /> <br /> This movie uses the "classic" techniques of the experimental theater. And that's where these techniques are, in my opinion, in the best possible use: As a tool to tell stories and create atmosphere for them, not just as pure abstractions or as an end to themselves. Those "tricks" have been made enough many times. Some other movies that I think influenced / inspired this director are "Eraserhead" and "Nosferatu". It is interesting how these techniques make this movie totally timeless: there is nothing contemporary in this movie. Or nothing at any other time. It could have been made a thousand years ago. <br /> <br /> It is interesting in this story how these people treat this new born holy child: they use it selfishly for their own purposes and do not even try to listen to him. They beat him, cut off his bowels and threw him. They drag his (living) body from place to place. And they are doing the same kind of violence to his mother. The story also reminds me of the Borges short story "El informe de Brodie". The criticism of Christian practices also reminds me of the great "El Topo". <br /> <br /> Unpleasant watch at times, but beautiful. Very simple, thought and concentrated. Very strong film, almost too strong. The whole human energy is concentrated for this. Also this movie shows that if you have the passion and ideas, you can make a film with a round zero budget. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit it was a bit difficult to look for a "contemporary" viewer like me, due to the experimentality. It was so slow and demanding. But still worth the effort. I have to give ten points just for trying to make this kind of movie.
