Director Mikhail Kalatozov's film The Cranes is Flying (Letyat zhuravli) is a glorious piece of cinema. From Viktor Rozov's screenplay, based on his own play, Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of the war and the suffering of those who left home. Tackling with countless war films that show us the frontlines and the massacre, the subject itself becomes annoying and avoidable. However, this Russian jewel shows how the story of suffering can be told in a different way; by telling us about the soldier's mouth how war is hated by all, that they hope that those who died have done so for a reason that makes peace and end of the fight possible, we see a new vision of the Second World War. We have young men who are willing to make war for peace, to keep their families and loved ones at home safe rather than to fight for a fight they don't believe in. With so much hatred towards our current situation in the Middle East and how people die without reason, against their will, it is nice to see a film showing how merciless and heroic these soldiers are, as well as those returning to them. <br /> <br /> Communist Russia shows how concerned everyone was in the war. While Boris is voluntarily going to the front lines, she is the father of a hospital doctor who helps with the repair of injured soldiers and his sister helps him there, as well as his girlfriend Veronika, and does everything she can to keep her mind. the fact that no letter came from her love. An entire city comes out to send the boys into celebration. Even the factory Boris and his friend Stepan sends representatives with gratitude gifts. Whether it's a glorious appearance in Russia or not, I don't know. There is no protest or malice of these boys who endanger their lives for a country, they are all praise and thanks. Some people in America can learn a lesson from this, because whether you agree with the war that is at hand or not, makes protests and devastation in its name, just as these men and women sacrifice each and every day. <br /> <br /> Acting is right through the passage, but some earn singling. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris's grandmother. She is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his departure is very clear on her face and through her body language. Vasili Merkuryev, like the patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich, brings what may be the best performance. As spoken at the end, fathers need to hide hidden tears, Merkuryev epitomizes those sentiments. He puts a tough outside, especially creaking jokes and runs his son hard when he learns about his volunteer work just hours before he has to leave. But when Boris goes out to go to the meeting station, we see the real pain of the man, sitting in grief at the table. He loves his son very much and although he cannot prove it to him, his actions throughout the film give it to the audience. Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris, a happy young man, and idealist, doing what he believes is right, and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as the shameful Mark, staying at home because of his talented piano skills, or perhaps just to steal his cousin 's love. Love, which Tatyana Samojlova played, really draws the audience into her sadness, deceit, and slender glory of hope. The real star of the film, she has to go through many emotions on a journey where she loses her way and needs to return on course, hoping she has done so soon enough for Boris's return. <br /> <br /> Besides realism for the story, and scared to use tragedy to convey the theme, I also loved the visual style of the movie. Sergei Urusevsky's cinematography is great, especially if the movie is considered in full-screen mode. It's one thing to create beautiful compositions in a widescreen panorama; It is completely different to do it in a square framework. From the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water, a bridge in the background, as our two lovers are hitting their way on the screen and in the distance. There are several instances of camera behind obstacles, but it still makes it possible to see the action, and it creates unique spatial depth and interest at all times. Sharp corners are used, as well as careful blockage to allow for overhead shots and excessive compilation of characters in frame. <br /> <br /> However, the right feats are the cases of the long shot. It is well used to follow Veronika through the masses of returning soldiers. It was earlier in the past, as she said goodbye to their loved ones while looking for Boris, her own farewell should be said. The planning for this shot had to be expanded because, while weighing in and out of people, the camera focuses on couples' kisses, people shouting at each other, and more, all deliberately in the frame at specific moments as the camera moves. Everybody had to beat his point exactly and this led to a brilliant piece of cinema. It's just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style; The Crane is Flying showing how successful placement and mise and scene can be to show the audience what it needs as simple as possible. Composition and professionalism of the actors and crew can do wonders, adding something that can never do big objects and special effects.
