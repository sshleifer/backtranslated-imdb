Guess, a few exclusive film directors sat down to enjoy their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice an evening in the 80s during the Cannes or other film festival and one said, "Hey, guys, we make a movie where everybody A segment of ours creates a world-class aria. "Well, it's kind of worked. It was clear that someone was smart enough to choose some of the best recordings of the chosen arias, such as Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma. If you were blind and lying on the floor, just listening to the DVD, you have more than your money's worth. Not every director has succeeded, but done more than not and the movie seems to improve with every view over the years. My favorite is the eerily beautiful love duet of Die Todt Statd; All right, a young naked Elizabeth Hurley is eyecatcher, but her husband singing for her, his wife's ghost, is incredibly beautiful with love music second only to Otello and Desdemona's "Gia nella Notte Densa" in all the operational repertoire. Can the movie be better, sure, what could not have been, but it is worth having a view, especially if you are in a hyper-romantic mood.
