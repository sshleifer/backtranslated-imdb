I can't stand people who comment on this program or other HBO programs as "too graphic" or "unnecessarily graphical", or that they are "unnecessary nudity / violence / sodomy etc." Contains. <br /> <br /> Guess what? Prison life is not PG-13. The "free" graphic content is WHERE LIFE of this situation. Prison contains rape / murder / drug trafficking and showers. If you don't like it, don't look at the program. I'm definitely not a fan of jail, but if it is left out of the show I will be surprised and less credible. If the prisoners were not cursing, it would just be stupid. Certainly it's free language, but it's REALISTS. <br /> <br /> The show is good, some of the viewers .... not so much, I think.
