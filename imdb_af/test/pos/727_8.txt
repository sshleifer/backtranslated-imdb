A raw edgy thriller aimed at great philosophical heights that didn't really reach it. I still enjoyed the movie a lot. It had great stresses, which left me with the beautiful chicks I expected from stress conditions, and it achieved it purely psychologically, without increasing blood and flowering. The soundtrack and the setting contributed perfectly. Sometimes it was a bit unpolished, especially the acting, and character development. It may have been a better movie if we knew more about past nightmares that the characters see when they close their eyes, and why they have the desperate need for the "answer" so integral to the storyline. to search. After all, they seem to continue to seek it, despite knowing or at least having an inkling of what can happen when they found it. I would recommend seeing this movie if you are willing to look outside the grit to see the potential of a diamond in the rough.
