It has become one of my favorite movies and definitely one of the best westerns I've ever seen. To have a gentle place for the genre (westerns are or was, since they are no longer very often made? Morality games that were too often denied by critics with intellectual predictions) I bought the DVD, invisible face, because I've read enough about William S. Hart's work (of which he wrote and directed much) to ease my interest and thought I should have at least one of his films in my video collection. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have approached the actual viewing with some tension. My previous experiences with silent cinema "classic" made me feel. Chaney's The Phantom of the Opera, Griffith's Birth of a Nation and Fairbanks' The Mark of Zorro was good, but not as good as their reputation would lead. They were too long, theater or both. <br /> <br /> However, the Tolhek was a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> This is a story told in a simple and simple way. Black Deering (played by Hart), leader of a notoriously successful illegal gang, thinks the time has come for the group to dissolve before it comes out of luck. However, he is opposed by his chief lieutenant, Jordan. He throws them all in one last punch through the promise of great wealth, but leads them to a fall into which he is accomplice. Everyone is killed except Deering, who is being imprisoned. When his prisoners recognize him as the man who once saved a number of soldiers and settlers by warning an outpost of an impending Indian attack, they allow him to escape. Free, he tries to find honest work, but is pruned and mocked and must eventually be robbed to survive. Soon he will not only be pursued by the sheriff's posts, but also by Jordan (who now benefits from the reward he has raised) and his henchmen. His flight leads him to a remote cabin inhabited by a single mom and her little son. After a few initial doubts, they take him into their hearts. Deering sees a chance for a new life, but with the posts and Jordan joining, realize this may not be possible. <br /> <br /> Heart was the first major Western star and the first to inject realism into the genre. As one of the pioneers of film making, he has created many of the characters and situations that have become cliché in Western for over ninety years. What makes his movies interesting, however, is his ability to go beyond the cliché (perhaps his mimics haven't gone far enough), so the material looks fresh and innovative, even now. Three such cases in the toll gate illustrate this: <br /> <br /> 1) In one scene, his character shoots in a crowd in an attempt to kill Jordan and instead kill a bystander. A subsequent close-up shows that he is clearly frustrated. However, the frustration does not come from the fact that he shot a man who has so far done no harm to him, but missed his intended target. <br /> <br /> 2) In another, as he flies from the mail, his "borrowed" horse walks into a jig hole and breaks a leg. Heart pulls out his gun to make the animal out of his misery, but before he pulls the trigger, his head gives a sad, loving pat, than to say goodbye to an old friend. <br /> <br /> 3) And finally, after curling Jordan and throwing his body over a cliff, he returns to find his guns and his opponent's pistol is lying on the ground near the ground. He walks forward and gives it a quick kick before his horse is tied. It is a simple gesture, but it emphasizes the deep dislike of the man who betrayed him and his comrades. <br /> <br /> And I love the title, The Tolhek. It is allegory in its implication that a man cannot start a new life until he has paid the sins of his parent. Deering's payment comes in the form of sacrifice. Today's more sophisticated audiences may not buy that sentiment completely, but it can still work on you if you allow it. <br /> <br /> Viewers who keep their videos in pristine condition will undoubtedly object to the picture quality of the DVD, especially the badly-worsened final line. I do not care. The fact that a copy of this 1920's movie even exists is a miracle, as prints of so many other silent movies have been lost. Keeping this in mind and watching the movie as a piece of history, its visual defects are not that difficult to accept. <br /> <br /> William S. Hart was born in New York in 1870, but grew up in Minnesota and Wisconsin, where he learned to speak Sioux and Indian Sign Language. He counted among his friends Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson and collected Remington paintings, so his knowledge of the West was first-hand. However, if his vision is too romantic according to today's standards, it is broaderly rooted in reality than the Spaghetti westerns of the 60s and 70s and the revisionist works that followed. Both the star and his films are in arrears for reassessment.
