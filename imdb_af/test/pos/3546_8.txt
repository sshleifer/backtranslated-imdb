Definitely worth watching. <br /> <br /> Ten different directors each offer a segment based on their favorite opera aria. You don't have to be an opera lover to watch this movie. (Though, of course, if you hate opera, you're really going to have a bad time!) <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the segments are brilliant to fair. Most of the fuss seems to be Godard's contribution - whether you think he's brilliant or pretentious, his segment won't change your mind. <br /> <br /> Some of the pieces have a clear story; others are more a fitting of related images. <br /> <br /> None of the pieces are more than 10 minutes or so; If you're not happy with what's on the screen, wait for the next segment and think about how much culture you're looking for. Keep your eyes open for performances by Buck Henry, Beverly Angelo, Elizabeth Hurley, Briget Fonda, Tilda Swinton, and John Hurt. (The Buck Henry segment alone is the admission price). <br /> <br />
