"East Side Story" is a documentary version of musical comedy in Stalinist Russia and later in the Eastern European satellite comedies, with many cuts from the films and commentaries of the survivors. Although some of the Stalinist films look bad (The Bright Road (?) Is a significant exception), the films from the sixties look good. "My wife wants to sing," "The White Mouse," and "Midnight Revue" look particularly entertaining. The producers had to fight with the censorship, which had the power to decide what was politically correct. This led to confusion, humorous in retrospect, as the people who tried to saturate the sensors were the people who supported the movies. start with! Since musical comedies were fairly scarce behind the Iron Curtain, there were only forty years in forty years. They had an excessive impact on their audiences, which made great hits from some of the films. <br /> <br /> I see that the sound for the sixties was much better. The directors often had to do with outdated equipment and strict power regulations - they had to take seven minutes and dangerous officers. <br /> <br /> I also see that the West Side Story has had a strong impact on the "Warm Summer". The later movies can't measure "Singin" in the rain, "but they certainly think they've hit hell out of" Bye Bye Birdy ".
