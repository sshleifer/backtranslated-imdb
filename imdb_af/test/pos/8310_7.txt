The main criticism of AT THE AARTH'S CORE is that it is cheap, the special effects are bad and so on and so on. Yes, some of the special effects are painfully bad, but what many people get over it is that it's really nice, which is very important in my book. <br /> <br /> In comparison, just look at the latest STAR WARS movies: they have the latest, greatest special effects created by the latest technological advances that are able to make amazing visual effects as far-reaching as what Imagine the human imagination and yet, with all the razzle blinded, the films were as exciting as a funeral. As Yoda would say, Fun isn't! In other words, who cares whether the FX is not the greatest if the spirit of the movie is quick, humorous and clear on the side of action. I love everything about the Earth's core: the contrast between stomping Victorian England USA the wild worldly, colorful setting of Pellucidar, the role-playing of characters, the concept of a lost underground world, the telepathic Pterodactyls, the human slaves who rebel , Jubal The ugly one (lol!), The inspired teamwork of Peter Cushing (who's fantastic!) And Doug McClure, the excellent music (it's really good), movie art by the amazing Alan Hume and last but not least, Caroline Munro. She is sexy in this movie. One of the most sexy B-movies ever captured on the screen. <br /> <br /> Seriously, anyone who doesn't like this movie doesn't know what's fun. Gimme AT THE EARTH'S CORE about any turgid STAR WARS prequels anytime! At least it has Caroline Munro, who can never recreate any CGI fx.
