I loved this movie, I saw it when I was about 8 years old and almost seven years later, I saw it again tonight. I really thought it had an interesting idea, they were just the thing that upset me, the end I felt was a policeman. "Around here it's hard to find this movie and I was happy to see it on BRAVO. I also expected to see more Drew Barrymore here!
