Charlie Wilson (twice Oscar winner: Tom Hanks) is an easy congressman ... Who loves party, enjoys the woman and especially drinks his drink. When Charlie's old friend and former friend, Joanne Herring (Oscar winner: Julia Roberts), wants to visit Charlie, Afghanistan, which definitely needs help. Charlie is shocked at what he has seen, especially of all ages murdered or hurt by this war with the Russians. He decides to help the people and the rebels fight the Russians, who started the war. Charlie, Joanne and an apostate CIA Agent under the name of Gust Avrakotos (Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman) will start a good fight to bring the greatest secret operation in history. <br /> <br /> Targeted by Oscar-Winner: Mike Nichols (The Birdcage, Henry, Wolf) has made a live, entertainingly sharp satire war comedy based on a true story. Hanks, Roberts, Hoffman in an Oscar nominated show and Amy Adams as Charlie's loyal assistant are very good at their roles. In spite of the excellent life-abilities, "Charlie Wilson's War", never get a fire and it is not as badly funny as you liked it. Director Nichols and Author: Aaron Sorkin (Moving) keeps things right and the characters are well kept. <br /> <br /> DVD has a sharp Pan & Scan (1.33: 1) transfer and good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The only special features of DVD are the background featurette with the cast & crew and a real-life featurette with Charlie Wilson and others. "Charlie Wilson's War" is a good movie that could have been very good, but it is not. But this movie is clever enough to please adult comedies for those who have written or performed well. (*** 1/2 from *****).
