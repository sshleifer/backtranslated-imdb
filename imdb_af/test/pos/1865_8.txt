I watched this movie at the 19SEP2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival. <br /> <br /> The Beagle is just flashing in just a few moments. The whole thing is about Darwin's life from 1841 to 1859, when he was explored in Kent with his growing family, 200+ pages of Origin were already set up. and he wondered if he had to finish the book. <br /> <br /> The script is based on Randal Keynes's book Annie's Box (Annie, Charles's daughter, died when she was 10). It is mostly a family drama, but also includes sex scenes. But the participants are married, both on and off screen. Not too exciting, not much science, but a well-made movie that is pleasant to watch the right emotional buttons. A little bit of a romantic whip, actually. I think the conclusion is that you can be an agnostic free-thinking scientist of an atheistic family background and still an emotional romantic as well as an excellent father. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters and Darwin put themselves or wonder if he killed God, but the viewer might doubt it. It is undoubtedly given the deadly struggle for survival and the web of predation on the pasture bank (known before Darwin and completely unreliable) and the failure of Darwin's prayers is that the idea of ​​a kind, providing God with "his" beings is unsustainable. <br /> <br /> I really can't object to many Americans. Some may have problems with the title, which is probably the most controversial aspect of the movie, or with the fact that Bettany doesn't have horns, a tail and a lift.
