To see this movie always reminds me of what I remember that summer is like God! so long ago. The whole night-time scene, from the canoe march to the end of the trip, is precious, and Tripper's story of the murderous mania is urban legend, right out of my youth. A highly entertaining film, often made better by the terrible persecutions that followed.
