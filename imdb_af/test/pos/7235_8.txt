This rubbish version of Romeo and Juliet goes into Manhattan in the present days. Romeo (Will Keenan) is a ** hole and violent relative Que, and Juliet (Jane Jensen) is a sexy (with beautiful legs and breasts) and bisexual Capulet family girl. The skatological situations facing this romantic couple are very funny. Although it is a cult film (including exhibits in the Rio de Janeiro Festival), it is not recommended for all audiences. If the viewer is of Peter Jackson's former movies ("Braindead", "Bad Taste"), "Toxic Avenger", "Body Melt" and another garbage film, he will definitely love this movie. Otherwise, he will hate it. Since I belong to the first group, my voice is eight. <br /> <br />
