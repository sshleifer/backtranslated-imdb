I saw this series at the PBS in college in 1980 and I have never been able to get it out of my head, although I have never seen it before. I remember every cast member (the casting WAS perfect, as mentioned in other comments), the design, the lighting and of course the story that in itself is enough to stick you to the set. Probably the best TV show I've ever seen along the original "Roots".
