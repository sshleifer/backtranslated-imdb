It's definitely not the best movie ever. But it is definitely worth seeing for people with special kind of thoughts. So the one who loves sadness and depression, and scary fairy tales at night, and wolves and real madness - welcome! If you find a copy of course :) As for me, I can only stand it once ... But since then the Wolves, and Saint-Lucy, and children's drawings, and a headless Christ in my nightmares .
