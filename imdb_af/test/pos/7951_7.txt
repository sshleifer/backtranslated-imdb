I watched this movie with high expectations but was somewhat disappointed. Although I like this movie and have spotted the story, I didn't find it and think the end is falling flat. <br /> <br /> The story is the friendship between a man who manages a photo book and his best client who is a traffic policeman. The location is a beautiful Korean town. <br /> <br /> This film is realistic in some ways as there is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic. However, I was not finally moved by a film depicting a man so loved by a woman, but not even giving her the choice to enter his life. In my mind he is a lovely, noble loser. <br /> <br /> Good points - Excellent acting by the two main leaders, enjoyable snapshot of village life. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages - flat end <br /> <br /> Overall - Good, but I prefer the movies before sunrise and after sunset (or is it before sunset and after sunrise)
