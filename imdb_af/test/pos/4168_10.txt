The title of my summary covers my review very well. <br /> <br /> For me, Teen Mutant Ninja Turtles was someone 5 years older. While I missed that little pop culture wave, I had the toy line and so on. series that Mighty Max was with both arms. <br /> <br /> You want to know how it was in me? I went as Mighty Max for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Thanks for the internet. Thanks to Demonoid, last week I was able to give up this great performance of my childhood for the first time in more than a decade. <br /> <br /> I now look at it, just blamed it by Rob. Paulson from Animaniacs, and I also love the celebrity humor in "Tar Wars". 4 minutes, and they already mentioned. By NAME: Clint Eastwood, Governor Arnold, Dustin Hoffman, John Wayne and Ace Ventura. Hells yes. <br /> <br /> Damn, that's just when you write it, that I realize there is NO WAY IN HELL. I can give this series nothing less than a perfect score. Any imperfections were lost in the mist of the time. <br /> <br /> It's my childhood. This is Awesomeness. This is the Almighty.
