Spoiler Alert I worked as an extra on this Lifetime TV movie (filmed in Seattle). It is very interesting if you participate in the production of a movie, as they are usually still writing parts (as was the case here) or making cuts and big changes to the final parts. <Br /> <br /> My husband and I both worked as extras in this movie, and I remember discussing on the set how it still needs to be determined whether the girl eventually dies. Frankly, I never thought Margaret Colin's character had really enough punishment for her crime of hitting and running, lying to the police, covering up, etc. Can you imagine how the end would have to change if she had finished killing and running victim instead of finally coming out of her coma, okay? Just something to think about. <br /> <br /> By the way, I play a police detective that you can see for a split second and my husband still plays a detective you can see regularly (we counted four times). Margaret Colin was wonderful to work with and much on earth, although Lisa Vidal (now a lifetime) was abolished. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was about a 7/10, but as another poster commented, is still a real tear and makes a good Saturday afternoon cable spot.
