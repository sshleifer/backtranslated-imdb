I now have a vacation in Hong Kong, and I just saw genius police at the theater .... what can I say ... it was so cool !! <br /> <br /> Everything you could wish for was in it! Basically ... just see if you can ... I'll get my friend to send me the vcd when it comes out. <br /> <br /> Only bad thing was the dodgy American style of speaking employed by some of the hl actors ... like Edison ... "What is my husband?!" but it added even more humor ... i see it ... especially if you are like any of the following genres: HQ movie, action, comedy, sci fi! SEEITMAN !! Edison also made a good song for it ... so download it ... Edison Tse - Heroes
