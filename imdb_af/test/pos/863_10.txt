When I first saw Stella on comedy centrally, I thought "God, it's awful!" But I love Nat Hot American Summer. So I knew something didn't make sense. There was nothing left for me to do, but looking for the Stella shorts I've heard, contains more dildos than any other comedy group out there. When I didn't find it, I met dildo expectations, but I probably found the biggest comedy screens I've seen in years. The set of twenty funny short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs. Not only did I laugh at my ass for the first time I watched it, but I was still more difficult to laugh when I looked them over and over. It's really a shame. Comedy Central had the limitations of cable television for the Stella series. It would have been much better focused on HBO or Showtime. Their sense of humor cannot be limited by censorship or popular culture. Given even if it was on HBO, I'm sure the "masses" would have chosen it in a season or less, but it would still be fantastic. Needless to say I'm in love with Stella and even though it is individual members. Any Stella fan should watch David's website with all his short films. They are just as enjoyable as Stella herself. So my hat goes down to Michael Showalter, Michael Ian Black, and David Wain for the incredible comedy they made with Stella. I hope to see much more of the troop in the future.
