It's an excellent movie. No, it's not Mel Gibson in "Braveheart", but then it doesn't try to be. In fact, the "Emperor and the Murderer" probably (mean) more in common with a Shakespeare production than a Hollywood blocker. <br /> <br /> In the third century BC, the king of Qin tries to unite (in other words, "conquer") the seven kingdoms of China. He has already overthrown the kingdom of Han. Now he needs an excuse to conquer the kingdom of Yan. <br /> <br /> That's where Lady Zhao enters. She and the King have been friends since childhood. Of course, they are very in love, but cannot marry for political reasons. Together they design a plot. She would pretend to have fallen with the King in awe and escaped to Yan. Once there she will convince the Prince of Yan to send a murderer back to kill the King. When the murder fails, the king will have his excuse to conquer Yan. <br /> <br /> Once in Yan, Lady Zhao began to reconsider. To hear and see more and more examples of her old friend's reluctance, she wondered if the King should actually be murdered. <br /> <br /> One sure sign you're not watching a Hollywood production is the final meeting between the king and the killer. Unlike a Hollywood movie where the hero and villain are clearly defined and the final outcome has already been determined beforehand, this is a real battle. <br /> <br /> It's a well-made and well-intentioned story of a turbulent time in Chinese history. There is a mixture of both incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. The most beautiful of all, however, is Gong Li as the Lady Zhao. I am increasingly convinced every time I see her that Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world. <br /> <br /> However, I have to say that she has one unintentional funny line in this movie. Early on Gong Li asked one of her servants: "Do I have a beautiful face?" <br /> <br /> Duh !!!
