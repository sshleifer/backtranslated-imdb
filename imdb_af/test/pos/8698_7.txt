A few years ago, when I rented a few movies, I got Subspecies 4, finally watched and actually liked it. We need a good vampire gore flick that doesn't hold back. But when I returned to the video store, they said they didn't have any other Subspecies videos. Unfortunately, it went the same for any other video store I was looking for. I gave up until someone on YouTube actually uploaded all the subspecies and I watched them last night and I'm addicted. I am now a fan of the Full Moon Subspecies series. I think, because it was the kind of horror movie I was looking for. I've been looking for a good cheesy fright and subspecies filled that place. Radu is one of the coolest vampires on the screen and almost gives Nosferatu a run for his patches! <br /> <br /> Radu is an evil vampire who is after his bloodstone, his birthright, the stone contains blood that is absolutely incredible and gives him strength. Three American girls studying Romanian history and culture bump into a man, Stephan, who helps to help. They stay at Radu's castle where we find out that Stephan is Radu's brother; Radu seduces and turns two of the girls, but Stephan falls for one of the girls, Michelle, and will do anything to protect her. <br /> <br /> Subspecies are a fun series, despite the cheesy effects, making it more pleasant in some ways. Plus Radu was a perfect villain, as Stephan was the perfect angel like a romantic vampire. The story is chilled and I think it was a fun vampire movie. It was also the first in the series, the best part is, the successors are just as fun. I would recommend it for a scary movie month, watch it in the dark, Radu is sure to send your spine, or even your neck, ... OK, cheesy joke, can't resist. <br /> <br /> 7/10
