A humorous trip to the normally gloomy funeral. It's easy to watch, and even offers Blethyn & Molina a scene from an old Fred & Ginger movie. Walken is on top as a keen rival of Molina in the business, and is trying to bring a new style to an old Welsh town. We see some very funny examples of the "new style". The plot thickens with Pugh who has a relationship with Watts and suggests that they enter Blethyn. Meanwhile, Molina repeated his long-suffering romantic feel for Blethyn and convinced her to expire her death so that they could run away to the Southern Sea and dance their days together. During the "false" funeral, Blethyn learns from her men's infidelities and denies her revenge. Look for a view of what funerals are likely to be - a celebration of life!
