As a young teenager when it came out, I was totally related to it. As an adult in the current sex-obsessed American culture, it doesn't have enough nudity to be called tame. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for American Pie type of cruelty, vulgarity or ghost and feces, Meatballs will be disappointing with penalties in the meantime and a guarantee. <br /> <br /> If you like Bill Murray and you like good clean fun, you'll probably enjoy this movie very much. Similarly to Stripes, Ghostbusters, Caddy Shack, etc. <br /> <br /> Enough said, just look and stop it intellectually. It's meatballs, to cry out loud! Why read a review? Just enjoy it and enjoy it. And ignore the trash talks by others. Movies, like so many other things in life, are subjective. To each one his own. <br /> <br /> Be careful with the "expert" who reduces the taste of others.
