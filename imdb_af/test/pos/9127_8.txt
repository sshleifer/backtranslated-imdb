LE CERCLE ROUGE is a very good movie, but it does suffer a bit, as there are similar films already. In many ways, the film is reminiscent of previous films such as RIFIFI and GRAND SLAM and many others. So while director Melville and the actors played good work, it looks like a case of Dej√† vu. As a result, I had a hard time giving this excellent movie a higher score. <br /> <br /> The one unusual aspect of the movie is how the crooks come together. Instead of the usual way, Vogel escapes from prison and only happens with Corey, a career crimes newly released from prison! Both are a good game, but because they both work in parallel for much of the movie until they meet, it was a smart touch. In addition, as expected, much of the film pertains to the meticulous details in the planning and execution of the crime. I also appreciated how the film made the crooks so cold and detached - something relatively common in French crime films, but scarce among American films until recent years. <br /> <br /> Overall, extremely well-crafted and worth seeing ... if you don't mind looking a bit repetitive, you'll see some fine acting, direction and excitement.
