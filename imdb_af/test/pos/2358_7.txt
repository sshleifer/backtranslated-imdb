This neo-film noir is one of a genre of American American films of the late twentieth century that all carry corrupt characters, fast cars, a highway ribbon and of course many guns worn by people who never have a gun does not have a safety course. The actors are the best reason to see "Black Day, Blue Night". There is the late, big J.T. Walsh ("Swing Blade", "Pleasantville", "Red Rock West", "The Last Seduction", and many more), which did many neo films noirs (see also "Breakdown"). Then there is Michele Forbes of the TV series "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "Homicide." (In a supporting role, even the late Bejamin Lum has also appeared on a Star Trek episode entitled "The Naked Now.") A heater of sorts. N Guideline: Only the innocent survive, but innocence is a very relative term in a movie like this, and you probably won't guess what is innocent before the final rule.
