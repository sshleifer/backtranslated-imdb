I wouldn't compare it to Le Placard, which had IMHO more comical moments, but while you were a slow starter, Romuald & Juliette definitely kept your attention through the film, played nicely and reached a heart-warming conclusion. There were many wonderful comic moments, a brilliant pathos and a realistic situation that all actors performed. <br /> <br /> It was a typical French film, confronting prejudices and phobias, which faced its own shortcomings! I'm probably happy to have it in my library, and I will undoubtedly see it again, which is a sign of a good movie for me.
