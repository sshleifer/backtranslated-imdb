I loved the movie. I loved Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whaley. The film had many different places in it. I really liked when Ann Hampton realized she couldn't love Rhett. And when Scarlett and Ann come along and Ann apologizes for taking Rhett and Scarlett just told her not to worry, she'll get him back. It had a good story. You can't just compare it to GWTW. It has so many scenes. I love both SCARLETT and GWTW! Of course, don't forget to have a handy hand.
