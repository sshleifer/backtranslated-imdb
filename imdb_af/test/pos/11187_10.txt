A group of evil businessmen have to build a building to build a large complex, but they can't remove the tenants. The tenants and businessmen with their hired thugs clash until the movie ends with one of the funniest battles ever! The man with the ginger hair that eeeeehhhh throws each time and the other man who sits with a knife in his mouth, instead of fighting, just to be beaten from the camera, makes this essential viewing if you like laugh. movies rather than with them.
