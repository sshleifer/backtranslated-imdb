I went to the preview of "Rory O'Shea Was Lord." I like this movie better than I expected, because the excellent works and the powerful performance. This is a film about the friendship of two disabled young men. Rory is a free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless of his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers, but he can speak eloquently and help his new friend, Michael, have cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I think it's enough to start with a crying drama. Well, this is. But with inspiring messages and deep moving performances. It looked me at things that I take for granted. What will I do if I can just move my two fingers? I need to be thankful for what I have and what I can do. It's a good movie, though it could have been better.
