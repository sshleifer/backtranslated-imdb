This film is about the aging of Geisha in post-war Tokyo. Okin, who is played by the incredible Haruko Sugimara, lends money to two other ex-Geisha, Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Otomi (Yuko Mochizuki), and they deny the way she was slightly annoyed. Tamae has a son, Otomi, a daughter, announcing during the film that they are leaving them while Okin, never a mother, visits two men in her past. It seems they just want money from her. This is a compelling story of what choices you make, what you do to come through life and who you have accounted for and considered. Haruko Sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character races ever of any country and she plays the mostly relentless, less compassionate Okin with an air of superiority that doesn't make you feel like her, but at the same time envies her. At a time when big films were made by Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinoshita and Kurosawa, Naruse among other things with him. If you have a regional free DVD player, try to find the two Naruse box sets in England. I think this movie was a great character study of women at risk of being irrelevant. That they really don't make this movie a true masterpiece.
