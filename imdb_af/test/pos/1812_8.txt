Generally, romance films were never my cup of tea. But Valley Girl is one of the few romance movies that I can't just penetrate, but actually enjoy. Nicholas Cage is wonderful in his first role, and Deborah Foreman is superfluous. There are a few side stories that tend to be, but not enough to reduce this movie.
