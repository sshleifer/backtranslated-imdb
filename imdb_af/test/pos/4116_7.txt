I thought it was the movie, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth having good chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays a woman who has fallen over the head and falls in love with Richard Greico's character. They end up getting married and everything looks perfect, except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, but she has a hard time getting pregnant. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy, and go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the movie was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing. It shows how naive one can be when they fall in love. Yasmine Bleeth is a good actress in this, and I wonder why she never made it further in her career. Richard Greico is very impressive as the deceptive man, and plays the evil part very well. I wonder why some actors do it and some don't. All in all, a good movie I would recommend.
