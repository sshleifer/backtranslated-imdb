When I saw the poster of this movie for the first time, I abolished it as another low-budget youth. After a few days, when it was finally made for the theaters, one of my friends told me it was a good one. <br /> <br /> A year later, the first time I saw the ad, Anand was being broadcast on television and the moment I finally came while I was swinging channels and I stopped for a moment to look and that's that I finally watched the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And now, 3 years later, I would have watched the movie at least 7-8 times and I didn't watch movies again! <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it tries to be different if all Telugu movies consist of 6. songs and 4 battles. <br /> <br /> It's a simple movie, a bit slow, but a very gripping script, there are no loose ends in the movie, many well-groomed dialogues, which are really hard to find. <br /> <br /> Music is both classic and calming, great versions by Radha Krishnan, some great kirtanas also come in the bgmusic, through the film. <br /> <br /> Cinematography deserves a mention. Editing is not smooth, but adequate for a romantic one like this. <br /> <br /> But what really blows you out in this movie is two things: 1. The way every scene is treated with the utmost respect, the well-known Shekar Kammula. <br /> <br /> 2. The beautiful lyrics of Veturi. <br /> <br /> And another thing deserves a special mention, Kamalini, part of her success attributed to Sunitha, for letting her such a beautiful voice, really for you, wonders my voice . <br /> <br /> The other actors are equally good, Raja in the title character and the girl, and the way she screams when she gets a new dog. <br /> <br /> Eventually, I can tell you this movie is coming soon to be another classic with those old classic romantic kids, along with Kammula's other classic-romantic piece, Godavari.
