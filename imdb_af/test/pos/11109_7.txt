I always wanted to see this movie and the first three-fourths proved that I had not waited in vain. But what happened to hell eventually? I mean, don't get me wrong, I like the movie. It definitely made me nostalgic of the realistic, unique NYC of the 80's that we lost to Giuliani. But it's still missing half an hour!
