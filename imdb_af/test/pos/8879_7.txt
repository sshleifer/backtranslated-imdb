Now, throwing Momma off the train wasn't a big comedy, but it's a nice fun and lets you laugh. The title may seem a bit strange, but the whole movie is not literally about it, though it is about something so sinister. <br /> <br /> Danny De Vito basically wants to kill his excessive mom and fast forward a bit, some random and funny events take place. The point of departure is pretty funny, and the stuff Billy Crystal and Danny De Vito enter was wonderful. Some of the screens don't seem to fit me, but it didn't make it a bad movie. <br /> <br /> For what it is, a crazy comedy, it pulls it off well and needs to be seen once. just to say you saw it.
