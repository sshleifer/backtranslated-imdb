William Shakespeare's Venice dealer deals with a Jewish lender and his bond to withdraw a pound of meat from the rich dealer Antonio, the forfeiture of a debt. The Jewish lender is, of course, Shylock and he has given such a high performance by Al Pacino that even outstanding actors such as Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynne Collins deteriorate in the background. The film is in Venice in 16th century and director Michael Radford relies on institution, mood and realism to tell his story. He shows cute costumes or a modern environment with rock music to appeal to a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Radford cuts the game's three hours to a manageable two hours and eight minutes and also offers some historical backdrop. In the revelation story, he tells us how Jews came in England, were subject to increasing persecution and eventually expelled from England. They were banned from owning property, merely making a profit by lending money out of interest and being forced to live in a Venetian "tow", a precursor to darker events. In the film, the dealer Antonio (Jeremy Irons) publicly falls on Shylock, but does not feel sorry for going to the traveler to borrow 3000 ducats to help his friend and suggest that the lover Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) to Portia (Lynne Collins), a wealthy heir. Although Shylock is insulted by Antonio, he agrees to spend the money without interest for three months on condition that forfeiture of the bond entitles him to calculate a pound of meat from Antonio's heart. <br /> <br /> playing is mainly a drama of hate and revenge, but like many of Shakespeare's works, there are also broad comedies. Here, the comedy involves three pairs of lovers: Bassanio and Portia, Gratiano, Bassanio's friend, and Nerissa, and Lorenzo, another friend of Bassanio, and Jessica, Shylock's daughter. Portia presented herself to the person who could choose the right treasure from one of three boxes made of gold, silver and lead. The Prince of Morocco chooses one of gold, the Prince of Aragon, one of silver and both are disappointed. However, Bassanio loves herself and opens the shed to find the portrait. Radford's adaptation carries a remarkable sense of time and place. Portia's residence in Belmont presents one of the beautiful summer houses, with impeccable gardens and art treasures hanging in each room and contrasting well with the grungy look of Shylock's town with its loggers. <br /> <br /> When it becomes clear that Antonio can't repay the debt, Bassanio returns to Venice, leaving Portia behind. When he arrives, the loan is in default and Shylock claims his pound of meat. Even when Bassanio, backed by Portia's wealth, often offers the amount in repayment, Shylock plans to take revenge not only for the loss of money but for a lifetime of outsider status. The Duke, who sits in judgment, will not intervene, as Portia enters into the defense as an attorney to defend Antonio. It is here that the film reaches its dramatic height, as all parties come to court to make a final decision. <br /> <br /> The Venice dealer is not just about an unpaid debt, but also about the alienation of Jews of Christian society and their desire to belong. It was one of Shakespeare's most controversial plays and analysts have long debated whether it is an anti-Semitic game or simply a play on anti-Semitism reflecting the prominent view of Christian society in Elizabethan England. Although Shylock is definitely a caricature, he is an ambiguous figure and there are many indications that Shakespeare regards his failures as human failures, not Jewish. The Duke acknowledges that he is simply a man who has failed to obey the Torah's compassionate language. <br /> <br /> In the monologue, "I'm a Jew. Don't you have Jewish eyes, bump us, don't bleed? If you tickle us, we don't laugh? If you poison us If we go wrong, we will not take revenge? "Shylock shows a universal humanity that expresses the equality of all people. Although we are afraid of the sentence he wants to execute, we can build up his pain over the years. Pacino's performance brings new strength to the text and his often over-the-top persona is replaced by a softer, more underestimated behavior that results in his mind. In an interview at Toronto International Film Festival last September, Radford said about Pacino, "If you work with a brilliant actor, you have a good machine. It's a bit like driving a powerful car. dare to do so. " He ventured and we're all the beneficiaries.
