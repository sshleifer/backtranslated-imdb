I saw Dark Harbor at the '98 Seattle Film Festival. Filmed against an autumn Maine wallpaper, this movie boasts an excellent cast and a plot that keeps you guessing throughout. Sometimes funny, sometimes funny, I have to say that it stayed with me for days after I saw it. Rickman and Walker are wonderful like the icy marriages and Reedus is someone you will hear more, I'm sure. The opening shot of a winding, deserted road in a flood at dusk (and the score it accompanied) set the tone as well - just great. Beautiful, beautiful work by a new director / screenwriter and his talented crew.
