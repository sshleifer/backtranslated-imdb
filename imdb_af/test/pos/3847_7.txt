Walt Disney's 20th animation feature was the last one relieved by the great man himself (he died in late 1966) and is generally not considered one of their best performances. The biggest problem is that the film on the surface just looks like the cats version of LADY AND THE TRAMP (1955) or 101 DALMATIONS (1961). Both are definitely more loved by fans. Even though it is an animation and cat lover, I dug this reasonable bouncy concoction in which a crippled female cat (pronounced by Eva Gabor) and her three little kittens in the streets of Paris by a rich lady (Hermione Baddeley )'s greedy butler is thrown out. Luckily, they meet a street cat (Phil Harris) who guides them back on the journey and is further assisted by a cat-band (led by Scatman Crothers) and two helpful and almost dopey dogs. Meanwhile, at home, Edgar the butler celebrates his alleged heritage and the mouse and the horse do their bit to help their fellow cat dogs. The legendary entertainer Maurice Chevalier was hit by retirement to sing the title song (which includes a verse in French) and Scatman's band has a lazy number "Ev'rybody Want To Be A Cat".
