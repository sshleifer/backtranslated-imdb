Exceptional film that handles a large-sized theme with a very balanced direction. Dmytrik was a very good director, at least of what I can tell about this movie and Murder my Sweet, but he was seriously affected by the HUAC as other movie directors and actors. It is ironic that Crossfire has not received an Oscars, as it is a beautiful example of how to make a good low-budget film. Everything about this movie is exceptional: a well-written manuscript that uses extensive flashbacks, a good role, excellent lighting that properly tells the story more than the actions. What more can you expect from a top-notch movie? May I add that noir is used here for its attractiveness, and I may add financial benefits. But it proves once again that what was originally considered a B-movie today can have more influence on most of the heavy-handed A movies that have lost their hearing over time. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a noir movie per se and it raises serious questions about what noir is. The style is definitely noir, in terms of sets and especially light, but the theme surpasses the recipe of the "noir genre". You can see things from the opposite perspective and claim that Anti-Semitism is just an excuse for the criminal investigation, the puzzle around the murder is the real focus. This would have been the case if Robert Ryan was not in an excellent performance. Anyway, the movie has a lot to offer and it is really a pity that the director had to suffer so much injustice for his earlier beliefs in a real "noir" era of America
