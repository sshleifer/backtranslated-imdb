Being in the suburbs of New York when the Z-Boys created history in Dogtown, I was simply exposed to a look at what's going on. I had a P-O-S Black Knight skateboard with clay birds. It's been long ago, and on the ash of my personal life. But I never forgot. It's like watching long-lost brothers and friends, and it hits me right where I live. I can't see this movie enough. Every time I see it, another aspect rises up, another point of view comes in sharp focus. The ancient footage, the incredible silence, the current personalities, the intermeshed with the vibrant shadows of the brightly lit past, the sincere and unrecognized story, all beautifully edited in such a way to make a landmark documentary of a real cut American history. In the words of Glen Friedman - "It was F-ing incredible."
