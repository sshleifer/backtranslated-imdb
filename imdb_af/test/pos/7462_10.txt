It's a good movie. I read the short summary and was unimpressed, but when I looked at it (especially for Caroline Dhavernas), it grew on me. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie where girls / young women are not punished is such a beautiful change. their sexuality. The girls get full license to explore and even the chance to make mistakes without ridiculous consequences. <br /> <br /> Some of the screens are absolutely hilarious - and many of them are so-called erotic scenes - which were not over the top. or unpleasant. The male characters in the movie were brilliant - David Boreanaz was wonderful as the capricious hunger - and what's great is that the movie doesn't hate us to hate him so much. The other two younger male characters were also good, without being persuasive. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best movies I've seen girls grow up and is very empowered to see how they realize their mistakes. But eventually come through and continue with their lives rather than dragging their mistakes with them.
