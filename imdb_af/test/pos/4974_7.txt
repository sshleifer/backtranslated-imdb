The Violent Men are a good western. Perhaps the story is not an original one-owner owner who is dedicated to dropping out small competitors from a valley he needs for his growing cattle, but the film has many ingredients that increase his level and that is the worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The cast is a highlight. There is the trusted Glenn Ford (John Parrish) as a former army officer and now one of the small farmers trying to stay out of trouble until he is pushed hard. Edward Robinson (Lew Wilkinson) is as good as ever as the mutilated big man and Barbara Stanwyck (Martha) plays his treacherous wife in one of her usual common female roles she easily handles (others were in Double Dissipation and Blowing Wild). Brian Keith (Cole) does it perfectly as Robinson's armed brother, an ambitious man trying to take over his brother's big farmer, no matter what. Normal 50's western villain Richard Jaeckel (Wade Mattlock) is also there and ends as usual there.) Dianne Foster (Judith Wilkinson) plays Robinson's daughter who doesn't approve of his father, mother and uncle's way of dealing with things with their neighbors. <br /> <br /> Rudolph Mate brings a standard but acceptable direction, perhaps helped by beautiful and wide open landscapes and a fine and appropriate music score. <br /> <br /> The inevitable final confrontation between Ford and Keith is one of the best in Western movies. Every man in his own twin style (note Ford's shoot with his s <br /> <br /> It's certainly one of Glenn Ford's best western appearance, the second only to the classic "3: 10 to Yuma" he two This is probably the role that the film is playing at an "A" speed and for me it goes to the top 10 list of the genre.
