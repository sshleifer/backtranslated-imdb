This movie is truly unique. It really captures the spirit of the play, but makes it entertaining for the modern generation. The romance between Tromeo and Juliet was credible, and erotic, not drawn by many adjustments. It is also so funny that I almost cry with laughter. <br /> <br /> As with most Troma, it is in your face, taboo subjects, gore and sex, and adds some very good acting and a Shakespeare plot. You really should see this movie! <br /> <br /> There are some hilarious jokes in the credits (best credits I've seen since Hot Shots), lots of jokes in jokes, as well as common satire and shakespeare refs. And tell Lemmy from Motorhead's house. I borrowed this movie from a friend and almost impossible to get it back. Troma at its best, this movie is really a gem, and goes into my top 5 favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Though it is not the kind of movie you will see with your mother, and maybe some people insult. For anyone who is bored with running the mills theater, you have to watch this movie with a funny sense of humor.
