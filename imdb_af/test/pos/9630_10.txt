I really enjoyed the Patriot. This movie had less violence and was based on a real life threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization. One line in Wesley Mclaren's (Seagal) movie featured in my mind to be a lot of our society. "Western medicine is in practice to lengthen disease and I'm healing it." <br /> <br />
