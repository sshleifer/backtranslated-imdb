I wanted to see it getting an inside of the show. It told more about Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, thought it was wonderful. We must see, Robin is always on, no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was wonderful. <br /> <br /> The introductions of the main players seem to me so realistic. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so beautiful in this, which helped me get all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes of his other performances (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley) were enlightening. I also thought Richmond-Peck's Harvey was also a nice rock in the dam. (This is a good thing). <br /> <br /> This movie tells the older story of Hollywood people, going through the ups and downs of the stars. It glued me to my TV, and I learned to love Robin, hell, most of the time it looks like everyone is the super guy I sometimes think is Hollywood. Go figure. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder why the network people are always playing to be idiots. We never saw ABC's head. He just heard him, like Charlie from Charlie Angels (I'm wondering if it's so planned?). It seems so sad that a show at number 1 can be destroyed by their own network. <br /> <br /> I think this story can be told of anyone's life, as they climb the teachings of any work. Movie and TV stars are always loved or hated by so many people, with whom you grew up, just want to return in their past, to remember your own past. I remember watching the show and always wondering what happens in their personal lives. <br /> <br /> Mork and Mindy will always be part of me, and I got a part of them. It may not be the truth, it is not a lie either, but in the end it has told me a wonderful sadness, happy story.
