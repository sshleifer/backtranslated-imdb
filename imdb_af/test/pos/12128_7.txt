A very accurate depiction of the small time mob film filmed in New Jersey. The story, characters and writing are credible, but the play drops the ball. Still, it is worth looking at, especially for the strong images, a few with me, although I only saw this 25 years ago. <br /> <br /> A young hood goes up and starts doing bigger things (trying) but these things go wrong and leads the local boss to suspect that his end is being scaled, not a good place to if you enjoy your health or life. <br /> <br /> This is the movie Joe Pesce introduced. to Martin Scorsese. Also present is the perennial screen wise man, Frank Vincent. Strong on characterization and imagery. Sound disturbed and much of the acting is amateurish, but a good story.
