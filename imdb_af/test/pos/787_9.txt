Buster Keaton was probably at his most enjoyable when he did movies for 20 minutes, and they no longer came across rib-kittens as a jewel. The dead pan comic gets involved in a photographic march with a criminal. This leads to his extensive evasion of various street people and fellow passengers who recognize his face from the "Wanted" signs. The Goat is a choc-a-block with brilliant yard holes, from the opening stage at the bread route to the wonderful lifts at the end. A Keaton movie never feels as if its silence is missing, because sound is never something you need with it. His movies explain themselves through the wonderful (but incredibly dangerous) things he did to himself. It's not hard to see how influential he really was - the man is as wonderfully wonderful every day as he was in 1921.
