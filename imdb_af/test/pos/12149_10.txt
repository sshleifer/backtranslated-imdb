Disobeying one can only invade 'Classe Tous Risques'; It should be on any "best of movie noir" list, including IMDb's. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is as good as ever; Knowing his serious, delicate family situation gives extra weight to his almost expressionless face and short dialogues. Belmondo's prestigious show under Sautet's solid direction just shows what a wonderful actor he could - and should have been. <br /> <br /> "Classe Tous Risques" is totally miniscule, dry and cold, without Melville's artistic scenery, beautiful faces. and fancy cars. It is almost film-noir meets neo-realism. Davos's few harsh words to his children describing their secrecy from there get your throat to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The final sense of the movie - a voice over tells Davos's end in no more than ten dry, gloomy words - leaving you with a loud punch in the stomach. <br /> <br /> A true jewel in the great crown of French film noir.
