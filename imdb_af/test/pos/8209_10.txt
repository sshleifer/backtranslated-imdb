I loved this movie! <br /> <br /> Movies and plays fulfill their purpose when they expose the majority, social, political, and other issues. This movie served that purpose. <br /> <br /> I identify with the plot and know people to whom it happened. By the time this film was made, concepts presented in this movie were advanced to the public, but already with my friends by people in powerful positions. And I know how it is when people do what they did to Angela Bennett because they did it for me. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Angela Bennett / Ruth Marx. She depicts a beautiful, intelligent and witty young woman who has the courage to prevent him from giving overwhelming chances, to fight hard to maintain her healthy understanding and to restore her life and to protect those she loves. Losing her self-concept and spending for the centuries-old effort to promote a mitigating self-image by spreading sex with a stranger added a gripping touch of reality. <br /> <br /> The climax of the plot reveals the only true solution to this kind of problem.
