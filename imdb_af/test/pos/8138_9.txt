This short film intends to focus on one issue sociologically known as cultivated shock. the film presents the state of the average Romanian in the democratic Romania who finds that life and the problems do not differ from the Communist era, and if you want something, you have to bribe to get it. <br /> <br /> So, our main character is discharged after a long time, he is about 50 and needs a similar job, but the only job available is one inferior. He is obliged to take it because the lack of money. <br /> <br /> My opinion is that you should live in Romania so this movie can be as real and tragic as it looks.
