"The bad dreams always come back like unwanted friends," said Marion Fairlie, who lives with her half-sister, Laura, in a large middle-Victorian estate. "And last night I found myself in the Limmeridge Cemetery. Usually, still-born people, just as usual are criminals who are trapped rather than victims. But then there was nothing normal about what happened to us." And we are on a first-class gothic tale of madness, deception and villain, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian secret. It is a good idea to pay close attention, as there are limits within the plots, but everyone is on a cunning and relentless scheme that involves, more money, a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Marion Fairlie (Tara Fitzgerald) and her sister, Laura Fairlie (Justine Wadell) are dedicated to each other. Marion is fiery and protective; Laura is softer and more romantic. Marion has no money of her own; Laura will experience wealth as she grows old. Marion has no marital prospects we know about; Laura was promised to Sir Percival Glyde (James Wilby) yesterday, a completely charming aristocrat. They are the wards of their uncle, a difficult, derogatory, highly self-centered hypochondria (Ian Richardson). Everyone looks pretty routine, but then a young artist, Walter Hartright (Andrew Lincoln), is drawing them drawing and artistic appreciation. And when he arrives at the local train station at night, there is no transport, so he goes to the estate on foot. In the dark forest he met a strange woman, dressed everything in white, wandering about and talking about things he didn't understand, which then disappeared. Are we uncomfortable? Yes, and so is he and the sisters when they realize the strange woman looks like Laura. Later love between Walter and Laura comes? Flowering a bud? Is there a misunderstanding that sends Walter away and does Laura marry Sir Percival? Cut a cancer? And secret secrets are revealed about the relationships between Laura, Marian and the woman in white ... teach us to be deeply suspicious of Sir Percival's intention ... come to mind the style and ways of Sir Percival's goodness enjoy friend, Tel Fosco (Simon Callow) ... and do we finally realize the dirty depths of depravity, as well as the power of honor and true love, which mankind is capable of? Visit our Victorian insane asylum, see fall from tall towers, dig open digs in the middle of the night and see retribution within the roaring flames of a closed church? <br /> <br /> Well, of course, it's a great trip for us. <br /> <br /> This BBC / Masterpiece Theater Program offers fine acting and excellent production values. To fit Collins' 500-plus-page novel into a television program of less than 120 minutes, a good deal needs to be cut or shortened, and some changes have probably reached the greatest possible impact on available time. Yet, according to his own terms, the production of The Woman in White works very well like a lazy, romantic, dark television story. Tara Fitzgerald as Marion gives a command as a woman who is determined to protect and then save her sister. James Wilby as Mr. Percival manages the clever feat to let us slowly see the depraved mucus under the skin, which still has charm amidst the villain. Ian Richardson as the young woman's uncle almost steals the show. He gives such a solid and sharp impression that he almost unbalanced the story every time he appears. Perhaps the worst of the main parts is Simon Callow as Count Fosco. The spade is merely a monster, but a highly civilized and charming one. Collins described him as an enormous outline. Callow does a fine, motivated job, but for me he has a bit of the evil of evil. <br /> <br /> At one point, Marian tells us, "My sister and I love Gothic novels, we sometimes act as if we were in them." Little did she know what was in store for her and Laura.
