In the 1980s, struggling with the world was simple. Hulk Hogan would record Roddy Piper, or Bobby Heenan's cronies or Ted DiBiase, and win more. Sometimes he would get an ally like Randy Savage in 1988, but most of it was all about Hulk Hogan vs Bobby Heenan, and that's how it should be. <br /> <br /> But this night it was changing, a new champion, a man who thought the WWE was, should their husband be for the 90s, was crowned.

There were very good team teams at this time. Jim Duggan then knocks Dino Bravo into a match. <br /> <br /> Next, Ted DiBiase has its most cherished possession, the Million Dollar Championship, on the line against Jake Roberts.
