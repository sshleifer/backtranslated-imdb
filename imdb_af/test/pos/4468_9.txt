As far as I know, I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's movies, with the exception of a few later children appearing on DVD, and I'll have to say it's his best "pre-zombie" feature. In fact, it cuts out its later movies. It is a story of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian village in the middle of nowhere where young boys mysteriously die. It's no mystery how they are dead, I think, it's more what it does. Is this a woman who has always regarded the townspeople as a witch? Is it a young woman living in a fine modern house on the outskirts of the village, who used a lot of drugs? Is this the town idiot, who gets in the wrong place at the wrong time in the near future? You will only know when you look and see how you should, because it is a top-notch mystery thriller, or should I say, a "giallo". I've seen it before, but it was long and at a second look it was as powerful as the first time. For those of you who only know Lucio Fulci for his zombie movie, open your mind for it because it is worth seeing and while the "monsters" in this man are as dirty as anything in his later movies are turned. . 9 out of 10 stars, see it! Please ....
