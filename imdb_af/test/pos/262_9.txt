It's just one of those movies, you love it or hate it, my girlfriend and I loved it, my brother said to rent it and he hated it. He said it was too flashy and commonplace, and then he usually just saw big action flicks, so probably not enough explosions disappointed him. There were some good new talent (I have never heard from the leaders)? Des Brady (the director brother?) Was especially good. I started playing a real dick. I thought he would never leave himself, but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and I finally drove him. A very surprising movie with lots of heart, if you can live without body count and explosions then this one is very original. Yashimo. Brixton in the UK.
