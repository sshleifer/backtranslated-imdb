China White (1989) was Ronny Yu's first international film. This UK / Holland / Hong Kong production was shot in English and slightly edited for Western audiences. The American Wong brothers (Michael and Russell) had to stand together in the film, but due to previous commitments were not available, so another Western actor Steven Leigh took his place. Several Hong Kong stars like Tommy Wong (a dumb play) and the always terrible William Ho appear as well as the director in an interesting cameo spot. <br /> <br /> The Chow brothers are in Holland to run the family business. . They want to make the family business legitimate, but the other Asian gangs do not want to see it and move as a sight-saving move to please the "strangers" and want to continue making money in the old way. Others want to take their business even a new layer of smuggling drugs and what not. After the Chow parent was thrown into cold blood, the brothers made their move against any family not with them. Can the Chow family kill the families to kill each other or while the streets of Holland flow with the blood of innocence and gangsters? <br /> <br /> A highly understated movie. I was surprised at how good it was. I didn't see the Hong Kong version. It will be a big deal for me. It is longer and has many more stars from the Hong Kong movie involved in the production. Too bad this movie is not available on D.V.D. The video edition I saw was washed out and the sound reproduction was not so good. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for action fans. <br /> <br /> factoid: This film takes place before the decriminalization of drugs <br /> <br /> in Holland.
