What's nice about Barker's Nightbreed is that it's the story of a man on a rampage, a deadly threat to monsters everywhere. In this one, the monsters (the nightmare of the title) are the "good" guys. It shares his feelings of celebration, the twist and the dark with the first Addams family movie, and much of Tim Burton's work. It also has the greed one expects from Barker. <br /> <br /> Especially fun is the performance by Cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor bent on destroying the Nightbreed. As in most classic monster movies, villagers have the monsters' castle with torches and forks. Only this time, the modern environment replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic "weapons" with guns and bombs. And this time the sympathy you felt when Frankenstein's monster was burned in the windmill was the centerpiece of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a masterpiece, and even Barker has become more interesting and definitely more cool, working. But it's pure fun, it looks good and remains light without mocking itself. A look!
