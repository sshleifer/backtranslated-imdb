I remember being so excited when I was a child on Saturday night and for Dr. Who's waiting. I thought it was the best show ever made. Then I grew up, dr. Whoever went out of the air, and no one I knew had ever heard it. Then I found out there would be a new series. I was a little nervous about it. Was it to meet the expectations I've been carrying since I was little? Will they screw it up? Will the Dr Suck? Would his assistant suck? Will they create a more intimate relationship with the Dr and his assistant? Yes, no, no, no, no !!! This show is great !! I love the new Dr. I love his assistant. I love the show. And I'm excited about the new episode on Friday night. I only see 2005 episodes, as I live in the United States, so I'm a little behind the rest of you. I hope the next dr. Is as big as this one!
