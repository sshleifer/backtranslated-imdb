Anderson's animation is easy on Pixar's and goes well past most things I've ever seen for Disney. While some say the story is a bit too abstract, I find it an exciting and refreshing change from the exaggerated characters and bumbling animals typically found in animated shorts. This is an interplanetary version of CASTAWAY! Anyone who has left the safe haven from home and has gone to a lonely, frightening place, will easily identify with these lost microbes. Excellent work, Mr. Other Sun! <br /> <br />
