After all these years, I was amazed at why Julie Brown (West Coast) is not a household name or a well-known comic star. She is one of the funniest women on the planet. In this spoof she picks up Madonna which is one of her favorite targets. She is Medusa, a very successful singer, such as Madonna who also had documentary truth or deed. Julie Brown spoof Madonna as Medusa who came from Wisconsin, the country dairy and beer. I remember the segment she went to Wisconsin to visit her family and a grave. I don't remember if it was a parent or her pet. I remember someone saying that Medusa didn't do anything originally. She just copied others. I have to say that I hope this spoof documentary is available somewhere on DVD. Julie Brown was at her best mockery and spoofing others.
