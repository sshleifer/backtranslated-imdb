The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that offers everything you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot. It's on a weekend at a country house. As always, all guests are suspects and it is Poirot's job to find out the truth. With movies like this, it's always best not to give away too much, so I'll stop here. What I loved in the "Hollow" was that it is a mystery in the old-fashioned way. For example, when Poirot arrives, everyone is around the body. Everyone seems to be the culprit. There is that suspicious appearance and the atmosphere is perfect for the story. <br /> <br /> You can expect a great time to wonder about who did this and how and why and perhaps even surprised. A cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you have a nice experience. <br /> <br /> The actors are all very good. As a curiosity note, Edward Hardwicke, what dr. Watson played in Sherlock Holmes. Nice to see him after a few years. Suchet is incredible as always and fortunately most of the time is on the screen. <br /> <br /> I found out who the killer was, but it's not yet predictable and it's also very credible. <br /> <br /> Such a good movie and always a pleasure. <br /> <br />
