I loved the movie "Northfork". I didn't know anything about the movie until I watched it. Therefore, I had no external influence or information to guide me in what I see unfolding on the screen. In retrospect, I would advise anyone interested in the movie to see it as for no other reason than the quality actors appearing in it. Read nothing about the plot, story line or movie review. In fact, STOP a little further in my comments, although I believe they are commonplace and do not want to spoil the movie for you, I do not want to lower the value of the movie to you. Find your own path of meaning in this movie or it's reduced in its potential. <br /> <br /> In general, I found the 3 benign strangers in Northfolk confusing. As the film unfolds, they can qualify as three entertaining escapes from a mental hospital or the dreams and hallucinations of a sick and feverish young boy or three angels sent to find the "lost angel". <br /> <br /> The sick and possibly dying boy works to convince the three strangers to leave the search for the lost angel, becomes his guardians (mother and father) and takes him safely far away from Northfork (no less not more than 1000 miles). He even declares that he is the lost angel trying to manipulate them all to be his guardian. Only one in three responded positively to the boy. The other two have no real enthusiasm or passion for this engagement. <br /> <br /> The nursing priest shows a deep care for people and a deep conviction for his faith. He surpassed the desert and emptiness of Northfork and its people; He is the light of goodness and hope for both Northfork and the movie viewer. <br /> <br /> In the climax of the film, the boy and new guardian travel over land to a field where a plane is waiting. They also found the other two aliens on the plane; In fact, one is the pilot. The engines start and the plane is getting down. <br /> <br /> Who are the 3 strangers? If only one stranger is interested in helping the boy, why were all three on the plane? Where's the plane going? Did the other two find the "Lost Angel"? Is there a lost angel and if so, who is it? Who are the six men dressed as entrepreneurs? If all of this is just the sick boy's feverish dreams, how did one of the 3 strangers finally come out to help one of the men dress like a vendor when he jumped and hit his head (not the boy or strangers did not have contact with men)? <br /> <br /> One or two sentences written under the title to tell people what this movie is about is a tragic mistake (it's not a spoiler, it's just an ad statement) . So if you haven't seen the movie Northfork, the questions above just show a few interesting and fun forks in the mindset as you watch the movie Northfork. If you read the plot plot of the movie before watching it earlier, you might have to look at some of the questions above and watch it again ... I know I'll do it. <br /> <br /> Terry
