The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways, ranging from more or less traditional views to dealing with art to more post-modern approaches that the play wants to analyze according to postcolonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason Jarman's version left me pretty cold is that I didn't have an idea about what he was going to do. What is the underlying vision / idea / concept behind this version of Shakespeare? The previous judges don't get much more than revenge behavior, punk courts, but there is more to it, isn't it? It is not to say that there is no vision here, just that I have made it difficult to discover it. Be as it may be, there are still things to enjoy. The punk taste is refreshing and funny. Toyah Wilcox like Miranda and Jack Birkett as Caliban are wonderful. I don't care much about Williams as Prospero ... not enough magic. The switches between the old monastery / castle and the (very English) outside world can sometimes be weak, but I think it is intentional. All in all, interesting, but not quite the success I had hoped for (especially after I saw Jarman's Caravaggio).
