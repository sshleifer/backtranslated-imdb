The fact that judges feel very intense towards the show is an interesting fact. If you don't like it so much, don't look. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers claim that you should be stupid, dull or ordinary old primitive to enjoy this show. Au contraire, my friends. I do not claim that all participants are smart. There are smart people, and there are stupid people. But I would argue that they probably have a higher average IQ than the average reviewer on this site. That's right, I said. There is much to be said for the science of seduced girls. I'm sorry, but please pull out all the sticks from your donkeys and realize the reason you hate these guys is that they threaten you. <br /> <br /> Those who are unaware of the social sciences, and more specifically the science behind mating, are clearly missing out on the boat. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear: The clubs aren't the only places to meet girls. Personally, I think the precious women don't even go to clubs, so they won't fall prey to men we see on the show. But what are men like this ???? Apart from those whose games stink, it's the character of men. They are men who meet women in the most difficult situations. These are men who take ownership of their own sexuality. These men don't ask their friends to break with them, and these men don't say "OK" to the phrase "let's just be friends". <br /> <br /> Klink known ???? In fact, these are the guys you are scared of if you take your special long-term friend to the club. We are all. These guys know what women like. (again, just the one who has a game) <br /> <br /> And even the one who's bad ... they're worth laughing! <br /> <br /> If you went to a club, and were actually involved with the people around you, find this entertainment syndrome. <br /> <br /> Look, I have a loss for why there is so much hate for this show. My best guess is that it aggravates insecurity in men who have had bad experiences in clubs, or threatens men who believe women are beautiful, smaller creatures who just want a good guy to buy their attention. <br /> <br /> I personally love this show. It's pure entertainment, and best of all, it's really. This is a very notable assumption on the most recent state of sexual psychology. Sex rolls have never been so different from before, and this view offers a very real view of it. <br /> <br /> I think it's actually intelligence to take away something positive from this show. <br /> <br /> This show appeals to a certain target market, and if you're out of it, I think you shouldn't tune in to the show. However, we can say about any other performances, can't we? <br /> <br /> Growth, <br /> <br /> ApolloHelios
