So many literary adjustments are disappointments. There are many reasons for this, but it is usually necessary to cut down a complex novel on the size of a script. The dead are unusual - it had to be 'stuffed', as the short story itself is a small, relatively short jewel. It can indeed be the best short story in the English language. In beautiful free language, it tells of the realization of Gabriel Conroy that his life and the lives of so many around him are controlled by memories of the dead. Even his own wife of many years loved a man who is now more dead than him. <br /> <br /> To bring such a short story to the theater will always be difficult. John Huston did a wonderful job. He never tempted to play it or use fancy technique to expand the story. It's simple and true, with outstanding acting. The only slight slip is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy. <br /> <br /> It is rare indeed for a movie version of a literary masterpiece to be a masterpiece itself, but I think it's fair to use this quarter for this movie. It's not a bravura movie production, but it's simple and pure. I always think of Ozu's movies when I think of the dead, it's at that level of purity and simplicity and deep wisdom.
