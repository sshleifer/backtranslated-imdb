It is difficult, today and in the US, to understand this movie. We have nothing really to compare it to. Here's an attempt to compare. It is as if in the last years of Saddam's reign a filmmaker in Iraq could somehow make a film, which for the first time ever showed life as it really lived in that country. The life of ordinary young girl, with all the terror and oppression full blown. Then the film was released in Iraq. If you could imagine the unlikely event, you might have an idea of ​​what the Soviet Union has been doing with this movie over the past few years. For this film, the Soviet theater was highly censored. Soviet films will only show an ideal life in the worker's paradise. Then suddenly it. Alcoholism, the random generation, the ugly desert that was the Soviet city, the suffocation pollution, the proletariat that favor each other and themselves, the total hopelessness - that's all there. People were stunned. Soviet women would often cry during performances. Many will say it's the story of their lives. It was a cultural earthquake that dreamed like dreamers. This has undoubtedly accelerated the breakdown of the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Read reviews here, I can see that little this movie understands. One says it was groundbreaking because it contains real sex. For the Soviet viewers, at that time, there was a small event compared to the fact that it first appeared in Soviet theater. <br /> <br /> Others compare it to current movies such as "So Good as It Gets". Also compare Homer's Illiad with the latest John Grissam novel. They simply don't compare. It's not just a movie, it's a social document, and a transforming social power. It should be seen or you will not understand the movie. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers see it as a movie about a dysfunctional Russian family. One even says it's hard to feel sorry for Vera because she's back to her family. The point is that Vera and her family are symbols of all Soviet life. There was nowhere else to go, because the family next to the block and in the next town was the same. It was life in the Soviet Union for most people. <br /> <br /> It is a film that can be viewed on many levels: as a drama, the landscape of despair is traced as a social document that shows the living conditions of time, as a political document As to the attitude of the people and many of the reasons for the breakdown of the Soviet Union, and as a moral document, it shows the evils of a dictatorship that is out of control and the atrocities that victims will have on each other. <br /> <br /> Little Vera clearly demonstrates the human toll that socialism ultimately assumes its victims, despite any good intentions the system may have. So it helped to end the Soviet regime, thereby contributing to one of the most important changes in modern history. Get this movie that only a few movies ever achieved. It is not only a beautiful representation of history, but it also becomes a force in that shaped history.
