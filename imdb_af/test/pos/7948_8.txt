SPOILER ALERT - AND I MEAN REAL! READ NO FURTHER, UNLESS YOU ARE READY TO REPEAT A GREAT PLOT ELEMENT! <br /> <br /> Well, first I have to say I have a relatively high tolerance for movie prints. I will see movies about true life-horrors (such as war and the holocaust) or where death and sadness are important to the plot, but I hate movies like STEAL MAGNOLIAS and TERME OF ENDEARMENT where the film is about a manipulative death of a main character. So, no matter how good this movie is, it has a big strike against it because one of the main characters dies at the end of a disease (though they never say what it did in the English subtitles version). <Br /> <br /> So you can ask yourself, "If it is so hard to hate this type of movie, why did he look it first?" You will have an excellent point to ask for it, though I hope I'm not really blown away! Well, when I found it in our local library, I had no idea what it was about !!! The movie was not specifically intended for export, as the captions were in Korean, English and Japanese and the box was printed in Korean. Well, as a fan to try movies from any nation (I've seen movies of at least 30-40 different countries), I tried it. <br /> <br /> Apart from the mandatory death, I loved the movie and hated it as it ended. While I usually hate Hollywood-type miraculous ends, I wanted to see the man rescued by a new drug or experimental operation. I was really bummed that he had to die - especially because he looked like one of the most beautiful people I've ever seen in movies. His smile was contagious and I really wanted him to finally get the girl. Oh well, at least I can appreciate the movie's message that you need to grab the moment. Great acting, music, etc., but not the most satisfying end for me. This movie was good enough to encourage me to try more Korean theaters.
