My roommate and I have free tickets for Pre Screening. I think you call it Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I expected something controversial, challenging, unnecessarily exaggerated, etc. But the movie is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdoing it, and the movie is being done in a careful balance so as not to scratch or unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> It's really well crafted and doesn't take too seriously. It's the beauty of it. If it was trying to deal with itself seriously, it would have failed miserably, but instead it would do with humor (some unintended) and some surprisingly good actions by Ricci. Although Timberlake fails in his role, the movie is good enough to put it on the side. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie, if not for any reason other than the fact that it is something else. to experience.
