The animation quality here is definitely under par IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters do not. <br /> <br /> It may be picky, but if you live in the city of Olympus almost exclusively by live machines, will you feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever have such effective human arrogance, shortness and greed? I doubt it. There are a few tips on this in the movie, but only when the team bothered, they can be replaced by "bioroids" (or whatever), with people characters. Seems sloppy to me. <br /> <br /> The main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement, although there is no light on this barn. There is little light in the background, a great pity. The short length of the film, coupled with the focus on mecha and crime, means we don't see any depth of character. The groundwork is all down, but we have finished with no final product. A captivated version of this OAV would have made a great TV episode once some character subtotals have been set. <br /> <br /> The highlights of this short film are the mecha designs and the action / espionage. /> <br /> The mistakes really start to show as soon as you have the chance to consume all the action, so I couldn't recommend to own it, but it's definitely worth a watch or two. have! Although this review is mostly negative, I really think it's worth your while to see it, but it's not something to pick out and buy. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: A viewable wasted opportunity.
