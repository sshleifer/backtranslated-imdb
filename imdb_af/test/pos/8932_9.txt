I saw this movie on a Sunday night and I have to say there is no better way to end the weekend. I am completely satisfied with the humor and warmth of this film. It just leaves me in beautiful mood. Watching this movie means having a good time and feeling warm. <br /> <br /> The movie offers sharp black British humor and feels very fresh to me. You really enjoy the story and the characters. Brenda Blethyn is so good. I don't know exactly why. She is too old to be a love affair for me and too young to be my mother. But I really feel comfortable when she appears in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people may say the story was thin and predictable. But who cares? There must be a happy ending, dance in the sunshine! Are the characters stereotypes or clippings? I don't know better, I don't care! I just loved them and enjoyed watching. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that I usually don't like romantic comedies. But this one is outstanding: a black comedy with a heart of gold !!
