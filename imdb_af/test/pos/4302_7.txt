It's a well-directed Columbo episode, with some good character, but the story just doesn't know enough and doesn't look as well-layered and constructed as it often was with a Columbo movie. This also applies to the murderer's plot to kill his uncle. It's pretty simple and doesn't look so good. Perhaps this movie has not really taken seriously enough, as the movie's atmosphere is mostly light. At least compared to different Columbo movies. <br /> <br /> For example, the movie has a large amount of comic relief, mostly of the Columbo character itself. This makes the movie a pleasant one to watch, but it also gives you the feeling that they are overloading it, especially because it doesn't match most other Columbo movies. <br /> <br /> The characters are good and it helps Martin Landau double. It is always funny to see how much else he still looks like a young man, while for example someone like Peter Falk has barely changed over the years, he just got grayer. The film also includes Julie Newmar, who knows best to play Catwoman in the '60s Batman life action series. It's funny how she still moves like Catwoman in this movie. Intentional or is it just her way of acting? <br /> <br /> It's a nice and good Columbo movie, but it also makes you feel that it could be better with a better thought-out script. <br /> <br /> 7/10
