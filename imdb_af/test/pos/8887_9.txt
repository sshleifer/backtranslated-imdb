We live in sad times today, in which every comedy movie and TV show seems to be painfully rude and inflicted with inexpensive, rough, or poor humor. Most people don't know what it means to really laugh at a comedy, and these people have to look desperately "Throw Momma From The Train." I say with little hesitation that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen from start to finish. The comedy is so unpredictable and turned just enough to make us run out loud a lot. Don't be fooled by the murder site. The plot is not serious enough to worry or worry about what will happen. The story involves a young man (Danny DeVito) who, from his annoying, gruesome mother (Anne Ramsey, who was given an Oscar in a role, would have a role that was completely flawless and do it by Billy Crystal If you want to kill the jokes and gags in this movie, but all I can say is watch this movie if you want to laugh. and really, a real entertainment for comedy lovers, and the type of movie you just don't see. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 out of ****
