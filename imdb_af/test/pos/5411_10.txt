Imaginary Heroes is clearly the best movie of the year. It was a complete and full joy to watch. I was sounding. The whole audience at the Sunset Five sounded, when the film ended no one was moving, nothing was talking. I think this movie is a perfect example of the power the drama has. Especially as it sets an example of the quality of drama / work of this younger generation. <br /> <br /> There were moments in your movie, much like at least seven, where I hit so much beauty, emotional beauty, that I couldn't breathe for a while. And for a Catholic junkie like me, it's about the best censorship experience I can ask. This is the result of powerful, masterful storytelling and direction. Like heavyweight, like Burtolucci and the guys. <br /> <br /> Each element of the film fits tightly. There were no misconceptions at all. The cast was amazing. I've been a big fan of Emile's and Ryan's, and I thought they had never been better. I was / will / will be constantly amazed by this movie. And I promise I'll drag every person I know to see it. It must be seen. It must win awards.
