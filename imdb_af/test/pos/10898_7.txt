This episode introduces us to the formal drafts worn by Captain Picard, Commander Riker, and Lieutenant Tasha Yar. The plot of this episode is about 2 groups of separate alien delegates, The Anticans and the Selae, who catch and eat every turn. The two sides totally hate each other, and it's up to Riker and Tasha to keep them out of trouble. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a mysterious spatial anomaly around the ship is hurting and killing some of the crew. But at the end of the episode, this independent anomaly has become a valuable member of the crowd. Will they be able to save him, so maybe they can continue with their ongoing mission of space exploration? <br /> <br /> Note: This episode shows Irish actor Colm Meaney's second appearance on TNG to "Encounter at Farpoint." He depicts one of Tasha's "yellow-colored" security guards.
