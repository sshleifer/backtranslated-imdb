I didn't know who Bruce Haack was before I saw this movie. I just saw the MOOG doc, which was good, the only problem was Moog had a lot of content life and the doc was good ... content. Haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people are buying these days, but it carries a big heart with it. Although the film is not so bad in the tragic things, one can feel that Bruce accepts the prize for making music. There are so many elements that make up her heritage. invention of the Peopleodian, where Bruce could actually play music by touching people. It had to be difficult to document Haack's scatter-brained output, which fell into every musical category (even rap music), but the director cut the piece very coherently and managed to capture the spirit. And the role-play ... that surrounds a group of characters, Bruce, but what do you expect from a telepathic guru, who copes with kids, against the music industry. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in music history, it's the mainstream, but it's important.
