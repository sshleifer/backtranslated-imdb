Hehehe. It was one of the best funny road movies ever! I laughed, and I fell out of the chair. With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves. Harald Zwart is the producer, known for films like Agent Cody Banks and of course one night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> It's about Norwegian crazy fans, going to the Soccer World Cup in Germany 2006. And all kind of crazy fun to come. It was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. I've never had so much fun. Rumors say it will be a number two, but I don't know. It will be hard to beat this one. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone! It's a movie to watch. I was sure to see it at the theater, but I did work at the times it showed. And try to rent it for a month, but have been hired all the time. Have it on DVD today. Well worth it.
