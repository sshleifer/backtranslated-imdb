When you read the book by Carl Hiaasen, the film is very true to follow, with some minor changes for Hollywood. In my opinion, this is a great family movie. Luke Wilson (Delinko Officer) steals the show from an all-star role that includes Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffet. The children in the movie do a good job led by Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley. <br /> <br /> Brie Larson may be a bit too petite to play Beatrice. I suggested a bigger girl, maybe 6 feet, 175 pounds, in the role of Beatrice. It may have made her more credible in her role in defeating Dana. They had to develop her "tough girl" character more and bite her through a band, or kick a soccer ball through a person. She is very beautiful and I understand why she was thrown. She is a box office attraction. <br /> <br /> It's about PG, like a movie, today, no sex and very little violence. This movie is a parents' dream truth, a movie with a strong environmental message, with children deeply appreciated for the beauty of Florida and its wildlife. It shows how adults are short in the management of our planet and that our children can claim better. One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Mullet Fingers says, "Florida can use some mountains like Montana. Florida is so flat there's nothing to stop developers from cleaning it from coast to coast." Also, photography of Florida wildlife spoke volumes without dialogue. As a family movie with children aged 5-15, it's a great movie! As a bonus, parents' entertainment, especially if they are "parrotheads".
