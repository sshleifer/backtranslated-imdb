The sale of four seasons was Rainer Werner Fassbinder's first shot at general acceptance. In a turbulent career of just fifteen years, he succeeded in creating an astonishing piece of work in film and theater, as well as an artist and creative producer, actor and director. Although this movie may not appeal to many viewers, the movie has a lot to offer. The storyline is pretty simple. A man is from his upper middle class family because of emotional and economic problems, and does not prove to be able to control the downward spiral. The sale of four seasons is shot with a slavish dedication to elegant detail, and each set is very carefully designed and built. Each object on the set eventually looks arranged to challenge low emotional texture. Many religious paintings and icons decorate the walls of the various rooms and resemble Hans's desperate quest for spiritual significance or direction in his life. There was much thought of how lighting and color were employed to contrast and enhance the drama. Several times during the film I locked the frame to marvel at the beauty of the shot's composition. I streamed this movie, and the pressure was almost flawless and no one else. Fassbinder uses his actors in an almost violent "Anti-Natural" style. He does everything possible to prevent the actors from responding in a normal or everyday manner, creating a fairly stilted effect. In doing so, he almost spits 'hyper-reality' for the story. Instead of portraying an everyday melodrama, the actors almost forced militant lack of emotion to confront the movie in a different way. Fassbinder's film prevents the intentions easily with the characters' trials and tribulations. You're constantly on the outside, look in. It will be a disturbing experience for many, but I have found it to be a unique and satisfying artistic adventure.
