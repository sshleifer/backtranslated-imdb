Once upon a time, a film that forces one to reconsider society's response to people different from the definition of normal comes. <br /> <br /> Mitthi suffered in the hands of un-social elements with her tragedy, retreating into her idyllic world .... one that she believes is the real world. <br /> <br /> Surrealism (Mitthi's world) relies on the rights (her family). <br /> <br /> Mitthi, who suffers from schizophrenia, forces us to reconsider our priorities of trying to rehabilitate patients like them. Are we right to retreat to our reality if everything we have to offer in ours is pain and suffering? What right do we have to deprive them of their source of happiness? What right should we take away when we can't help them in their grief? 15 Park Avenue is one of the best movies on social issues ... showing us the need for any patient to have empathy and not sympathy.
