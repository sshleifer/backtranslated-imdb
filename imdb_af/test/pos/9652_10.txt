This is the best French movie of the year! I saw it twice and I both got it well. I didn't think it was boring, even though it was very long (3 hours). I'm seventeen, so of course I didn't live the events of May 1968 that knew a very important turn in French history, but it doesn't matter, as I still enjoyed the movie a lot. It's actually quite universal: people of my parents can identify the characters and so people can age me. Garrel seems to understand young people, the way they think and the complications of love, as well as the loss of illusions about the possibility of changing the world. Maybe it's because Louis Garrel's character (his son) is actually meant to represent Philippe Garrel himself. Well anyway, fantastic movie, no action (must be honest at that point), but such strong feelings that you may not be able to remain indifferent. If you are looking for a relaxing Sunday evening movie, don't waste your time, you will be disappointed. But if you like cinema, you will like Les Amants like Regulators who are a captivating movie close to those made in the 50's and 60's by the Nouvelle Vague artists.
