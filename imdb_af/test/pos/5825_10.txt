Oz is the TV show that is intensive non-stop adrenaline. It's a show not aimed at a big audience, but a specific one as themes is very mature. This, of course, did not reach the mainstream success, as it was an impossibility, but had much fame with his audience and many well-known actors died or became part of the show last night. <br /> <br /> Oz is a series of fictional stories based on a prison located somewhere in the New York state. There are many different ethnic groups that play a somewhat equal role in representation. These groups are Muslims, Homeboys, Aryans, Bikers, Italians, Latinos, Irish, Christians, Gay and Other. Some have some form of affiliation with one another, such as the Bikers and Aryans, while the Aryans are the enemy of many groups such as the Muslims and the Homeboys. <br /> <br /> In Oswald Penitentary (His official name) there is a policy that not too many members of any ethnic group may be allowed. This is the maximum security prison and the regular prison where sometimes prisoners are sent to or from the show is called "general population" or "gen pop". The main character of the show is Augustus Hill, who also tells the story before and after the main segments, crossed between a documentary type and a biographical one. Hill is tied to wheelchair use because of its unknown past. He is part of the group "others" that contains individuals who do not fit in the other prison gangs. <br /> <br /> Of the many groups it is the smaller ones that can avoid themselves in trouble. of times when the greater is in conflict with each other. There are few of the most notable characters as follows: 1) Ryan O'Reilly is in charge of his fellow Irishmen and somehow he is always voluntarily involved in lethal activity for the weakest link. 2) Miguel Alvarez is the watched Latino who is constantly struggling to handle his popularity within his own gang and with others. 3) Simon Adebesi is the Nigerian who was the former leader of the Homeboys gang. Hes also very physically quite large and solid. These two reasons are why he is one of Oz's strongest residents. 4) Karim Said is the Muslim and Black nationalist who is very defined in his views and desires. He fights for the rights of his people at many levels through the show, from his own Muslim group, to his larger black group and even fights against all the unfair rules of authority for all groups. He characterized somehow identical to Malcom X, the famous Black fighter who was also Muslim. <br /> <br /> All in all, Oz is probably the largest (fictitious prison show or program based on ethnic relationships). If it doesn't sound like your own kind of series is probably not going to be tried out, but if it makes interest, it's definitely worth looking at. The biggest problem with the show is how addictive it is, some may feel wrong viewing lots of this kind of material. Researchers argue whether it is harmful or not, but in the end it is just a reflection of the society of the world in which we live today. This means that it is as an informant and an indicator of the world as an aggressor.
