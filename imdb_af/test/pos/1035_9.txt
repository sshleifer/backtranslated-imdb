I watched this mini in the early eighties. Sam Waterson proved that he was a good actor. In fact, when he started right and order, I was disappointed in him because it wasn't so powerful. Unfortunately, the good roles don't pay the bills. I wish I could get a copy of this rare series and review it. It's both factual and entertaining. Everyone should see it to know what really happened. I was so moved I bought and read the book "Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds". And watch this man become an unlikely hero who has never been rewarded for his insight. If you get a chance, you should see this movie and see what a performance Mr. Waterston really can offer an audience. Enjoy the movies!
