This movie is about Viola (Amanda Bynes) and her search for the school's Cornwell boy team after they kicked the girls' team. So she goes to the competitive school Illaria and joins the boy team. So she falls to Duke (Channing Tatum) who thinks he's an old man and loves Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who loves Viola as her brother. <br /> <br /> I was in a version of the 12th night game and the beginning was very modern. So I knew the scene well. I was very excited about seeing this movie and when I saw it, it exceeded my expectations. It kept many of my favorite lines and I could see great connections with the scene. Although it was like the play, it wasn't that complicated. It was also more of a chick flick than I expected, but it was good. It was very funny. It draws you into a whole lot of crazy love stories and lies. You've seen viola (Amanda Bynes) think wrong about what guys thought and her complications in living in a world of people. You also see her roommate, Duke's (Channing Tatum) impression of this. I really liked seeing the characters portrayed in a modern way. It also tells the modern theme "Follow Your Dreams", but this time it has a twist. I think this movie was a good movie about a girl who loved football and held herself and her family and her dreams. I think this movie will be the big break for many stars.
