I think the filmographic descent may run like that. Pay attention, please, because I had to look it up. In 1967, Peter Yates, a former car racer, founded the English barge drunk "Roof," the most exciting part of which is a car hunt through the streets of London, under alleys where crowds of children play and everything. It's a success. <br /> <br /> A year later, Yates launches "Bullet," with Steve McCool, starring McQueen, with another spectacular motor yacht up and down the San Francisco Hills, with dumbfoundingly authentic engine sounds. It seems to include double clovers, full of races, no dark, twelve-cylinder engines under forty foot-caps, supercharged, super-supercharged and all five thousand horsepower running at full tilt. Many shots of McQueen's gum-cold display with concentration as he tries to push another car off the highway, although a passenger in the other vehicle has a shotgun. The pursuit is performed by Philip D'Antoni. Bill Hopkins is driving the criminal vehicle. <br /> <br /> A year or two later, finding a good thing, Bill Friedkin shows "The French Connection", which raced between a motor vehicle commander (Gene Hackman) and a elevated train in New York City. Many shots of Hackman's cursing face as he grapples the injured car through the streets. The pursuit is performed by Philip D'Antoni. Academic awards follow. <br /> <br /> We feel a good thing, a year or two, we bring the "The Seven Ups" with a chase between a car run by Roy Scheider, with lots of shots of the curse. from Scheider as he tries to knock the other car, which is driven by Bill Hopkins, off the road, although the criminal car definitely has a shotgun passenger. No hills in New York City, just bumps, but they're still sharp enough to lift the cars a few feet. The chased car screeches around a corner and bumps into a street where a dozen children play. Shots of screaming kids scattering the pavement and allowing the car to zoom. But once is not enough. The children immediately walk back into the street and have to repeat the refuge for the pursuing motor vehicles with Scheider. <br /> <br /> I once saw a quest for high speed on the streets of Philadelphia. Both criminals and police drove through the streets about 25 miles an hour. They stopped at every stop sign and red light - very boring things compared to this movie. <br /> <br /> Talk about this movie, it's pretty good. "Roof" and "Bullet" were cool. All dressed neatly. But the New York movies are dirty. There is garbage everywhere and the metro cars are covered with graffiti. Shooting outs and knock-ups take place in unfinished lots surrounded by crumbling brick buildings, or in dumps for industrial freezers. <br /> <br /> The acting is also pretty good. Roy Scheider looks whippet slim. The other actors have faces for the camera, especially Richard Welsh. And the story is tempting, if not completely unknown. What is best about the movie is the way it captures New York City in its almost total indifference to human depravity and nobility. At a funeral, the limo drivers with their dots are standing up, jumping from their mouths kicking their cold feet together, completely bored with the ritual. The film wants us to believe that The Seven Ups is an elite group of untouchable policemen who stop at nothing to get the job done, and here it is a bit sold out. They always seem threatening to do something unethical and illegal - knocking hell out of a suspect or physically damaging a hospital and helplessly hiding, but they always avoid it. (If they actually did, their characters would become lifelike and ambiguous, and we would rather have our heroes and villains of a more biblical nature.) Very enjoyable, even though you have seen them before and you can do it very well . some of his previous incarnations.
