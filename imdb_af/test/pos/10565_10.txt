Wow! Where to start? <br /> <br /> This adaptation of Sarah Waters's third novel is one of my all-time favorite movies !!!!! <br /> <br /> I'm not too big on fiction novels (seriously I never read fiction), but the book is just as FABULOUS as the movie! Or should I say the movie is just as FABULOUS as the book? I just love this story !!!!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I put this three hour movie (2 part series on DVD, 3 part series on TV / book) for about a year and a half. It just didn't look that interesting ... YOU ARE YOU I AM WRONG! <br /> <br /> I immediately immersed in the rich and exciting plot ... totally surprised! Just like the book, you can't stop reading / reading. It understands your attention for the entire 3 hours ... and when it ends ... wish you didn't. <br /> <br /> The story flows just as well and you'll wonder where the time went. <br /> <br /> The lesbian subplot was just icing on the cake! The parts I love most are the subtle facial expressions and tins / eye contact between the two characters. You really feel their desire for each other and yet they can't think of it until they have to. <br /> <br /> May I point out that the lesbian theme is an important part of the movie, of course, the essence of the movie is a truly unexpected love story, but it's definitely not what the whole movie is about . For me this is what makes this story so unique and intriguing. I have never read or heard of such a thing. Sarah Waters is pure genius! <br /> <br /> The turns and turns it takes make you hang on the edge of your seat. Seriously! My hands were stuck on my couch with every surprising plot twist and I even shouted several times ("OH MY GOD! NO GO! THAT WASN'T CLOSED! DID IT?") ... I NEVER DO IT! /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that I wish they'd added more to the book. But of course the adjustment was limited over time, they couldn't add everything I would have wanted. How awful it is ... I think I'm just evenly selfish ... forgive me. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes seem a bit chased. However, they put in all the important pieces where even if you just watch the movie and choose not to read the book, you will be most satisfied with the outcome. <br /> <br /> The actors are just SUPERB! BRILLIANT even! Sally Hawkins (Sue) and Elaine Cassidy (Maud) have such a big screen chemistry that they've steamed up your television set. Simply electric! The emotions ... the despair ... the struggle that each one of them seems to be effortlessly expressed by these wonderfully talented actresses. Rupert Evans plays such a good bad man as the Lord. I found myself every time he got on the screen, but I love it because he's just as damn cute and somehow still charming, even if you want to turn his neck. Imelda Staunton gives another fantastic show like Mrs. Sucksby. She is such a warm-hearted actress that you can't help but loves her ... even when the character she plays is not so nice. Everyone else in the throw was perfect! They represented the characters well and were just as I thought they should be after reading the book. <br /> <br /> It's a must have for any movie buff! Actually, Everyone and everyone should see this movie AND read the book! Chances are you won't be disappointed! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars from me! There are only four other films that I have given the same rating. It's very rare that I really enjoy a movie so much that I give it 10/10. This is one of those movies. Fingertip is really a masterpiece!
