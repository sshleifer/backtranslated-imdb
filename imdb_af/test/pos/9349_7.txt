I saw this movie more than once. It's not the biggest scifi movie I've ever seen, but it's not a bad movie. The acting is good and the characters are more "actually" than most in low budget sci fi. (At least it's not full of dumb bimbos like so many other low budget scifi.) I especially like Elizabeth Pena. She is a good actress and she makes worried single mother as well as any and better than some. <br /> <br /> Don't let the no victories run away. See it yourself and judge it yourself.
