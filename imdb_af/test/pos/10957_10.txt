It should be noted that this movie is not improvised (as you probably think), despite what the title at the end suggests. The film was heavily written and rehearsed. Cassavetes did not have enough money to support the inevitably high production cost of an improvisational type of film, even though he wanted to produce something like that. The improvisation of the movie is contained in the actors' performances and the emotions they draw from the lines. <br /> <br /> That said, let me say it is a beautiful job I "will probably come back again. The depth of emotion that Cassavetes is able to draw from the smallest gestures and interactions is incredible. I have no idea how he could manage such incredible performances from the actors, especially under the circumstances he worked. It is truly a wonderful landmark of film that I recommend to anyone interested in exploring beyond Hollywood.
