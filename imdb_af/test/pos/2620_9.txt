This episode of Charmed has changed everything! The show is about to end this third season, and hell is breaking into this episode. The Charmed people bring an innocent Dr. Griffiths to the manor who protects him from Shax, The Brothers Assassin. When Shax attacks, he blows in as a tornado and then corporealises in his demon skin. He blows Prue throwing a wall that knocks her completely and almost kills her. Then Piper threw what remained of the wall. Phoebe comes from the attic and says the attacks before Shax killed the doctor. But to be the power of one, it didn't hurt him. Leo comes to heal the other sisters and Prue wants to find Shax and really destroy him. Phoebe, meanwhile, is trying to find Cole in the underworld. When Prue and Piper go out into the street to find the devil, the demon finds them. After their struggle, the witches realize that a camera has captured everything! Returning to Manor, trying to fight the media and after Shax's overthrow, a witch went to cookoo shoots Piper. Prue uses her telekinesis to get people out of the way so she can get to the hospital. But they get them too late and Piper dies. And just when Prue is about to be shot, time is returned to where they dr. Bring Griffiths to the Manor. Shax blows in and blows Prue and Piper. But Phoebe is still in the Underworld, so Shax kills the doctor and exits the Manor. When Leo finally comes, he can't heal Prue. Prue is dead and so is the power of three. For now. Personally. this episode was sad. Prue was the headquarters of everyone. I would love to have her power of telekinesis. I really don't think Phoebe would go from the Underworld, because if Shax didn't, Shru wouldn't have killed Prue. But Paige brings back the power of three and I'm happy with the performance's progress
