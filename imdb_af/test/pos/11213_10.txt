People need to learn to see what's on the screen. It's a good movie based on a slow, careful collection of details that serve to establish the personalities of these two men. The passivity of Yusuf (Emin Toprak), the national cousin, is well described by his fear of talking to women. He has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young woman and loses them all. He has many decades of baccalaureurship in front of him, and perhaps also unemployment. <br /> <br /> Mahmut is another case. He came out of the village by working very hard (we think), and his resentment of slackers like Yusuf is tangible (he makes crumbs on the expensive carpet - the slab!). Among other things, we are a group of friends who, among other things, speak to Tarkovsky, and we note that Mahmut regrets - but little regret - that his work has become commercial over the years. The gap between the cousins ​​becomes wider and wider. The mouse fall theme is wonderfully alive, bringing out the compassion and confusion of Yusuf, and the cold-blooded problem solving of Mahmut. <br /> <br /> I am reminiscent of two classic films of men who manage each other's nuts: Les cousins ​​of Chabrol (the rich boy with Hitlerian pretensions played by Brialy's always in my mind) and Kiss of the Spider Woman ( William Hurt can't figure out why everyone is so mean. Nuri Bilge Ceylan takes his place among the dozens of major directors now active. I just hope he will come in the future to trust co-workers, instead of writing and shooting his films himself.
