You can take the rascal out of the joint, but it seems much harder to remove the joint from the jaw. We saw this kind of character in this kind of situation before (and since then): in movies like BOB LE FLAMBEUR, LIFT TO THE GALLOWS, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI, ANDERSON TAPES, etc. Too many times to mention. What helps to make this one of the more striking is (of course) the heist himself who, in real terms, plays without words and the attitude of the lead role. Bogart would think twice before crossing this man. The ironic ending is perfectly suited to this story (it almost demands it). All around, one of the better movies noir.
