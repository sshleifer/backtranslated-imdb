There is much wrong with this movie. I won't lie. I would say that most of the problems are coming from a budget cut out from the bottom of the movie and some bad hacking operations. <br /> <br /> It's not Office Space. Don't enter the levels of comedy in the office space. However, it is very funny. It's a mess, but very funny at the same time. A funny mess of a movie. In the way Caddyshack is funny. A mess of unrelated funny scenes, filled with some very annoying unfunny scenes. <br /> <br /> It works as a whole, and it definitely deserves a wide-ranging issue. This is the best comment on the Wal Mart / Starbucks / MTV nation you can hope for. The fact that a movie explores the idea that stupid people are at a frightening rate while the intelligent people are not, is wonderful in my book. Not very politically correct, but at least worth a debate.
