I still remember Satya for the first time. I was completely blown away. Here was a movie that was very different, like the other Gangster movies I saw. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so credible. Despite "Company" (which was a very good effort) and Vaastav (more focused on the journey of the protagonist) who came close, no underworld movie could ever live to Satya. <br /> <br /> When I first looked at Ab Tak 56, I said to myself: "Indian Cops have their own 'Satya' now. The quote from Nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that Not an ordinary movie, what touches the "encounter" at the beginning of the movie is the relaxed way it is performed, there is a cold and frightening feeling that you realize it's part of their routine <br /> <br /> Ab Branch 56 is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt policeman, but of a policeman who is ready to do what is necessary to get rid of the criminals when All legitimate means have been exhausted, with simple shots and camera angles, director Shimit Amin manages the essence of the characters and gives it a realistic and rough feel to the movie, Editing appears non-existent and therefore effective. impressive and haunting and staying with you long after you leave the movie room. <br /> <br /> But for me, what actually take the cake, are the dialogues and the superlative of every character. Sandeep Srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer. When I start presenting my favorite dialogues, I'm afraid I will rewrite the entire movie script. <br /> <br /> The movie boasts some star performances. Yashpal Sharma is contemptible as Sub-Inspector Imtiaz Siddiqui and so is Jeeva as Joint Commissioner Suchak. Revathi, Hrishita Bhatt, Mohan Agashe and Kunal Vijaykar have small roles that they play to perfection. Nakul Vaid as the newcomer Jatin Shukla was a revelation. The scene where he has to reluctantly shoot the wounded gunman? O my God! He teaches under Sadhu Aghashe's guidance and believes in him. <br /> <br /> Prasad Purandhare as Zameer Zafar is impressive. His conversations with Sadhu are true jewels of dialogue knowledge. Never before in the Indian film has any film brought such a beautiful relationship between a policeman and a gunman. <br /> <br /> Not that I wasn't a fan of Nana Patekar before this movie, but this movie made me a fan of a devoted. Nana as Inspector Sadhu Agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best I have ever seen in the Hindi cinema. From the way he speaks to his expressions, how he taps his cigarette and grinds the tea? It's almost as if Nana can't do anything wrong. He is at his best at every stage, especially when he teaches Jatin about how the police function. His cool and composed way of doing things is sometimes frightening. His dialogue and body language convinced me that he is one of the best actors in the country. It's a pity he didn't win a popular award for this one. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, Shimit Amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and making full use of it until coming up with a modern masterpiece of Indian theater. In an industry that is ill accustomed to raising stories from here and there, Amin takes an original writing and brings it to life with beautiful treatment. I just hope that he will continue the great work and not give Bollywood entertainment! If he can do that, he is sure he will be a force to be reckoned with in the years to come.
