Hayao Miyazaki captured the imagination of audiences young and old all over the world, and his latest film art is "Ponyo", a children's story that lends itself to the story elements of The Little Mermaid. Of course, like other Miyazaki classics such as "Spirited Away" and his last film, "Howl's Moving Castle", "Ponyo" is full of creativity that can only be appreciated by adults, but clearly more of a children's story than those recent attempts . It's a magical story that is best described as beautiful and lovely, with a view to charm rather than conflict. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" is the story of a bug-eyed childish fish of the same name, the daughter of a submarine wizard, who desires to escape the sea and become a girl. When she does, she quickly befriends a young boy named Sosuke. In the process she gets a strong magic and throws the world out of balance between land and sea and a huge storm drowns most of the stone town, where Sosuke lives with his mother and threatens to end the world. /> <br /> Like Walt Disney's Moving Castle, Walt Disney picked up Ponyo for a US release, and has convinced it with an impressive variety of Western voices. Even the choice of home-made products in the younger brothers and sisters of the Disney group, Jonas Brothers (Frankie Jonas) and Miley Cyrus (younger sister Noah) respectively Sosuke and Ponyo. Tama Fey (Lisa, Sosuke's mother), Matt Damon (Sosuke's father), Cate Blanchett (Ponyo's sea goddess mother) and a trio of hilarious elderly women are played by Betty White, as well as Liam Neeson (Fujimoto, Ponyo's father ) Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. The effort is definitely there to make this film for American audiences and Disney gets close. <br /> <br /> But voices are of little interest in a Miyazaki movie, all about visual creativity. A fan of transformations and the movement of fluid and fluid movement, creates a fairy tale that is partly submerged, should be a joy for Miyazaki to work with and perhaps even his whole motivation for choosing this story. Amongst the highlights are drops of water that send Fujimoto to Ponyo, which moves like live waves, as well as a variety of other beautiful sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes, making Ponyo another Miyazaki movie. <br /> <br /> However, as a children's story, "Ponyo" concentrates on his efforts to be worshiped. The discovery of true friendship and love between Sosuke and Ponyo is heart-warming, even if Noah Cyrus screams childishly when Ponyo excites human life, it can be a little annoying. But as wonderful as many of the imaginative elements and loving relationships, there is very little antagonism or danger. Last Miyazaki films have distinct villains, but the conflict in "Ponyo" actually shrinks as the story goes. Sosuke believes that he lost his mother at one point and in the background is the idea that the world is going out of the shit and that people should be ashamed to pollute the sea, but "Ponyo" is mostly free of tension. Most sharp, its climax is inevitable despite how common all the characters are. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> will satisfy Miyazaki's fans in all respects with his imagination, and newcomers will still by its simple but visual touch. ambitious storytelling, but clearly more of a children's movie, best for families and others who love fantasy, regardless of its form or target audience. It is not quite what you would expect from Miyazaki to consider his recent work, but it is certainly remembered as one of his beloved stories. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my website at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
