Although many sound recordings by great musicians such as Jascha Heifetz survive, the film or television record is indeed limited. That's why musical offerings like "They must have music" are so rare jewels. While, with modern eyes and ears, one can swarm over the plot, the acting viewer must place these unique delicacies in their proper perspective. The plot is designed to appeal to both young and old audiences of the era, but it remains nice to this day. An important aspect of the experience of watching classic movies is seeing them through the movie maker of that era. <br /> <br /> I have to take a reviewer complaining about a movie in black and white or obliged to report that their students print such discussions. These are young complaints that reflect a limited historical perspective. For the teacher, it should provide an educational opportunity to explain the unique features of black and white photography and its place in film history. In fact, color can get in the way of a good story or the music. For example, the black and white photography of John Ford's "Stagecoach" is, like the stills of Ansel Adams, an artistic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> As far as Heifetz as wood is concerned, I could no longer differ. If you want a blatant emotional attitude, go to a rock concert. The role of a classical musician such as Heifetz is to move the audience, not himself or herself. Heifetz's emotion is conveyed by his play, not by his body language. He had a rare ability to extract every emotional nuance from the music and convey it to his listeners. This is the listener who has to be moved, not the artist. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, a reviewer asked to see Heifetz on YouTube playing the first move of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concert, with Frank McHugh in the audience. It is from the 1947 film Carnegie Hall, not "They Must Have Music" Carnegie Hall is an even bigger treasure of many good classical artists. We are blessed that there were film producers who at least chose to portray these artists in these limited cases. In was another era that is not completely overwhelmed by the lowest common share split we get today.
