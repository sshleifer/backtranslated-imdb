Messiah was a compulsive performance from the beginning to the end. The story centered in various horrific ways on seemingly random men's murders in London. DCI Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) must find the truth that is a little closer to home than he might think. <br /> <br /> Gripping drama and Ken Stott were brilliant. Hopefully we haven't seen the last DCI Red Metcalfe.
