I really like this show. It rolled drama, romance and comedy in one. I'm 28 and I'm a married mother, so I can identify with both Lorelei and Rory's experiences in the show. I've mostly watched the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I'm not up to date. I think women want this show more than men, but I know some men will enjoy it outside! I really like it for an hour and not half an hour because it looks like the hour is flying when I see it! Give it a chance if you've never seen the show! I think Lorelei and Luke are my favorite characters on the show, but mainly because of the way they are with each other. How could you not see that there was something there (or so long to see it I think I should say)? <br /> <br /> Happy viewing!
