Boogie Nights follows a theme that is very well known to gangster movies (although not in the genre itself) - the rise and fall. We see the rise of several individuals, some of them of complete darkness, to attain great heights ... and then to fall down from grace because of their excesses. <br /> <br /> I believe this is the first feature by author / director Paul Thomas Anderson, and that's a great start! I have seen elements of other directors' influences, such as Robert Altman, but the film holds its own in originality and plot development. <br /> <br /> Character development is the movie's finest feature. I have really identified with all the characters and feel their pain and their success with them. All the performances were brilliant. (It was especially good to see a small part performed by real porn veteran Nina Hartley). <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie combines comedy and tragedy. This is one of the best films of 1997, which was killed at the Oscars (probably due to the "racy" - as they would say - subject and the general conservatism of the Academy).
