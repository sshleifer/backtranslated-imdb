Whoever casts this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for them, and they all do an excellent job in their parts. This is a good look at what life was before and during the civil war, the difference between the rich, the average whites and the black people. The story gives you some insights about the real problems of the era, and the problems inherent in daily life in those days. The storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the whole movie. There are characters that you will fall in love with, there are characters you will hate, and you will engage yourself emotionally. <br /> <br /> Both my wife and I loved it and we'll look at it again in a few years, I'm sure.
