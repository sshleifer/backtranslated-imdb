So many early British audio movies I watched on video suffer from poor print quality or poor sound or both. Fortunately, I could get a copy of this movie on a quality video so I could focus on the story myself. <br /> <br /> It was an excellent story. At first sight, the passengers on the bad bus looked like a very boring lot (except for the always lovely Jessie Matthews). But when the film showed every passenger's story the day before the accident, I discovered that the role, unlike the initial look, was a talented group of artists who were skillfully geared to a true individuality to their distinctive characteristics bring . <br /> <br /> Viewers can have different preferences about which two passengers will end up with a tragic end and which one will survive. But the movie holds your interest because it keeps you guessing. This movie deserves a much bigger audience - a real gem of the early British cinema.
