"Japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own", while it may be true, it applies to everyone except for one thing, that is, ..... Major League baseball .... but not to worry not to be. , "Mr Baseball" is there to try to change everything. But just who will change who is the part of the movie that really rocks it! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and shines in his comedic roles. The storyline can be true in life, but the subplot is dead. The Japanese people are a gentle, respectful person with ways and traditions that are very different from those of Western society. All these elements and obstacles combine to make for one truly enjoyable, funny movie. It's definitely worth the watch!
