Somebody definitely did it to The Wind and I can't believe that what I've seen on the screen is very much about it. It's a better and more solid movie than most of the independents I watch all year round. The cinematography shows a true love and mastery of the vessel and the casting was just fine. I'd like to see more of these people, especially Zeke Rippy. <br /> <br /> As far as the story and the writing are concerned, I'm not so sure that the negative comments made by this post were written with the intention of providing information to anyone else about the movie. The long stretched nit-picky bashing posts that had taken hours to compile and are the only comment ever made by any reviewer on this site are clear defamation on the producers of the movie. I don't know the inside story, but it will probably make a good movie. What I know of being this biz is that productions that are trying to make everyone happy are usually awful and when the filmmaker has the courage, drive and common sense to kill the babies, someone always ends up with sore feelings . It's also part of the Biz, and one of the best learning tools available to those who are truly committed to making it into the movie business. Of course, the failures have nothing better to do than to sit at home and write fake reviews on the internet as a form of vendetta to those who have caught them (read: were honest and truth with them). And it's my best guess to explain the nasty, nasty reviews. As far as there is a truth grain behind it all, there is a point to be made, but these grains are so overbearing that it becomes obviously fictitious. <br /> <br /> It's not a slasher massacre if that's what you're looking for, it's more the psychological suspense thriller, which is typically not appreciated by the lowest common denominators out there. The best way to see this movie is to try, pin down and unfold any idea of ​​the past - seriously, characters are defined by their actions and words and when you see what these people are doing and what they say, I don't think you can get away with the conclusion that these characters are poorly developed. Poorly understand maybe. <br /> <br /> Overall, I agree it's a nice, compelling movie. Perhaps I wouldn't have given it a normal 9 under normal circumstances, but the serious negative comment actually attracted me to the picture (I have a secret love for a very bad theater). For me, the ratings below 5 should be reserved for the shocky, improper, poorly acted and foolishly written movies. None of these apply here - it is quality filmmaking with some real talent there. I gave it the nine to push the scales back in the right direction. Watch the movie and tell me I'm wrong.
