This is classic 80's humor. If you were a teenager in the 80's, it was a summer hit to watch. It was an early look at the now superstars. This and better of death is just fun and silly movies to sit back and enjoy. Everyone admits that they had a crazy summer when they were a teenager. Even crazy family and friends like these characters. Introducing some of these characters was so much fun. The crazy uncle puts a wake-up call on a radio waiting to win a million dollars, the grandmother who just keeps the granddaughter and afterwards gives the kids an account, the twin brothers who don't look like anything and hoopz to meet lots of fun. It should not be won from an award, but it is just a fun movie to be lost in one afternoon.
