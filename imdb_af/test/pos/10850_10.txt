I love this movie. I watched it over and over when I rented it from Netflix. It had a lot of substance and meaning to me. I think many people will enjoy it. I have read and seen quite a few lesbian stories over the years and am happy to say they are getting better and better at how they are presented. They tend to have a more positive sense of lifestyle. and feel gay women.Its nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this society. I think it's clear that more and more movies with this theme will enjoy our theaters and TV screens. Many producers and directors are aware that Lesbians are very full and healthy lives and that we have wonderful stories that can be seen and seen by individuals and families alike.
