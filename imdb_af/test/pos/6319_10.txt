While this movie may not have been the next evil one (hell knows maybe it will, it was just for a year out). It is worth the effort. Don't expect a $ 10m movie. cuz you will be disappointed. DOEN expect to be fun, laugh and enjoy the experience. All in all this movie is much better than many, if not all the low budget horror movies out there. I watched movies that spent more than 10 or 20 times that cost to make this movie and come out. The effort by far in this movie weighs on the setback that it faces by having a limited budget. Movies are meant to be entertained, and this movie makes it sure. In fact, this movie can even open new doors for you to watch movies. It's available on Netflix if it's not your local video rental store. So look at it, then decide.
