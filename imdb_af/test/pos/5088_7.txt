Continuing with the exclusive movie program on complex relationships in some European courts, was shown last night in the Schloss theater "Anna Boleyn", a film led by the great Teutonic film director, Herr Ernst Lubitsch. The film shows the terrible story of the Queen Consortium of British King Henry VIII. She was executed by her husband (well, not exactly the king ordered the officers to do his dirty work) not to mention that this marriage caused a major political and religious historical event, the English Reformation. <br /> <br /> The movie stars Dame Henny Porten, Germany's first screen superstar during the early years and Herr Emil Jannings, Germany's fastest actor in the quiet era. Both play their characters appropriately; Lady Porten as an innocent aristocrat who is increasingly interested in the power of court and her. Jan Jannings offers as the unscrupulous, whimsical and feminine British monarch, a character highly suited to this German actor who is the exuberance and excessive personality of the character himself. <br /> <br /> In the early film era, Herr Lubitsch was renowned for his outstanding costume films, colossal productions with huge budgets ("Anna Boleyn" costs about 8 million points, a fortune even for this German score) that takes great care beautiful decorations, as can be seen during the coronation process in the Westminster Abbey scene, which employed 4,000 extras. Temporary Germans of the time were used, causing revolutionary workers to make a fuss when German President Friedrich Ebert visited the set during filming. . <br /> <br /> Apart from the spectacle, one of the most important aspects of this and every film by Herr Lubitsch, even during his epic era, I have seen the complex relationship between the main characters. We experience a game of different interests, dual meanings, and the intricate art of flirting, but being treated lightly only ends in a tragedy. The importance of those historical facts is brought in an effective way, but Lubitsch is really more interested in the changing relationship between Henry VIII and Anna Boleyn. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, temporarily take my leave because this German Count must make sure one of his fat and rich heirs doesn't lose her head for this Teutonic aristocrat. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http: // ferdinandvongalitzien. blogspot.com/
