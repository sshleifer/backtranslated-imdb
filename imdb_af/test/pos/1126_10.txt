... I can't believe I was immediately addicted to this show after seeing the first scene, I was deep in it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the first is the guys Cappy, Evan, Calvin, Fischer, Cappy, Heath, Cappy, etc. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the girls are cute, sexy, smart and are not afraid to be called tits. I like that. Which at the same time does not make them mean and greedy, just realistic. <br /> <br /> Third, relationships are so great, especially Casey and Cappy. Lately, every show turns away from the original road and people end up with someone who wasn't even in the first season. Cappy and Casey's relationship is true love, a kind of expensive. They kept each other apart and it didn't end when a guest star appeared. <br /> <br /> In today's world, it might be amazing that two people have long since kept each other apart, but it happens. And people define each other in college so I knew exactly who I wanted to be at college. Just like Casey and Cappy. <br /> <br /> I hope there are many more seasons of this show and I hope we can see the relationship between Casey and CAPPY and it will probably stay at Thanksgiving. Keep this show up
