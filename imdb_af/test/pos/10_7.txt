If you asked me how the movie was throughout the movie, I would have told you it was great! However, I left the theater unsatisfied. After thinking about it, I believe the problem was the end of the end. I feel that the majority of the film moved so slowly, and then the end developed very quickly. So, I would say the end left me disappointed. <br /> <br /> I thought the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher portrayed their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act! Also, the different relationships between the characters were very real. Furthermore, I thought the different plot lines were well developed. Overall, it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing it. <br /> <br /> Finally: Good characters, Big plot, Poorly written / modified end. Still, go see it !!!
