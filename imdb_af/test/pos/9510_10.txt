This is the best movie I watched this year! Excellent detail and storyline (for a remake). <br /> <br /> It offers you a "what if" situation in which the island of Japan can be completely eradicated from this earth. A mind-boggling, life and death situation and not to mention all life on earth (indeed in this particular Japan). It also offers a great and ingenious solution to this massive tragedy. <br /> <br /> Horror, action, suspense, science, documentary, love story and all the interest in the human interest you can find will find everything here! But I also warn you that this is a real tearjerker! The movies, actors and everyone are all excellent, better than any Hollywood movie! <br /> <br /> The thing is ... it can really happen anywhere on earth! Let me ask you now after you see it ... "What will you do if you are confronted with this life and death situation?
