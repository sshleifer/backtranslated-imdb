Why do I give this 1974 porn movie 7 points? Because I watched it. And I found it hilarious! Strangers, their strange spaceship, their strange helmets ... my God, it was a face. And all that these desperate foreign women need is semen of the earth. <br /> <br /> And where are they looking? In Bavaria, Germany. And that's where the main fun comes from: In Europe (and more in German-speaking countries), Bavaria is seen as a traditional and backward region. And then the actors are so helpless with the alien women. Well, there are movies about people who can't deal with women like the American Pie series. <br /> <br /> But what this movie has achieved is a real weirdness. You are constantly wondering how they do this cracking potion. But it was 1974, and looking back 35 years fills one with a kind of nostalgia. You've never seen such a movie. <br /> <br /> And if you don't mind seeing casual hair and breasts, watch it once. It's a comedy in essence, not a porn movie.
