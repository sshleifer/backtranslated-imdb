Scooby Doo and the monster of Mexico were undoubtedly the worst of modern Scooby Doo animated features. Loch Ness Monster is a significant improvement. <br /> <br /> This time the gang goes to Scotland to see the Highland Games and visit Blake Castle, Daphne's ancestral home. And you don't know, the castle comes in the 'spicy' fishing village of Drumnadrochit, on the banks of Loch Ness. <br /> <br /> During their stay, they meet some interesting people. First there is Fiona Pembrooke, a scientist who drowned all her money to find the Loch Ness Monster. <br /> <br /> Sir Ian Locksley, head of the National Heritage Museum of Scotland, is a strong believer in Nessie. <br /> <br /> The Haggarts, its own a cozy inn on the banks of the Loch. The boys are some local jokers, always in disaster. <br /> <br /> Del Chilman, a wild, paranoid hippie man who is convinced that the monster is out and will stop at nothing to find her. <Br /> <br /> And finally, Duncan MacGubbin, the dockmaster who watched Nessie too much to count. <br /> <br /> Most of these characters are stereotypes, which are a bit annoying as it teaches younger audiences a little shit and gives the wrong impression. But if you can make yourself immune, you'll be fine. To get off Scotland, I can't help but at the terrible Scottish accent. Fact: We don't sound like that. <br /> <br /> Soon Nessie, who rather looks demonic than "ordinary," appears, causing havoc. The gang seems to have another riddle on their hands. The usual pursuit scenes, clues and Shaggy's crazy disguises follow. There is a lot of laughter. The animation is beautiful, with some atmospheric scenes and places. And the plot is much better than Monster or Mexico. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing this time is the music. I miss Louis Febre's score and the songs here are also rotten. Where is the Hex Girls when you need it? <br /> <br /> The region 2 DVD is in crystal clear 1.78: 1 anamorphic widescreen (the region 1 is not) with Dolby 5.0 sound. Some okay extras are included. Definitely worth getting.
