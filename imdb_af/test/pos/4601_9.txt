This movie was quite a pleasant surprise. I've been expecting it for a long time and was scared to go so it couldn't meet my expectations. <br /> <br /> It exceeded them. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. . <br /> <br /> Nice from start to finish (stay up to the end!), it is absolutely remarkable how a movie about stupid and annoying characters can be as intelligent, spiritual and engaging. <br /> <br /> With the obvious carpet paintings, the movie's future Earth reminds the Planet of the Apes series and other Sci-Fi movies of that era. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie is essentially the planet of the monkeys, but with people who are the spiritual equivalent of apes. <br /> <br /> It moves pretty fast, and Luke Wilson carries the movie very well, with a character reminiscent of the one he called in "Bottle Rocket". . "<br /> <br /> Maya Rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former" painter "who has also been frozen. <br /> <br /> Despite all its strengths," Idiocracy "has the clear sense of a movie taken from the director / editor before it can be fine-tuned. <br /> <br /> I can't understand for life why a movie would just make this funny in a few theaters are dumped with no advanced performances, no trailers, no marketing whatsoever. <br /> <br /> It is as if the studio has decided that they will no longer spend on it and just walk away. <br /> < Or maybe they thought the movie had the cultures of a cult classic, and the only way to become a true cult classic was to fail it? <br /> <br /> Whatever the case, it's a pity, because Mike Judge and especially this movie deserve better. <br /> <br /> I predict this movie will have real bones on DVD and a word of mouth s all this compels the success it deserves. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the Fox drivers saw themselves in the characters, confused and thought it was a documentary?
