Rita Hayworth is right there where she should be - as a "Cover Girl" in this 1944 Technicolor movie which is also genl. Gene Kelly, Phil Silvers, Eve Arden, Lee Bowman and Otto Kruger are. Rita plays a beautiful show girl, Rusty, who works at a small club owned by the man she loves, Danny (Kelly). Every Friday they go out for oysters with Genius (Silvers), the club comedian. They all hate oysters, but they are looking for a pearl. When they find one, all three will have luck. They believe. <br /> <br /> Quiet auditions and win the role of cover girl for a magazine - she started before the other contestants because the magazine owner (Kruger) sees a deal between Rusty and the girl he once loved, what seems to be Rusty's grandmother. As soon as she becomes the cover girl, opens the world to her and her dreams of appearing on Broadway become true. Danny wants her to have her success, but at the same time realizes he has lost her. <br /> <br /> "Cover Girl" has overwhelming dance numbers and songs by Jerome Kern, with Rita dubbed by Martha Mears. Rita plays best with her both Rusty in the past and her grandmother in the past. For such a sexy, desirable, beautiful woman, she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of dominant men. Neither of them ever showed on the screen, nor did she want to be a movie star. She is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life. Gene Kelly plays a serious role here, but gets many chances to dance and sing. Phil Silvers is very encouraging and funny as the in-house comic and best friend. <br /> <br /> It's a very good movie without dull spots. The only problem I had was the idea that Rusty should choose between a successful career and the man she loved. When the supermodel Jinx Falkenberg, who plays herself in the movie, talks about marriage, she is warned by her boss that she is not essential to the modeling business. We are not told if Rusty is continuing with her career or going to work at Danny's - but all the signs showed to the Brooklyn club. Why couldn't she both have? Still, you can't beat 'Cover Girl' for the best of entertainment, beautiful color, beautiful music, good energy, fine performances, and its most wonderful asset, the glorious Rita Hayworth.
