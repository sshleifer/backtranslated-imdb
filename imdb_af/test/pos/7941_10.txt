When I saw this movie about 6 months ago, I considered it interesting, but little more. But it got stuck with me. That interest has grown and grown, and I wondered if my initial boredom and reaction had more to do with the real VHS quality rather than the movie itself. I bought the Criterion DVD set, and it turned out I was right the second time. Alexander Nevsky is a good movie. It's exciting, and I'm sure it succeeded in its main purpose: propaganda against the Germans. <br /> <br /> This is the most common criticism of this film, and against Eisenstein, that it is just propagandist and nothing else. This is untrue. He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important who ever lived. By now, the world is far enough away from Joseph Stalin to see Eisenstein's films as art.
