Explore this movie as it does not create a whole new genre with perfect imperfection --- hilarious, truth, fun, talent and circumstances that make MAGIC. <br /> <br /> From creative musical numbers to the cuff comedy that includes the best actors, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought there was an extensive writing here. <br /> <br /> what you get: a mighty wind meets conversations with God meet something so fresh and new and beautiful that it becomes a separate entity. <br /> <br /> Peters and both delivered stellar performances and instantly made use of you. The rest of the cast is also phenomenal. there are no small parts ... just small actors, and everyone involved, should be put on the back, taken out for dinner and considered for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Well done!
