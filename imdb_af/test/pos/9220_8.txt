Um, hello. Rainbow Brite. The name alone is difficult to take seriously, as she may be the cousin of Strawberry Shortcake. But if you're a kid, it's definitely serious stuff. <br /> <br /> So, there is this dirty, mushy, spoiled girl and she wants Rainbow Brites belt, including the light of the whole universe, and Rainbow Brite and her friend Cris are determined to stop her. As I recall, Murky and Lurky had a small role in this production. Maybe they wanted too much money? <br /> <br /> Anyway, snotty, evil girl has a powerful jewel and she can do it right to take Rainbow's belt. Imagine? But somehow Rainbow gets her belt back and re-activates it with "star sprinkles" and kicks the bad girls' buttocks with the help of Cris and his prism bracelet, and they also save the whole universe in the process. <br /> <br /> So good triumph over evil, beauty triumph over rudeness, and Rainbow Brite and the Color Kids are once again safe to spread color and joy for all mankind.
