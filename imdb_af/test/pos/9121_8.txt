I love a movie that mixes the tension of the seat, laughs, style, good acting, and a bit of self-pity. Hitchcock kept doing it all the time and in "Le Cercle rouge" Jean-Pierre Melville did the same. I was sorry when this long movie ended. <br /> <br /> I agree with the English commentary that has commented on one of my compatriots' chauvinistic. I love French movies, Italian movies, English movies, Indian movies - and the increasingly rare American movies. I also felt the writer who posted the film because he wasn't even a good copy of a US gun movie, completely missed the point. But I think it's like jazz: either you get it, or you don't know, so why waste time explaining. <br /> <br /> Just watch "Le Cercle noir" and be prepared to be fun.
