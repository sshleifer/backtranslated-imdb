Television in 1982, from a Los Angeles production, is probably the best example of a filmed stage music you're likely to experience. Issued on DVD in 2004 in a remastered digital transmission, it is quite stunning. Hearn and Lansbury give the performances of their lives and the rest of the players are naturally trapped in the power generated. Of course it is Sondheim's music and lyrics that make it possible. If anyone doubts that he is one of the "groats" of the American Musical form, listen to it. The sets are sturdy, as it fits the plot, and smart to make the fast-paced scene changes possible and the cameras capture the action without eliminating the fact that it is a stage production. A central, movable and rotatable platform is Mrs. Lovett's cake shop, with the barber shop upstairs. Around it are various gantries and moving stairs to make the rest of the action happen. The cruel story of injustice leading to revenge, murder and murder is very spicy with dark humor and comic moments. Sondheim does for hairdressing shops that Hitchcock did for showers! An important work in American music theater is given here to give an electrical performance.
