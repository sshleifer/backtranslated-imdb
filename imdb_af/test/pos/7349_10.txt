Viva La Bam was one of the ways I didn't have a high expectation before I saw it, and I never even knew it until I saw my friend. I thought Jackass was pretty funny, but the stunts were just that, funny and I never really got into the show. When I first watched Viva La Bam, it was the opposite effect, I loved it. It felt more of a TV show, which has many of the "Reality Shows" today. I was addicted and I wanted to see what new scheme they would cook for each episode. All the way to the last episode has kept my interest and although some of the ideas sometimes looked, it always had a newer and funny twist. Viva La Bam is one of those shows that makes you hook and I still have another show that looks just like it.
