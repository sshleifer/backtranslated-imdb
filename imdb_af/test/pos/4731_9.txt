Many people remember the long-standing Waco dismissal. What most people probably have embedded in their minds is the "cult leader" David Koresh and the images of the compound burned to the ground after a long distortion. Many people have the belief that Koresh was a kind of man who thought he was God. He was accused of being a child molester and credited for the interruption and death of his followers. In addition, many people feel the cult committed suicide when the FBI stormed Mount Carmel and then burned the building. Most people feel the cult is guilty because they have not agreed with the FBI with reasonable conditions. Most people feel the cult has been brainwashed by Koresh and followed with everything he said. Nothing can come further from the truth, because of strong evidence after the nightmare was over, and this one-of-a-kind documentary proves it pretty much !! <br /> <br /> This documentary document is one of the most balanced exams on the situation. It is very thorough and very detailed than most people in the mainstream media have received. For the shock of many, this documentary will reveal that the ATF, the FBI and the higher levels of the US government were unfair, cruel and misleading, and not David Koresh and his followers. What Korseh and David's did was just to protect their constitutional rights, and the higher powers violated and raped the rights completely. The AFT had no grounds to storm the connection; It was the AFT that shot first and they shot some of the helicopters from unarmed men, women and children! What's even more shocking is the actions of the FBI when they entered Mount Carmel. Look it up for yourself and you will develop a new perspective on the US government. There are infrared footage that clearly shows that the FBI shot machine guns at men, women and kids in the burning compound. It will boil your blood. It will really make you angry. This will make you wonder what kind of people this country is managing. Finally, it will make you wonder how you are told the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This video is scary and I highly recommend it if you can find it. This documentary need not be purchased; it can be watched for free on google video!
