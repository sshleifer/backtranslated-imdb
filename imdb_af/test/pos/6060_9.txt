Jack Webb is playing a Marine Corp drilling instructor in the D.I. Webb. Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough but fair Marine, whose job it is to prepare young teens for possible battles. No one could have played this role better, Jack Webb. As a former Marine, I can assure you that it is the most accurate movie dealing with basic training in the Corp. Extremely entertaining!
