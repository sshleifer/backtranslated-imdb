After many years I saw this beautiful love story again and thought how I would respond half a century ago to a movie that made so many girls cry and sigh when I was just a male adolescent trying to understand women's behavior , in a small city in Brazil. <br /> <br /> This time, however, it caught my attention in the movie. It was something very different, namely the insistence with which the doctor dr. Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) announces her special ethical condition as a Eurasian to journalist Mark Elliott (William Holden). In fact, she constantly focuses on this point in their relationship and reiterates that she is willing to accept her love for him and enter it in an "occidental way", provided that she does not betray her Chinese side. It seems to the spectator that Suyin eagerly tries to establish a very subtle reconciliation between the two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture, as they will act immediately in the open conflict in her mind at least a failure in her attempts at them. to control. <br /> <br /> So does Suyin's attitude always leave poor Elliott? a solid, brave and extremely practical man ?? anxious and confused, without knowing how important it is to give her words. For him, whose love for her is simple and simple, the situation is quite clear: if we love one another, let's make a few and start a life right away. "Not so fast" is what she looks, verbally and non-verbally, to always answer him. <br /> <br /> Suyin's Chinese section will never allow her such a level of pragmatism. And as she goes further on strengthening this multi-pointed balance between the two worlds within herself, she has often told him that a very peculiar characteristic of Chinese culture is deep in her mind, namely the constant "attacks" on the real world through invisible beings from a spiritual or non-physical world. Because Suyin always makes Elliott aware of how dangerous life is, not because of any objective and concrete threat (such as continued English colonialism or the eminence of a Japanese invasion), but because of the threats of very cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical creatures about the poor, terrible and vulnerable people. <br /> <br /> In fact, a lot of Chinese deities seem to be on the watch permanently to make people's lives miserable. As a result, mothers have to dress their precious male babies in girls' clothes so that they are not taken away by jealous gods; Everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away, to prevent them from covering the moon's eyes; Farmers are advised to shout aloud: "The rice is bad! The rice is bad!" to protect their crops from stolen deities; and in a funeral it is recommended that the dead's family be isolated from other people's curtains so that the gods do not benefit from their grief and fragility. <br /> <br /> In other words, Suyin introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence, as if a rather disturbing pantheon of malignant and sadistic gods is always about to affect the most banal acts in anyone's daily life. <br /> <br /> As the story happened in Hong Kong in 1949, it should be clear that China was actually a semi-feudal society at the time, while the country from which Elliott came was not yet dominated by fiery capitalism launched in 1973 by the US to the first oil cook, controlled the whole world. Therefore, at least in one aspect, both sides of Suyin's Eurasian personality were much more innocent than they would be today. <br /> <br /> Much history has emerged since those old days. As far as China is concerned, the fact that after several stages of a communist regime the country has described the state of a very aggressive economy much more than state capitalism over the past two decades. And what happened to the old spirituality that surprised Suyin so much in Hong Kong in 1949 and with which she impressed so much a passionate Elliott under the tree on the hill behind the hospital? It's gone, completely gone! In short, if the story happened today, Elliott would not need to go to China to suggest Suyin in the presence of the Third Uncle and her whole family. In fact, both men would now be relentlessly closer to each other, in their great pragmatism, to talk things as usual!
