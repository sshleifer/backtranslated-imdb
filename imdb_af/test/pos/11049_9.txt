And with the words, one of the big movie publicity campaigns came to a conclusion. "Garbo Talks" and she spoke the words in her first sound film, an adaptation of the Eugene O'Neil play Anna Christie. <br /> <br /> Unlike other players and other studios, MGM took great care to find the right vehicle for Greta Garbo. Many players who were good at the universal medium of silent movie would lose their careers due to talkies. Their heavy indigenous accents would get in the way, some didn't know English. <br /> <br /> It was no coincidence that Anna Christie was chosen for Garbo. First, it was written by one of America's foremost playwrights, which was the kind of literary stuff she would have appealed to. Secondly, since the title role was someone who was Swedish, the accent could be explained. Eventually, a lot of kinks from early talks were worked out, although Anna Christie still made use of title cards. <br /> <br /> Like most of O'Neil's work, it is short on action, but long and deep characterization. The story takes place on the New York waterfront, where Garbo, like Anna, came with her father, George Marion. Marion went to the sea years ago when Anna was a baby and Marion left his wife. Anna had to do what she could to survive in the adult world, and that included prostitution. <br /> <br /> Of course, Marion is happy to see her, he even kicks off Marie Dressler, the old waterfront crown where he lives. with years to make room for his flesh and blood. Of course, both Marion and Garbo adapted their problems, not made easy if they gave shelter to a sailor played by Charles Bickford. He gives Garbo a nice feeling. <br /> <br /> Marion repeats its role of the original Broadway production. The role of Anna on stage was done by Pauline Lord. Anna Christie ran on Broadway for 177 appearances in the 1921-22 season. It is one of O'Neil's best-known works and one that is regularly revived. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garbo's performance with perfect diction, even with a Swedish accent, was praised and her future in sound films ensured. Greta Garbo received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and the film also has nominations for Clarence Brown as Best Director and William Daniels for Cinematography. Daniels must get a lot of kudos for the way he photographed the water front tones. And Brown created the atmosphere around the waterfront where the movie was set. <br /> <br /> Eugene O'Neil's work is timeless, so Anna Christie, even with many bumps of early audio movies, doesn't do the way many movies are from that era. Garbo also shows that she has mastered the subtlety needed to work in the sound medium. Anna Christie is a classic, all around.
