There are two ways to make a TV series in a movie. <br /> <br /> The first, most common and least successful one is to basically make a TV episode of a feature - see the disasters of Steptoe & Son Fliek. The second is to do something else - something completely different, Ã  la Monty Python. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the creators of the cult TV series went for the second option, and they made something unique. , smart and funny - it can't feel any less like a TV episode. <br /> <br /> Try to get your head on this - the authors play themselves, are confronted by their Royston Vasey alter egos, played, of course, by them, and said to continue writing the series, otherwise apocalypse will hit the town. <br /> <br /> High concept, faced and easy to screw on? Yes, but they managed to pull it off. Not for every taste, maybe, and end, but fans will be happy, and it can even win over the uninitiated.
