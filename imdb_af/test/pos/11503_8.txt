This movie is incredibly free of storytelling. It's a pure experience where the music overshadows the visual impression. - Words, of course, cannot express enough that need to be expressed, but it is the requirement of the conversational classes that take place in the middle of mediocrity and therefore a necessity to express any meaningful thoughts or opinions on something that must not tolerated by chatter. Therefore, these expanded views are suggested to satisfy the empty thoughts that need to be filled by sound that you will not find how hard you try in this movie.
