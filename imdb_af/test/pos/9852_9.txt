I heard so long about this documentary that I knew I had to take the time to see it. As a documentary, it is very well done, as it takes a neutral, striking view of their experience. There is no voice surplus or interview. It's honest. It is true. It is also humiliating. Two comments really stayed with me after the movie was done. One was how the boys were told not to be like American boys wearing the pants, and how in Africa there was time, but no money, but in America there was money but no time. The biggest impact was how the boys were hungry for education, and how one of the boys had moved completely, so he could go to school. I watched this movie with a high school company that said it upset him to see how the boys were brought to their new life without any real orientation to America. He also said he knew so many American teenagers that simply could not appreciate how their lives were in America. I agree with him on both accounts. A strong film that will make one think of many things.
