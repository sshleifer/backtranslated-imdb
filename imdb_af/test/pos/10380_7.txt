NVA combines oostalgia humor, military comedy and teenage movie. Although it is somehow typically German movie-like sentimental, I think it's a big and very funny movie. Not only will you laugh at NVA, but also get some insight into the East German armed forces of the late 1980s and how the young recruits as well as the professional soldiers will fall the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of German Democratic Republic. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy NVA if you like Sonnenallee (another film directed by Leander Hau√ümann), but not necessarily if you enjoy Good Bye Lenin which is much more serious and less obviously funny . <br /> <br /> The play is acceptable. But look at former son-singer Kim Frank, who has only two facial expressions: natural and shocked saucer eye!
