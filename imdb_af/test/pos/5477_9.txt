It's one of the few movies of this type I've reviewed and enjoyed. While Clint Eastwood is his usual self, the overall story works well even in Washington DC. <br /> <br /> The theme: A killer follows the president and there is only one person who can save him. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to make a movie that enjoys audiences of this time, in this arena. This movie passes on different levels. Eastwood is his regular underplayed hero who wants to save the president since the Kennedy era. He does well in this role, as well as his foil, Reneee Russo (an FBI agent). Overall well done and thrifty with extra stars for Malkovich. 9/10.
