A very moving and thought-provoking film that causes mental health, terminal illness and euthanasia issues. Sounds a little too heavy? It's a little bit, but it is all realistically straightforwardly treated in a story of the changes that are taking place to the family who has to handle these things. This is a positive story of life and responsibility that is not subject to the subject. <br /> <br /> Life is beautifully shot and manufactured in modern modern times and deals with modern problems. It is a character-driven, charming movie with a strong role and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's not the kind of movie that always performs well at the box office, so catch it while you can.
