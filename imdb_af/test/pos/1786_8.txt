A year after her triumphant first special, "My Name Is Barbra", Barbra Streisand regrouped with her production team to produce this sequel CBS TV specially in then-revolutionary color. First broadcast in March 1966 follows 'Color Me Barbra' in a similar format to its predecessor - three segments, the first two with unique concepts. The first takes place in the after-hours halls of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where she is dressed up as a girl, she runs the galleries and becomes part of the artwork through songs. In various dimensions, Streisand speaks a variety of moods from the "Minute Waltz" comedy to the "Non C'est Rien" melodrama in a Modigliani painting after the Beatnik style madness of "Gotta Move". My favorite moment in the special is when she is transformed into a dead ring of Queen Nefertiti while singing a haunting version of Rogers and Hart's "Where or When". <br /> <br /> Opening with another comic monologue full of dom-sequiters, this time in French, the second segment is back in the studio for a brightly colored circus medley where she communicates with animals, including her beloved poodle Sadie. She finds an appropriate context for "Sam, You have been wearing the pants too long" with a beautiful penguin and compares her profile with an anteater with "We have so much in common". As with the first special, the program ends with a sounding solo concert in which she sings a few castles, "Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home," "Where Do I Go?" and "Start here, start now" among them. Also included is the brief introduction she filmed in 1986, ironically dressed in all-white, when the special first was released on VHS. The accumulation of local and song is even more effective than in her first special, and a 23-year-old Streisand is in peak shape.
