Roy Scheider is not Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood, but who is? The Seven-Ups is one of the better police films, even today, and is the second for McQueen's Bullitt and the Dirty Harry series, which is not bad. There are three things that seem to be a good police film: promising writing with big plays, big car hunting scenes, and some heavy action. This movie has all three and the car hunt scene is better than that in Dirty Harry. Scheider plays the head of a group of police to get NY's bad guys sentenced to seven years or more; hence the name Seven-Ups. Overall, not quite to Dirty Harry or Bullitt, but much better than all the cop films made since the Dirty Harry series. 9/10.
