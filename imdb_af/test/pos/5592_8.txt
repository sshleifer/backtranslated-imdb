I really felt the movie was before his time. The one potential daughter-in-law was such a strong, professional-minded woman. She knew what she wanted and was diplomatic but solid with the transferable mother-in-law to be. The mother's role was very well played (you just loved her to hate her). Her need to control her son's lives was neurotic. If you were ever in a relationship where you were judged and found that it was not (and everyone who knew it), it could be too close to home. It's been years since I saw this movie and I remember thinking that this plot and dialogue will work in a 50's or 60's movie. It's hard to watch because of the mother and boys' dynamic, but I'd love to see it again. I hope to find it on one of the old movie channels, but so far not happy. Attempts to buy it were also useless (I don't believe it is on tape or DVD).
