It was a great 1981 movie that had a wonderful story about three men and two girls going on a camping trip and going through thick woods and high mountains with a large waterfall. This group of people are owned by George Kennedy (Roy McLean) who plays the role of a Ranger and drives a white horse. Roy McLean warns these young people that wherever they go, there is no campsite and they must return. Of course, these youngsters pay no attention and continue to swim a ball in the nude near the waterfall and play music and dance to the fire and drink lots of beer and wine. There is an old, one-room school house that pulls the gals and guys inside and from that time on the movie is beginning to be terrifying. There is one opportunity when a young girl has to climb a tree to get away from a man who desires her body and begins to chop the tree to catch her. Don't miss this movie, there's a lot of everything.
