During the Clete Roberts preface, I started thinking it was an Ed Wood production, but what comes out here is some tough stuff. The story of crime and corruption in a Southern town is being told by a throw that is being thrown out of Hollywood's poverty, making it more realistic. There are no bumps here, and sometimes the movie is reminiscent of "The Well" (1951). The black and white texture gives a newsworthy quality. For sure, younger viewers will be reminded of "The Blair Witch Project", but this one is based on true events!
