First of all, I just have to say I'm a great LOST fan. Everyone who makes the show, I love them. That's all really. <br /> <br /> I'm glad they have good people, for example Jack Bender is the best director, perhaps to J.J. Abrams. And of course, full credit to Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse. They are geniuses. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the season 2 final is definitely one of the best episodes of ever lost !!! Live Together, focus alone on Desmond David Hume's story to come to the island, and Henry Ian Cusick is so nice to play that character! The artists of the show would have been very stupid if their parents were to die on us. <br /> <br /> So, in LOS, the aircraft accident survivors have been there for 65 days. 65 days, man. Whileas Rousseau is there for SIXTEEN years, and the other was there because God knows how long. With reference to Jeffrey Lieber, Lindelof & Abrams. Anyway, I hope we get the answers we need in season 3. Can't wait! My voice is nine.
