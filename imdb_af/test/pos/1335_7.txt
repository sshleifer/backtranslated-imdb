"Strike Force" or "The Librarian" is a fun action movie that doesn't take it too seriously. William Forsythe star as Simon, looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client. He meets Sandi (Erika Eleniak) who is also looking for someone - her sister. But there are bad bad guys going. The most evil of them all is Marcos Canarious (Andrew Divoff). Marcos likes to kill people. So now, Simon and Sandi have to work together to bring down the villains. The whole role is wonderful, with Divoff stealing the movie. There are also cameos by Ed Lauter and Burt Reynolds. If you're looking for a good action movie, watch it and enjoy it.
