I only saw this movie at the Hoyts Double Bay Theater in Sydney in 1959 when it was fifteen years old. I loved it and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted "naturally" and you "felt" in their respective roles for them. A glossy film of the period. The relationships in it are still applicable to today's world, but now the generations are on the same level. Women will not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past or not. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a pleasure that Film Score released the CD every month in January 2005. Neat scenes are cut before release - even at two o'clock you want more! I registered with Amazon for the DVD (they now have a special page). To view this movie in CinemaScope, it will be good for forty-six years of pan and scan. Twentieth Century Fox, look at your catalogs of fifties CinemaScope DVD productions - there's a big market out there. I am waiting for US March 2004 arrival Vanity Fair Special article about the film, which is said to be fifteen pages with many pictures on the set. Cheers.
