This movie is a great movie. The movie shows so many themes all in one wonderful movie. Driving Lessons centers around Ben (Rupert Grint) a shy 17-year-old who comes from age. The movie is about how Ben is sick of his dominant mother and how he just wants to be himself. Ben then meets Evie, with whom he has a very special bond. The two take a trip and in the process he finds himself and what a relationship he and Evie share. This is the movie you see yourself or with someone else. No matter what, you will all feel what Ben is going through the movie. It's a heart-warming movie that just remembers whether your driving lessons have ever been so emotional or so much of a journey as Ben's lessons.
