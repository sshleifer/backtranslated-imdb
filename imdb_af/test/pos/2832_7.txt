Generally, it desires a better movie, but it has enough flashes of intense power to make it worth it. Peck made this film in the same period he made The Gunfighter before he apparently decided he was a monument rather than an actor. Pity! He was a good actor, perfectly prepared to tackle characters that were not very nice, and to do them very well. The character he plays here is driven and, when necessary, relentless. Given the mission, the character is assigned, and the "men" with which it is done, those attributes are essential. <br /> <br /> Without being a spoiler, think of this movie as an early, greener example of The Dirty Dozen genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this movie is a bit of a ham that is handed over, but it is atmospheric and intense and definitely tells a story worth telling. It features good work through all the character players and even Barbara Payton turns into a credible performance. <br /> <br /> This one is not often shown on television, so your local video store can be the only place to find a copy. Go ahead! Give it an evening. It's worth your time!
