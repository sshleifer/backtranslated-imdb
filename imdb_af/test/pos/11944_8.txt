I usually have a hard time watching a TV movie, the extra-long commercial break will break my concentration and I give up and find a good book. However, this one made me add to it and stuck to it to the end. I realize the movie is based on a real story, but it wasn't brought up, why did it take so long to find Denny? They had his name and I will accept his social security number. As he moved around, it appeared that he would be found as soon as his number was entered for a job. The actors were a bit old for the part and a buried metal object when it was unearthed had no rust. These were just technical errors and didn't take out the file. For a LifeTime Movie it was better than most.
