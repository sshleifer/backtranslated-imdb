If it wasn't to murder a Mockingbird, this movie would be much more familiar. If it wasn't Gregory Peck and Addicus Fitch, the acting would be much more praised here. If it hadn't been for William Faulkner, maybe a Mockingbird could not be written in his shadow. <br /> <br /> I found this movie to be sad because it showed me one of my favorite movies, Dood a Mockingbird, may not have been so original because I always thought it was . Maybe it's inspired by this very similar movie. Oh, the "whodunnit" is different, but the underlying story, a lonely fair "white" lawyer against a white southern town defending a black man, is too familiar. And, written by a woman, Mockingbird concentrates on rape, the ultimate betrayal for a woman while concentrating this brother on brother's hatred, the rape that a man feels through brotherly betrayal. <br /> <br /> There's not the depth of Mockingbird here. Not the convenience that Addicus brings with its presence. So you just left with the sadness that, whether she intended to lift the plot out of this movie or not, Harper Lee's Mockingbird reflects. Nothing changed in those ten or so years since she read the book Faulkner's book and saw his movie in Alabama in college and unconsciously or not most of her in his years as herself. Nothing has changed in racial relations, and some may not say anything. It is many years later. <br /> <br /> This is a pity, and there was one wish that there was an Addicus of our day to fix it. Where Mockingbird makes you hope and slams into Addicus's arms and waits for a morning of better times, this movie just makes you sad that the pride of black people may be the pride of the White or better. But pride is also no answer. <br /> <br /> It is rather the answer of Addicus that we need, comfort that we are all defective and that we must have mercy in our weakness, not proud of others in our differences.
