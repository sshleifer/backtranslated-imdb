So funny is the perfect way to describe this 12-minute spoof of the original Star Wars. Hardware Wars are incredibly funny. It is presented as the trailer of Space-Epic Hardware Wars. The joke is this: think Star Wars played by bad actors and amazingly bad special effects. The characters include the "Intergalactic Boy Wonder" Fluke Starbucker, the "Ace Mercenary and Intergalactic Wise Man" Ham Salade, Darph Nader, "Villain" and an army of other fantastic characters. It is impossible not to laugh when you watch this 12 minute treasure. It's stupid, but it's fun. You will be laughing from the beginning to the end, and you will feel the need to watch it again, and again, and again and again ... and you will laugh every time you see it! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. The funniest 12 minutes ever made. You will believe it takes a moment!
