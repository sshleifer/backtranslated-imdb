Quitting can be so much to leave a pre-determined identity than about withdrawing drugs. As a rural man who comes to Beijing, class and success must face this young artist's face as a call to separate his roots and outdo his perpetrators' acting success. However, problems arise when the new man is too new, when it deviates too much from family, history, nature and personal identity. The subsequent splits and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the things of a gut test on the one hand or a complete escape from the self to the other. Hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely way back to self can be grim. <br /> <br /> But what an extraordinarily convincing detail, honesty and census director, Zhang Yang, and his actors bring this trip. No clicks, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no required sex, romance or violence scenes, no required street language, and to start, no money adopted to drive character movements and desires. <br /> <br /> Hongshen Jia is in his mid-twenties. He is a talented actor, impressive, in vain, idealistic, and perhaps emotionally hungry. The perfect recipe for its enablers. Soon he is the "cool" actor scared off by the youth. "He was hot in the early 1990s." "He always had to be fashionable." He needs extremes, and goes in for heavy metal, takes earrings and a scarf. His acting means the arts, friends and roles, but not the kind that offers any personal challenge or input. And his self-criticism, immersed in immediate success, opens the door to an irrational self-doubt, self-hatred. "I didn't know how to act." "I felt like a fool" - and readily available drugs to counter them. He says: "I had to get up high to do what the director wanted." So its level identity as an actor, through drugs, becomes an escape from identity. <br /> <br /> Hongshen's decoupling of drugs and his fake life is very gradual, intermittent - and yet its own. Solitude, space, meditative thinking, speech refusal, replacement therapy. The abstract is out. And much of its change takes place outside --- not in ideal places, but mainly on green spots under the highways, bridges and high-rise buildings of Beijing. Physics is almost romantic, but it is not. The cycling ride to Ritan Park, the long spontaneous walks, the drenched sun and rain, grassy picnic, the air patterns and kites taking its mockery are very specific. He runs to arrive, although he picks up clues to a more real and realistic identity. "I started opening," he says in retrospect this time. And the contact seems to begin with his slender body which, in a current situation, suggests a kind of dancer's positioning (clumsy, graceful, humorous, telling). If mind or spirit is missing, his legs can force him to walk all night. <br /> <br /> Central to its return is the rejection of set roles. To break his end to plays and his determination for a new identity, he breaks his videos and TVs and hits his head bloody against his "John Lennon Forever" poster. He dropped his iconic anti-settling artist --- but he's the only viable guide he knows. He even presents him as John's son (Yoko Ono) and accepts his "Mother Mary" as a forerunner in his "hour of darkness" and "time of trouble". (the tearing, pain in the park - hallucinatory and skitzoid trials). "Music is so much more real than acting," he says. And talking about Lennon's influence as "show me a new way." In the mental institute, the life-saving apples (resistance, nutrition) reflect Lennon's presence, as well as Hongshen's need to hang his hero's poster in his redecorated room. <br /> <br /> If Lennon's influence arises, Hongshen's father's influence is founded. Although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drinks), it is Fegsen's differences from his son who endorses his change. Because the father is safer in himself: he assumes he is Chinese, a farmer in a boerboel, a rural theater director. And he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions. It is this recognizable identity that Hongshen manages to treat him like a sounding board, sometimes with anger and anger, sometimes with humor (the blue jeans, the Beatles) and passivity. In his most crazy and violent exchange with his father in which he accused him of being a liar and a fake, he expounded more of himself than his father: "All the acts I have done before were troubled ... the life is restless. "And to Hongshen's stressed" you're NOT my father, "he answered softly," why can't a farmer be your father? " <br /> <br /> Among these two teachers and with many additional help from his mother, sister, friends, prisoners at rehab, he makes a tangible connection with a real (not all) self. As long-term drug effects fall, it also does its old identity. Debt replacement replaces pride, trust distrust. Integrity bans its black cloud. All its edges softened. "You're just a human being", he repeated endlessly after he was released from the band that went on for the refusal of medicine. Back home, it's now a good farmer's soap. And she once started "scarce and true friendships" again, as it is so clear in the back of the spicy back-to-back fence scene with his musician companion. Hongshen says of this movie: "It's a good chance to think about my life." And I can add, become a new actor, one who is bound to art and life. Like Lennon, he achieved success without a loss of identity.
