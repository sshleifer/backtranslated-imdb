There are many movies now on DVD, but producers have forgotten some titles of interest to many movie guests. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the wide-screen era, earned huge budget knowledge. Many of my generation learn a lot about the history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas. (The first time I heard of them was a very inexpensive adventure movie called Charlton Heston, The Treasure of the Incas), the same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome saw many "bad" episodes of the era. many production values, excellent use of color (The De Luxe color was more Brigit and sharp than the usual Technicolor), perhaps the cast was wrong, but the film anyway maintained to give us an idea of ​​life in ancient times Egypt and was in a way to get out of the car and buy the novel, my Mika Waltari, one of the best, if not the best historical novel ever published. It was also the wonderful count of Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann. I saw this movie many times when I was a boy, and it wasn't the big box that Fox studios wanted. The Robe's big hit, in CinemaScope and Stereo, was a wonderful brand new eyepiece. I have the Lasser Disc version.m the only way to see Ito's wdisescreen format. Soon I will appear hope.
