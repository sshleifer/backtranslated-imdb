KRAMER VS KRAMER won five Oscars, including the best photo of 1979. This intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down when his wife of eight years walks on him, caring for his son and build a relationship with him he never had. Robert Benton's impressive screenplay offers us defective but real people with hearts, souls and brains. For example, in the scene where Joanna announces to Ted, she leaves him, she doesn't just storm out the door ... she gives him the keys, her credit cards, the dry cleaning card, tells him what accounts have been paid, and notifies him that she no longer exhausted the amount of money she had when they were married from their bank account. This decision to leave was not an impression ... It was thought and Joanna felt, with no other option but to leave. If she was gone, she would do it properly. And with no specific plan in mind, she didn't think it's right to take Billy. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer, a man so obsessed with bringing the bacon. He had no idea that his life at home crumbled. Meryl Streep also played an Oscar that Joanna, the unlucky woman, we feel sympathetic to in the beginning of the film, but it changes when she returns for her son. Hoffman is in the form above. I always tear the scene where he tries to explain to Billy (Justin Henry, Oscar) why his mother is gone and he does it all whisper at some point or when he comes back to Joanna and her drink in a wall (a Hoffman moment not in the script that Streep was not told to get a natural response). Justin Henry hits all the right notes like Billy, the confused little one who doesn't know why his mother is gone and doesn't know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also received an Oscar wink as Ted and Joanna's neighbor, Margaret, who converted the film's conclusion to fidelity. It's an intense family drama, but it's also nice to be here ... Billy and the chocolate ice cream ... Billy pouting because Ted picks him up for a feast ... Billy's dad's one night JoBeth Williams) on her way to the bathroom, naked, but these are the moments of human drama you remember. Ted walks through Manhattan with Billy in his arms to come to the emergency room after BIlly falls off the jungle. Ted to be fired before starting his custody battle and instead of making a scene, he tells the man in a whisper ... "Shame on you." And of course, the final where Joanna Ted tells, she doesn't take Billy, which I found a little hard to swallow. Why does she go to all the trouble to sue for supervision and then just change her mind? But it's a little doubt about a wonderful movie, masterfully directed by Robert Benton and performed flawlessly by a top-notch cast. A must-see.
