Jim Varney's appearances as the Harem Girl and A.U. is incredibly funny - on a level that exceeds Chaplin and Keaton. Linda Kash is great in her once-in-a-lifetime role as the hometown waffle waitress longs for adventure. Unfortunately, the remaining 90% of the movie was unsettling due to the horrible plot. The creators of Ernest Goes to Africa did not lead to the creative challenges inherent in low-budget film production. Just worth seeing on the cable.
