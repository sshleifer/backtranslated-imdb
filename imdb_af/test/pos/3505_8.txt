Ali G Indahouse should be one of the funniest movies I've seen in the past, and Cohen's portrayal of a British gangsta is hilarious. This film has written cult classic everywhere, and it contains some very good lines. Ali G Indahouse is a great party movie that literally makes the viewer laugh. Definitely Vote Ali G and really keep it.
