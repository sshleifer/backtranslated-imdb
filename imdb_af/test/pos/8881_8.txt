A photo with Danny Devito and Billy Crystal. They are both well-known actors, and in this beautiful comedy they are trying to kill each other's pet. Billy Crystal's pet is his ex-wife who stole his book and put her name on it, and Danny Devito's pet tooth is his malicious mother. Billy Crystal is a writer and teacher and Danny Devito is one of his students. This comedy classic is very entertaining and for all ages. <br /> <br /> Danny Devito seems to act like a child in this movie because of his evil mother who always drops him. She says things like "You have no friends!" And when Billy Crystal crashed, she said, "Drill him before he stinks the basement!" She also sits down Danny by calling him "Lard ass!" and other things just to make him angry.
