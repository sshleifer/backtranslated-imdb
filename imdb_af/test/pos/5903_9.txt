I saw this movie when it first came out and never forgot it. My uncle Antoine is much, much bigger than the sum of his parts. The film, loosely, is about a pre-adolescent sent to live with a family member in a small Canadian village. There are adventures that look more or less typical, but underneath there is a current building. MUA has a quiet pace, but has patience, the reward comes. I believe the movie is subtitled and as with all non-English speaking movies I've seen, it's worth avoiding any shortened version. Inescapable movies reflect the attitudes of a new director and actor, with the added necessity of lip-sync lines that don't really fit. For example, the English-speaking Amarcord is a travesty, while the sub-title version sings. My uncle Antoine is worth finding it in French.
