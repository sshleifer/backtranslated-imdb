And I think for one this is a good thing. I have never been a Rosalind Russell fan, although the original RR movie was my favorite. But I love Bette and was excited to hear she made it. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the production, I think it was slightly less than the original movie. One of my favorite minor characters in the original was Mazeppa with her scratch finger-on-the-blackboard that stretched out: "HEY! It takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah!" and although I missed it, I was glad to see that the producers had the courage not to do a carbon copy. <br /> <br /> I also liked the fact that there are large portions of this movie that is filmed as if you were watching a stage, it made you feel like you're in the theater, not just at not the movie. <br /> <br /> I think the other thing I liked about this production was that there was slightly less repetition of the song "Let me entertain you", which becomes completely annoying after the 5th time you hear it .
