"Dope Sick Love" is a very remarkable documentary made for HBO about two pairs of heroin addicts who boast the streets of NYC. I accidentally caught it one day and found it absolutely fascinating. There is no narrative and we never see interviews with the subjects, the camera follows them just like a third eye, completely loose. The people who are followed do not even seem to be filmed! (or, at least, they don't seem to care). The footage is incredibly candid. Of the most open-minded I've ever seen. It's as much as it gets. The nuts and bolts of what it looks like on the street and addicted to heroin. We watch their score, shoot, make up, hit, and even policemen to rob people, and about a million other small details that would make less acting documentary filmmakers go out. <br /> <br /> Some of the materials are really awful. As you look at how one man is looking for riotous, he loses. I prayed myself that he would find it, just so that his misery would end temporarily. And when he finds it, the man literally dances in the street. <br /> <br /> As you see it, the cyclical nature of drug addiction becomes very clear. Everything is about the next score to these people, but the next score is worth the trouble they are going through. <br /> <br /> I would like a copy of this if someone knows where it is available. Highly recommended if you can catch it on HBO.
