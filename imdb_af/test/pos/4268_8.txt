I especially liked the end of this movie - I really felt what the characters felt, which I think is a sign of good direction. I was pondering how the new lease at the record store turned out - great character development there, though its "role" probably considered minor. <br /> <br /> I was also impressed that the entire film, while dark in its subject, was free from generous nudity, curse and violence. Sadness, sexuality and darkness can all be communicated (often better) by what is left unseen, but it seems that it is often unique to truly "stylish" films and actors. Kudos for the movie maker.
