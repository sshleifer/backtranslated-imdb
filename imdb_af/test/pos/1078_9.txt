Business vs. Personal Belief. Profit versus Art. <br /> <br /> As with any documentary that the capitalist big corporations oppose the small producer, the viewer will always have to take one side or another based on their own beliefs. It's so much a documentary version of the new standardized way of doing things that globalization brings us, against the old traditional ways in which character and art of making things are almost more than selling the product. <br /> <br /> If you have to remember one thing from this movie, the masses can't decide for themselves. They just follow the taste of one or a few critics who are leveling and standardizing as MacDonalds used to do for the quick bite (something Parker herself acknowledged in the movie against a background of a Burger King sign). "It's all about image" against content as another interviewer says. This is the easy way, the standardized way. Easier than aging time for a nice wine, easier than melting your own taste by trying again and again. Controlled branded flavor is easier. <br /> <br /> There is a glimmer of hope if even some of our cousins ​​across the ocean agree that a few people are leveling the taste of wines to maximize profits and to maximize their assurance. "gray masses" sell. Individuality and difference are offered for the extra money. It is nice to see that not all or all participate in standardization, even across the sea. <br /> <br /> As in many other areas of today's world, the dominance of some and reduced freedom of choice affects us all ... let everyone think and decide what to do. Too much standardization kills the mind and taste; Difference brings innovation and healthy competition and will allow for choice - and not just vacuum packed "more of the same". Standardization sells easily and many, and brings everyone to the same level - the bottom one. <br /> <br /> This will open a nice bottle and wish you a hearty "sante".
