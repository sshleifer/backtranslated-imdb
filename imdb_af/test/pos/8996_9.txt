A very positive message for our youth is shown in this movie. Through rugby as a means of sport, a high school rugby coach leads his players in their behavior and lifestyle, ON and OFF the field. <br /> <br /> The acting and direction are good. The rugby shots are just OK if you know any rugby or really cool if you don't know much about it. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie, especially at a time when this sport is winning. challenge more and more. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on a true story that takes place in Utah. The coach featured in this movie has been in charge of the Highlanders for over 30 years (losing every match every 3 years). <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
