This is one of my favorite cheap, crowny, vampire B movies. <br /> <br /> Calvin Small Underwear model ... oh, I mean, Stefan the Good Vampire, return to Transylvania to climb the Vampiric Royalty throne, but Manikure disabled and eternal apostate brother Radu has another plans. After killing their father's king, Radu now sets his sights on Stefan, Stefan's new mortal friend Michelle and her two lovely friends, and the omnipotent Bloodstone. Okay, the scenery is beautiful and It must be as it was shot in the place in Transyl-fricken-vania for gosh sake. The actresses are not a good shake and Stefan the Heroic Vampire is about as charming as a cool fireplace poker, but who cares? There is only one reason to watch this movie, and its name is RADU! He is a physical tribute to Nosferatu and he has the best lines in the movie, all in the grumpy voice of a man who smokes ten cigarettes every day. The cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film, as Radu slowly approaches the camera and sees his grinning, slumbering face for the world to see. I cheered him when he collected the victims and encouraged his perfect brother. But maybe I'm just a sick man. Confusing aside in men aside, I recommend this movie to vampire enthusiasts. It's original, it's fun, and Radu is one of the best vampires I've seen long ago ... Much more fun than the tight, tragic, winning Undead brats who have endlessly blessed the horror screens. Radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes. He's a vampire.
