I cry at many movies. Call me sentimental. Call me one of those viewers who always want a happy ending. This movie, although it has a sad end, was wonderful! Of all the actors I would like to eat, it will be Sidney Poitier. His play, along with John Cassavetes and Jack Warden (of 12 Angry Men fame) is star. His character, who is up and running with a man (Cassavetes) and helps him in every way possible, is incredible. <br /> <br /> This is yet another forgotten noirs made at the end of the noirish era. It's well done, has an excellent movie, extremely talented acting, and good cinematography. It's a movie worth watching over and over. I recommend this one! This is just another really good movie done by Mr Poitier and sold on DVD. Although I cried, kudos so great art!
