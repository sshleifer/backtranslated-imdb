A beautiful film enhanced by the musical and vocal background, especially during the competition. My understanding is that there was never a soundtrack, but you can advise my sources where I get information about the singer and the probability of getting a copy of the song he sang. Your help will be appreciated. The song really touched me and my wife and we would like to make a copy where possible so we can play it as background music if we pass our family and friends for our "Italian nights". If you can find this information for us, we will be forever grateful. Even if you can advise the studio, contact us so we can go straight. <br /> <br /> Greetings, <br /> <br /> John Payling
