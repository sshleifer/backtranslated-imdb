Intense domestic tension with the mistress of the house (Lupino, excellent as always), threatened by a psychotic migrant housekeeper (Ryan). The 2 masters of the genre are at their fierce, erotic best, as they fit wit, emotions and wills into a bizarre hostage situation from the Saturday night Post. B&W photography cried abundantly with an unusual amount of post-headers. The young girl bothering Ryan is really well-directed here. Unlikely but satisfactory suburban melodrama.
