Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford slept once, but now Scott's sheriff and young Ford kick out his gun. He is hired to pull a bank, but is delayed to go to town and those who rented him get someone else. This causes all sorts of complications, much for a movie that isn't even 90 minutes long. <br /> <br /> Randy and Glenn have both girls here. Claire Trevor plays her regular good time gall with a heart of gold. And Evelyn Keyes is the daughter of Edgar Buchanan who falls for Ford's big time without realizing who he is or why he came to town where Scott is the sheriff. <br /> <br /> It's B western, but unusual for the time, and Columbia Pictures has received the full technological treatment. The Desperado's have marked Glenn Ford's first film in technicolor, a process reserved only to some of the more expensive films of larger studios. Harry Cohn was definitely not the one to think of. And certainly not during the war. <br /> <br /> The plot gets a little over, because both Ford and Scott are being tested for friendship versus opportunity / duty. The plot also includes some high-class hypocrites in Randy's town, in terms of true offenders. <br /> <br /> The four leaders do a good job and the best supporting performance is Guinn Williams as Ford's lovely sidekick's explosive sidekick explosive lunkhead. The climax involves a cattle stamp and a shootout in the village hall and is one of the best ever done in a Western movie. <br /> <br /> Fans of the four leaders and westerners in general will enjoy this one.
