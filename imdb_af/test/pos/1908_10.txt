Yes ... I read David Lee Roth's autobiography, Crazy From the Heat (which is a wonderful read), and DLR says it was his favorite black-breathing movie as a kid. In fact, he says he always suggested him as a black man in Southern Cal. Mr. Roth said: <br /> <br /> "We've seen every Blacksploitation photo, and those movies were a huge influence on me. Trouble Man, Superfly, Foxy Brown, Shaft, Cleopatra Jones, Blacula, Rudy Ray Moore Doiniet his Dolemite vibe - I've seen all the people ... "<br /> <br /> He says: <br /> <br />" Dolemite - Rudy Ray Moore - was one of the original. was a blue cartoon, with blue humor, as Redd Foxx did on early party records, he was the best to play a new secret agent, his answer was not "Bonds. James Bond. "His answer was" Dolemite, motherf *****! "We'll wait for the line in all his movies." Get Whitey "would appear at least once in each movie and we'll wait for They also had the cars, they had the shoes, they had the guns. The Hair Cuts, The Snake And The Scams And And We All Have knew that all the believers at the end of the movie were white bull *** * he tries to feed hungry children, but he is actually a pimp ... bull ****. make our mothers and fathers taste so they can see us the photo. "<br /> <br /> Speaking like a true genius. So I was about Dolemite in Mr. Roth's book read, I immediately bought on DVD and I really like it. Yes, it's super low budget, and yes ... I hate rap ... but as a fan of Tarantino movies, I can see many similarities, especially from the 70's fusion / funk ala-jaco pastorius music throughout the film. I also love the scene where the two police brush him for a cookie and then one of them sniffs a whole bunch of it, as he did it a thousand times before, and says something like: 'Aww yes ... it's the real mccoy! "... and then he goes on talking and he has some cooks on his lip. CLASSIC! Some of the violence is a bit over the edge but shocking, which I consider to be a positive quality. Not as predictable as I accepted it, definitely going to pick "The Human Tornado" 10 out of 10 very soon.
