I honestly can't believe this movie is no longer highly regarded. Claude Chabrol can be described as something like a French Alfred Hitchcock, and while this film is just the second I saw (the first Le Boucher), I can see that this guy is something special, just on the strength of these two movies. The film is a French and Canadian co-production, and takes place in Canada. The film consists of British and Canadian stars and the high quality performances played well with the rest of the film; most of which are of high quality. The movie is a murder mystery and begins when a young girl covered in blood is brought to a police station. After being questioned by Insp. Carella, it seems that the young girl, Patricia, and her sister Muriel were attacked by a man who killed the sister and only allowed Patricia to flee. However, while the investigation continues, Patricia goes back to the station to give new evidence, revealing a much more shocking identity to the killer. <br /> <br /> The performances in this movie are excellent. Donald Sutherland is muted as usual, but he does adjust the role he has given here, and I will not hesitate to mention his performance in Blood as one of his best. The film also features supporting twists from British stars Donald Pleasance and David Hemmings, both of which are giving good luck; Fun in particular shows how great an actor he can be and emphasizes what a shame it is that he is wasting himself in Halloween movies. The unknown Aude Landry also gives a great performance in her role as Patricia. The movie is very mysterious for the first hour and keeps the audience really fast. When Inspector Carella Muriel's diary is discovered, the film becomes more of a drama showing the girl's last actions; and while this part of the movie is not as good as it used to be, it is still interesting and makes a big difference! Overall, blood relatives are a good movie that really deserve to be seen better. Le Boucher is a better known attempt by Chabrol, but for my money it is at least as good! Highly recommended look.
