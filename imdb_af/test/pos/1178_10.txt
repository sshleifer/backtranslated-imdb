Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau should be one of the best friends to ever work with. They made a lot of movies, I think they are both great when working together in a movie. From the sea is a fantastic comedy movie I think to watch. I give the film 10 out of 10. Jack lemmon and Walter Matthau will be remembered when the movies they did together will be on TV. Unfortunately, they will be missed. God bless you both.
