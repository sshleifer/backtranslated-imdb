Taking into account the Chan movies that would follow, it's not bad. Many stereotypes start with the black man in the beginning and when the police captain orders that "every Hindu in town" be rounded off. A parade of stereotypical characters enters the scene, including Shemp of the Three Stooges. Charlie seems to be moving the city quickly from Sutton Pl. to the W. Village in a flash. The end is stupid. A clear toy airplane is used as it climbs through the air and then dives nose. Ed Wood couldn't have done better. The final scene is absurd, as the murderer, of course, is in the attempt to restrain the one who knows his identity. Overall, it's worth watching.
