This morning I just watched this movie and I saw it as a good show of the wealth of faith. Babette gave them another way to look at life; not a replacement, but an improvement. She shared everything she had with those who gave it what they gave her. I see the story of God in this. He sent his only son to man. Man could not give anything that would level it. So, for our little sacrifice, we are given an ultimate treasure and transformed through it. In this film, converting townspeople have devoured themselves with a small interpretation of God. Babette showed them that life and God can indeed be beautiful in its fullest sense. The love God showed for man is the love we have to prove to each other and our lives will be richer for it. Even the movie is a metaphor. It looks slow in the beginning, but eventually the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded. It really was a feast.
