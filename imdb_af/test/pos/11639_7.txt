While it may not be his most packaged movie, MIGHTY likes a MOOSE as one of Charley Chase's most satisfying farce comedies, twenty minutes of smart sightgates, fine choreographic comedy and amusing quips (delivered via title card, of course) all based on a shaky and unconditional point of departure. We are informed that this is a story of domestic people - a woman with a face that will stop a clock - and her husband with a face that will start it again. "Soon we will meet Charley Moose and his wife Vivien, who have a huge nose. But there is no reason to discuss plausibility if our plot depends on such an exaggerated array of interrelated coincidences: ie, firstly, that Charley would have fixed his remnant the day his wife would find her nose, secondly, that every spouse would keep their respective cosmetic operations secret from the other, and third, when they later bumped into public, Charley and Vivien would not recognize each other. Sounds like a bit of stretch, or not? Multiple regions are more like that. Obviously we're here in the world of the farce and just have to roll with the crazy plot twists, as long as you can relax and forget about plausibility, you'll probably enjoy this discount. <br /> <br /> DUE AS A MOOSE comes down to a quiet start as the various complications of the story are established, but things are picked up as soon as Charley and Vivien "met" and made a date to attend a festival at Charley's dentist's home. They all jump excitedly, enter separately and are initially unaware of each other's presence. (Mr And Mrs Moose does seem to be rich, incidentally, since they live in a home, the size of a luxury hotel.) There is a beautiful time series that somewhat resembles Buster Keaton's THE NAVIGATOR in which husband and wife over the house without ever meeting face to face. And as soon as they arrive at the party, the comedy really comes in high gear, as Charley is forced to dance with gawky flower Gale Henry. Henry, a treasured player in his own right who played in very short comedies from 1914, is hilarious as the dance partner who gives great power but little grace for her dance. There is also an elegant cinematic touch in this series, when the camera inflates to show us just the shoes of Charley, Gale, Vivien and Vivien's dance partner. We can know exactly what happens between the principles by looking at their feet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for Charley and Vivien, the party they attend is attacking, and from there the complications increase as they escape the police trawl and return home. When Charley realizes that his newly-married wife has tried to step out with another man, he decides to teach her a lesson. . . while he obviously forgot that he was trying to do the same thing. The last few minutes of this movie offer some of Chase's funniest physical comedy, with a good viewpoint for the punchline. POSSIBLE POWER LIKE unfortunately, the viewer with a hot glow, and certainly with the most amusing comedies produced by the productive, underestimates Charley Chase.
