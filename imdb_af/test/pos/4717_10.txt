It's a good movie in many different ways. Perhaps most importantly, it introduces Western audiences to the remarkable, tragic story of Aung San Suu Kyi and her struggle for freedom and democracy. Wonderful acting, beautiful cinematography, awesome action and excitement: "Beyond Rangoon" has it all. I've seen the movie several times over the past ten years and each time it means more to me. Not everyone will like it (hence the relatively low rating on IMDb), but that's because it's not conventional Hollywood dumbtainment; On the contrary, it makes the viewer appear at various levels. I never looked at it without bowing to the end and promised to live a more meaningful life.
