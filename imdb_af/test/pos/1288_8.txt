The debut from the darkness is one of the brightest stars of contemporary noir. Nolan did not get any money, but Nolan could not have chosen a better topic than the deadly and loose bottom of London to relieve his trade, as there was no money. This short (67 min) is at its best to play with the audience and protagonist's expectations of who is being deceived, although the initial setup calls some alarm bells in the credibility dept. The muddy cinematography (which he often used for natural lighting due to the budget) can usually be laced to noir styling, although the limitations sometimes show. <br /> <br /> One can easily see how Nolan's style evolves in this fast-paced effort; many of the same themes of faded identity and expectation that fall back into MEMENTO and INSOMNIA. Not a masterpiece, but good and definitely a look for modern noir and Nolan fans.
