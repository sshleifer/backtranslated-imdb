A brilliant Sherlock Holmes adventure with the brilliant Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Despite many other actors who play Holmes and Watson brilliantly and do a good job on it, Rathbone and Bruce will always be the best two. <br /> <br /> Holmes takes a Professor Tobell from Switzerland to London. Tobell is wanted by the Nazis. He has a clash that could win World War II. His bomb yard is divided into four parts, each hidden in books. Tobell agrees to give his bombing ground to the British government. On the night of his arrival, Tobell went to his girlfriend's home. He drew some figures from men. If Tobell disappeared, the woman had to give the drawings to Holmes. On his journey home he was attacked, but a policeman stopped it and the attacker walked away. Tobell is happy for the British government to use his bombing facility, but refuses to give it to them, Tobell wants to watch it. The bomb site is divided into four parts, each part completely useless without the other. He gives one part of this bomb yard to one of his scientific friends. Then Holmes's biggest fear happens, Tobell goes away. Holmes visits the young woman, Tobell, the night he was attacked. She tells him about the drawings. The drawings were stolen. She said only one man came in when Tobell was about to attach the bulb. The man she describes is Professor Moriarty. He works for the Nazis. Since he has the drawings, Holmes is ready. But he finds the writing he used and the use of Science he manages to see what Tobell has drawn by looking at the next page. He sees it's code. He sees this as the name of four scientists. The first three he works for the code, but he can't work out the fourth. The three scientists he worked out were killed and the bomb site was taken. Holmes can't work out the fourth scientist, but he can't do Moriarty either. Disguised as a sailor, Holmes succeeds in Moriarty's office. Moriarty immediately sees it as Holmes, puts him in a box and lets him be thrown into the sea. But Watson and Lestrade insist that they find the box and find Holmes in it. It is now clear that Moriarty is great. Holmes manages the fourth code, a Frederick Hoffner. Holmes came to his house immediately and found Hoffner and the decisive fourth part to safety. Holmes must now pay Moriarty for work with the Nazis. He pretends to be Hoffner. Moriarty works out the fourth code and gets two men to go around and get Hoffner. They take him back and he comes face to face with Moriarty. Meanwhile, Tobell is not in a good way, he was tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist. Moriarty had it with Holmes, he had him and his death long for Holmes. The idea is to put him in hospital, put a needle in his ear and see him die with blood loss. Watson walks in and saves the day. Moriarty gets away, but Holmes was just indifferent enough to leave Moriarty's trap open. Moriarty sticks sixty feet. <br /> <br /> So, Moriarty dies. No. He made his final outing in the movie 'The Woman in Green' but in 'Green' he is definitely dead, a suicide, he jumps out of his roof. It was Moriarty's second of three appearances in the Rathbone series, another actor playing at every opportunity. His first appearance in 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' was played by George Zucco, his second in this film he was played by Lionell Atwill and Henry Daniels played in his last outing in 'The Woman in Green'. The first three Holmes films by Universal prevailed in the war as Holmes about the Nazis. 'The Voice of Terror' was the first, then this movie and then 'Sherlock Holmes In Washington'. Then it was back to Victorian times, with definite relationships with Edwardian and Georgian (George's fifth and sixth) times. This film was closely linked to the Sherlock Holmes short story 'The Dancing Men' found in 'The Return of Sherlock Holmes'. A great film, though obviously propaganda, was a brilliant Holmes excursion.
