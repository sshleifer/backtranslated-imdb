I have to say I didn't expect much from this movie, but it doesn't seem to be bad. Most hits were of course Aidan Quinn's performance. I will never expect to see this fine actor as an action hero. The big thing about it is that it really builds its character (Annibal). I mean, it wasn't like Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis would do it, he was sensitive and modest. For example, he is very upset when he kills someone. I also noticed that some clicks were avoided. When Annibal gets his training, you will easily expect him to be a rebel and act like any average American would do in such a situation, ask what the f *** does and refuse to cooperate. But Annibal is a professional marine officer, he does not give up and tries not to lose his courage, in which he succeeds well, except for a short break on Christmas Eve, which I think was very realistic. I'm glad Aidan Quinn had the opportunity to show another side of him (in fact, two because he also plays the villain), even though the film wasn't that successful.
