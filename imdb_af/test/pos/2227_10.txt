Since 1972 I have seen this movie and I still remember it as one of my favorite all-time movies. I would buy a copy if it was on DVD and it is too bad, it is not. You'd think anything with Peter Sellers would be in the lead. Much better than "There Be" and as good as the Pink Panther series. Uschi Digard played a small role for such a benevolent artist. She is a bonus in this movie. I think the medical field can't appreciate this movie as it really makes fun of the profession and it also appreciates that sellers were never available to treat them, as his bedside idea also sucked, his analysis of urine samples .
