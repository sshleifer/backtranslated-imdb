To solve a challenging problem, you first have to ask the right questions. Without this, even the largest library of information is useless. This movie just makes that - where other movies guide your thoughts along a storyboard, this movie draws your emotions and your understanding of justice and what is permissible. These questions will pull you all the way and challenge your assumptions as the characters develop. This movie is important. This is relevant, and a must have for anyone who keeps abreast of current issues. The fact that it is highly entertaining and includes a whole host of movie stars improves performance. My advice: watch it with a serious crowd or better yet, even if you want to read an editorial from your favorite newspaper. In this case there is one difference: the answers will be your own.
