I enjoyed this movie, which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love hate relationships, along with intersexual action scenes and a few sad moments in which the mountainmen oppose hard military discipline. All the main characters are well thrown. True, John Wayne or Robert Mitchum could probably have done the main role as well, but Victor Mature definitely comes across as a hot-tempered Tarzan species. Remind me of his film role as Samson, another difficult but not impossible man to tame. <br /> <br /> The mountaineers in the opening scene are definitely an anachronism, as the era of pure hiker mountainmen ended pretty much 20 years ago with the collapse of western beaver populations as well as the fashion market for beaks. This story is believed to be in Oregon before the end of the Civil War. Due to the volcano in the background of the opening scene (probably Mt. Lassen), the fictional fort was located somewhere in a remote part of the Cascades, as we never see other citizens. However, there is very contradictory evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana! Red Cloud, the war chief threatening the poachers and soldiers in the fort, is the namesake of a well-known Sioux war chief who in 1865-66 led a very successful campaign to eradicate the newly built army forces in Wyoming and Montana. Fort Laramie (eastern Wyoming) is called as not too far removed from the fictional fort. The plains of Assiniboines call it to join Red Cloud. This aspect of the story then has a general agreement with the historical fact. <br /> <br /> It may be interesting to see some similarities between the story of this story and that of John Ford's Fort Apache. In both cases, we have a fort commander recently assigned to his first border post with native American troubles. He underestimated the military capabilities of his opponents, regarding them as little as gunfire to advance his career. In both films, he paid a lot for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy. In common, the Greenhorn cup has a subordinate who has a long experience with the local Native Americans and wants to tell him what is wise to do and not to do. In both films, we have a nurturing romantic relationship between a woman very close to the commander's heart and a subordinate, doing the commander everything to wrestle. Clearly, the commander should be eliminated so that this romance can continue. <br /> <br /> I also see some similarities with "The Misfits". The soldiers as a whole, including the commander, are misfits of a kind (as one of them acknowledges): mostly they have "problems" or are raw recruits without experience to fight indigenous Americans. The commander's wife is apparently the only woman In or near this fort, it is inherently a misconception, with a man who is very uncertain about his future in the army. The trappers, in turn, are wrong and do not want to accept army or civil discipline, but are cut off from their previous free spirit by the recent army-generated antagonism by Red Cloud. <br /> <br /> Finally, we can also compare this story with Anthony Mann's later movie "The Far Country", starring Jimmy Stewart. In Stewart's case, he might choose to return to a lonely cowboy, but in the end, the parent's character doesn't come in a nice new way to be his own boss. Red Cloud made life outside the army in this region too dangerous to consider. In addition, he is obsessed with the commander's wife.
