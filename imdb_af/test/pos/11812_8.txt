I really liked the movie, thought it was very entertaining as well as dramatic. But I just had a question about the music being the movie. I couldn't find any kind of soundtrack (even if there was one). And specifically, I wondered if anyone told me the name of the song playing while the boys were going to tell the river on their way to New Orleans? I thought it was something like "My Great Escape", but I searched books on the Internet, just about anything I could think of, and I just can't find it. If anyone can help, it will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
