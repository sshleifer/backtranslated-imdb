2001: A Space Odyssey <br /> Is it a sermon? An account of the history of humanity? An exploration of man's useless efforts to promote technology just to destroy technology? Is it about the fragile balance of time and space? A Lesson in Evolution? Or is it just a spectacular effect program; a movie Kubrick just made us the unlimited possibilities of the film and gave us the truth that images are more powerful than words? <br /> <br /> 2001: A Space Odyssey is all this. One of the most interpretable movies ever created is almost nicer to analyze and discuss the ambiguous plot design and events of the movie than it actually looks. But it is deliberately left open for discussion; if Kubrick explained the significance of his wonderful 1968 classic (ranked # 22 on AFI's list of the biggest 100 films ever made, my personal 21st favorite movie, currently - and nominated for 4 Academy Awards: Director, Original Screenplay, Art Direction and visual effects for which it was won would have lost half its fascination, all its complexity, and a good part of its movie value. We will only be left with the technical ingenuity; which in itself is worth praising. <br /> <br /> Because every shot is worth the time to look. And there is a lot of time. 2001 is very elegant, and also cool down; detached. However, the emotional distances and slow pace pay a perfect tribute to the unique visual experience; 2001 begins with man's monkey ancestors, who upgrade from hunters and toolmakers to hunters and toolmakers after discovering a giant monolith in the middle of their desert home, and then (in one of the movie's most inspired jumping accelerations) leg is thrown into the air and becomes a satellite that jumps into space for several thousand years, where astronauts have discovered a similar object on the moon, and then the film follows a crew of space traveler's mission while following the monolith's signal through space Through their unreliable HAL computer, which attempts to sabotage the commute and kill the crew, eventually the only survivor through space and time is launched (in a flurry of drug-induced colors that are likely to be hippies given an epileptic shock in the day) getting old, dying and becoming a "star-child" born again. Whew. <br /> <br /> This pacing and emotional emptiness is also in sharp contrast to the movie's most ironic scene; the destruction of HAL. As the crew's last explorer put down the machine, Kubrick bathed in the holy aura of red light. He always used as a recurring motif, HAL singing a beautiful voice, it's a strange emotional experience. And this is all genius. <br /> <br /> Other notable aspects of Kubrick's masterpiece are the memorable voice of HAL (a quiet, some sinister, Douglas Rain), the minimal dialogue use (Kubrick wisely trusted his images to drive the movie and only give banal, obscene lines to his actors, the best known is "Open the pod bay doors HAL", satellites that dance in the orbit of unorthodox music and the first, awesome shot of the earth; The light of the sun was lightly illuminated by hand, played by the sound of rays, triumphant horns. <br /> <br /> 2001 will always be a mystery and will forever prove the strongest point of the theater. is more powerful than writing. It's all about one of the film's legendary and best directors, whose unique vision was always his own. 10/10 <br /> "Open the pod bay doors HAL" -2001: A Space Odyssey
