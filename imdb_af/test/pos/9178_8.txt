It was a romantic, simple, funny movie. I really enjoyed it and will definitely say to see and enjoy it, Will Smith was funny, fumbly, nervous, sweet and just a simple guy hit by Love. It was cute to see him fall for someone and be as nervous and lost as what to do or say. It was wonderful. He was big, funny as usual. Eva Mendes was better than I expected her to be so good. I thought there were moments in the movie where Will got the shaft, he did everything he could be good and still treated badly. The end was romantic and happy and it was wonderful. I've seen it several times and would see it again. A funny, movie, something you no longer see. It felt the old time with a fresh new look.
