According to the judge, the best time to be a child in the 1990s is a period when cartoons are not heavily censored and talented and creative thoughts were responsible for the best family entertainment to hit the airwaves. The best producers of Saturday morning animation were at Warner Brothers Television, which had a great Golden Age with the dream team Steven Spielberg, Tom Ruegger and Paul Dini. Along with serious and dark ranges like Batman, they also have revived, strange cartoons made known by the Looney Tunes. Animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark adult humor and tribute to past and present celluloid, but Tiny Toon Adventures was equally popular by rediscovering the Looney Tunes for a new generation while still holding the crazy cartoon violence and intelligent comedy has. can hold on to any age group, no matter how old. Even when the Tiny Toons was stretched to a feature film with how I used my vacation, it didn't feel like a longer episode of the television series, a curse that so often bothered with other feature-length adjustments of popular animation programs. /> <br /> The Tiny Tone gang is young descendants of the classic cartoon characters that make audiences laugh in the 1940s and 1950s and are currently learning cartoon comedy to earn their Toongraad. Summer holidays have begun and each character has their own idea of ​​what to do. Buster Bunny (Charles Adler) and Babs Bunny (Tress MacNeille) are starting a water rifle battle that eventually causes Acme Acres to be flooded and both to the Mississippi. Plucky Duck (Joe Alaskey) joins Hamton Pig (Don Messick) on a long-drive car ride to the happiest theme park in the world, but Hamton's family seems to be harder than he thought. Meanwhile, Elmyra Duff (Cree Summer) is being distributed in other stories, trying to get a cat to hug and print. Fifi Le Fume (Kath Soucie) aims to date with her favorite skunkster and Shirley the Loon (Gail Matthius) going to the cinema with a loud fowlmouth (Rob Paulen). <br /> <br /> Although the performance is very thin for a movie with features, the many directors and screenwriters make all the stories great. The best of these is Plucky's unfortunate road trip, which uses a golden comedian opportunity very well: feel sorry for someone while also being in trouble. Plucky's irritated response to all the bad things that happen to him is a perfect combination of writing and animation, all within the confines of a small car filled with pork. Elmyra's story is definitely second, just to see how a small, almost innocent girl can cause fear in so many jungle animals. The aforementioned cartoon violence certainly comes up with Buster's and Babs's story, which not only leaves us with the hilarity of the outcomes, but also nostalgic, as Ruegger and the company are unlikely to do half of them in that segment. Almost half of the segment plays a parody and tribute to Liberation, including a clever twist on the twin banjos scene, with the unforgettable Tiny Toon Adventures theme song. <br /> <br /> Part of the universal appeal of the Tiny Toons is that humor seems to be very intelligent, as it targets with anger that proves that it doesn't deserve the title of "children's prize" at all. people don't. A whole segment with Fowlmouth's poor label at the movie makes fun on yappers in a nut-perfect way, along with an additional jab at Lucasfilm's THX logo. The scene is so perfect that it has to be displayed before each cinema. There are also a few moments of fun playing at Disney World, movie holes and even Warner's legal department. The fact that today's cartoons are scarce and uncompromising makes those intelligent moments even more treasured, as there will probably not be another animated series that will come close. <br /> <br /> After looking at how I used my holiday for the first time Time in many years I can say with certainty that they didn't make cartoons as they were used to. With the continuous censorship received today 's family entertainment, one wonders whether such a thing will ever be made again. This review is not only a recommendation of a really clever film, but also a plea for Spielberg, Ruegger and Dini to refurbish and bring another magical creation to our minds. Lord knows that the children of the twenty-first century need something with the intelligence of Tiny Toon Adventures. It's not a simple cash grab, it's a wonderful movie full of spirit, madcap mayhem and hilarity.
