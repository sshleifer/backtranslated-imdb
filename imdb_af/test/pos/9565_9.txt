I saw this movie with an open mind, without knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this movie is written, directed and acted in such a way that every minute of it is a beautiful watch. The people do not seem to act, more than they are real people who really train dogs and lead the lives depicted in this movie. There are some wonderful moments where you laugh or struggle, some jokes may be dry but are presented in a very obvious way. Highly recommended!
