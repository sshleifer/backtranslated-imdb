Two hard luck, but smart ladies decide to act like HAVANA WIDOWS by sailing to Cuba to meet and meet extortionate people. <br /> <br /> It was the kind of ephemeral cartoon that made the studios pretty effortless during the 1930s. Well done and very enjoyable, Depression audiences do not seem enough of this popular, funny photo drama. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell & Glenda Farrell are perfectly thrown as the brave, fast-paced women who go to great lengths to make a little dishonest dough. Although Joan gets both top billing and romantic scenes, both are gals so talented and viewable, as they are beautiful. Handsome Lyle Talbot plays Joan's sustained hearsay but he is relatively few to do. Chubby, cherubic Guy Kibbee appears as the girls' intended target. Whether it's awakening to find himself in the wrong bed or hunting the roof of a Cuban hacienda in his long johns, he is equally hilaries. Behind him comes a rank of character actors - Allen Jenkins, Frank McHugh, Ruth Donnelly, Hobart Cavanaugh, Maude Eburne, Dewey Robinson - all just as skilful to please the toughest crowd. <br /> <br /> Filmmavens recognize an unredited James Murray as the suspicious bank teller with the counterfeit check. This very talented actor has come out of the darkness to die in King Vidor's The CROWD (1928), one of the most sought after movies of the quiet era. Hope was high for a good career, but his celebrity quickly disappeared with good photos. After a long string of small roles and little parts, broken and upset, his life ended in the waters of a New York River in 1936. He was only 35 years old. <br /> <br /> While never first-rank stars, Joan Blondell (1906-1979) and Glenda Farrell (1904-1971), movies at Warner during the 1930s, especially the eight in which they stood together. Bros. won. Whether they are gold diggers or work maids, reporters, or secretaries, these blonde and brash ladies were almost always a match for any leading man who was happy to share equal accounts with them. With a wisekrack or a look their characters showed they were ready to tackle the world - and any man in it. Never been as malicious as Paramount's Mae West, you always had the feeling that Blondell & Farrell was difficult to defend their fierce hearts to outdo the real man. While many performances of seven decades ago can still be seen or watched today, these two beautiful ladies are still enthusiastic.
