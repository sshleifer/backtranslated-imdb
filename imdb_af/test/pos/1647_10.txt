Shtrafbat - Penal Battalion is a moving, and mostly honest, look at the lives and deaths of Soviet soldiers sentenced to wash away their crimes with blood during World War II. One can call it the Russian equivalent of highly-acclaimed "Band of Brothers" miniseries. <br /> <br /> In July 1942, on the eve of Battle of Stalingrad, the criminal battalions were regarded as expenses and horrific casualties. (sometimes as high as 90%). Prisoners of GULAG (political prison / concentration camps), deserters, soldiers captured by the Germans but managed to escape, soldiers accused of protocol breach, gave everyone a chance to join the Shtrafbat and to Prove that there are no "Traitors of the Motherland" with their lives. Those who sustained injuries and those who died in the battle were considered rehabilitated and recovered in the eyes of the law. <br /> <br /> This miniseries has a look at one such Shtrafbat, commanded by Tverdokhlebov - an honorable officer captured by the Germans was shot dead and left dead. It features a colorful and diverse group of people in a situation where there is no escape. The authoritative, but honorable crime boss Antip "Kulak" (fist) and his small gang of uninhibited criminals, a young Jewish intellectual who joins his anti-Semite officer, Father (Orthodox Priest) Mikhail, who joins the battalion when she congregation is being destroyed home-to-home battles, political prisoners who hate the regime they have condemned to the LAG, but who are nevertheless willing to last for their people and country, all have their courage and reason find to stay, and to keep fighting. <br /> <br /> Although set during a war, not every episode is inconsistent, and in fact there are battles, often chaotic, sporadic and short - which were probably the director's intention. . In between, the miniseries focus on different relationships between the role, their backgrounds, their thoughts and tragedies. The rape of a young woman by one of Shtrafbat's soldiers and then his execution, execution for alleged AWOL, boredom periods on the march, the celebration (and subsequent consequences) of finding a German bunker filled with food (and champagne) The moral dilemma of officials who cannot save their husbands from their own superiors, spouse fraud and other situations, is prominent. The camera is unshakable - it does not detract from the ugly war and the uglyness of human nature, or from raw human emotions. The dialogue also does not censor the curse. <br /> <br /> The play is wonderful and deep, and the writing is also well written. Everything from anger, to fatigue, to resignation, to finding a scrap of joy, is rendered almost flawless. One complaint may be that some of the Russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies cannot always be understood by someone who is not familiar with language and culture. Because it is a history drama, some of the terms and situations (military rank, mention of other battles, certain historical references) may be lost to some viewers. This concept is not necessary to thoroughly enjoy Shtrafbat, but these references are a good touch of authenticity. Another charge that can be made is an occasional anachronism and bends over history to adjust the plot, but frankly, it is such a sounding miniseries that one will probably forgive these little accidents.
