You know, people who forget comedies so often are really okay to be outrageous. Well not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead ... and it works. It doesn't just work, it works very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard, I think I injured myself, but the main characters were all so human, so honest and so real. But isn't that where big comedies come from? Don't characters have real feelings, real emotions, and the ability to feel real pain? Well, they do in this movie. Unconditional Love is a movie you should not miss, especially if you need a very good laugh or you are actually curious to see the psychotic dwarf in the red raincoat.
