"Hit and Run" is a devastating story with the wonderful Margaret Colin as a community lady who "has everything" until she hits a child with her car and leaves the scene. Hence the title. The tragedy is that she is going to ask for help and calls, but is frightened by terrible passers-by who thinks the hitter has left the scene. It was made in the days when not everyone had a cell phone, or there wouldn't be a story. <br /> <br /> Colin's guilt and anxiety are tangible and cause her to behave so strangely that a detective on her right comes away. Her lies sink deeper and deeper into a self-destructive hole, making her a worse situation. <br /> <br /> It's a very moving story, and it can't help but feel it. lady's pain, which immediately wished, she would just be clean. <br /> <br /> As a TV movie, thanks to Colin and a strong writing, it's a well-average TV movie.
