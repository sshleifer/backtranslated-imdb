Love this movie! Kick it old school! Love the idea. Love the script. Love the characters. I really loved the Geeks! I was excited to see the stupid, slapstick horror leaves still being honored. It was right with my favs like Saturday the 14th and Pandemonium. If you're a big fan of scary and stupid then it's your movie! Just taken one star, because I'd love to have better sound. Not bad sound, but would like more. Big blood splash. Great murder weapons. Great costumes! I really love the nod for the 80-year-old stereotype ala breakfast club. And I can appreciate the non-CGI tension. Really good camera action and light voltage instead of cutting CGI. I'd rather have a good fake that really fails. <br /> <br /> Kisses to the role and creators! Oh, love the "make-of" too!
