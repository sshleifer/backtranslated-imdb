I just love this show.It's so funny and cool. Kuzco is such a hilarious and interesting character, I love him. He is the thing that makes this show what it is, although Kronk and Yzma are so funny and charming. All about this The show is great for me, because it always drives me to make a laugh, no matter if it's just an episode. It's just as funny and all the characters are so sweet and cool, it makes the show worth watching, unlike some crap on the Disney channel. Give this show a try next time it goes on, if you've seen the movie, and even if you haven't seen the movie, you will be very pleasant anyway. So go on.
