No, it's not Citizen Kane. But would you expect it to be with a name like "Meatballs"? It's the best damn summer camp movie of all the summer camp movies. Does anyone say "Little Darlings" line for line? Or "Whitewater Summer"? <br /> <br /> It's just one of those movies that came into my brain when I was in junior high and stayed with me all the years. Every time I feel geeky, I mumble "Spaz. Spaz. Spaz. Spaz." Or when we walk in the brush in the woods, I tell my husband, "I'm Wudy da Wabbit." (He doesn't get it). "It just doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter." I mean, these things are classic! <br /> <br /> Disappointed with the DVD, though. Wish there were special features, maybe a comment or a make up. But the movie itself is a perfect snapshot of life as an adolescent in the late 70's. Maybe not MY life. You can't help but want to walk around in shorts and knee high socks and feathered hair every time you see this movie in the bush.
