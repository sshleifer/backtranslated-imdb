Deep Water explores the pressure and ambitions of an ordinary man in a compelling documentary. The evidence and archive material is a fascinating insight into the late 1960s and a groundbreaking round of world yachting. The personal conflicts of duty to family, self and reputation are played in one of the most memorable and influential films I have seen. I was not familiar with the history of this story and the play was successful and clear. The story is mostly respect for the participants with heroes and villains who are implied rather than mercilessly exposed. Most of the interpretation is open to the viewer, so the room is personally related to the situations and characters. This movie is a bitterly sweet experience with an entertaining mix of thoughtful tension, joy and drama.
