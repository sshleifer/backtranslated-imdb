That, ladies and gentlemen, is really a modern B-movie. The dialogue is stylized and provided with wood stiffness, the foreground is predictable (there are some decent twists and turns) and characters remain 2D for most of them. And yet there is a certain ... charm. WWE wrestler Kane brings to life the sick, twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos (although similar to his character playing ten years) and so I will almost find it amusing if people say it is "not much of a reach for him, "but Glen Jacobs is apparently the good guy, so actually it is. Anyway, he was perfectly thrown as the bragging brute and the fatalities were over the top (Jason would be proud), but I heard at least four applause breaks for four different deadly scenes. To be honest in this movie, think you'll have a little fun and a gorefe, oh it's QUITE the gorefest. The R score is richly earned and I actually got a little bit up in some of the more graphical times. Anyway, a very, very fun, but pretty bad movie.
