The Hindi version of the movie is 121 minutes. In the early 1900s in Bengal, the film (based on Tagore's novel) made an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjugation of women. A well-behaved and beautiful woman, Binodini, becomes a widow within a year of her marriage, but she does not accept the constraints imposed on her by her as a widow. The movie has a beautiful view, but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is in the depths of the depiction of Binodini's strong character with his subtle combination of idealism and vice. Binodini's idealism does not occur, and as a result, the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried.
