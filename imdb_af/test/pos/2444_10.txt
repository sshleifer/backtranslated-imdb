It looked when it was first checked and missed when it disappeared from British screens. It has shown another side of Old Australia that we need to see more. Good opposite position of old hand and young turkey. Then the realism of the hard back was fantastic. This was unfortunately missed. This show was a cold look at the old way to look at Australia. Hard life and hard work. The young idealist clashes with the old practical head. Real Politicka fights with the young start of New Labor. Adding the Modern Political Folk Language. <br /> <br /> This show was the first of its kind that I didn't find a tourist work on Australia. It was a good performance of the realistic <br /> <br /> upcoming documentary realistic type show. Some good movies were at the same time. It would be great to see more of this kind of TV from Australia because it's unfortunately over the past twenty years. because everything we have been feeding is the varnish of varying quality.
