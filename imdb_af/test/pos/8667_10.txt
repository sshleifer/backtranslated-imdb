As you may know, Norway is the most developed country in the world (with regard to HDI; Human Development Index). This film reveals our future to us. Our future will be from Norway, as we are all doing the best and offering the least. The life shown was perhaps an exaggeration, but comparing today's concerns with those of our ancestors is not far from the reality reason. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie free from all our presuppositions, we can both find our faces; The one who laughed at the brilliant scene of Andreas and dumped her girlfriend and the one looking for hours and hours to choose a stupid chair from stupid collections. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the hole with the hope of lightness was another wonderful idea of ​​the movie. The slight glory; but the only one, and the effort it has made, draws us closer to Andreas. <br /> <br /> Although I was particularly attracted to the idea and production of the movie, Trond Fausa Aurvaag played pretty well and the atmosphere of the film was quite adaptable.
