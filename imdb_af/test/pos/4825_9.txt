From the acting to Cardone's direction, this new twist on the famous ghost's awkward theme will keep you glued. Slow, because it builds 'what is going to happen' tension. Medium-good on gore, but what's nice nasty. Spoiler: The death of the jockhole and the subsequent festival is a highlight for gore dogs. <br /> <br /> The writers have made an old story but have added doubts and thought again that you are typically haunting. Cardone brings it to life. . . there. . Uh death. <br /> <br /> Lori Heuring, Scout Taylor-Compton and the ever-fabulous Ben Cross are actually no signs of acting. Everyone in the throw is dedicated and this is certainly not what any director aspires to. The actors believe, so we believe. <br /> <br /> Along with the traditional ghost surprises, the movie is loaded with tons of atmosphere, from the mine, Hank's house and the Tunny house, there is a creeping fear from the first frame to the last. <br /> <br /> Horror fans do yourself a favor and enjoy what is one of the real horror movies out there. <br /> <br /> I end up with a big kudo after Boaz Davidson (story) Ben Nedivi (script) for unsuspecting writers Hollywood will be nothing but an ugly reality TV party.
