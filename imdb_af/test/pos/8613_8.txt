Sex is a comedy, but is not driven by a fantastically imaginative plot. Effectively focuses on the relationship between film director and crew during film production, while addressing the dynamics of human relationships successfully, and more specifically the issues and problems of actors involved in filming sex scenes. Director, "Jeanne," appears prominently, because it is she who carries the plot forward, instead of a narrator, and gives us many small pearls of wisdom to think about. She is a social commentator, regarding her assistant and others the problems she finds with her new male lead, by associating him with a male stereotype. Their ambiguous relationship characterizes something about human nature ?? the tendency to be capricious. On the one hand, the two look close; when he is not in sight, she claims to hate him. Jeanne also speaks to his masculine pride in feminist behavior. <br /> <br /> The obsession taboo is aroused: the content of the sex scene is not considered obscene, but beautiful because it is fakeness that is unclear - this is the justification of the director. However, this is ironic, because the film we see is in itself a construction within a construction. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is more to this movie than just relationships. Watching this movie is not just a matter of analyzing it for the sake of some meaning. One can entertain in the natural lighting that permeates the film. It makes it realistic and credible. A static camera is sometimes used to take a heavy composition and sometimes the camera looks shaky like a home movie. If you are looking for something fun to watch on a Sunday afternoon, it is not too heavy, but still think it is.
