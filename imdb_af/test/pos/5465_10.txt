I just returned from Santa Fe. NM. I visited Loretto Chapel. Looking at this building, acquired by a private owner, I relived the movie version of the staircase. It is an overwhelming mysticism that occupies this building. It's about what can happen if you truly believe. The bookshop has a story about the subject, which is the story of the staircase. I read the story as a whole. I was absorbed by the atmosphere around the people in it. It was as if we were completely in a time shift, all with the same thoughts and awe. When we left, the hush was overwhelming. Everyone should visit Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe. NM.
