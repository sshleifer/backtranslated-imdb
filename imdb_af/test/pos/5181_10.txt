I watched the movie tonight and I found it brilliant. It does not have special effects that make your mind fall, and it is not violent or bloody, no terrorist or stranger, but it is brilliant. It's just nice, sweet and it brought me to a whole different time, a much simpler time, where people could take their time to walk down the street and look out over the sea. I think it was beautiful and I recommend it. Nick was a great character and his friendship with Harry was one of the highlights of the movie. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I believe everyone should look at it, mostly when they feel or when they want to share something with their friends.
