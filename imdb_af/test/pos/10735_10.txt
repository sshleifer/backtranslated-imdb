No, it has nothing to do with the sitcom "Seinfeld" or its eccentric and hilarious character Cosmo Kramer. In fact, Kramer vs Kramer is a great drama movie, without a doubt one of the best of its kind and one of the best movies ever. I'm glad it won more Oscars than "Apocalypse Now" because it earned such a glory. <br /> <br /> "Kramer vs Kramer" is a great movie, made so well and so perfectly balanced that I don't change it in any way. There's nothing wrong with the movie. It's the highest quality movie-making. And this is also the test of time. Not only does it not seem dated, but its cultural impact is long-lasting and its realistic story remains as important as it was when it came out in 1979. A timeless classic. These movies are dramatic, realistic, simple but brilliant, intense, powerful, sweet and even tragic and depressed. Yet it also has good humor. It has no special effects, but who cares? It's not the movie or place to discuss such a thing. For such a movie, such things would be senseless and absolutely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. The actors' chemistry is just perfect. All the actors are great, but the 3 most important are the best. Dustin Hoffman, a brilliant actor, has his greatest performance ever here as the sweet, but distant workman Ted Kramer. Meryl Streep is big like Ted's wife, Joanna. And cute little Justin Henry is fantastic than the loving, but sometimes stubborn Billy, son of Ted and Joanna. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is all instrumental and wonderful. The opening song (by guitarist Frederic Hand) is brilliant. The rest of the soundtrack is mostly Antonio Vivaldi's classical music and is simply brilliant. <br /> <br /> This movie also has an incredible character development. See character Ted Kramer: a workaholic who becomes an incredible father after he left without choice, but to take care of his son, trying to adapt these new responsibilities to his job after leaving his wife, Joanna is. Ted learns about the most beautiful things in life, but also realizes how life is, with the problems in his work and the return of Joanna, who wants the supervision of their son. But even Joanna changes for the better and the end is an unexpected surprise when you see it for the first time. <br /> <br /> This movie also has some things, like courtrooms where both Ted and Joanna are experiencing a cruel character. assassination triggered by lawyers. Another thing to see is when poor Billy drops a jungle gym with his toys (a plane) and is seriously injured on his face. But then the scene is very good and the following is very intense: his father runs fast and crosses many blocks and ignores the traffic to take his son to hospital. <br /> Overall, this is a movie that is a great lesson of life. <br /> <br /> It should definitely be on Top 250.
