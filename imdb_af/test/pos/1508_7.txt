The one who says Lucio Fulci is not one of the most important names in the history of poaching is probably angry. The Italian director is a legend among hardcore horror fans, and his work exceeds the boundaries of the genre (which is his Western, crime or fantasy movie). It's probably his prettiest movie, and unfortunately the last one starts. A horror director (Fulci as himself) about horrible murders. He goes to a psychiatrist who makes him believe he is the criminal. At this time, the doctor started a long chain of serial crimes. With such a plot, the movie must be filled with something. And there are rock bodies, crashed or melted heads, stabbings, decapitations, chainsaw dismemberment and many others. Child sometimes sows, the movie is saved by the excessive violence that the gore addicts will definitely please.
