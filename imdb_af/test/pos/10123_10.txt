Cuba Gooding, Jr. will win the Oscar for BEST ACTOR in 2003. And Ed Harris will win for the BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR. What a beautiful and attractive movie it is, but make sure you bring a box of tissue. If this film does not come to you, then you have ice water in your veins. <br /> <br /> It was 1976. The environment was in South Carolina and the Civil Rights Act was about ten years old. We have a white high school soccer coach and teacher, Ed Harris. Then there is a black, disabled, but pleasant fellow, Cuba Gooding, whose biggest possessions, including a radio, are stacked in a shopping mall which is also used when his bicycle. <br /> <br /> For a reason explained later in the film, Ed Harris takes a keen interest. He nicknamed Cuba "Radio" and following is an absurdly sounding, far-reaching, spicy exploration of the human soul. <br /> <br /> The movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.
