Uzumaki has a very unique story and I will never look at spirals again. Not really spine tingling horror, this movie has a dark morose, sour journey feel to it. For certain parts, was it just me or did you see vortex visuals? The camera shots are interesting and the movie runs your imagination. The bizarre supernatural feeling of this movie draws you just as the title suggests. To do is well done and the village itself seems wrong to start with. <br /> <br /> It may take a few moments to sink it. A great trippy movie.
