Obviously, the previous judges are not fans of this genre, but I think this one was pretty well done. <br /> <br /> It's cleverly twisted and dark. This story brought memories to the type of girls I fell in love with as a child. <br /> <br /> Also, it makes me like Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments on how hot she is in this video. <br /> <br /> Sure, there are a few Burton influences here, but I won't say Brad is trying to snatch him. <br /> <br /> He just jumps in and adds his talents to genre I can appreciate. I like what he does, and he does it well, nuff said!
