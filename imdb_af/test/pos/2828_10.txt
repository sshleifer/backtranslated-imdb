The movie didn't have any help, promotion-wise: if there was an ad promo on TV or radio, I didn't see / hear it. The only newspaper ad I saw was on the opening weekend: an icy, messy B & W photo of Andy as Val-Com, behind jail, titled "WANTED! Runaway Robot!" (It was also the poster for the 3 movie theaters I saw. - Not the pretty little color poster on this site, with main photos of all Crimebuster movies and cartoons - which wasn't really that good. They have an action scene of the movie itself - do not have an opening photographer? A poster is supposed to help a prospective audience decide if they want to watch the movie - there were so many people who could not come into their sale choice, and want to know WHAT Heartbeeps was over - and that poster didn't help! The beautiful picture and the only other photos provided on paper were so indistinguishable in B&W that they were worthless.) There was NO follower for the movie: just a slide at one theater, consisting of the word "Heartbeeps" inside a heart shape, with a doll's arrow through it and one that was a completely black picture: only Andy and Bernadette's voices say "Val-Com! My pleasure center is wrong!" "So are the mines, do you think we should tell our owners?" THIS is no help to people who were not aware of the movie. <br /> <br /> During the filming, Andy told reporters he couldn't eat as soon as his plastic cuts were applied, he would load up on breakfast and quickly "during the day's shooting. I don't know what Bernadette did did not, but then I wondered why they not only cut protein drinks through long straws, or did they eat pure astronaut-style tubes through the tubes? <br /> <br /> The baby robot "I was trying to find out if they had the same designer, but no help. I have vintage magazine articles about the movie, and the design team was very proud of it." on their job and used a special award for their innovative device to create odorless "smoke" for Catskill's cigars, just after that LucasFilm didn't use that device, even though they had to, for the return of the Jedi 's scenes with Jabba the Hut: a man has a steam calm ndom Jabba created by blowing cigarette in a tube and joking that everything he needed was a glass of brandy, and he was a happy man. I thought LucasFilm's use of real tobacco products was insensitive to people who were upset by smoke. <br /> <br /> John Williams, who recently succeeded the great Arthur Fielder as the Boston Pops maestro (who was then a rating - but never recovered from Fielder's death and is now a shadow of his former glory, use the show to promote films with which he provided the music. He introduced the "The Empire Strikes Back" player there; and you would think he would have helped Heartbeeps by playing a few numbers there? One of the critics of this movie was Williams's score - but it was NOT available for purchase! I saw one vinyl album in 1982, with half of Heartbeeps, half of another movie - but it disappeared. I only saw this CD this evening and ordered it. If I can ever get a scanner, and time to type the articles, I'd like to create a Heartbeeps tribute site. I like the movie, and don't care what dissenters say! <br /> <br /> The only problem with the movie was that it was almost over, logical: the robots ran away from the factory to have the freedom to determine their own destiny, to make their own choices; Yet, when the junkyard owners tell them that Phil should go to the factory, to set a "goal" in him, they don't even ask; they just look meaningful to each other, and they go. Along the way, each of the adults loses battery power, and "dies." They are not really dead because they are robots and only need new batteries, but they are treated as "dead", with little Phil crying and rolling over them. So what was the point of this? Phil never gets back to the factory and gets a "goal!" And of course, the junkyard owners couldn't manage them, or they recharged the battery, with backup batteries; but the real point was to have this gripping scene, where the robots all turned, and Phil was left to cry. <br /> <br /> In the end, Val-Com is a golf instructor, and Aqua-Com is - I don't know what. Catskill is an entertainer - what else is H supposed to be? I'm not sure they made it clear. The junkyard owners seem to find it easy, lying on chaise lounges, drinking lemonade from Phil, their "bartender." Val's and Aqua's new "daughter" Philsia - I think the name is - maybe it's Sylvania - doesn't look much more like a table lamp. <br /> <br /> There are missing footage, which is sad - of photos I suspect the missing stuff includes a lovely scene, where Phil has a Christmas, with Val donating him with a car's steering wheel; Aqua produces a horn; Catskill took the fire helmet to give Phil as we saw; and they have Christmas trees. I don't know if any missing footage offers better logic, or if the authors just couldn't think of a better crisis / resolution. The film was finished up to 72-75 minutes to connect with other failed movies. No other reason than that. For a DVD, I would like to create, as I would like to interview the cast / crew and John Williams, and the Merv Griffin interview. Making footage; and reloading the missing footage to make it better.
