The way I found out about this movie was when I looked at American pie 2. At first he had a trailer for Ali G indahouse, I watched the trailer and it just forced me to buy the DVD. It looks incredibly funny! So the next day I went to my local store and picked it up for Â£ 3.99 (Bargain!). The film is about Ali G, who is a "gangster" of the massive crew of the western spots, whose opponents are the massive crew of the east. Ali has a "Cub Scout" packet of kids learning how to survive in the "ghetto" by teaching them how to swear and steal cars. After Ali found out that the government was stopping the money to come to the recreational center where Ali learned The children, he ran for MPs for colors and overthrew another MP in his efforts to get rid of the recreational center make an airport in color. Throughout the film there is a lot of laughter when Ali comes to the crazy stuff! Borat also makes a few seconds in the film, it's a definite movie for all your Sacha Baron Cohen fans out there!
