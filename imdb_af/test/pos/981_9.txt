"Big Fat Liar" comes as a welcome - level but welcome - breath of fresh air to one too many movies with bathrooms, body fluids, pets on acid, gaseous jokes and cross-goats. After all, "See Spot Run," "Max Keeble's Big Move" and "Snow Dogs" indicated the Degenerative Spiral or Kiddie Movie up. Worse is the realization that the young audience will later be satisfied with the smuttier offers of "Not Another Teen Movie" and "Slackers." Written by Nickelodeon producers Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (who co-stars in the 80's sitcom "Head of the Class"), movie stars Frankie Muniz as Jason, who is always ready with a good lie to get rid of. (Where is the English newspaper? Dad boiled on a Swedish meatball.) His teacher (Sandra Oh) released an ultimatum: Turn the paper over at the end of the day or take the summer school. Jason sweeps a story known as "Big Fat Liar" and is hit on the way to school by a limousine carrying insensitive Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Wolf gives him a ride, but Jason leaves his paper behind. No one will hear the truth this time, and Dad tells him he has lost his trust. <br /> <br /> Months later, Jason and best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) see a movie preview for "Big Fat Liar" and go to Los Angeles to make havoc on Wolf's life - all to get a confession that he stole Jason's paper to make the film. They even get the sympathy of some of Wolf's abused employees, including his assistant (Amanda Detmer), former driver (Donald Faison), movie star (Jaleel "Urkel" White, who plays himself) and stunt coordinator (Lee Majors) <br /> <br /> Because "Big Fat Liar" is without the edge known as its sitcom "Malcolm in the Middle", Muniz is easy to root but doesn't have much to work with. Similarly to Bynes, which highlights her own Tracey Ullman sketch on Nickelodeon. All the hamminess is given to Giamatti, whose eyes bow and cheek with every bad insult. <br /> <br /> The movie gets sniffed just by trying the highway, and needs to be enjoyed by its target audience (especially since most of the high jinks occur on Universal Studios lot). But here's a scraper: The message is that it's paid to tell the truth. But didn't we just see Jason go after his refund by telling white lies throughout the film? Well, there is at least no shit.
