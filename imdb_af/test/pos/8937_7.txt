"Plots With A View" of 2002 is a beautiful little comedy, just as the British can do. The film's sense of humor is both moderately morbid and black and yet very sweet and sometimes very slapstick-ish. It's the only movie by director Nick Hurran I've seen so far, and while I'm not going to see any of his other movies (I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies), this one is very pleasant and very funny. The film takes place in a small town in Wales, where Betty Rhys-Jones (Brenda Blethyn) is married to the town's drunk and adulterous chief (Robert Pugh). The local mortis Boris (Alfred Molina) has been desperately in love with Betty since childhood, but has always been too shy to confess his love for her. Apart from falling in love, Boris has a few other problems as the eccentric American mortar Frank Featherbed (Christopher Walken) opened a burial business in the same town. The strange, very British white of the movie should all make sense with humor, and the story is sometimes bizarre. Also, "Plots With A View" wins a wonderful cast. Brenda Bethlyn, who already proved to be a funny lady in 2000's "Save Grace", plays the lead and she is very funny and very fond of her. Alfred Molina, who plays her shy fan, always delivers good performances, and Robert Pugh fits perfectly into the role of Betty's messy man. Beautiful Naomi Watts is also great as the man's secretary. I become a bigger fan with every movie I see. However, the greatest role is played by the incomparable Christopher Walken (one of my favorite actors). Walken is brilliant, as he is always in the role of the eccentric Mortician who rectifies burials that are fairly unorthodox. Overall, "Plots With A View" is a very entertaining British British comedy that I highly recommend!
