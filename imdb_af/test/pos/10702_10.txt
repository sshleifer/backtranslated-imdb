Canadian filmmaker Ron Switzer delivers a solid, incessant thrill of ruthless horror with the brilliant 1991 science film "Science Crazed". A gruesome monster revenge on his mother, a police officer and tenants of an apartment building. Brilliant practical makeup and special effects designs create a frightening monster, especially when leaking through the atmospheric shadows and smoke from the gloomy apartment settings. The characters are beautifully developed with outstanding and surprising touches of performing an ensemble cast. Produced by Donna Switzer, newcomer Ron Switzer also wrote the slideshow of the film. He made an impressive trail ride of twists, turns and terror that guided you to the last frame. Science Crazed will undoubtedly have followed you to the shocking conclusion. Highly recommended!
