I'm not Ebert. What I am is compassionate and I have never felt compassion for a fictional character as I felt for Leland P. Fitzgerald. Sorry if I don't criticize, but I see nothing but perfection in this movie. I'm sure many who see this movie will never see the same things, but if you look hard enough, you might see something you didn't expect. I read that Leland's character was flawed. It seems to me that whoever wrote it could not see the question this movie offers. I feel sorry for anyone who doesn't see the answers this movie is making. Open your heart more than your mind, and you'll be able to give this Leland P. Fitzgerald a world that truly has a meaning. Exceptional story with extraordinary acting. Ryan Gosling deserves to be spoken.
