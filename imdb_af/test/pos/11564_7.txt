Dakota Incident is a curiosity for several reasons. It will be clear from the outset that it has been made long before anyone ever thought of political correctness. Although the Ward Bond character softens the edge of "maybe we can communicate with them, it's also people," they say. His part is next to each other with the preacher's companion to communicate with the Martians in the World War. In fact, it's rude. The title is also curious. Use of the word "Incident" carries an interest and sophistication in the movie that is unlikely to hurt box office. The combined range of characters and Linda Darnell's fancy dress and hat are wonderfully dated making the Dakota Incident a cool mid-fifties western artifact.
