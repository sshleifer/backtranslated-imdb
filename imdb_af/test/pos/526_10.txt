Never before have I been so impressed with a movie as this piece about four groups of people, who are experiencing a crisis or a lot. In some ways, it's a bit like shortcuts, but totally different. At the same time, there are a lot of lead characters, all of whom get to know well as their stories unfold, and they are, if people show their good and bad sides, their weaknesses and their strengths, with lots of drama and laughter. <br /> <br /> I think the closest equivalent in a US movie is much weaker. In all respects are the Royal Tenenbaums. <br /> <br /> Four shades of Brown, as the title would be in English, tell the story of a stressed hotelier and his wife, and his older parents (who are magicians); about the receptionist at an animal crematorium and his family's misadventures; about the members of a cooking course (mostly talking about their sorry lives) and fourth about the funeral for a troll jockey, trying to sing the family from outside the grave and appear in 3D at the funeral. to hi-tech equipment that costs its entire fortune (the family gets zero, not even the famous horse is given to the family!) <br /> <br /> There is a warmth and compassion in this movie, which is filled with sorrow and laughter, which I have never experienced before. <br /> <br /> Most actors were new to me, except Robert Gustafsson and one or two, but they all deserve the big slam that the movie at Swedish Guldbagge <br /> <br /> Male, Female and male supporting actor prizes went to this movie, plus another, to get started! <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, check it out - the hours fly fast!
