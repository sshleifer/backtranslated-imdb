It is really good to see that Van Damme's film is getting better, especially when compared to C-grade flops "Derailed" and "Second in command" which were both tragic and not in a good way. The Sheperd: Border patrol is a good action movie with some very good action / fighting sequences. It's good to know that Van Damme still knows how to kick, as his last movie "Until Death" had no martial art in it. <br /> <br /> It is said, this movie is significantly inferior to "To Death" which was a very good turn for Van Damme. "To death" most Van Damme movies did not overlook, but were dark and eager and Van Damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that movie. Still, The Shepherd is definitely a movie that is especially watched by Van Damme fans or action movie fans in general, but if you are looking for a movie with a little more storyline ..... you can do this a leftover! <br /> <br /> I believe this movie was done well enough, especially on what small budget it would have been shot. The only real problem I have with this movie is the title; "The Shepherd"? I don't get it! I suspect that "Border Patrol" just doesn't have the same ring for it without the word "Shepherd" for it !!! <br /> <br /> My rating for this movie is 7 out of 10, but it's not in any other movie category by Van Damme movie standards. <br /> <br /> That is good for a Van Damme movie.
