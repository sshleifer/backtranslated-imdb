For those who loved "Wayne's World" .......... And hell, even Raiders of the Lost Ark, you'll find a lot (but probably not love) in "Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny , a fictional epic about the formation of the JB (Jack Black) / KG (Kyle Gass) band, two out-of-work losers with a love for rock n'roll are met with a dilemma when KG's long-standing support mom stops sending him checks JB and KG trace the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after a saga music shop clerk (an inspired Ben Stiller) tells them about the titular pick (a funny animated tapestry sequence gives the background) Along the way, our zeroes meet a Snaggle-tedious stranger (a game of Tim Robbins), Sasquatch, Stoner security guards, Sorority chicks, and Satan himself (an ironic-thrown Dave Grohl) in a climatic sequence should be believed (and preferably played at high volume), rarely do I see comedies in the theater, but "Pick" is a very good tempovera netting ... it should not rise to 11, but it both prunes roughly and cleverly for a good 90 minutes. And the songs are inspired by low-brown hilarity. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10
