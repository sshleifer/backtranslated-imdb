Have you ever wondered how it feels to feel FREE? I am sure that each one of us knows the meaning of freedom and never thinks seriously of using it to our advantage. HARI OM shows the audience that freedom actually means. In this film, freedom is described in the form of style represented by Isa's discovery of India. Isa discovers her inner true love when she travels in a Rickshaw journey with Mr. HARI OM is. She looks at life differently and presents freedom that limits every woman in herself when in a relationship. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth a watch, and I saw it for the first time in Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF), and I left the cinema with full satisfaction. <br /> <br /> "Watch it"!
