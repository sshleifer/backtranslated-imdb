Absolutely quoting! Director Arthur Hiller and author Paddy Chayefsky breaks the US hospital system with this evil comedy / drama / whodunit. The hospital depicted here is fraught with problems ... from the protests of neighbors to evade patients from a possible serial killer on the loose. George C. Scott is the top doctor on the brink of his own nervous disorder with generous Diana Rigg and her crazy Barnard Hughes. Alternately depressed and restless, the HOSPITAL contains the most acid-toned dialogue imaginable (note how Scott describes his love session with Rigg). It also has very good vignettes: Scott robs Nurse Nancy Marchand after one of the underarms accidentally killed a doctor; daffy administrator Frances Sternhagen desperately tries to collect insurance information from a waiting room full of sick people; Scott is approaching the hospital psychiatrist after telling him about his difficult home life. All the acting is first class. Scott and Rigg are dynamite and Hughes is a real surprise. The movie is a masterpiece with Chayefsky's script that deserves a well-deserved Oscar (about such a tight competition such as CLOTH & Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). The opening narrative is invaluable.
