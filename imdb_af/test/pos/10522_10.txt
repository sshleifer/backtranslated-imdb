In the early 80's I recorded the DION BROTHERS, broadcast TV (with the ads). I borrowed it from many friends, and everyone agrees that this is one of the best B-bandits ever made. One day, as I walked to my NYC apartment, I saw Stacy Keach for a TV show, Mickey Spilane. We had a moment to talk, and I told him how much I enjoyed the DION BROS and considered it a pure classic. He thanked me and said it was one of the best and most memorable movie experiences of his career. He was very friendly and sincere and I was grateful for the few moments he had taken to talk to a fan. This is a classic DVD.
