Didn't have much aspiration for this movie, but was pleasantly surprised. Very well-made film, very well-cut, does not really know what Human Traffic has done, but it is a very good effort. Well directed, and I thought the lead actor created an excellent performance! In fact, the only very bad performance in the movie was from Tim Curry, which is supposed to be the name. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Cool Film didn't do better than it did. I never heard it until I saw it with a friend. <br /> <br /> I'm not a raver, but I suggest people who really like this movie.
