Jennifer Gray looks the most unlikely of romantic clues and this is probably why this beloved movie is such a firearm. It is very good to do a version of Montagus and Capulets with sweeteners, such as dancing and damage-free baiting. Jewish society-family tropics are thrown in, but usually there should be an X-factor. <br /> <br /> Swayze probably makes this movie safe with its robust, after-Travolta movements and temperament, but it is overcome by this curly Penelope Pitstop teen who brings the dream to the reach of the impressive market. The super (dated, perhaps "immortal") soundtrack helps and, of course, the shrewd arrogance to put the film away in daily life, which makes the fantasy finer. 10/07
