Even if you are not a "theater person," I strongly recommend that you see it. Based on a play by the same name by Christopher Bond (which in turn was based on an old London legend), Sondheim did a wonderful job of bringing it to the music theater stage. The score is just wonderful - by far Sondheim's best, and probably one of the best scores ever written for a musical. The show is very well thrown, and my only complaint is from Betsy Joscelyn's portrayal of Johanna. It's good, you think, and she's a very versatile actress, but she doesn't just sing "Greenfinch and Linnet Bird". But other than that, it's all phenomenal - Angela Lansbury * has the role of Mrs. Lovette made, and she does it just as well. George Hearn was a good substitute for Len Cariou in the title role, and Ken Jennings gives a good performance as Tobias. The end will give you cold fever. Top points for a great show.
