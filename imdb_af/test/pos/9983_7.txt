Disney's Buena Vista Pictures offers a wonderful story-based sports drama directed by actor Bill Paxton. Photography is wonderful, but the story sometimes hangs together. This film is about 20-year-old amateur golfer Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) and his competition in the American Open 1913. What a story; A one-off opportunity for a so-called inept young man to play alongside the best golfers of the time, including British champions Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) and Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus). A storybook ends up leaving a knot in the throat. The movie also includes: Peter Firth, Elias Koteas, Marnie McPhail, Robin Wilcox, and possibly the show is Josh Flitter, who plays Eddie Lowery, Ouimet's caddy and best friend.
