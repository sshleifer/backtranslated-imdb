For those who are not knowledgeable, the Asterix books are a very successful series of comics about a town of inevitable Galles who resist emperor's invasion, thanks to a magic that makes them invincible super-men. There were several animated features (just one of them, The Twelve Tasks or Asterix, which really made the books and the spirit of the books despite an original screenplay) before a perfect movie, Christian Clavier and Gerard Depardieu, starred in two lively action adjustments that were successful throughout Europe but had no impression in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> The unencrypted French version is very nice, but apparently not available in a version with English subtitles outside the UK DVD. While there is still no sign of an American theater or DVD edition, the Miramax version of Asterix et Obelix: Mission Cleopatre is also on the DVD (and played on British TV), and you'll never guess what - It was completely redesigned (at least 21 minutes past) and dubbed in English. Perhaps Harve touched it for a Hong Kong movie - he never saw a strange movie he didn't think could be improved by heavy reprocessing and shelving for a few years. <br /> <br /> About Asterix et Obelix Contre Cesar was lovingly bought in English from a particularly good translation by Terry Jones, but otherwise left unchanged, that kind of thing is not really the Miramax way. The results are not good. The film was the best attempt to get the book mix of slapstick, anachronisms and highbrow classic humorous aside to the screen, but many of the classic references are gone (such as the great Raft of the Medusa sight gag or the Cyrano de Bergerac references of Depardieu), along with anything that seems to be French or perhaps slows down the picture, with the result that the first 20 minutes is now a real slogan. Several punchlines to rows are missing, Depardieu's part is finished (its part was already quite small due to its serious health problems during the shooting: the American version is partially digitally rearranged to change the unhealthy bleach of its face into the original!), And like usually with dubbing, because literal translations in English do not fit well, lines are rushed so quickly that they are no longer funny, or the dialogue is completely changed (some of these changes are indeed funny, like one character dreams of) a world in which he can move his lips into French and hear the words in English. <br /> <br /> Not a total disaster, but very disappointing in the light of how complete the version is. Be thinking that Miramax will do a Shaolin football and release both versions, but since they have both been filming for two years after paying $ 45 million, another classic case of Harvey's infamous chronic k oper's repentance. Disney was so p **** d at their overspending) and has no release plans yet, it may just be too much wishful thinking. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that such an accessible and entertaining movie will now be available only to non-French speakers in such claws. The spicy Gauls seem to have defeated Caesar's legions, but have no Miramax jacket match.
