I am a big movie enthusiast and also an active rugby player who believes rugby is the biggest game ever played. Forever Strong is a mix of Coach Carter and messy rugby. This movie is full of big plays, well-developed characters and action shots that will duck and dodge you in, but with more arm tackles than squeaky soccer and almost every shot, as soon as a player is shooting the ground to almost like football. look. If you want to bring your kids to see a movie that will build character from within and inspire a blind man to see it again, I can easily give it out of 9 out of 10 if you want to see a big rugby movie the sport really shows. You have to wait for the next one because Forever Strong mostly practice, run, and a little movie, because I give it a 7.75 out of 10.
