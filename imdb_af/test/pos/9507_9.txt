They were an alternative before there was an alternative, The residents are a bond like no other, and I love them. It has all their classics, from 'Hello Skinny', 'Third Reich and Roll' to their tribute to the great James Brown assuming 'This is a Man's Man's Man's World'. But that's just the beginning. As a bonus, even Renaldo & the Loafs have a spectacularly beautiful 'Songs for Swinging Larvae' and even the Residents' coverage of it. Needless to say, I strongly recommend purchasing this DVD, I also recommend buying their latest album 'Demons Dance Alone', which is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Uncle Willie Eyeball Buddy # 502
