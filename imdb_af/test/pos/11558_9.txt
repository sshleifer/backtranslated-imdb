When Melville's "Pierre, or The Ambiguities" bookshops hit in 1852, his first publication since "Moby Dick" a year earlier, was the public response similar to that found under the "POLA X" IMDB reviews. Newspapers even published headlines such as: "Melville Insane!" which of course he was. But if one compares the writing styles in "Moby Dick" and "Pierre", one finds in the latter a sharp deviation from the simple and often declamatory style found in the former. It was evident that he mimicked the excess flower of the now-forgotten Victorian Romans, who chose his immortal "Moby Dick". However, he was not happy to portray the kind of product his publishers wanted, and it would certainly have sold. His version of a Victorian romance was perhaps a twisted, cynical one, but brilliant in his synthesis. The alternative title: "The ambiguity" is quite appropriate. As Pierre seeks and thinks he finds the truth, we become more and more uncertain about what and who to believe. As he looks for happiness, he becomes increasingly miserable. <br /> <br /> "POLA X" is a fascinating adaptation of this novel, located in modern or almost modern France. Although it leaves little imagination in some ways, and we graphically show the turbulent relationships Melville can only indicate. The ambiguities that make the novel and its message so attractive are perfectly intact. The questions it poses are those who thought few movies were asking, but the responses were left to the viewer. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading this novel, which is much shorter than "Moby Dick", before seeing this movie. I hope more people will discover this vibrant movie.
