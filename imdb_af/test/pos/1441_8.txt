A very good look at the world and the realities of a heroin addict. The film is one that gets too close to home to those involved in the drug culture and has knowledge of what a heroin addict is (or is to be). Good movie, which will never really be outdated. Excellent performances by everyone involved and the minimalist set are Preminger's way of showing how dark a JUNKIE's world can become. Worth watching - a kind of education. The golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain in which a junkie lives.
