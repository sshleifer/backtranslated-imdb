In & Out is a comedy with a simple starting point. It's great to be in the mission of being funny and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The comedy in this movie ranges from the ridiculous to the sublime, physical comedy, along with dry humor, with a good veteran performance by Bob Newhart. Kevin Kline is predictable in excellent form in this film, along with Tom Selleck who does not play on his expected "square match" front man type. Mr. Selleck plays his humor well and shows a good sense of comedic timing. The film makes this movie successful. <br /> <br /> Not all gay-themed movies are made to promote a kind of sinister, hidden Hollywood liberal agenda. In fact, this movie is made easy to entertain, and if any Some of these films make the viewer think, then it was a by-product of the well-directed work of tremendous role players. Often in the cheek I laughed at the right moment. A solid "B."
