But the movie is now at the comics, it doesn't matter. This film radically moves away from the boredom of "Maintenance with the Vampire" (though it was acting well) and slipping into the wonderful action scenes. Very convincing story and interesting with surprisingly good behavior from everyone. Disadvantage - poor graphics. Does it matter? Nope.
