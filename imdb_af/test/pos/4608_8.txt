Universal studios. The name evokes so many memories of the horror fans of beautiful carpet paintings ... there ... landscapes, fog-reprinting countrysides, full moons, weeping wolves, tavern and torch wielding mobs. Yet it is rather strange to look back at those movies, how little the era that the true classics produced lasted. The 30's had their masterpieces, but it was mostly from the same directors and many of their films are mostly of historical interest today. The 40's made more unconscious fun-matine movies than they did in the arts. Most fans agree that the classic era of Gothic horror films ended with 'House of Dracula' in 1945, beaten and officially by the Abbott & Costello comedies. dead in the 50's and the advent of the atomic era. <br /> <br /> It is strange, therefore, that one of Universal's best Gothics was created in the 50's! This alone makes the film a strange one, as costume drama was on its way everywhere. It can't be compared to the all-time classics like James Whale and The Wolfman, but it damages all the fun elements of those movies in a wonderful surprise! Get ready for nothing but pure entertainment! As several social mores have changed, the film also enjoys violence that would not have been allowed before; There is no blood, but we see characters shot and stabbed, and there is even a burning torch in the face! <br /> <br /> The movie may not be a horror movie, but it has the atmosphere, look and feel of one! It begins with the death of the night with crying winds (and wolves) when two men seal the tombs of two seemingly dead young lovers, BUT WAIT! One of them is not dead, but he cannot move! He is trapped, but speaks quietly in his own mind, cannot communicate! What is his story? Now it's how you start a horror movie .... <br /> <br /> English businessman Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene, who performs one of his best performances) is named Richard Beckett for the disappearance of two friends of his disappearing into the castle of one-eyed Austrian Earl Von Bruno (did Sacha Baron Cohen see it?). It seems many years ago that Bruno suggested as a god to the African natives to steal ivory, he was exposed by Burton's men and the natives upset him. Now he is giving revenge. <br /> <br /> The movie has all the clichés, a Jonathan Harker style ride to the castle, an inn full of cautious residents, deaths and a hiding staff (Lon Chaney Jr.). The torture scenes are actually exciting, including a floor panel that activates a heavy door (which later creates an ingenious breakaway scene), a hunting expedition with an imported panther (!!! ??) and even n alligatorput! And then there is the Romeo & Juliet-style fake death that leads to the movie's prologue .... <br /> <br /> The plot is cliché and the world view is black and white. But it's still incredibly entertaining, with director Nathan Juran making every scene hoping for the atmosphere and looking fresh and new. There are also several plot holes. Why does Ronald try to leave the castle so early? And he never solves the mystery that happened to his friends, although it goes without saying, but he does not know it when he gives up and he looked it so earlier. Weird. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great. Despite being a rude superclass, Richard Greene Burton makes one of the most favorable protagonists I've ever seen in a horror movie. Rita Corday is excellent as the count's 'farmer wife' who becomes Burton's love interest. She may have the stereotypical "in love" problem of all the film heroes of this era, but her portrayal of a long-suffering woman in a loveless marriage with a sadistic monster is very convincing, she also shows a suspicion and there is little film hero of this era, and even a forced attempt by Burton to silence her (and to poke her chain, though it is just to analyze as it has an important idea) as a rape attempt, but she never looks nasty in her paranoia, the audience sympathizes with her. Although he fails to make Von Bruno look really strange and out-of-the-world (he is a villain in a horror movie), Stephen McNally gives a truly different performance to the sadistic nobleman. When he reveals and burns his burnt eye, it's really scary. Lon Chaney Jr. is also wonderful if she is dumb farmer Gargon. <br /> <br /> But best performance is unmistakable by Boris Karloff as the mysterious doctor, dr. Meissen. He only has a small screen time, but steals every scene he is in. It is a show that is screaming, sad, secretive and ultimately heroic. As he learns to apply leeches to one of Bruno's henchmen, we spy on our hero and speak in the well-known 'You know I'm not really good' voice just what Karloff can do, you're wondering if he's a hero or villain, always crook. And even though he functions as the principal agent of our hero's escape, he still shows human irregularities such as greed and fear of his own life, even poisoning a man for Burton's benefits cold-blooded before even getting Burton. His plan to help our hero and hero flight also places them directly in the clutches of von Bruno, as he arranges an amazingly sadistic (as incredibly flawed) death for those who inspired similar scenes in Corman's Poe series. He may not have much screen time, but it's easily one of Boris's best performances. <br /> <br /> While the end may seem sudden and anti-climate to some, half of the fun is there, and there's a lot of excitement. to be. Kick back and relive the days when heroes and heroes were villains. It's not a masterpiece, but it's incredibly fun at its best.
