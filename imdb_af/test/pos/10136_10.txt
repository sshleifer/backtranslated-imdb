This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! How anyone can beat this movie, oppresses my imagination! First, Gooding and Harris's performances were simply spectacular, especially Gooding. This is the only way I can describe the play: spectacular! You have to imagine how difficult it would be to play and subtract such a character; then you see Gooding, and his performance was magical. Regarding the plot, as it is based on a real person, it goes where the characters' lives go. For all the action buffs, it can be a bit slow, but then it's not an action movie. I definitely give this movie a 10. It does not deserve anything!
