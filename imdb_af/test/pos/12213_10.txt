I enjoy the show surface a lot. The show is very entertaining and it's a clean show. A show like surface is interesting. It keeps my attention. It has compassion and tension. I love all the actors on the show. They are all very good choices. I think it's very important to have the right cast of any show, because that's what represents a success and of course the screens and the show itself. Television has changed so much over the years. It has changed in good manners and in bad. I love comedy, action, tension and romance. And scifi. But Surface is a show I hope to come back to for many seasons, as it is a wonderful show and it is something families can watch. My kids are growing, but my husband and I like to look at these kinds of things. I appreciate your time and express my opinion. <br /> <br /> Thank you. <br /> <br /> Paulette Blackwell
