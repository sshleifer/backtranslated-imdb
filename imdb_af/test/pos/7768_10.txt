Late film critic Gene Siskel said this movie shows how easy it is to make a movie. He gave it a compliment, although it can now be regarded as an insult. Although I do not always agree with Gene Siskel, I agree with him here. Love Jones is a brilliant example of how a love story should be: realistic with real characters in real-life situations. <br /> <br /> The story chronicles the ups and downs of the relationship between Darius Lovehall (Larenz Tate) and Nina (Nia Long). Larenz Tate and Nia Long are more than just a beautiful couple on the screen. These two actually have chemistry together. You can feel the vibe between these two when it's on the screen and its fantastic. <br /> <br /> Bill Bellamy is pretty funny, because the fraudulent Wood and Lisa Nicole Carson are great like Nina's friend Simone. Isaiah Washington is as big as Darius good friend Savon and I sigh every time I see him in a movie. The man is a good actor whose career has been ruined by the industry's low lifes and the childish games they play. You can believe he called the little weasel on Gray's Anatomy from his name, but anyone who knows how to work Follywood knows better than believing an "official story" of the place he believes. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Love Jones is a wonderful love story full of interesting and fun characters who are in realistic situations that anyone who has fallen in love can also relate. You love these people because they are credible and not portrayed as gangsters and tramps. Not one obscure stereotype can be found here. Contrast it with the romance films of toady. Exactly. Eventually, if you like Black Cinema, you'll do well to own a copy of this movie.
