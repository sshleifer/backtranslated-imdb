Following the great success of Nick Park and the Aardman team with the Wallace and Gromit short animations, we now have the first (hopefully many) feature with the plastic characters who have so much love. The DVD of the movie has probably been best used to the longest duration of my two children's Christmas gifts. The plot of the movie is straight enough, but the beauty of the W&G movies for me is the background gags. There are lots of front gags and slapstick for kids and adults to enjoy, but the wallpaper is the killer for me. Already in a classic addition to an already classic filmography for Nick Park et al and I would recommend fans and new viewers to watch this movie .... often.
