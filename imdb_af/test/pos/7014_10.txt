One night, after she turned away from a resort activity, she bumped into an all-night dance party with Johnny Castle and other fellow dancers. Quickly captivated by the racial dance moves, 'Baby' is eager to learn when to fill Penny just so she and Johnny don't lose their jobs at the resort. But young 'Baby' quickly finds her in a tough situation; she fell in love with a man she knew her father would never approve. However, when Johnny is accused of stealing wallets, it's "Baby" to confirm his alibi by admitting she was with him the night. Johnny is dismissed anyway to get involved with a visitor, but quickly realizes what a mistake it has left 'Baby'.
