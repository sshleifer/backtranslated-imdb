So when I first saw Greek ads, I had some questions about how to approach Greek life if they wanted to give away sacred mystery secrets, if they would focus on the brother and sister's brotherhood or bring mastery, or what most college kids think of Greek life as a big party. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it all covered. The story plot was wonderful, it gave you a character to love, hate, someone you want to be, someone you don't want to be, and of course a crazy roommate! <br /> <br /> It was one of my first looks at what writers believed Greek life looked like and I can honestly say that they nail the nail nicely. <br /> <br /> I loved how one of the biggest things they had experienced during the season was the relationship between Rusty and his crazy roommate. It's hard enough to move away from home and be forced to live in a small room with someone you don't even know, then come out to find out. You have nothing in common. Probably every college bound freshmens worst nightmare. <br /> <br /> Rusty's sister Casey was almost the typical girl on campus. Everyone is jealous. What didn't she have? Oh that's right. Everything for herself. Rebecca and Evan had an "affair" early in the season, which made Casey feel quite sympathetic. Her character has evolved, and her relationship with Rusty has become increasingly loving and outgoing. <br /> <br /> Cappie is one of the most beautiful favorite characters, and absolutely insane. One of my favorite episodes brought him to a strip club, and Rusty had to phone Casey to sponsor them. I love how they addressed the issue of gay people in Greek homes. Calvin was a very real emotional character, and I really respected him for keeping to his standards. So Jen K was pretty crazy, but she really liked Rusty. It was amazing and I questioned her from the beginning, but of course I wanted to work it out between her and Rusty. <br /> <br /> I definitely look forward to returning the Greek. It takes you into the truth of Greek life, something that many people overlook. One of the biggest things known for freaks and tournaments is partying and drinking. Greek is a good performance, and the characters are easy to relate to.
