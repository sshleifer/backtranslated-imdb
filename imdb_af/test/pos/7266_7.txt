A very watchable movie, and one that dared to see the trailer a few times. <br /> <br /> The whole thing looks beautiful, from the ridiculous efforts of the little upper class to leaving themselves from the mediocre, to the lower class sham that just tries to keep their heads above the dirt, take the film the spirit of the 18th century brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Jonny Lee Miller plays Maclean very well, though the part doesn't really matter, and Robert Carlyle looks a little wasted on Plunkett, Miller's highwayman colleague. <br /> <br /> The real star of the show was undoubtedly Ken Stott, Chance (a kind of 1740's chief of police) plays with an evil movie, and someone who enjoys the color and style of Peter Greenaway's movies will keep its appearance, though the thinness of the plot becomes . clear before the 2 hours on. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
