Harvey Keitel gives a typical top performance in one of his first roles as a bitter, ambitious, uncompromising young staff producer Coleman Buckmaster, a truly talented hot shot with a clear "golden ear" and son of a well-known jazz pianist to start. Coleman's eagerness to cut a few songs with the group's smokin's R&B outfit (none other than Earth, Wind & Fire in their terribly funky prime), but its sleek commercial Groedhead label A-Chord Records that, by incessant, mob-linked means of the Jerry's roadside (a proper unhip Ed Nelson) want him to sing a hit for the spectacular Carpenters-like pop porridge trio The Pages, an alleged squeaky clean bunch. Includes an eminent pedophile stepfather Franklin. Bert Parks, bitchy, neurotic daughter Velor (a fine, brief turn by Cynthia Bostwick), and hedonistic smack addict Gary (Jimmy Boyd of the former 50's). The extremely naive and idealistic Coleman must teach pronto how the music business really works and the downdown dirty game, as well as it can, or it will lose the group as well as its credibility. <br /> <br /> Accepting a sharp, invasive, corrosive hard and unbiased prescription from syndicated column and rock journalist Robert Lipsyte, director Sig Shore (best known for producing Superfly) shows a definite cynical and unobstructed portraying the various bribes, installments, broken promises, back stabbing, ambiguities and double talks that are an unpleasant but intrinsic part of the large-scale corrupt rock music business, with particularly thorough thematic aspects of art versus trade, to fight for its artistic integrity to retain the then recent push to homogenize rock to mere, useless, creative stagnant mainstream respect. In addition, this gritty, downbeat gem offers a rare, fascinating, minutiae-detailed and full-bodied backdrop to the recording process as a recording console cowboy. Coleman struggles gamely in his own words to "make chicken salad from chickens." It looks like it's a spectacular piece, and the legendary "fifth Beatle" Murray's K is learning, lecherous DJ Big John Little. (Velor bites his hand after Big John hit her shell during a life-on-air interview!), New York soul DJ and host of NBC's Friday Night Videos Frankie Crocker as his own jazzy'n'jivin himself, R&B singer-songwriter Doris Troy (she wrote the beautiful "Just One Look") as a church pianist and tubby, naked 70's blaxploitation favorite Charles MacGregor as a priest at a wedding. The rather poor sound and Allan Metzger's messy cinematography accidentally adds to the film's overall, rough-round-the-edge documentary style authenticity. Although technically lacking, this movie is generally still one of the 70's most bitterly pessimistic, unpopular rocksploitation gems.
