It is from the question that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia. Apart from many distinctive differences in physical appearance (Anderson's eyes are probably bigger, lips thicker, nose bigger and turned up at the end ... etc). Anderson's unable to speak Russian is a ridiculous story ...... That's why I seduce Anna Anderson and her allies so much. Not many scammers have the audacity and endurance to make scams for 60+ years with such a blatantly untenable scheme. <br /> <br /> However, I have some sympathy for Anna Anderson. Life in those days had to be difficult for a young Polish farmer. And personalizing another woman for 60+ years is a difficult task for anyone. She had to keep her fleshy lips constantly mimicking the thin lips of Anastasia and had to be skinny at times to make people believe that all her chaotic memory was. just a result of spiritual problem. <br /> <br /> Anna Anderson was a wonderful woman on the wrong track. If she looked good, learned elegance, endurance, acting skills in proper use, she could make a first-rate actress. <br /> <br /> On a synonym: Some main characters from these two parties look like the real numbers. Prince Erich may be a mixture of Gleb Botkin (believed by most possible brains behind the entire scheme), Duke George and Dmitri van Leuchtenberg, and several other figures. And Darya Romanoff seems to be based on the beautiful Princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova. But unlike the right allies, Prince Erich was unmotivated in this performance and Anna supported her for love and sincere faith in her, which touched. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good show. Fixed a little, but still remain true to reality. The power of Amy Irving's acting lies lies in the fact that she has successfully represented Anderson's self-confidence. The mixture of other people and themselves is intriguing. Just as Princess Xenia said about Anderson: "She was herself at all times and never had the slightest impression of doing a part." Highly recommended.
