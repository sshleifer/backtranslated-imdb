From all the Mafia movies I've ever seen, this is one of the best for many reasons. The acting of Pesci, Cortese and Vincent. The story is one of the best ever (in the mafia genre), as it is realistic. The characters are people that many people can connect to. This movie is also great, as this dialogue is good. It also has many realistic battles and action scenes. This film also started the careers of Pesci and Vincent. If it wasn't for the success of this movie, Casino and Goodfellas might not be as good as they were. <br /> <br /> Story 10/10 Acting 9/10 Realism 10/10 <br /> <br /> GENERAL 10/10 <br /> <br /> My favorite Mafia movies are <br /> 1: Goodfellas 2: Casino 3: The Godfather Trilogy 4: Family Enforcer (The Death Collector) 5: The Sopranos (I know this is not a movie)
