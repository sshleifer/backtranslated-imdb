This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress playing Elvira's mistress of the dark. For a while, the nurse's actress, who would give her wedding ring, was the owner of Roy Munsin in King Pin. It's the most glorious story ever to be told. It must sell more copies than the Bible. My parents played a role in the proposal for the release of this movie to a local movie. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it. The lady who gave the gift (family friend) was let out by the theater. I was 3 years old. I burned 4 copies on VHS and finally converted it to DVD. It is pretty.
