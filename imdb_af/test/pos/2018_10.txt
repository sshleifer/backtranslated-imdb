After reading previews for this movie, I thought it would be a deviation, but after I got my region 1 DVD (the DVD was available before the movie played UK theater), I was pleasantly surprised. Strong performances of all roles make it a great movie. The fact that the text is reasonably weak means that you do not fall into the story and therefore the repetition view factor is greater. I recommend this movie to everyone <br /> <br />
