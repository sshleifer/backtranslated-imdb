With all the shoot-em up, blood horror movies that came in the last minute. "Saw, Hostal, Saw 2, The Hills has eyes" Yes, they have their place, don't get me wrong! The other night I watched with my friend when a stranger called! Why? Because this is a remake of the 1979 classic, which was excellent and frightened at the time, you know what from everyone! I didn't know what to expect. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It was a movie made of mood, atmosphere, excitement! Because people you can't see, what you think you see, what you can't hear, or what you think you hear is much more scarce than you do! If you like movies with mood, creepiness, tension and atmosphere! You will love it! It brought it back to the roots of the original Halloween. Thumbs up, a solid 8.5 out of 10 Remember people, that's well done! not perfect! It's ghostly, not bloody. It's a scam, not a pity! It was nice to see a movie coming so long. Our minds are conditioned and distorted by the glamor and shock of today's horror movies, we forget, what is really scary.
