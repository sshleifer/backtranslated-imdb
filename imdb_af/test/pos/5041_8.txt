1996's MICHAEL is hot and wins the comedy fantasy that features one of my favorite performances from the John Travolta Library. Travolta gives one of his breeziest and most enjoyable performances such as Michael, an archangel whose silence at a lonely innkeeper's home, Pansy (Jean Stapleton), is disrupted as Pansy Michael's presence in her home on a " National Enquirer-like newspaper report and editor (Bob Hoskins) sends reporters (William Hurt, Andie McDowell, Robert Pastorelli) to the motel to test it out. Hurt, McDowell, and Pastorelli are pretty good as the news personnel messed up. They had a hard time accepting that they had met an angel, but it was Travolta's performance and he ruled as a bitter, sugar-eating, cake-loving, Aretha lover, chasing Michael, a angel who not only thinks of you when you think of angels. And you must love the scene in the bar when he and the ladies dance to "Chain of Fools". I like this movie more and more every time I see it and this is mainly due to the complete winning performance of John Travolta.
