Having seen enough movies, there are very few who do not remind you of other movies. Yet, it was a watchful and somewhat disturbing movie. I had to switch it off from time to time and later return. Like 'Silence of the Lambs', it contains the quest for a serial killer who kidnapped someone and restricted her to his room of horror. Like 'Flatliners', the main character examines a dream world through an experimental procedure. The surrealism of the dream sequence is what makes this movie, as one finds the characters in a situation and landscape where anything can happen literally. And beyond this continuity and 'make sense' is not necessary, which also makes it a movie maker's dream. <br /> <br /> The only thing that looks slightly like is the fact that one ultimately hopes for the deliverance of the serial killer or the exorcism of his demons. You really feel sympathy for the boy inside the man, but clearly the innocence of the boy cannot be separated from the terrible acts of the man. The focus swings as needed to save the man to save his victim.
