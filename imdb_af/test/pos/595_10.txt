I always loved The Muppets. Although most children's entertainment was not so enjoyable, The Muppet's. The Muppet's are very, very funny. They are probably the most beautiful children's characters ever. <br /> <br /> Not only did The Muppets have their own show. They also played in various films. from The Muppet's Christmas Carol after The Muppet's Treasure Island. The first Muppet movie, The Muppet movie, was also, like the show and the other movies, excellent. <br /> <br /> The Muppet movie is about how they all started. Kermit lived the frog in a swamp. Until one day, a film executive told him there were auditions for frogs in Hollywood. So Kermit takes off for Hollywood. Along the way he walks into many people like Fozzie Bear, Gonzo the Great, and Miss Piggy. Also, an evil man tries to catch Kermit. <br /> <br /> All the Muppet movies are very enjoyable. I mean they are all very funny. This film has a lot of film appearances. Like Steve Martin, Mel Brooks, Elliot Gould, Carol Kane, Richard Pryor and Orson Welles. The Muppet movies are all very enjoyable. I hear Jason Segel will soon die. I can't wait to see it.
