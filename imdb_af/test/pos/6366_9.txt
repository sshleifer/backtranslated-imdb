I agree with the comments already posted by the previous author on this site. <br /> <br /> I only stumbled upon this movie in the 80's when I was employed at a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately, many of the barbels aimed at the psychiatric profession hit home. I especially enjoyed the end, where the psychiatrist will speak to Grodin's hospital. Trust me, it's pretty accurate. <br /> <br /> Of course, doors at most psychiatric hospitals are not closed, nor are straight jackets used nowadays, and any hospital must be licensed to have a "stuffed room". br /> <br /> But a wonderfully understated movie, and definitely one that's quite amusing. <br /> <br /> Jeff
