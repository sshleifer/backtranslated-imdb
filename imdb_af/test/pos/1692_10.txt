Krajobraz po bitwie like many films by Wajda may not be understandable to the "rest of the world". Story based on the few short stories of Tadeusz Borowski, who were camps of Oswiecim, Dachau and Dautmergen during World War II. Borowski in his books describes the inhuman life in the Nazi camps from the point of view of the warriors of the parish of the writer who was also in the privileged position of the prisoners. Borowski was merciless to mankind and merciless to himself. He describes human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation. Ironically, after returning to Poland, he stopped writing artistic prose and became a communist propagandist who produced the stream of anti-imperialist and anti-American press publications. After a few years he committed suicide. In the film, Wajda changes point of view. Vorarbeiter Tadek - character created by Tadeusz Janczar - plays only supporting role. Story is focused on the poet, destroyed, burned by war and imprisonment and his one-day love affair with Nina, the Jewish girl who escaped from communist Poland, though she actually hates Jewish life and mentality. As a backdrop we can observe the sadness of the so-called "dipis" (displaced) life, which is settled in SS barracks after the liberation of the Americans. Marches, patriotic kitsch mixed with the hunt for the extra dose of food and / or produce German girls. <br /> <br />
