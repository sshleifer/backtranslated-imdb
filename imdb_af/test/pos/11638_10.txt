From start to finish, these 1926 classic two reels from the Hal Roach Studios seem to be fun over the 20's.

Recently released on video and disk, it is one of ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by audiences of all ages. Although Charley Chase dropped his star today, he was regarded as the leader in the short subject comedy in the apostate years. He helped Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy careers before they were brought together as a team, Leo McCarey and a host of other talents. It is a pity that he is still remembered today.
