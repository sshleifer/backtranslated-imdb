Paul Rudnick (Jeffrey, Addams Family Values) wrote this shrill story of a moderate school teacher (Kevin Kline) who was eliminated at the Academy Awards by a former student (Matt Dillon). The rest of the film deals with the absurdities that revolve around this setting. The effect on the town, his fiancee (Joan Cusack), self and climaxes with an all-love-all final. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a gay real-life activist or a naive youth for an accurate portrayal of a man's battle to come out or a "true" portrayal of gay life, save yourself the trouble and rent something else (maybe beautiful thing) or read a book (Giovanni's Room). If you can understand that this film was inspired by the piety of Tom Hanks's speech at the Academy Awards when he won Philadelphia and had a nice pleasure in Hollywood culture and small town ignorance, you have a spectacle for a 30-year screw ball comedy. Baby, Holiday, The Palm Beach Story) Enjoy! Far from being a biting satire, try the movie for the exuberance of a Preston Sturges farce and get the dam close. No, it's not 'deep' or 'powerful' - neither Romy nor Michelle, 9 to 5, or Young Frankenstein - and it doesn't matter if it is; It keeps its tongue-sturdy-in-the-cheek. It gets too preachy and maudlin for its own good after the end and certainly some of the jokes are a bit outdated (there's also a dressing room scene that could be cut), but after having been burned by countless comedies it is like a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck are great games, while Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley provide good support. The excellent Joan Cusack's award-winning performance is star and the big Bob Newhart is, well, Bob Newhart. <br /> <br /> The fact that much of In & Out has offended is as absurd as the communities of the villagers, it makes fun; Personally, I was more abused by Philadelphia. I will take innocent rubbish over holiness every time.
