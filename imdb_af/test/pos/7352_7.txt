Okay, "pretty good" doesn't yell at me, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Campfire Tales. Although it is not a classic, the directors concerned have an idea of ​​tension. The terrorists are not just jumping out on you, but the directors are constantly building on the climate moments. The film is based on popular urban legends and ghost stories. The authors have updated the stories fairly well and just turned the well-known ends into a punch. The best of the shorts is "The Honeymoon" and "People Can Lick Too", I both enjoyed, as they have a nice tension in every story. "The Locket" was a good ghost story and the casing around "The Campfire" is pretty good, except that they are turning too much at the end. The only disappointing segment is "The Hook" which is good because it is pretty short anyway. Overall, I give it a 7 out of 10. It has tension, which is missing most horror movies today, and well acting through the cast. It may not be with Halloween and The Exorcist, but it's a good movie worth the price of a rental.
