First, to rent or watch this movie, you expect something in the B-horror series. What this film brings to the clever fan of this genre is a hilarious skirt through the Nordic fragrance. At times, I remember the humor of Jackson's Dead Alive and others of a Stuart Gordon movie. <br /> <br /> The f / x achieves some very real ghostly (the first time Ed meets his nemesis), but generally feels that this movie is made up by a down / x team have any and all props at their disposal for other movies ... gremlins, devils, slasher movies, etc. to reasonably good effect and work through the use of hallucinations. <br /> <br /> The jewel of the movie is the humor. The gore works most of the time, but more to laugh. In his heart it is a parody and a fun one.
