Was very happy to see the movie Hari To at the Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the first night and was such a beautiful film. It's shot beautifully over India and I want to go there now. The main actor. Friday was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie. He was the total star of the show. Benoit's character cracked me ... was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was also good. They were all great! There were very big scenes like the one with the monkeys. And basically I just loved the movie. Everybody who walked out touched it and it was definitely a highlight of the film festival. Was my favorite of the festival. It caught the vitality of India very well and can't believe how beautiful India is. The feeling of going out of the theater was a real highlight. It's a beautiful, happy movie. I loved it !!
