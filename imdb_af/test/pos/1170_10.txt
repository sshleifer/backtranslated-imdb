This movie is well thrown, often silly and always funny. Lemmon and Matthau work their team team force to perfection. Brent Spiner is just a riot as the selfish tyrant of a travel director. From the first "rabbit krishna" to the last "you should pay him fifty dollars to call your two studs", I thought it was a great comedy
