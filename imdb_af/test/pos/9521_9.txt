Starting with "My Names is Joe" like the scene in Alcoholic Anonymous TBM careers in a crazy spiral of infidelity, dual standards and clandestine affairs. but what do you expect from a family of lawyers? <br /> <br /> A really funny movie, with some of the most outrageous characters since The Birdcage, plot and subplot, is intertwined with surreal scenes of decadent Parisian life (ever after a wedding reception in the shepherd's toilet where the bride's grandmother and her upset girl are smoking and cracking blue jokes? No, either I!) which leads to a final scene of almost Arcadian symbolism. <br /> <br /> Excellent.
