This film by well-known Czech director and writer-co-worker Petr Jarchovský is remarkable for his detail, but annoying and distracting in his details. With its theme and title from a Robert Graves poem, it deals with a woman with several men and a few silly relatives in her life trying to make her two children, 15-year-old Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and a blonde asthma Cuba (Adam Misik). The poem is much in evidence, but the theme - it gets a bit lost. <br /> <br /> Marcela (Anna Geislerová), the beauty and Jarda (Roman Luknár) lost everything. In the flood of Prague in 2002 and has nothing more, it seems, but good sex, with which they are going with such a vengeance in their small apartment, that Lucina and Cuba must keep their ears against the noise. Laziness welcomes such statements and skates on the verge of embarrassment or shock. There is no good explanation exactly why, but financial despair caused Jarda to process stolen cars in the large garage that adjoins his apartment. His car-thief cohort drive from a sturdy Volvo, the comfortable Benes (Joseph Abrham) left with the keys in the ignition while owning a large property he owns. Legs are a nice guy, but not a fool. His Volvo is wired for satellite detection in such cases and it leads the police straight to Jarda's garage and he and his cohort are in jail. <br /> <br /> "Beauty in trouble flees to the good angel, on whom she can rely," begins the grave's grave. But actually these fracas lead Benes to Marcela when he meets her at the police station. He introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and holds her with a picture book about Tuscany, where he, although born in Prague, owns a beautiful villa and lived most of his life. He is here to regain the house in Prague which is now occupied by a couple with an old and weak mother, whom he allows to stay. Benes' every gesture is benevolent, though he does not prevent Jarda from going out of prison. <br /> <br /> In the circumstances, Marcela has to withdraw with Lucina and Cuba from the love of her mother, Zdena Jana Brejchova) and the much lesser mercy of Zdena's current husband, the scabby diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer ) - which begins for the children when they prohibit the cardinal sin from using their cookie cookies, seems to be the uncle of hell. Jiri Schmitzer cuts the film at this point and never leaves it completely. Even in the final scene, he is a figure of learning threat. It is surprising that the dishonest Richard does not sexually abuse one or both children. He is urgently demanded that Marcela come out on her own, and when Benes presents her under his wing, he and Richard become unlikely allies. Unlikely - perhaps unquestionable. Why should Benes be like him? But then, what is Benes' whole story? About some things, the film gives too much information and about others, not enough. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the "good angel" Benes is infallible - and a polished, beautiful older man whose ways suit his Italian education. It was only at the end when he was pushed by the occupying occupants to the limits of his Prague property. He proves that he is not one who will not lie down and walk. <br /> <br /> Also treated is Jarda's religious fanatic mother Sdena (Jana Brejchova), and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to look at. But she's just another wild card that doesn't enlarge the deck. <br /> <br /> The poem is set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on the screen by the draw radio Raduza, first in a small scene, then performed in a more elaborate one at a prison performance that witnessed by Jarda and the car thief. If you respect Hrebejk as an author, you can enjoy this drive. otherwise it tends to feel unsatisfactory. Also included are a number of songs by Glen Hansard / Marketa Irglova of Oscar-winning Irish music film 'Once', including the latter's theme song, Falling. They feel more out of place than they would have otherwise because of their familiarity with "Once Once" - although this film first came. <br /> <br /> Workers' people arrest; even small koba has its Shakespeare child moments and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer are unable to resist the temptation to break out and over magnify. Legs endures can be difficult to show he has a difficult side. But such an extensive demonstration was not necessary. The acting is good, and there is a wonderful thing about flawlessness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex and money get lost in the struggle and Marcela's conflicts and how they solve them never get clear. It's good that there's no solution to the theme and Graves's poem that Marcela has another hot sex with Jarda during a visit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her children. But there are too many questions about what the stupid Richard or Jarda's annoying pious mother (Emília Vásáryová) should be. How come we suddenly learn Koba gets letters from India allegedly from his father, who is in prison? When did it happen? Interesting details, quickly pasted. It looks like a world where you can't see the forest for the trees.
