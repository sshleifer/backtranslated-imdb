First of all, I must say I love this movie. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie I saw from director Micheal Haneke and I was impressed by how good the direction was! <br /> <br /> Haneke definitely knows how to target actors. What I have found is also Haneke's scenario. Initially, you saw a woman who is very straight and looks like a good piano teacher and very much loved and respected by everyone in her background. Then you realize she has a mother who is a control freak and is too much in her life. Now you know she's missed, she has emotional problems, but you don't know exactly what. And then you fall into her dark side, but her dark side is only revealed when a student falls in love with her. She couldn't control her anymore. <br /> <br /> Roles are very complicated and difficult to play, but Isabelle Huppert is in her role and she deserves the recognition she had at Cannes Festival. Benoit Maginel is also very solid, but a bit obscured by Huppert's performance. <br /> <br /> There is one thing I found strange in the scenario, how the character that Magimel played is not very credible. He is too talented! It is rare that a person is a piano virtuoso, but spends most of his time playing and studying hockey. This is a weak point, but only a minor error. <br /> <br /> I just saw the movie, so I can't do a very full critic because I didn't analyze the movie. I love what I saw! so I give the movie an 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... for the end, Haneke showed that he really wanted to shock his audience. A motivation that doesn't think is needed to make movies, but Haneke does it with style and precision. That's why his film is better than Baise-Moi. <br /> <br /> Vince
