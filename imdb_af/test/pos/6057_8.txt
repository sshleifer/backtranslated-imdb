I was a Marine at Camp Pendleton when the D.I. came out (1st Marine Division, 11th Marine Regiment, 3rd Battalion, I-Battery). I still remember being in line with a lot of other Marines to watch the movie at Star Theater in Oceanside, California. <br /> <br /> We didn't expect the movie to portray everything we experienced in boat camps. but we were all pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was. The idea of ​​using real Marines in the movie was a good idea (I believe they were also all right drill instructors). As good as an actor like Jack Webb, he couldn't just call a cadence, like a true Marine Drill Instructor. <br /> <br /> Everyone had a laugh when the "problem" yard's mother climbed onto the camp. to talk to the captain. Never in a million years would this have happened, but it is Hollywood, and we did not leave the episode of us to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> During the summer, I went to MCRD in San Diego through the boat camp. from 1956, and at that time there were virtually no limits that the DIs could do to you. The "Ribbon Creek" event at Parris Island has not yet had a boat camp, at least not at MCRD - San Diego. <br /> <br /> I agree with what many of the other reviewers have said about Sgt. Moore's "stiffness" to his girlfriend friend. I believe it was just Webb's acting style, and although they could have removed this part of the movie, it didn't hurt much about the production. <br /> <br /> One small note, the character (unreasonable) of "Pvt. Rodriguez" was played by one of my Drill Instructors, Sgt. Peter J. O'Neill. Sgt. O'Neill told us he wanted to be an actor one day. We secretly laughed at it, but he surprised us all. He was a good drill instructor, and I thought he did well in his part. He also enjoyed throwing knives. He showed us his skills this summer in the boat camp. I often wondered if he was still alive.
