Russian actress TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me so much of young Audrey Hepburn and flying the camera in the taps, seems to love her so much. She is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance against the backdrop of the Second World War in Moscow. <br /> <br /> The film is almost poetic in its beautiful B&W cinematography, the main reason for watching the movie for the first time. place, since I've never heard of it and decided to try it when broadcast on TCM. <br /> <br /> It is a very moving love story about a girl's deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier set in wartime. She can't forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him, but inexplicably marry someone else who has forced him on her, a pianist who soon realizes she still loves the soldier she wants to hear. Their marriage is an upset because she can't let her soldier sweep her memory of a happier time. <br /> <br /> At the end of the story, she accepts the idea that he will never return and is able to confront reality and deal with the situation. There is a very poignant final scene at a train station where oncoming soldiers greet their loved ones and the tear-like girl shares the joy of returning soldiers by giving flowers from her bouquet to the joyful families. <br /> <br /> The stylish and eye-catching camera work is what the film carries as well as the honestly played story. <br /> <br /> Tastefully done, but perhaps the English subtitles didn't tell the whole story, because some of the plural elements seemed a little faded to me as if they were overwritten. <br /> <br /> Summary: Easy to see why it won awards at the Cannes Film Festival. Remind me, in style, of another great Russian movie, BALLAD OR A SOLDIER.
