There is a lot to remember in this film, despite its humble bumps of a prehistoric PC story about rape and the perpetrator is always better than the victim. The film made a fair amount of tension in the riddle around who sent the notes. (I was sure it was the teacher. It would have been more likely, because the idea of ​​the best friend's friendship of the child came out of nowhere. I think the point is that rape is ubiquitous. You know never who's going to be.) Caller is as always informed (see KB board for my qualification of this statement). Like all punch movies, the plot lasts 15 minutes past the climax, so you might stop watching at that point. Unless you're really curious to find out what's happening with Phillip. Blythe Danner, like the mother, is in the role she was born to play: the ferocious, over-protective mother. Some good 70's scenes for 70's fans. (The dark bar that the father goes to drink his pain is all the dark-colored beams, barrels, oak and cork). A must have for caller fans and highly recommended for fans of the 70s high school melodrama or 70s kitsch in general.
