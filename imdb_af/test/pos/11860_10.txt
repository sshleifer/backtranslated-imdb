I first got the movie at a premiere party in Mr. Zwarts hometown, Fredrikstad, seen. There, between directors, musicians and other Norwegian celebrities, I laughed and laughed. I just couldn't stop. If you want a comedy with black humor, sharp lines and excellent acting - this is one movie you should see! It's like mixing 'True Romance' with 'The Wedding Singer' and adding a little 'Mad over you' Hilarios! <br /> <br /> 10 points!
