Many reviewers prefer to choose the original version of The Man Who Were To Know, which I did not have the opportunity to see. The '56 version is in itself a very good movie. Running mid-late-fifties Hitchcock movies (including "Rear Window", "Dial M for Murder", "Vertigo" and "To Catch A Thief" as well as this movie) is one of my favorite periods in his career. In the man who knew too much, Jimmy Stewart cast himself in his role as always. Doris Day is very credible in the role of an atypical Hitchcock blonde. I thought there was nothing wrong with her performance. Her character may not be as strong as the original, but she is definitely not reduced to the role of a passive, "yes, dear", beautiful thing on Jimmy Stewart's arm. <br /> <br /> There were really some smart lines written for Hank (the couple's son being kidnapped later) in the opening scene on the bus. It's too bad, Christopher Olsen reads them so woody. It is rare to see a good performance of a children's actor in the 50's. Most of the supporting actors in this film were very capable, but especially the killer (played by Reggie Nalder). <br /> <br /> Some small ones undoubtedly make this movie Hitchcockian - using non-English dialogue, especially French (something Hitch did on a much larger scale in "To Catch A Thief"); using bias, Arabic music in the hotel when the killer appears; Stewart and Dag talk to each other in church and sing their words to the song of the song; the Albert Hall scene, which specifically shows the musicians and the assassin's accomplice, builds up the tension, as well as the percussionist who prepares the cymbals; and finally the assassin's gun as it appears behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and precisely that it has to be done mechanically (an effect Hitch is also used at the end of the "Spellbound"). <br /> <br /> All in all, The Man Who Were Too Much, is a fun movie to watch. It's not as deep or heavily loaded with symbolism as some of its films ("Vertigo", "Strangers on a Train"), but it is also one of my top five Hitchcock masterpieces.
