I really love this movie !!! I didn't play Final Fantasy VII, but I still loved the movie, it's really funny and I love the work the voice actors did. The visuals are so fantastic and all the lines are so well done. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have a pretty good imagination so that I could fill most of the gaps that the movie offered, and I suggest you watch it twice because many things suddenly make sense. <br /> <br /> Also (it's pretty funny) you should see it with the captions, because what they say and what the subs say is sometimes completely different. . It's really pretty funny, but sometimes it helps you understand what they say better. <br /> <br /> Watch it !!! love marnie
