Thank God for the Internet Movie Database !!! When I got this movie first, I watched it just before bed every night and something different from it every time. But no matter how I cut it, it became disturbing. The black and white and all the sobs have really crushed me. You are staring at the screen uncertain about what you are watching, and just when you think you have it, it becomes clear and it is something completely different. The images are VERY disturbing, sobbing and straight razor doesn't fit me well in any movie. Still, I watched it, I interpret it somewhat differently (there is no dialogue, you know), so I decided to check the IMdB for the plot summary. Boy throwing me a loop, I had no idea what was supposed to be God. Now I'm going to keep that in mind and see what happens.
