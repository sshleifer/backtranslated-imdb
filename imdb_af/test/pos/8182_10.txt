The movie invites comparisons with Shakespeare. The Mandarin is beautifully written and spoken, and the plot is intricate and intriguing. Gong Li has never looked better, never has the glory that China is better represented on the screen. The balance between political unrest and personal intrigue that Gladiator saw, but never really delivered, is here in the spade. Simply incredible.
