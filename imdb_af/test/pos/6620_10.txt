If you've ever been, you have a friend, or a kid who was or was skating at once, watch this movie! I've seen it several times and every time I see it, I get something new from it. It reminded me why I first got into the skate (a long time ago). It reminded me of what skating for a person and I found will also help a person who doesn't understand why skaters don't skate. Certainly a very dark side of the whole has been seen, which touches the film slightly. But it tends to focus more on what the core of skating is. Just a person on a board, do it because they like to do it. This movie was so inspiring to me that I was skateboarding again (I'm 32) and I wasn't happy with myself in years. Give this one a go, you won't be disappointed.
