Well, let me break it down for you ... Haggard is probably one of the funniest senseless movies you'll ever see. It has a blend of a unique story about a man with girl problems and everything that goes back for him, mixed with a lot of humorous scenes that will make you laugh throughout the movie, basically if you see Jackass or the CKY series have, you "I know what to expect for humor, as it has most people from those movies. Overall ... I just had to give it a 10/10 because it is one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (P.S.) Haggard rules!
