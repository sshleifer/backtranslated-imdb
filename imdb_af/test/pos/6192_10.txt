The problem with this series is that it is too real. I watch it on Amazon "Unbox" and I just downloaded episode 2. I hate, absolutely hate, Fark, the leader of the cell. I can't remember any television series that has this emotional impact. Remember the old brand series for horror movies "Just keep yourself his only movie"? Well, I find myself reminding myself repeatedly that its "only TV". But of course it's not just TV? The possibility of a cell like the one actually working in the United States is definitely within the scope of plausibility. This is what gives this program its ominous authenticity. And so I hate it so much.
