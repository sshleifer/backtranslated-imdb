"In 1927, a young man, alone in a single aircraft, flew from Roosevelt field in New York across the Atlantic to the Le Bourget field in Paris, a distance of three thousand six hundred and ten miles. flying, victory, body and spirit, Charles A. Lindbergh influenced the lives of everyone on earth - because in the 33 hours and thirty minutes of his flight life became a reality, this is the story of that flight. " > <br /> Billy Wilder fits in with Charles A. Lindbergh's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name that fled the resale of Lindbergh's historic 1927 solo. Strengthened by a sizeable strong performance by James Stewart (himself a pilot) as Lindberg, and with an intelligent script from Wilder and Wendell Mayes, Spirit of St. Louis is a sincere, well-known story. <br /> <br /> In what sometimes a monotonous movie threatens, Wilder is keeping it up with Lindbergh's life. After the beautiful narrative, such as the danger that Nungesser and Coli realize, is missing (never found) while trying the same journey in the reverse, we learn things like how he works his first plane and she works with the flying circus. It's all about understanding the man and his clear passion for the fly. It also helps to give us a complete picture of Lindbergh, so we sit with him in his insulated cabin, as he undertakes this dangerous journey. Fight isolation (his only company is a fly) and chronic fatigue, this is where Stewart perfectly portrays Lindbergh's dedication to the task. Supported by a tremendous count of Franz Waxman and Academy Award nominated bonds by Louis Lichtenfield, Wilder's movie appears to be an interesting human interest story that has achieved a thorough professional production. 10/07
