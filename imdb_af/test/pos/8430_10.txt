"The China Syndrome" could not be released at a better time: twelve days after its release, the notorious screw occurred in Three Mile Island. But even if it (and / or Chernobyl) has never happened, this movie remains an important look at what can happen through mismanagement of nuclear facilities. Jack Lemmon turns in a five-star show as the supervisor tries to deploy a cover sheet on his nuclear plant, with Jane Fonda trying to investigate the reporter, and Michael Douglas plays her cameraman. <br /> <br /> I don't know I don't know if the current threat of a terrorist attack makes the Chinese Syndrome more disturbing, but it's definitely another movie everyone should see. <br /> <br /> I hope the people who spent years pushing nuclear power saw this movie just so they knew their views and ideas were completely uncovered.
