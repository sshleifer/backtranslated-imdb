It is an entertaining and touch of the classic story, also very intelligent, not of the 'Me Tarzan, You Jane' school. <br /> <br /> This is the famous story of a child born to masculinity. in the jungle by monkeys. A titled British couple (the woman pregnant) is stranded after the shipwreck in the African wildlife. After the death of the parents, the baby is raised by monkeys in the jungle. Twenty years later, this young man (ie Tarzan) rescues an injured Belgian explorer who returns him to health. The Belgian discovers evidence that his rescuer is the young Lord Greystoke and returns him to his rightful estate in Scotland, where he has to adapt to civilized society. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts. In the first half we see Tarzan in its jungle environment. I'm not an expert, but I'm not aware of the realism of his portrayal of the monkey community life, but it's definitely entertaining. For me, the more moving part is the second half, when Tarzan needs to meet his real family, develop language skills and meet the aristocratic British society, and Jane (Andie MacDowell) will worship all the time. He is portrayed as a "noble wilderness," either in nature or in elegant Edwardian stables. In contrast, the upper crust is depicted as often far more barbaric than the Tarzan jungle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert is fantastic in his sympathetic depiction of Tarzan in both the jungle and civilized environments. He gives a real sense of his confusion and conflict, torn as he is between the two very different worlds, his original monkey family and his new human one. Sir Ralph Richardson, one of the old British legends, is brilliant as always in the role of Tarzan's grandfather, the sixth Earl of Greystoke. <br /> <br /> The movie focuses more on Tarzan's struggle to adapt to civilization and its inner conflict than to its jungle issues. This unusual application of the old classics makes it the typical dramatic adventure, but above all also a moving personal story. I was not surprised to note that his director is the same individual, Hugh Hudson, who also directed Chariots of Fire, another brilliant movie.
