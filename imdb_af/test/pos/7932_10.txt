I learned a lot from previous viewer responses. Is there not one who calls 'propaganda'? Too slippery. 'Perception is concept dependent'. I love Fred Astaire's musical, the great, good songs, and Fred's relentless grace. But comrades, if you see rude, brainless, rich parasites dancing to the oppressed and unemployed, this is a valid criticism of 'capitalist propaganda'. Any movie is disturbed in the values ​​of its time and place, not to mention those who fund it? the pipers who call the song. Great art exceeds everyone, as did 'Nevsky', as well as 'All Quiet on the Western Front'. I admit. I saw it 40 years ago. But the images are burned in my brain. It's the biggest battlefield ever to be filmed. And it makes you terrible to be excited. 'Plastic ice cream' did anyone say? It's the real death you see. True extras have died to make it. "Real looking" is now special effects-defined. Just as 'too long' - stretching for an age of crossing attention? Mozart had too many notes? Propaganda, Catholic Church blasphemy? The Vatican was always there when they encouraged ancient favors to get the German Christian Democrat gov. Croatia recognized in the 1990s? remember the chaos and genocide? Forget the props, the lighting of Nevsky painted the medieval world? like a Breughel. There is one in Hampton Court Palace that shows a massacre. Rough Dutch nationalist propaganda, but it tears in the heart. Stylized acting? So what is Henry V (Olivier movie)? Naturalism? Does anyone believe that English medieval knight killers have spoken so? As said, the music of Prokofiev is wonderful. Only Ken Russell & Eisenstein have the balls and genius to match sound and image at this 100 octane level. OK, you want the snaffle and little. I will burn the nervous system every time. Eisenstein did not copy Wehrmacht helmets, but his model looks as if those buckets were worn by "Teutonic knights" in the 1930s Nazi magazines. Eisenstein was a genius, but unlike Hollywood directors, he had almost unlimited (non-commercial) time and funding. Modern Russian directors are free of political bonds, but have no money. Even Kurasawa had to make a late (big) movie in communist Russia. He was honored, but priceless in his own country (much like Russell). How much propaganda is in the eye of the seer? Set your sensible people from another, peaceable world. How will they respond to Nevsky? Would the fight, or the robbers for the dead, dominate their cognitions? If we didn't know the gas chambers and SS, how about 'Triumph of the Will'? Where can I get a Nevsky DVD, cheap?
