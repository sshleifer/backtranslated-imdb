Unlike the previous poster, I kept the celluloid treatment. It looks good and has made the movie so much fun to watch. For me, this did not detract from the content of the documentary. In fact, I felt the luster of the look allowed me to lose myself so much more in the content. The previous poster was fair to compare the style to a Nike commercial; It certainly has that look. But for my taste it worked very well (and I'm far from a fan of Nike advertising). <br /> <br /> I think that's the way documentaries are to be made. I can't wait to see the following installments from these promising filmmakers.
