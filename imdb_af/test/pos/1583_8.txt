I recently saw Episodes 1-4, and now I can't wait for 5 & 6 to be available! (I heard they are coming soon.) Commander's Log looks set to become a cult hit among university people and all the others with a taste for an exciting comedy. It is obvious that the budget was small, but the care that the writing uses is clear. In fact, with the simplicity of the show, I appreciated the writing and the acting more. Bowlsby is a master of the pit-down ... I just wish I could remember the best for later use on unsuspecting co-workers! Let's just say if you don't like Commander's Log, I'll personally make sure your downfall gets extra starch!
