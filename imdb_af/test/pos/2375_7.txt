Two actors play competing gangsters in three films, the final of which is a science film, which nods funny to William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick and anime. The robots are actually called "replicas", a reference to Dicks Blade Runner. There are also several visual references to the movie. And the bad man is a psychotic gay mayor who is obsessed with limited reproduction through a compulsory drug for heterosexual love is fleeting and homosexual love is eternal ................ ...... The hilarious climax involves the two leads that move in a winged robot with a giant phallus for a head, which embodies 'destruction', which has been the path of both characters so far, their individual thoughts and later literal heads that function as something like testicles. The film ends with the mayor and his free jazz play child, because the robot apparently sees a wall around them, the last words of the mayor "O f * &%", followed by a quick fade to black. Part of me had been staying, part of me confused, but mostly I just laughed. Much of the movie is rather boring, but the best scenes book the movie while the rest is far too slow. Takashi Miike has always mined the sexual motives under male violence in action films, and this film, with the exception of "Gozu", enhances this theme more than any other. Sex and violence are two pretty basic themes, but like Cronerberg (who can be the jazz interludes to entertain after lunch), Miike can show where the two are connected with a spectacular, strangely coherent effect.
