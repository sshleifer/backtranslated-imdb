I've seen this movie before, but I couldn't remember it was this fantastic: it has a fun plot, Madonna fumbleer around the city with pumas etc. And the music is perfect! And the happy ending! Who is that girl is a good choice for a romantic like me. In my opinion, it could even be the best Madonna movie I have ever seen! 10/10
