I loved this movie because of the dialogue and beautiful play of Candace and Jacqueline. But I never knew until now, looking at a Bette David marathon on TNT that this film is a remake of a 1943 Bette Davis classic called Parenting. Bette-co-stars with Miriam Hopkins, with whom she was in a terrible feud while making the movie, because Bette had a relationship with Miriam's husband who ordered her in a movie before making her parenting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, both are worth every look. I recommend this movie if you want a lot of dialogue and drama. This is a study in the psychology of women and their relationships with one another, in my opinion.
