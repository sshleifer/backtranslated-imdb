You can't watch a movie like Peter Watkins' "Privilege", a story of the exploitation of a pop music movie by big business, state, and even organized religion, without thinking of creative degenerative commodities like Michael Jackson or Britney Spears, who hacks corporate giants like Pepsi or other poison for money. Or any number of artists, in music or movies, becoming instruments of political parties or commercial religious interests such as Scientology and Kabbalah. A film such as Privilege almost seemed like science fiction when it was released in 1967. It was so fantastic. Today, we tend to accept love endorsements, with little emphasis on its more worrying implications. Watkins's vision has not only become reality, we accept this tacit reality as "normal". <br /> <br /> Now consider Punishment Park. As Privilege challenges the viewer to investigate what is being sold to us, and why, Punishment Park requires us to count on what is being taken and why. <br /> <br /> Heaven helps America, and it matters to the world, if contemporary politicians get their hands on this movie. It's already so close to reality that I have recently experienced a real, fascinating sense of anxiety. <br /> <br /> Watkins again uses a documentary style story. As it appears in Privilege some rough edges to this technique, it is healthy in Punishment Park for sharp, seamless perfection. The sense of realism is enhanced by disarmingly unpretentious, economic, credible depictions throughout the role. It's the kind of acting Hollywood has its back completely on, to its detriment, in favor of cosmetically perfect image projections. The cast has first-class material to work with in Watkins's script. <br /> <br /> Many movies have tried to shake the viewer out of the free sense of security. No one ever achieved this result with such sharp and cold accuracy as Peter Watkins does here. <br /> <br /> "What is clear now is, rather than bringing the estranged and excluded Americans, like these people, back into the national community, the Administration chose to accept the current section within the country and exploit, and besides considering reconciliation politics, it chose the politics of polarization. "<br /> <br /> To paraphrase one of the characters, we don't have to call the pigs. because they know what they are. Better than we do.
