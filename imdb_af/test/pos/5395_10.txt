This movie was great! I like the way it mixes dark humor with drama. There are times when you think there is no possible way to laugh at the situation being offered, and yet you experience a surprising giggle. It has performed wonderfully, with great performances by Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, and Emile Hirsch. It is well written with a stylish, surprising end. I'm not one to say that everyone will enjoy it as much as I did, but give it a chance and hire it. The DVD has great special features, including full-fledged commentaries by director, Dan Harris and Emile Hirsch and one of Sigourney Weaver, which gives you interesting information about the movie. I hope my comments are useful and enjoy the movie!
