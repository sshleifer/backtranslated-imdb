This is one of my 3 favorite movies. I've been on the water for 13 years, so I got a lot of humor as well as much of the near-country environment (the film, although in and around Virginia, is filmed around the San Francisco Bay), especially the mothball fleet just east of the Benicia bridge where Kelsey Grammar's character was first introduced to the USS Stingray and San Francisco's piers at the end of the movie (including a boat I was working on). As other people have said, the actors had fun making this movie as well as making it entertaining. The line "We are reaching the bottom, sir! I can hear some lobster living it out." At least this is invaluable to me. <br /> <br /> I'm one of many people anxiously waiting for a letterboxed DVD from Down Periscope to be launched.
