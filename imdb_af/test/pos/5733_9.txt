The Elegant Universe brings many ideas of the universe to light. After watching this documentary, you can't help but take a step back and reconsider their view of everything. There is a large group of scientists, mathematicians and others on both sides of the String theory. It is constantly questioned if untested, untouchable, and possibly dead, wrong. The closest thing to proselytizing anyone does is to explain that Quantum Physics, the set of mathematical ideas that give extremely good approaches to what happens to sub-particles, never made a wrong prediction. Not so with String theory; No one is willing to say on the camera that String theory is the truth, and so the piece retains a certain respectful distance from the subject.
