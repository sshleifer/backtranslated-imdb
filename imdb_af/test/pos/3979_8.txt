I was very scared to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Although I knew it would be a different film in the style of Revenge of the Nerds, I was still impressed. <br /> <br /> There is much truth to the fact of this type of learning and strongly believes it should be allowed in a "new school style". <br /> <br /> Conventional teaching methods do not always teach students what they need to know or need to know or want to know. <br /> <br /> This approach to teaching should be further explored in true academic courses. <br /> <br /> While there are still too many party scenes, of course, it should be thrown in there - for Hollywood's intention to make a comedy about college ... even though we all know life is not like that. is not. <br /> <br /> Get hit incredibly, still funny and with a killer end. <br /> <br /> Awesome end. Important to the whole story and very surprising. <br /> <br /> Without the final scene, the movie would be half as good. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie and it doesn't have to be. has too many amounts of curse or nudity or brutal jokes to do it well. <br /> <br /> Large crew and throw, story and even generic types of mandatory "Hampton Frat members" were well done. /> <br /> American Pie 1, 2 3 and American Wedding or whatever clones do, do not do it with 1/3. <br /> <br /> Much better than most comedies over the first year. College with no I liked it, even if it was simple. It was interesting and even had a heart. My only regret at watching this movie is that it was no longer.
