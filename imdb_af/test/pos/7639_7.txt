I gave these movies a 7 out of 10. I think the general dislike of this movie is due to people who do not really understand the plot. Thinking about the story line, this movie is actually perfect, it never gives you a darkened explanation. It is true that the special effects are substandard and it seems semi-low budget, but I think the originality of the plot keeps you moving. People say the vampire genre is exaggerated and clicked, but with Bled it's not getting your conventional vampire movie. It is a dream / alternative reality story line with a vampire / eternal life spinning on it. I loved it. The only thing that kept me from giving it a higher rating was the lack of special effects and that I personally don't like movies where most people have accent. But as I said earlier, if you really get the plot, it's not a bad movie.
