I went to see this movie with a ladies friend of mine who didn't like flute movies. But she enjoyed it. I completely missed pieces of the movie. It's a story about Edward Norton and a crew stealing gold, and Norton decides he wants it all for himself. Then the people he betrayed want to come back to him. It's a well-composed, intelligent, funny and action-packed movie I have to see again ... all the way through. One of my top movies of the summer so far. <br /> <br /> A great help to the entertainment factor is Seth Green. I don't know anyone who doesn't like Seth Green, and he adds to the taste. He plays a man who says he created Napster, and his comrade pushed it away from him. He is a computer genius that is a wonder to watch. <br /> <br /> Norton was said not to do this movie. But if I were him, I wanted to sign. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that it is very predictable. Any filmmaker should be able to say what happens before it happens. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint to the movie is Eddie Nortons's choice of face. The thick but thin mustache, and a little snoek on his chin ... he looks like an 80-star star for the god.
