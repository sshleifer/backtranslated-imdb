It's the first James Cagney movie I've ever really watched. I have never been interested in his movies, because I thought I would have nothing in the style of the theater and because I heard most Cagney movies, the same. I must say I really liked it. At today's standards for movies it wasn't special, but I found it surprisingly entertaining. Cagney didn't have the appearance of a tough man, but he played the part very well.
