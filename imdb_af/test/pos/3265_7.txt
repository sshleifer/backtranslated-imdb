It's hard to know what to make of this strange little Aussie crime flag - on the one hand it's a nice little movie with a good sense of humor; but on the other hand, it lacks only a certain thing that ensures that the film never reaches the limit, which holds it in the only "interesting" area. It is said, Two Hands is a well-scheduled movie that simultaneously brings together several stories, allowing several small climaxes throughout the film, and in turn helping to make the movie boring. The absurdity of the action, the thick Australian accent and the bizarre set of characters all help to keep the movie entertained. The plot follows the story of a young doorman who thinks he will go to bigger things after accepting a work from the local kingpin. He does not; the work just ends up in trouble if he desires a swim and immediately leaves ten on the beach, which is immediately stolen by a few children who have the time of their life at a mall. But everything is not rosy for our hero; who should get the money or face the consequences ... <br /> <br /> The movie is a cast of unknowns; Anyway, it was back in 1999, as Heath Ledger is now something of a name. However, he does not impress too much here, as his performance is mostly of one-note variety and he does not make a very compelling advantage. He fits the movie in that he is Australian and naive; but out there he is not the best lead I've ever seen in a movie. If you ask me, Bryan Brown delivered the best performance here. He may not have much screen time, but he steals every scene he is in and it is he who gives the film a lot of humor. He has nothing to do with the best order, but it takes place in the form of probably the most hilarious bank robbery ever captured on film. Overall, I can recommend this movie to people who enjoy strange crime films; As the strangeness abounds, and the way the events make the bizarre turn, is enjoyable; But if you're not a fan of this kind of movie, I can't really say that Two Hands will drive your boat. It's not a must see, but if it's your thing and you get a chance to see it, you'll probably regret it.
