It's a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feel of this could lead to a sequel, but I doubt it will make enough money. <br /> <br /> Deniro proves he can be a great straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to work with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo-well, she's just nice to watch anyway and she played her part excellently. <br /> <br /> Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the truck zone. It was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got a lot of the movie and the great outlook at the end. Don't leave at the beginning of the credits! <br /> <br /> At least a 7.
