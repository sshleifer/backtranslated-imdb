This review includes some small but significant spoilers. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> I just finished watching my copy of Noroi ... <br /> <br />. .. And this was GREAT! It may sound cute, but several times during the movie I forgot it wasn't really XD. The play is convincing, though the acting of Masafumi Kobayashi (playing himself, I think ...) sometimes looks a bit. Marika Matsumoto (Yuka in Takashi Shimizu's Rinne) has changed listening levels of credibility throughout the movie. Sometimes she is VERY good, then she is very cheesy the next moment (especially at the end of his exorcism and subsequent re-possession. <br /> <br /> A character who was ridiculous before was Mr. Hori, a man with an ectopic worm that believes that an ectoplasmic worm is going to eat, he initially gives inadvertent comic relief (like the victim of the stereotypical alien victim), but near the end some very scary scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot was very interesting and really made me wonder how everything was tied up, there are a few things that aren't really explained (like a mass suicide in a Tokyo park and where the reincarnated Kagutaba son came from), but everything looked good, the end became GOT as one of the most unpleasant, if not the scariest, order I ever had the pleasure of witnessing. <br /> <br /> In all, Noroi is a very fun way to spend 2 hours and the new Hong Kong R3 DVD offers great photo and sound (especially the English SUBTITLES-Engrish free!) for a great J-Horror experience. I recommend picking it up.
