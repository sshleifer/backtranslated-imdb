On the surface, COOLEY HIGH is a funny ensemble comedy that darkens as a period piece (such as in the early 60's, with a flawless Motown soundtrack). But there's so much more to this movie - it gets better every time I see it. The film of unknowns (then) is excellent, and it is striking as a black music film that does not fall into any Blaxpoitation clich√©s. Sometimes COOLEY HIGH feels almost an updated, urban neo-realistic movie, with lots of edgy humor added. Sometimes the slightly tight budget shows, but the restrictions actually work the movie. There is an eagerness and honesty of emotion here that makes the film an instant lack in most similar films (like Schultz 'later CAR WASH, which was more popular but mostly useless). It is sad, but also a real life. It may have been one of the sleepers of the 70's - then celebrated, there seems to be little film freaks about this one today. Their loss - it's a fine, fine movie. <br /> <br /> The bare-bones pan-and-scan DVD (no widescreen!?!) testifies to how little cares for this excellent movie.
