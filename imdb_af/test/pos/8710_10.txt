This is one of the best and most cheerful Vampire Tales ever! I really love this movie. The character is great, even the places and the story. Indeed, the picture is not a big budget production, but it is absolutely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> OK, there are bugs (especially the names of the castle and places) in this movie, but such errors are typical and almost in every Horror Movie. <br /> <br /> The scenery fits perfectly into the story and is close to reality, I can honestly say because I visit them once when I was in Romania in my holidays. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the best part of the subspecies range.
