Now I know Sandra Bullock has made this movie, but she must learn that sometimes you have to make some sacrifices to promote the story ... like not making the whole movie about her character! <br /> <The story is about two high school students (one rich and popular, the other smart and anti-social) who formulate a plan to commit murder and follow it according to the number ... just to see if they can get away with It. Enter Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin as detectives to resolve the case. The boys planted evidence, created alibises, and so well-disposed that the police fell for the whole act. But Sandra has the feeling that everything doesn't seem to be like it. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a wonderful Hitchcock style thriller, but the movie spends too much time getting to know Sandra's character rather. than focusing on the actual crime itself. You see, something happened in her past that haunts her throughout the film. And we learn all about it ... all about it. It only becomes rather boring after a while, especially if you're right in the middle of an intriguing murder investigation and then you have to stop the investigation to hear about what has happened to her in the past. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the right winners in this movie. They play their characters convincingly and with just the right amount of malice. If the writing spent more time on these characters, and the detectives kept doing their job, it could be a very entertaining thriller. With the way it is, most of the excitement is lost. They had to cut out all the stuff with Sandra's character and made it a separate TV movie for the lifetime channel. But I deviated. It's still an entertaining movie. I recommend this movie ... but wait for the video / DVD.
