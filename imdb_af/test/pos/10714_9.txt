What can I say about Kramer vs Kramer? On the surface it is fairly simple, but at the bottom it is about emotions that are bigger than life itself. It gives you great moments, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. You sympathize with the characters and you care about them. Many films fail, Kramer vs Kramer is a success. <br /> <br /> I think everyone will agree that the play is excellent. When you watch Kramer vs Kramer, the acting in most other films begins to feel plastic and unmotional. The actors look good with their roles and the characters really live on the screen. There is a beautiful chemistry between them. I think the best performance in the movie comes from young Justin Henry. He's different from any other child actor I've ever seen. He is incredibly natural. <br /> <br /> There is also a kind of neurotic beauty in Meryl Streep. And Dustin Hoffman is one of the best shows in his career! The story is very well written. It's simple but complicated at the same time. The concept is the simple part, the feelings associated with it are the intricate part of it. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie yet, you're definitely wrong! See it now!
