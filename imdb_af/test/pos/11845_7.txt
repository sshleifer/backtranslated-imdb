"See other people" is a brave romantic comedy about a couple named Ed and Alice (Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson) who are engaged and planning to be soon. They live together, but both have doubts about their relationship. Alice realizes she has had so few sexual relationships in the past. She may just marry Ed because she never felt anything else. So, they agree to spend time with other people to test their own relationship. <br /> <br /> The film balances a former question - by focusing too much on the "What if?" aspects of life, can it do the opposite and just feel more limited? When Ed starts sex with a college girl, he starts getting addicted and almost alice for Alice. When he realizes this, it scares him. <br /> <br /> I haven't heard from this movie yet, but I enjoyed it. It's not very well done and certainly has that purposeful, low-budget indie feel, but it's much better than most romantic comedies out there in the mainstream today. <br /> <br /> See if you have a chance.
