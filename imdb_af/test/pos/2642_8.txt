There are many people who have put down this type of 80 movie, but these people may not be from age. I just started college when this movie was released, so I could really appreciate it and my friends and I will joke about certain lines in the movie to date. As much as I liked Sean Penn's character Jeff Spicoli in "Fast Times", I actually enjoy Chris Penn's character "Tommy" more because he's the main character with more of a real speaker role against only a series of one lines like with Spicoli. Chris Penn should probably pop this movie into his video recorder and use it to lose weight motivation. Yes, the subplot with the Randy Quaid, Vietnam cattle character seems a bit out of place, but he does a convincing role in the role. If there is someone who hasn't seen this movie, but the other similar kind of movies like "Fast Times", etc.
