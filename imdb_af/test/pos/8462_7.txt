See this movie when it came out and then a few times later. I look at it 20 years later and it is still a very good story. Does it make a "lifetime movie network"? Yes, but the lifetime has not even existed, so it needs to go to air. <br /> <br /> The throw was excellent. The story was a bit schmaltzy; two women become close friends and unknown that some friend has a relationship with his other friends husband. She is invited to the house for dinner, which is how she discovers that her lover is the man of her best friend. She is horrific and tries to break the matter down. Shortly afterwards, he was murdered tragically in a car accident that deviated from both women. Of course, the woman accidentally finds this case and Holly wants to get out of her life, but can overcome their friendship because they need each other. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good story a lot of throws and perfomrances. I really enjoyed it.
