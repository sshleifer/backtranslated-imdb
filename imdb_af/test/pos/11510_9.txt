This movie I've seen many times. I read the book, Englar Alheimsins, written by Einar Már Gudmundsson, who received the Scandinavian book awards for the work. The movie does not start in the same place as the book begins. It happens in Reykjavík and the main character, Páll is young and has a good life with his girlfriend. But if she breaks the relationship with him, he starts a few headaches that make him angry and angry. And soon he started having great spiritual problems and then the movie started. Soon he will be placed in the Icelandic Spiritual Hospital called "Kleppur" and there you will see some great characters like Viktor who thinks he is Hitler and Óli who thinks he is writing all the "Beatles" songs and sending them with thoughts to them . transport. Ingvar E Sigurðusson who has the role of the main character is working so well that it leaves you breathless. Also, the music in this movie is angry with CIGRUS and just for the music's cost you have to watch the movie. Overall, a good movie is meant to be seen.
