A rare long Kinski feature rolled as Crazy Johnny sex crazed ban wanted in San Francisco. Kinski's character is obsessed with the rape of women as a sexual predator in the old west that has nothing more than stealing, raping and killing. This movie may be a great disappointment to many Spaghetti West fans, but not to many Klaus Kisnki fans. A total of two things made him enjoy a good performance by Klaus Kinski and a good music performance by Stelvio Cipriani. <br /> <br /> Another story line that needs a lot more work to make it impractical, but still fun to watch! <br /> <br /> It would be nice to see this movie again in the future. Since most old movies are made today.
