An astronaut disappears into the deep space and finds himself in unknown areas aboard a living spacecraft, accompanied by a group of alien offenders. This amazingly signed and enjoyable TV installment comes together as a positive birth-fantasy. The individual characters, in conflict at the beginning of the series, must learn to work together and eventually develop into a strong group. Most of the action takes place in the womb of Moia, the living spacecraft (who is even pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). While science fiction stories are usually interested in negative birth fantasies (see, for example, the 'Alien' movies, especially the fourth part 'Resurrection'), it comes as a surprise. Also, the absence of a military hierarchy aboard the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human (and alien) body are also pleasing. One of the female characters that is actually a plant experiences "photo gas" while being exposed to sunlight. The crew should even go to the toilet. Wouldn't it be impossible in 'Star Trek'?
