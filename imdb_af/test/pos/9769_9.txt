Apparently, this Australian film is based on Nevil Shute's novel in more than one form. Beware of heavily cut versions that are sometimes shown on cable or satellite, running anywhere from 95 minutes to 2 hours. Only the full 5-hour mini version shows the story properly. This is a very close realization of the story, only through editorial errors commonly found in TV movies: choppiness and episodic progression. But this excellent throw brings the story very well forward with generally good production values ​​accompanying their work. Yuki Shimoda is notable as "Gunso Mifune", one of the guards assigned to accompany the women on their malicious move. In the end, he becomes a friend. You will be angry with him if his loss of face leads him to death. Helle Morse as "Jean Paget", beautiful but not a great beauty (she looks like Sigourney Weaver a bit) just registers the right amount of spunk and winsomeness as the occasion requires. The miniseries really emphasize the beautiful love stories, three of them: "Joe" and "Jean", "Noel" and "Jean", and "Jean" and Willstown. Gordon Jackson plays "Noel Strachan" attractive, but as a somewhat younger man than Nevil Shute is featured in the novel. The third love relationship I mentioned is not completely emphasized, and the full meaning of the title is diminished. "Jean" focuses on the goal of bringing businesses to Willstown, which will influence young women and girls and their civilization in this God-forsaken village. She wants to make it "A Town Like Alice"; Alice Springs, this is. We only get a few tips from this in various scenes. If you save the five hours, this miniseries is a truly rewarding experience. Nevil Shute based his novel on the cruelty of the Japanese army to place a large group of women and children from one place to another on the Maylay Peninsula on a true look. However, this happened on Sumatra, according to Shute, rather than on the peninsula. The crucifixion of 'Joe' by a Japanese officer to steal chicks to feed the women is probably fiction, but the cruelty of Japanese in dealing with prisoners is certainly a matter of record.
