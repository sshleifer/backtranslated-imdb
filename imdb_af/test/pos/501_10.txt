This movie is great! Wesley Snipes plays Blade the vampire hunter with pure class, he kicks reed in such a fluid and violent way that Bruce Lee will be proud. The movie is a fast, exciting ride of action and excellent stunts. The first action scene and the last is outstanding and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs around to erase all suckers. The writing is pretty good and there is also sharp dialogue. Wesley had to do more action movies if he had, I know he was a very good actor and in that he was not scattered as much as in his more comic or drama roles, but as far as action stars were concerned, he was the best actor of them . Everyone, just Bruce Willis, Stallone and maybe Tom Cruise (if he is an action star) comes close. Steven Dorff is also very good as well as the bad man as well as Wesley. It was an unexpected surprise that someone with a small stature compared to Snipes would have to be threatening, but he did. Overall, the movie is sharp, stylish and I hope the sequel is done with the same kind of pass.
