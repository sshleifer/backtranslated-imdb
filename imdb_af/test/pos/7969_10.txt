Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting! For the people who say they don't shoot-em ups as they use. Well, this one is very difficult! David Bradley is really good and his character is hit in the movie. He is hit by a dozen times, stabbed in the back and is in a coma for three days and then wakes up and fights again, is defeated, defeated and is ready for more action! His character is incredibly tough! Charles Napier was also very good and he probably steals the show! Vernen Wells was good! Professor Toru Tanaka had a short and unreasonable role in Hard Justice! As for the action, it's really great with all the rifle battles and the big stand like the scene in the beginning, inflated cars and flew in the middle of the air! There is so much going on in the 95 minutes. For the action fans you will be blown away by all the firepower and fighting that this movie offers! Hard Justice is a movie that is not easy to find and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it because this movie is a big keeper and the box is cool! There are a lot of actions to be seen to be believed! See if you can find some great deals on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com's Z-Shops and Market Place sellers! I strongly recommend that any action movie fan that loves shooting ems and movies be fought and disappointed by other movies that look like a real non-stop action movie, but fail to deliver to Hard Justice!
