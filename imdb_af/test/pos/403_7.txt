Another great entry into the Crime Doctor series [# 4/10], with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some beautiful Spanish American backgrounds and sets. And also a more outdated story! <br /> <br /> A man who looks like the insane killer of his first two women is found dead in a closed room after a dramatic dinner. The crime doctor is on the scene (apparently as a guest) to immediately resign and thank this murder, and so we are given a strange set of people together, because one of them did the act. Was it the scary of the dead? 1st wife, 3rd wife and rich widow Hilary Brooke, the dancing brother and sister vampires, the intense young man, the eccentric cabinetmaker Lloyd Corrigan, who bought Boston Blackie, the irreplaceable butler, or chance. -On Jerome Cowan? Police inspector Emory Parnell cut out his job, but Warner Baxter and Ordway were so irreconcilable as ever to work it all out. One of the goofs listed on the IMDb is wrong: In the break-in of the murder room, Ordway says, "Right through the middle of the forehead" and Cowan answers, "He didn't miss this time". Favorite Pieces: Baxter and Cowan travel through sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to make compensation for their interrupted dinner; The scene where the Braga's place of tranquility apparently rumbled. The plot sometimes looks temporary and the way it is all explained might be more worthy than Monogram, but it would not do in the air as supernatural! <br /> <br /> Well worth checking out if you like the genre, you won't be disappointed unless you really like the genre.
