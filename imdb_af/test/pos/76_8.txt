I think I like this movie as well as anyone I know; It's not perfect, but under the title "The Americanization of Lily" this charming and unforgettable semi-musical satire can appreciate me even more, and still loved by those who have recognized his special Blake Edwards spirit of gentleness, clever . humor and solid narration. The unlikely but delightful story line follows Lili Smith, a fringe-type spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; Lili Schmidt passes over as Smith helps her uncle who is also patriotic, for Germany, but not cruel or political, merely opportunistic. Lili's target is William Larrabee, a charismatic American squadron leader who can provide her valuable information. The plot thickens when Lili falls in love with Larrabee, has opened her eyes to the effects of her playing spy and sees the effects of fighting on wounded men in a hospital and realizes what it can mean for her men what she has met and likes. She becomes jealous of a rival for Larrabee's love, then realizes she can no longer do what she did and gives the spy business. The logical end of the movie comes after the terrible WWI ended, singing the theme song of the movie, "Wishing" in a darkened theater, one by one the members of Larrabee's squadron, including her lover himself, appearing they indicate forgiving her and their former opponents; And even Uncle Kurt joins enthusiastically in the song of "It's a Long To Tipperraree", to indicate that everything is good with the world. It's a fast-paced and brilliant story idea, written by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty of "John Goldfarb" celebrity; And this is a beautiful story. Larrabee's squadron, including an unashamed collapsing and other lovely species, populates this vibrant film; and the feeling of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic, both in its scope and realization. Credit for Jack Bear and Donald Brooks for their costume creations, Reg Allen and Jack Stevens for sets, Fernando Carrere, for another stunning production design, Henry Mancini, for his sensitive and appropriate musical score, and Russell Harlan for his shiny cinematography. . In the beautiful footage are starring, Julie Andrews, Lili, Rock Hudson and Larrabee, Keremy Kemp, outstanding such as Lili's Uncle Kurt, Michael Witney, Lance Percival as the uncivilized pilot, Gloria Paul as Lili's striptease competitor and many other fine actors. in smaller parts. It's hard to say enough fun things about the pace or the smartness of the just-this-side of the broad comedy; This element is introduced by Edwards to mitigate the horrors of actual warfare, for example, the almost comic-opera approach that men have made war in a more innocent era of human civilization. This comedy also helps prepare the way for Lili's conversion. of unfair acceptance of a duty towards the German state to the reality of what she is doing and possibly doing what she may cause. It is a rare "sentence-of-life" film about Lili's "Americanization", her claim of herself in the real world and then, among other things, can happen before the tragedy. It's spooky, I find and beautiful in many ways. I regard it as Blake Edwards masterpiece of directing; And under the title "The Americanization of Lili" I believe with almost any change that can be recognized as the anointed sapphire of a movie, it is by every standard I know.
