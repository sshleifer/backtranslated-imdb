I was lucky enough to be an extra in this movie when I was 13 during the roller-skating scenes. My junior high school drama class was invited to participate. It was a fantastic experience. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey, Charles Martin Smith and Don Stroud played music all day! As a musician, I appreciate the tireless work and dedication that these guys enter into their roles. They had to play those songs 20 times. It is very difficult to maintain consistency and energy under such conditions. It is visible during a cut after a day it will be, but fortunately the unsuspecting public probably didn't pick it up. <br /> <br /> Skater all day, getting the day off school and transporting back in time was an incredible excitement. I also have my first "date" on film. I had to walk to a ticket house. Woo hoo! Even with an out-of-date hairstyle and warm lights that melt the vaseline in my hair, it was still worth it. Fun stuff. <br /> <br /> In addition, the movie is very satisfying as a whole. Busey plays his best role ever and the supporting role is excellent. I'm happy to be part of a wonderful movie of the day. To think I could have been in the Corvette summer or something. Not. <br /> <br /> A funny ironic end is that years later I was in a video store in Malibu, watching the movie the week it was released on video. Gary Busey came in and stood right next to me. I showed him the cover and talked about how big he was and how I was extra and what wasn't. Pretty strange, but very cool, for what it's worth.
