Quirky, vulnerable, raw, honest and a surprise to watch. I'm not here to give a summary or summary of the movie. I just want to congratulate this little movie with the GREAT GREAT HEART. I put my hat on the filmmaker and it is excellent throw. If you want to know what happens in the movie, then it will see. Author / Director Michael Parness has dealt with a very sensitive and emotional subject, suicide, with great compassion, comedy and empathy. I see a good career for Mr. Parness. This movie works. From the outrageous opening to the tender, honest moments between David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. As with every movie, we have to suspend unbelief, but I found with MAX AND GRACE. I was easily transported and completely convinced of his "surreal moments". I just wish they would push some of those moments. Mr. Parness cast a wonderful performance on this talented role. For example, Guillermo DÃ­az's performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical as well as moving. Colossus Ralf Moeller, former mr. Olympiad, as a terrible patient ... perfect. I can go on and on ... This independent feature has the strength of a great Hollywood movie, but you forget about the STARS on the screen as you accompany this wonderfully written story. The real star here is the brilliant screenplay. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Writer / Director Michael Parness.
