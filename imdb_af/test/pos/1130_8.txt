I watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations, just graduated college and switched to "real life". I was not in a brotherhood, but many of my best friends were, and I took part in the party they did in their home, so I know what happens in some ways. <br /> <br /> Of course, this show is a dramatization, not a documentary in any way of Greek life or university life, though it does hold a lot of truth, though it is excessively exaggerated. If you look at the show for the value it contains as a TV program, and nothing more, it is very entertaining, such as movies like Old School, Porky's, Animal House, etc. If you look, it expects all of your Experiences in your own college life, you will probably also be left over, more or more want to dramatize many events.
