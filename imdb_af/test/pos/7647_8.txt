This one surprised me. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews beforehand that called it a good B grade film and was prepared for the worst. Halfway through, I suddenly realized I was completely wrapped up and enjoying it a lot. There were some very exciting moments that you sat down, nervous about the remote control or any other object in reach. Overall, this movie definitely doesn't deserve the B-grade tag. <br /> <br /> Credit should be given to director, Gary Ellis and authors, Bill Boatman & Todd King for their film debut. I hope these guys go on with bigger budgets and some studio support.
