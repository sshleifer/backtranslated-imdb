Their relationship becomes physically fast and they both believe they are soul mate. Until one day the provincial girl comes home to get a man in their bed. Her lover then reveals to her that their relationship was just an experiment and she really likes men. Um, similar to the Anne Heche and Ellen Degeneres thing. Anyway, the provincial girl who broke and broke through this discovery moved out and began to find out what the real world was about, as she fell into the hands of all manner of revengeful and fickle people in the 19th century England.
