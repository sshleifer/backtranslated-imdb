VERY memorable comedy. It's great to look at the many situations that evolve and eventually converge after a long journey on the largest collection of eclectic humanity (and the world's largest base tonk) - the great American highway. Like "... evil, crazy world" it has many contemporary talent, old age politics, good comic action and dialogue. Unlike these, it's the target that isn't looking for the illegal searchers - they have no idea what they really want, as they drive along America's major road. It also does not carry the weight of a large falster that is only saved in the end by a large stomach laugh. But the finale series is nothing short of spectacular, with excellent movie editing, humor and timing. The metropolitan bank scene is hilarious with many original plays, especially by a very talented character. The total aplomb of the inhabitants of the city in the face of chaos makes one feel like the proverbial fly on the ceiling. The slapstick is funny, but Honky Tonk Freeway deserves to be heard and seen now, as it is surprisingly loaded with nuances and character missions that are easily missed. All in all, a very funny reflection of who we were and are, good or bad, and the good-natured situations we find ourselves in. It was just meant to be FUNNY and it is!
