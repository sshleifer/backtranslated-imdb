Mum really should get another title to distinguish it from all the other movies out there, called mother or with the word mother in the title. <br /> <br /> It is a much better zombie movie to so much of the mess It is time and time again and everyone ends up very much like any other zombie movie out there. <br /> <br /> It's so different and refreshing that it almost categorizes. <br /> <br /> The cute old lady who enters a creepy lodge, who is just a carnivore, then infects the old lady, who also gets into a carnivorous zombie or ghoul, which is not exactly defined . <br /> <br /> There is pathos in the story as her son realizes what she has become and tries to help her by providing food. (I will not say more about it, fear of inserting a destroyer!) It is one of those 'quiet' movies unlike guns that explode, explosions rage, car hunt, etc. Sowing etc that makes so many movies the same junk. but still with enough greedy moments to satisfy horror fans, while also enticing sadness in the story, along with fine feet of humor, as opposed to the straight silliness of some so-called horror movies. <br /> <br /> There is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the movie, where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her Christmas tree for the company and looks so innocent, but what she gets !! Oh me! <br /> <br /> A jewel of a movie and even if it's not your thing, should at least be considered once by a real horror fan.
