The curse of Monkey Island. Released 6 years after the success of Monkey Island 2. You would think with Monkey Island 2's cruel end that it would end Monkey Island once and for all. But it seems a little to attract Guybrush into exile. But enough of that is the whole point of Monkey Island returning, and the voices are just phenomenal. If LucasArts were to make a movie / cartoon of Monkey Island, it would probably be what it looks and sounds like. The plot is really good, and everything about it is just fantastic. If you haven't heard of the Monkey Island series, buy the Monkey Island Archives of The Monkey Island Booty Pack and play through all the games starting with The Secret of Monkey Island then Monkey Island 2 and The Curse of Monkey Island. Monkey Island 4 was really good, but this one occupies them all.
