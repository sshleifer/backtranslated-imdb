Buddy Manucci (Roy Scheider, strong in a leading role in the lead role), has a secret, uncovered police group, called the Seven-Ups whose tactics do not necessarily follow the exact ways of the law. They get the job done in their own way without letting the press leak, and it gives them the freedom to expand their ways to come to the criminals. Most work detectives and policemen just can't get away. Buddy has a childhood couple named Vito (Tony Lo Bianco) who exchanges information with him about gangs and shysters working in the streets of NYC. What Buddy does not know is that Vito constitutes a scheme with names of Buddy's "checklist" (he opened this book to give notes by Vito, but does not know that his friend wrote those many names within his mind) to erect mob families in a series of kidnapping gangs, through two cop posters, Moon (villain Richard Lynch) and Bo (Bill Hickman) working with him. When this scheme goes wrong, with one of the Seven-Ups being killed, Vito becomes anxious because he knows how Buddy can be if he is a doggedly to someone. Especially if one of his own is murdered. <br /> <br /> Very underrated cop movie has been trying to get an exciting New York City car chase, like Buddy's kidnapping of policemen, after killing his mate. The movie is not too complex after the plot has been set up and we realize who the ringleader is in the twilight of mobsters. Scheider has never received the credit he deserves as a good lead actor. He has emotional scope and we see his policeman lose and a friend takes his toll on him. The film is quickly tackled with good action sequences and represents an interesting plot of betrayal between friends, as greed before that childhood friendship comes and how it seems like a smooth crime spree against evil communities can get families. killed.
