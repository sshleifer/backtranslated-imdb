I read a fake hidden comment about previous remarks stating that this movie has a lot of gay guys fighting their gayness. <br /> <br /> It can't be misleading. "Eighteen" is not a gay movie. It has only three gay characters in it and one of them is the victim of people's prejudice like the one who wrote the comment, despite his confession of justice. <br /> <br /> Pip's grandfather wasn't gay. The fair of the soldier and his sergeant is male bonding at the critical moment of death. But some people are frightened by a kiss and welcomed scene of intestines killed by a man. The focus of the film is the straight relationship of Pip and the sweet girl and their face. social obligation and parenting. <br /> <br /> Ralph Rewes www.r1313.info
