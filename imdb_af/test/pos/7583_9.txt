In the history of the theater, every major filmmaker had to make a first film. Many times when seen after they have succeeded, a light bulb goes on in our heads. The connection is made and we see the solid foundation of where they started. So it is with HORSES ON MARS. This is the subtle humor that is told around a seemingly straight forward story that tells a wonderful story, but you can also enjoy the footage at the same time. In the images, I paid close attention to detail and a production polish that is scarce in any student life. <br /> <br /> A young filmmaker has always made improvements. But if Mr. Anderson continues on this road, I think we will look back daily on this movie as the beginning of a good career. <br /> <br /> You should definitely see this movie. Nothing beats the big screen.
