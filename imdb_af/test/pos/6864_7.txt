Anatomy is an entertaining and engaging movie that does not contain the discomfort associated with the movie subject. The notion of ethical ignorance in the medical science world is one that pushes the viewer to discomfort, and the realism of the institutions ('Heidelberg') and the special effects make it a completely easy movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The characters, the writing and the brilliance of the film, however, are all too familiar with the Scream movies that have again popularized this kind of genre. Unfortunately, while the subject is one to care for, the viewer is presented with another movie full of college student characters that we really don't get a chance to care for unresolved subplots and rediscovered hammy stage murders. several years ago, since the unforgettable opening of Drew Barrymore in Scream. <br /> <br /> Steven Ruzowillzky makes a fair effort of writing and direction, but does not push other boundaries than the general theme. While being presented with an entertaining movie with reasonable performances, we are unhappy with the old feeling: nothing is wrong with this movie, but nothing is extraordinary either. <br /> <br /> An entertaining movie and an interesting opportunity to see how foreign filmmakers are influenced by the post-screaming horror culture. 6 out of 10
