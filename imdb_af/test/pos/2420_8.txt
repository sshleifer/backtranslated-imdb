I read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as previous Karate Kid installments. Although my favorite is still Karate Kid II, I felt this fourth installment of the movie series was in line with the other and had some important lessons to share. Unlike previous versions, the karate student is a female teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path rather than a male teenager. Maggi finds it a little more challenging, but rises to the occasion. The plot turns are credible and predictable. I found the bad guys a little one-dimensional, but this weakness is present in all the installments in different grades. The camera work is impressive and from time to time over a beautiful scenery. The Zen monastery is both tough and charming. The Zen monks add a bit of humor and light to the narrative flow. I love the "Zen Bowling" scenes that were previously on a humorous counterpart to the serious Zen archery. The quality of the movie is like a good TV show. The music selected for the wallpaper is very good, especially with the Little River Band playing "Listen to your heart". The lessons in the movie are valuable and worth learning. They are faithful to the spirit of karate and do not be careful to glorify the fight. All in all, I enjoyed it.
