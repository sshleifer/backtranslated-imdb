This depiction of lost Japanese forces in the Philippines is a tour of the total meaninglessness of the war. This is an effective representation of Japanese pacifist views after World War II. In the film, Japanese soldiers were left to preserve themselves in the jungles of the Philippines. Faced with impending famine, they settle the cannibalism and gradually lose the small humanity they have left. Calling this movie will be depressed, something of an understatement. The viewer has a very desperate sense of life's lost value in the modern battle. The final scene is almost nihilistic, but the film is a worthy statement, nothing less. Highly recommended.
