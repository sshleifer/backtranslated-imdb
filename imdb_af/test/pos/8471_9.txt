I say nothing new when I say "Ray" was wonderful. While listening to this movie, I have to mention something that differentiates it from other movies. Very rarely is a film made entirely by the actor (s). "Ray" is made easy by Jamie Foxx. Without the wonderful performance of Jamie Foxx, "Ray" will be just another interesting and informative biopsy. I always thought Foxx was funny, from his days with 'In Livin' Color 'and' The Jamie Foxx Show ', and I also knew he was talented as he used his own show ("The Jamie Foxx Show") has to show off his musical talents. But I never thought he could get such a role. I don't know much about acting and what they get through in character or other things like that, but what I saw about Jamie Foxx was extremely impressive. He wrapped him in that role and we had Ray Charles rather than an actor depicting Ray Charles. Ray's story was great, but it is life given by Jamie Foxx.
