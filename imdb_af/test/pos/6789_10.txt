I hope we will never be cynical as a society to appreciate the simple beauty of this movie. Nice to look at its romantic English countryside, and beautiful in its message of faith and loyalty. Look at your children, especially your young girls. Velvet Brown is a wonderful role model for girls. It was one of my daughter's favorite movies. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a best-selling book by Enid Bagnold about a girl, Velvet, whose whole life is her horse, Pi, and pursues her single-minded pursuit of her "impossible" dream. I will no longer say about the plot because I make it visit for the first time. She lives with a large loving family in a small coastal town. <br /> <br /> This is the movie Elizabeth Taylor made a star, and watching the movie is to understand why. She is a natural actress who radiates an inner beauty that matches her external beauty, confidence, passion and innocence. She is the emotional core of the film. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney gives a great show like Mi, the young man who comes to their doorstep one day, and helps with the Velvet train the Pi. It's one of his best performances. Anne Revere also stands as Velvet's mother in an Oscar-winning film. Her strong, loving and wise character understands that life does not have much value unless you follow your dreams: "We are equal. br /> <br /> I recommend this very lovely, very inspiring classic from Hollywood's golden age.
