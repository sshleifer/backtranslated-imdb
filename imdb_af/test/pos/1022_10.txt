I was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very much like my school. The school plays where the top actors kiss, which happened at my school. A crazy gang of boys, my school just when we went on a highway, would have a smoke! "Awake", someone in my school broke through a light and broke the stick! Then they were kept in a safe !!! And for some nocturnal activities! what can i say. The movie actually came out in 1982, I remember it, as it was when I bought my house and showed the movie at the same time. If you like British movies and movies about school, growing up and magazines, then that's for you. Another movie, much like that, 'SWALK' came out a few years ago and I'd love to see it again, also 'Kes' is in the genre. Highly recommended. (But trust me, 1982 is when it came out)
