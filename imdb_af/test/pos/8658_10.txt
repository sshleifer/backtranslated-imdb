Overview: Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) finds himself alone on a coach, dropped on a desert ground, after which the last stop of his journey appears. He didn't know how he got there, but a welcome sign was set up for him. After a moment considering his whereabouts, he is greeted by a man who brings him to his new life. He then enters a world that differs from the one from which he came. <br /> <br /> Since Andreas is quickly introduced as an accountant to his new job, he feels that his environment is a bit too uniform for his taste. As he broke his first lunch, he immediately noticed that everyone in the city was walking in gray suits. On the same day he saw a fellow businessman killed on a few fence stands, which looked like an act of suicide. The strange thing is, the city staff does not pay attention to this horrific act and walk as if it never happened. It is quick to see that these people are genetically incompatible, and their ability to distinguish between anything human or inhuman is absent. <br /> <br /> To help Andreas establish, he is invited to join a local nightclub with his co-workers. The club seems to be one step away to be as exciting as a bingo evening. And if Andreas drinks his sadness, he realizes that it doesn't matter how much he drinks, the alcohol has no effect on him. While telling these incidents to a stranger in the men's room, a man in a toilet bowl starts words that have come out completely on Andreas's mind. If he realizes that this man thinks he is, he follows him to his home, noting where he lives for future reference. The plot develops predictably with Andreas who wants an escape. He's looking for the man he once followed, hoping he could lead him to become human again ... but is it too late? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This Norwegian movie is something everyone should see, as it contains the answer to the big question! What is the meaning of life? (Well, close enough). The film outlines the dark realities of what became of today's working man (or woman). The only purpose is to make people realize that life is too short to be materialistic. It tries to show that small clich√© things, such as the sound of children playing, should not be taken for granted, because the moment you do not hear the sound, it is the moment you step away to a robot. The end of the movie repeats what happens when it's too late to escape the everyday routine you've become accustomed to. You start assuming "if it hasn't broken, don't make it right" and become too comfortable to cause a risk of change. <br /> <br /> Although this movie should not be taken as a piece of realism ... its message is more than real. The lack of empathy conveyed in the film, and what Andreas sees, is a brave statement of what life can become. The director, Jens Lien, compiled a film that failed in any other director's hands. It's a fine piece of cinematic genius, and I'm eagerly waiting to see what he's doing next. <br /> <br /> The lead, played by Trond Fausa Aurvaag, is perfectly cast. Representing the average Joe, Trond offers a good catalyst to make this picture dark humorous. The supporting actors also do a suitable job, and for some reason I feel that Keanu Reeves would have been perfect in this movie, as most supporting roles require their acting as emotional. <br /> <br /> The score because this movie was beautifully composed. The recurring theme was always a pleasure to listen to, and it gave a very bleak but pleasing feeling to the movie. <br /> <br /> For a release time in the UK for May 25, 2007, I'll definitely be reliving this experience on the big screen. This movie gained its way in my top 10 ... now quickly become my top 20! It has some shocking scenes and is darkly humorous throughout ... A MUST SEVEN !!
