Sheba Baby is another Pam Grier Blaxploitation film. It was one of Pam's less visceral films of this genre. Pam plays Sheba Shane, who is a Chicago gum shoe. Saba's father is the owner of a small loan company in Missouri. When local people try to run her father's business, Sheba goes to the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier has already made her in Blaxploitation films, by the time Sheba Baby came together. Fans of both Coffy and Foxy Brown know that Pam is capable of having an explosive intensity as an actress. In Sheba Baby, the fiery performance that Pam's viewers expected was not so clear in this movie. Not that Pam doesn't kick in Sheba Baby. She is just not as much of a road-train vigilante as in her previous Blaxploitation films. <br /> <br /> The supporting film in this movie is a clear disappointment. So Sheba Baby is Pam's movie, through and through. And while Pam is a little more muted than in her other films, she still gives a compelling performance in Sheba Baby. This movie is definitely worth your time, if you are a fiery Pam Grier fan.
