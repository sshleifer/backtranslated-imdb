This movie can be compared to "comfort food" for the soul. Anyone who has ever tried and tried to save a relationship can relate to this movie. So many parts of it are so hilarious and so many parts are so sad. It's not perfect in its production or even its dialogue, but the story is unique that speaks for modern "romantic" comedies. Luke Wilson is fine at best, but in my opinion Heather Graham does an exceptional job. Try it, despite the DVD cover. The character of Joline brings many problems into our culture of self-service. She asks us if commitment really is for the other person or ourselves. Truly this is ourselves. Following a promise (everywhere from marriage to a friend's claim) is a good feeling. Again, our word is nothing but a shapeshift puff or smoke. Joline is like a wake up call. We need to be aware of our words and obligations, that means more than we think. At the same time, we should not commit to someone who is unable to do the same.
