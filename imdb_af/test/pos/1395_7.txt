Although the video box for many copies of this movie claims it's about people who turned inside out, it's a total lie. In fact, apart from the opening segment, the movie is not even a horror movie. With his sunken treasure, legions of fishermen and crazy scientists, it's much more like a Doug McClure adventure movie. Obviously, this movie is not a work of art, but it's nice to watch. Just be warned that the beginning is a pity.
