Unlike http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098238/, this movie does not provide background information. We see a photograph of the fall of Danton, its mockery and execution, but unless one has expanded the revolution reasonably, it is difficult to understand where characters come from (Fouquier-Tinville, Philippeau, Desmoulins, Robespierre. ..) and therefore to appreciate them for what they are: Danton and Joe Blobb can be the same person for the viewer. For example, Robespierre & Desmoulins have been good friends since their youth, explaining how Robespierre is acting. Those who know the facts will easily orient themselves and appreciate this good movie with actors who deliver solid plays, no useless subplots and good reconstruction of the times. Desmoulins and Danton are the best characters, but everyone does a good job, even the "demented" Saint-Just portrayed as psychopath. 'Terror' was a period of massacres whose importance was not fully documented and that it was largely driven by ambition, greed, and the establishment of personal disputes, which were carried on to ignorant sans-culottes as the next epochal fight against tyranny.
