WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> 'Rock Star' is one of the solid rock movies I've ever seen. The original idea of ​​the screenplay focuses on a young singer in the 80's, who has paid tribute to one of the most famous hard rock bands of the era. He not only plays their music on the note, but also lives the life of his idols. When his friends in the tribute emit him, looking for some originality, the lot plays a good turn and he is appointed to replace the lead singer of the idol. A dream came true? Well, hardly. While starting the life of the celebrity, including the drug and sex transgressions of the 80s rock scene, he must face the problems of his supportive friend. He will eventually have to answer questions about creativity and questions. a saying in the band's music. <br /> <br /> I like the movie, one of the reasons being that it is one of the first time that the life and music of the hard rock rock groups is shown in a realistic way. Music genre fans will be happy with the soundtrack. The general idea is original, and the issues of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are rendered in a meaningful and balanced way. It's pretty good with Mark Wahlberg better than most other action games I've seen lately, and Jennifer Aniston agrees with the pretty-girl-who-know-a-lot-of-life role. More problematic is the end, which is fairly conventional, and can disappoint. It seems the main character, after leaving the big and well-known band, has found his own creative path. But in an ironic twist, the music he plays at the end is the worst in the movie! <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale. Worth to see - however, expect exposure to a high dose of metal. If you don't like this kind of music, you may prefer to avoid this movie.
