A brief history of time. The cosmological content of this documentary is fascinating, the thoughts and the man ... brilliant. Yet I had a hard time enjoying this documentary. <br /> <br /> The way in which family members and professors are maintained feels so unnatural. These members were interviewed on specifically built sets and were uncomfortable. Mostly, their bills came as much action and vigorously directed. The (deliberate) non-inclusion of the requested questions manipulates the given information in a very hard and impersonal format. <br /> <br /> I don't know who is responsible for the interview, but they did a terrible job and took away the experience. <br /> <br /> Overall, another fascinating documentary effort is worth seeing. , if only for the interesting concepts offered.
