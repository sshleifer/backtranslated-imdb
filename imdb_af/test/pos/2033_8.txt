I have to admit that I don't expect much from this movie. I was surprised that I enjoyed it so much I did. The writing wasn't oscar material, but it wasn't terrible either. The play was great by Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston had a great supportive role, and looked like always. What this movie made for me was the music. If you don't like 80's glam or hair bands, you probably won't like this movie. It's all about a rockstar. Some cliches were present, but did not drop the movie at all. I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll and remembers getting up and shouting !!! 8 out of 10 for great acting and fantastic music. <br /> <br /> Jason
