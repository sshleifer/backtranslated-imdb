After I drove around the world, it struck me that Australia really doesn't have one thing other countries have: history. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Australia didn't have a war, it didn't have a civilian life. war and most of his political history is rather ..... boring! Nothing "big" came to mark a kind of turning point in Australia's history. To the dismissal of the Whitlam government by the governor-general of Australia - John Kerr. <br /> <br /> For those who are Australian, you can overshoot this paragraph and move to the next. This is to the benefit of curious non-Australians! Australia was colonized by the British. As time went on, it became clear that Australia could stand on its own two feet. As a result, the United Kingdom authorized Australia to establish its own parliaments, laws, courts and so on. Australia's law and politics will no longer be provided directly by the British; Australia will, however, be governed by Australians in its own right, although the courts, precedents, parliament and so on are largely modeled on the British system. This shift is codified in the Australian Constitution. Despite the fact that the constitution legally establishes Australian governments, legislative procedures, courts (but for those who are curious - no rights), these are two divisions that were previously included and remain to this day. It is more or less regarded as the "reserve powers of the Crown (King / Queen of Great Britain)." The first group of divisions concerns the creation of the Governor-General's office. Briefly, the Governor-General is regarded as the Queen's Chief Representative in Australia and is described as the "Executive" branch of the Australian Government. When a piece of law is passed by the Australian Parliament, the constitution declares that it will only become law when it is signed by the Governor-General. As such, the Govenor General is regarded by some as nothing more than a rubber maker who performs an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the Crown. Theoretically, the Governor-General may refuse to sign a law passed by the Australian Parliament if he approves of it. For example, if parliament passed a law that would allow the police to kill any Australian over the age of 50 (hypothetically of course) then the GG may refuse to sign it and it will not become the law of the country. However, this power is theoretical and has (to date) never been exercised. At the "convention" (which is the buzz word of the events leading to the dismissal), the governor-general does almost at the command of the Australian government and, thus, if the government passes the law and the prime minister governor-general instruct it to sign it, he will, almost always without any question. In fact, by the "convention", the governor-general agrees with the advice given to him by the prime minister of the day (and the prime minister alone). The second aspect is Article 64 of the Constitution, which stipulates that the ministers of the Governor-General's "pleasure". Now the events of 1975, covered in this film, have given rise to a precedent in this particular section: if the governor-general is somehow dissatisfied with the government and / or the prime minister, this section seems to him lawfully allow the government (which happened in 1975 ... hence the title of the movie "the dismissal.") Whether or not "the governor-general's pleasure" can be interpreted as "the unfit right to dismiss" A controversial point, though, has led to rather exciting exchanges among Australians - especially since the governor-general is not elected by the people of Australia. <br /> <br /> Now that this wallpaper aspect is out of the way, we come back to discuss the movie. It was well made. The pass was patient but didn't drag at all. The drama was well-contained and very realistic. This does not have to dramatize the events and, above all, it has not presented its viewpoint from one political perspective. On the contrary, I felt it was fair and balanced, although the completion of the text before the credits suggests that the filmmakers are unlikely to approve the governor-general's decision to dismiss the Whitlam government. But I won't generally describe the film as a bias in one direction or the other. <br /> <br /> In terms of accuracy, it was almost on the point. The filmmakers definitely did their homework and clearly read the books and writings of all the principals involved. There were a number of finer details that were slightly skipped, mainly because they took a long time to explain and eventually had little impact on the events of 1975, so I forgive them for that. Furthermore, I think it was difficult to regain the public sentiment of the post-Vietnam war era, but Noyce pretty much pulled it off. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was delighted that the film tried to get individual policies from both sides without being analytic, obsessive or judgmental about them. In addition, anybody we raised, such as Connor's pipeline, has a lot of relevance to the story. The filmmakers realized that their task was to tell the story of the events that led to the dismissal and not to offer a political endorsement or opposition regarding policies and views. It was clever because it meant the movie could not be accused of misrepresenting one side's policy. <br /> <br /> The dismissal is probably the most incredible piece of political history in Australia in its short life. I am glad that it has crystallized in celluloid. Essential look for any Australian.
