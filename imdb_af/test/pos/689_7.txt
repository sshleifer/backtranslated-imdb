<br /> <br /> ************************** MILD SPOILERS AHEAD ************ * ************* <br /> <br /> Our Diving at Dawn is an English-made movie featuring John Mills in the lead. The second time I watched the DVD version was on a big screen TV and I have to say the movie is better than I thought the first time I saw it on the samll screen. Maybe it's the big screen viewing that helped? <br /> <br /> I'm still saying the first few segments of the movie are stunned, but as soon as the submarine leaves the doctor and starts its mission, the movie also goes down! The search for the German battleship called Brandenburg and the adventures that came with it was absorbent and the detail shown in the movie is interesting! <br /> <br /> I increase my score to 7/10. If you enjoy WWII movies, I think you will find this one interesting once the submarine is running. Some of the men on the sub have a sense of humor!
