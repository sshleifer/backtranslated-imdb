The last film that gave a lively and disturbing glimpse of what madness is likely to be, was In Dreams. In that movie you didn't see madness, you were there. Now comes the cell with an updated and much more disturbing representation of the heart of a psychotic killer. The opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a little comatose little boy, and the things that Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are first fascinating and frightening. The things she later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) are incredibly imaginative and fascinating. Most of these things have never been seen in movies. <br /> <br /> The story of The Cell is not exactly something that is truly groundbreaking. In fact, it's basically the same as the story in the silence of the lambs. You have a murderer in custody and these people should come to mind to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life. The only real difference between the bases of the stands is that in the silence of the lambs a murderer must enter to find another killer as well as his current victim, while in the cell must come in the mind of a killer around his find own victim. Despite the unfortunate bad story, The Cell revolutionizes the genre of the psychological thriller. Nothing ever made, even comes close. <br /> <br /> The movie also had good direction and was extremely good. Vince Vaughn delivers another of his outstanding performances (he was even good as Norman Bates in the pathetic 1998 redesign of Psycho), and even Jennifer Lopez made the second good effort of her career (the other being the big one out of sight) . Nothing can be said of the cinematography in The Cell to give it enough credit, it was imaginative and fascinating and unparalleled by anything ever seen in film history. The Cell is an incredibly well-made movie, and it deserves to be recognized.
