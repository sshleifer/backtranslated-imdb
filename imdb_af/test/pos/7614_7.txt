Never Kissed gives Drew Barrymore the chance to do something about 70% of us want to do. Go back to high school and make the necessary corrections. Actually, the first time for me was bad enough and at my age I doubt I could pull it like Drew did. <br /> <br /> Of course, the reason is that when we leave a high school, we look like a cocoon and we have to deal with the big, unfriendly world out there. I knew a few in my life who would go back and stay if they could. In fact, there is a Law and Order episode that investigates the dark side of the same situation. A young enough girl to pull it off goes through the high school at least three times and kills the person who stumbles on her secret. <br /> <br /> With Drew, however, it is a command. She is a copy editor for the Chicago Sun Times, who wants to be a reporter. Publisher Garry Marshall, who plays the role of Donald Trump has taken over the Sun Times, gets this brilliant idea and only sees in Barrymore a young enough person to pull off the masquerade. <br /> <br /> The first time high school was bad enough. Drew wasn't the most popular then and she didn't do better the second time. This is until Brother David Arquette goes back to school and helps her over the rough spots. <br /> <br /> Of course, it brings a lot of trouble to Drew, peer pressure from two sources, work and school. What is a girl to do? <br /> <br /> Never Been Kissed is a light and charming comedy that has the opportunity to be redundant and gives us great entertainment. Drew is very funny and sweet and her performance in moments of stress for her character moves beautifully into pathos. Michael Vartan as her English teacher is the kind I wish there was more in the field of education and Leelee Sobieski and Jessica Alba played a few empty bearded children trying to hook Drew so desperately. <br /> <br /> However, it doesn't inspire me to return to Midwood High School.
