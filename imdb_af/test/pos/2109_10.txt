Without a doubt, GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive film of AAA stars and musicians ever gathered for a pleasant family adventure. This is a MUST BUY for every video collection! Director BARRY TUBB skillfully combines the drama of the rodeo / 4H competition for the "GRAND CHAMPION" cow with a pleasant and funny story of perseverance against tough challenges. Joey Lauren Adams delivers her distinctive solid performance as the well-known mother, but the star of the show is the 12-year-old EMMA ROBERTS, whose presence on camera is a glow like that of her famous JULIA aunt. You can expect a lot from this young Roberts protégé, as it has already been in her new Nickelodeon series, "FALSE." Proof.
