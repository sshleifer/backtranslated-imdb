Intense, funny, witty, and more than anything, social comedy on the path of adult dating and that's the result - whether good or bad. Mohr and Nicholson are engaged two months away from a wedding date when a bizarre event at their engagement party forces Nicholson to reconsider the relationship and start other people so they will not feel so unspoiled when it comes to sexual experience. . This leads to a disaster of events following Mohr, Nicholson, and their cohorts. Very intelligent and needed at this time of awkward, derogatory comedy, while containing your usual variety of comedic, sexual and frustrated characters (especially Charles as a sexually frustrated sex behavior ... very annoying) who even seem to get the right feeling until this heart commented. <br /> <br /> The film goes the way movies today have to go, showing that guys are sensitive to heart and have moral things. Most of the male characters are the moralistic, straight-forward eyes, while the woman is the strenuous street pointer, who will do nothing to get pleasure. Children will appreciate the message made for self-respecting guys. However, it is easy to assume that most men who watch this movie will use the message of masculine sensitivity to cover any mistake or trait that a woman may find offensive. Yet the writing formula uses it as a tool to pave the way for his male lead, especially that of Mohr, Richter, and to find the director in a cameo as a salesman! <br /> <br /> The women are by far the most prominent if they talk about nothing but pleasure and what it would be like to be with someone else. Although covered by the image of sex-driven kittens, they have friendly qualities. Very funny things. <br /> <br /> On another level, the film follows some of the ensemble in different relationships. Richter meets a tense divorce (a VERY remarkable and noteworthy performance by the ever-reliable Helen Slater) called Penelope, separated by a boy who hates her to divorce her father. As the two enter into a relationship, human interest is revealed and both the comedy and the tragedy of divorce and the beginning of the new study are being studied. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, Mohr and Nicholson had gone too deeply to see what was coming next and what they learned from each other and to decide what would come next . It becomes appropriate and dramatic at the right time. <br /> <br /> Wallodorski's direction is emulated very well when the characters learn to confront each other for everything that has happened ... with the right end. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film had to be released countrywide, and I have to hope it is for some academy awards. Perhaps Helen Slater can eventually earn the recognition she deserves. Anywho, this movie is a no hits hits, give it all you have a romantic sex farce, display very mature and aesthetic. <br /> <br /> Great movie!
