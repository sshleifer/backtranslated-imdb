The problem with the movie is simply that, Conrad's prose is powerfully surprising and cannot be adapted for a movie. Marlow's story in the novella captivates you from the first sentence and you just see "what Conrad writes. In the film it's different, you see the visuals, but the description and reflection that the novel really makes is frightening. But so far If an irreplaceable book is adapted, it is of good quality, with exactly the same scenes, which are genuinely determined, but they never have the same influence as in the novel, the plot in the movie has improved, and it works a lot Good to make it more interesting. The references to Ancient Egypt have been carefully inserted. My hint, read the book and keep it that way, there are better movies out there.
