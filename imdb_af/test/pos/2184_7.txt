This broadcasting of the classic musical Sweeney Todd does not make the production right, but is quite enchanting. <br /> <br /> First, the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production design, up to the frightening staircase. Then the show is excellent, up to the slash. <br /> <br /> The most important thing that fails here is in the shows people give. Oh, they are credible, but it is very frustrating when no one apparently says their moments in a song as fast as they say, "Kiss Me." In fact, Johanna's actress is not only inactive, but also a little out of the box. And Angela Lansbury's slightly exaggerated cockney accent is a bit annoying. One more thing - what exactly is so bad about Judge Turpin's actions by Johanna that it was banned from American theater, but not the cannibal folk song A Little Priest? <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's an excellent production. It's a thrill to see people doing what they love - and I'm not even talking about "meat pie with a twist".
