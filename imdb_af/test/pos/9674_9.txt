It is a great show, which makes me wonder why it has been pulled off the air many times. But I believe it's here to stay! This show cannot be compared to any other. Before Simpsons was beautiful "on the edge" and as Family Guy, they stretched it out to get off the edge. The things that get away from this show are incredible. Work the clock completely! If you like the Simpsons, you'll be a family guy!
