Imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a child. Now think what would happen if you had the chance to talk to your younger self or even change him or her. Will you try to influence or try to change your younger self's beliefs in the light of your future experience? Or maybe the encounter will change your parent's perception of life and reality? <br /> <br /> Walt Disney's The Kid is trying to tackle this complex mindset by Bruce Willis in a 'younger self' collision course 'Spenser Breslin' (from The Santa Clause 2 and The Cat in the Hat) fame)) The result is a sometimes funny, sometimes appalling encounter that reminds you of your own past, present and future and believes it is never too late to change your course.
