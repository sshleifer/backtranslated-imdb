Jack Frost 2 is probably the brightest movie I've ever seen in my life. The full title of the movie is Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman. Horror movie fans who have a taste for campy story lines will be happy to watch it. This movie was straight to video, and for good reason. Here's why: The acting was so horrible and so terrible that it could cause someone to cry. The main character had no personality, and the actor's bad scene made it even worse. The script was also horrible. Each character always says a cheesy line, and adds the cheesy lines to the bad choreography, then you have something bad. Secondly, the story line is not really that impressive, but since this movie was straight to video, it was forgiven. The director and writer could have changed the idea of ​​a killer snowman into something cool, but they didn't. Their story has many plot holes in it. In the beginning, a cup of coffee is beaten in the fish tank, with the melted Jack Frost. Scientists are trying to restore his life, but they can't. After the cup of coffee fell into the tank, Jack Frost was completely recovered. Now he is immune to freezing. In Jack Frost part 1, the main character's DNA blended with the anti-freeze used to kill Jack Frost. As the main character is allergic to bananas, Jack Frost is also. Hence, here's my point. They say Sam's DNA combined with Jack Frost's. But one of the scientists had some saliva on the cup, so when it fell into the tank, the scientists would be DNA combined with Jack Frosts. Another thing, the special effects were not very good either. Here's the good points: Jack Frost 2 has lots of blood, which looks pretty realistic. Although this movie is flawed in hell, it is still entertaining. Overall, Jack Frost 2 is a pleasant horror movie. However, the first one was better. 7 out of 10.
