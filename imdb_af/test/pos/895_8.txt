Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa after a photo shoot. There she is met by a couple and other swinging couples. They all stay in this large, very touristy hotel with a huge pool. One night, they have a pool party with a true living native dancer. It is very unpolitical and very kitschy. Later, Emanuelle finally got her photo shoot, which turned out to be in one of those driving, in-car safaris (though photography is beautiful). Throughout the film, Emanuelle goes to every man she meets. Photography is very well done in this movie. There are scenes with the waterfall, which gallop the giraffes and the ancient ruins. The film is worth seeing for the soundtrack by Nico Fidenco alone.
