Fata Morgana, the documentary film of 1971 by German film maker Werner Herzog, filmed in the late 1960s over several years, is one of the rare DVDs to be listened to with the comment enabled. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) images that are timeless. You simply can't say it's been made more than thirty years ago. The soundtrack of the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality. The narrative by three different German narrators (German film historian Lotte Eisner, Eugen Des Montagnes and Wolfgang von Ungern-Sternberg) is solid and Herzog continues with Eisner's input to this project, himself and film history, but the English speaker of the translation, James William Gledhill has a fair voice, which offers him a lot more perfect for this project, although much of the text is fairly unnecessary in any language. Yes, the faux Biblical sounds of the Popul Vuh Maya creative myth in the first part of the film, Creation, are interesting, but the text Herzog wrote for the remaining two parts (Paradise and The Golden Age), along with quotes from A German poet Herzog names like Manfred Eigendorf, looks almost a satire of the first part's sombre tone ??. The film apparently coincided with the shooting of several other Herzog projects simultaneously - the fictional Even Dwarfs Started Small and the documentary The Land of Silence and Darkness and the flying doctors of East Africa, but these rejected projects just add to the beauty of this movie, such as aerial photographs of a flamingo mating far away that gives an ominous sense, of which Herzog raves in his comment. This unpleasant feeling is present from the start of several aircraft landing on a desert runway. The images are darkened sequentially as the heat rises from the ground and increases the twisted waves that mark the images. That this film was influential in the Quatsi films of Godfrey Reggio is an understatement. But while Reggio has content to just throw images on you, Herzog has the ability to only have American film maker Terrence Malick: to make a completely independent vocabulary from the compilation of images and words and one that is dependent on " an emotional first print. Analysis can fail when it comes to such efforts. Herzog often does not understand why his art is great. The best thing he often does is completely unconscious and mesmeric. That's why his contempt for Hollywood's Lowest Common Divisor is open to comment. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best illustration of this is in a scene that commented on Herzog's comments we have a serious consequence in Cameroon. It shows the chopped cattle carcasses, and Herzog describes the unbearable stench. Yet, the viewer can do all of the images, the blackness of the sun-dried parts of animals and the flowered bone sense. Yet, even in the commentary, Herzog focuses on the stench, not a deeper meaning. He is happy to let you interpret and interpret what you want in and out of his work, such as the almost erotically feminized forms of sand dunes, reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman's wolf hour, where Max Von Sydow hands his hand. Ingrid Thulin's beautiful nude body curves. But the archetypal image in this film, which symbolizes much of Herzog's career, is a mirage of a distant car moving back and forth on the surface of what appears to be more. It is deep, hypnotic, illusory, elusive, supernatural, but actually, like Herzog, the believer who came from a family of militant atheists is. But then it ends like everything.
