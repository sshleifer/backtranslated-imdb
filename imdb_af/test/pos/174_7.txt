I can't believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all of your eighty horror reactions and I will definitely not join all my fellow reviewers, saying that 'Bloody Birthday' is a terrible show. On the contrary, I enjoyed it very much and I was pleasantly surprised by the ingenuity and surprises it offers. Don't just refer to this movie as another 80's skater, because the victims here are quite unlikely and so are the murderers. We were introduced to three cherubic young people who were all born during a solar eclipse. The moment they are delivered, the planet Saturn is blocked by both the sun and the moon and therefore the children are emotionally and apparently without conscience. It really starts to show their tenth birthday, as they are on a merciless deadly spree. <br /> <br /> Granted, these things have been unbelievably conquered and even slightly offensive, but serious, who cares? Unlike many other horror movies of this period, try at least something original and imaginative. For once, the children's play is good and the whole movie has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music. The murder sequences are grim and tense, and it is always rude to see them being dedicated by children with an angel. I don't know who hired the 3 kids, but they did a good job. Especially the girl and the child with glasses are very memorable. The beautiful images of the heartless threesome remind you of classic highlights, such as 'The Lost Village', 'The Bad Seed' and 'Prohibited Children'. This movie is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones, but very nice and not one horror lover will regret watching it. <br /> <br /> Bloody Birthday is written and directed by Ed Hunt. Not particularly the greatest genius in the film, but a pleasant fella that also brought our incredibly entertaining cheese festivals such as 'The Brain' and 'Starship Invasions'. If all this is not enough to convince you, Bloody Birthday has a lot of nudity. And not just a nudity, but a topless dance act by MTV-VJ Julie Brown. Oh, and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by Joe Penny, later the star of TV series 'Jake and the Fatman'. Look at it !!
