Fantastic documentaries. A movie in a movie. I'm so stuck with Block after his mother's death. Make one wonder about the time and money spent on therapy. What would have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just add a dependency that flushed his bank account? The audience must understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - going to therapy instead of going to college or work training. She seemed to be trapped by the situation. I wonder if the therapist ever tried to make her think about what she could have done to change her situation and free herself? Meanwhile, woman # 2 was just the opposite. She was out there and worked with his father. ended her bad marriage, supported herself and seemed to be a very confident person. As for the marital status, the Blocks did something right to set up 3 children who could look at their parents' story. Be good with it and share it with us and perhaps lead us to start discussions with our parents and spouses.
