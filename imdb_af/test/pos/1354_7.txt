If Sicily is an area of ​​the Baroque, with its doubling of perspective, it is part of the film's realism challenge. And it's an exuberant pleasure here, to leave Fellini with none, but three film directors, plus of course the real Bellocchio, who really made movies and should not be his honor. There are a variety of tasks and decision improvisations on Manzoni's "I promessi sposi" with, somewhere, real marriage. Sicily is also considered an area of ​​skulduggery (You already know this version of the island, so there is no fairy tale involved), a comic version of which the picture is worthwhile for Sergio Castellito's work with watchdogs on the floor of the great hall of a palace.
