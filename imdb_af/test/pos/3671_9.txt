This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and bars, American rifle culture, divorce and marriage; Yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each one. Kathy Bates is "Amazing" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering series, she brings her considerable comic talent to ground this somewhat unusual movie as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comic talents such as Dan Akroid as Max, her former advocate and the background of Chicago center and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain. Jonathan Price plays Victor Fox, a gay gay singer who is murdered by a Chicago crossbow killer. His boyfriend Dirk Simpson, who is played by the beautiful Rupert Everett, must overcome Victor's brothers and sisters, including Lynn Redgrave. They want to turn their house into a tributary museum and teams with Bates and her dwarf mother-in-law, Maudy Beasley, to find the killer among Chicago homeless. <br /> <br /> The whole role-player sings at various points in the pursuit, and is excellent, especially. the talented prize and assets. This amazing storyline, both funny and bizarre, is one of the most off-center movies. Kameos by Julie Andrews, Barry Manlow, and Sally Jesse Raphael have to tell you how bizarre this movie really is. Strange, funny and out-of-town, but with a good perspective on people of all kinds.
