In Fassbinder's previous films, his ideas sometimes exceeded his ability to perform them. He was always a good writer, but it took him a while to get his style of camera work and write down the storytelling. <br /> <br /> The Four Seasons Dealer is one of Fassbinder's first movies to make full use of color, from the bright green pears in the merchant's car to the bright red roses at the funeral (a funeral in a Fassbinder movie that would have thought). <br /> <br /> His camera work was also there, but it was rather minimalist. The occasional occasions sometimes seem uncomfortable and unnatural, but Fassbinder still comes from his pure avant garde phase. This could be because Michael Ballhaus is not behind the camera, but rather the slightly inferior Dietrich Lohmann. <br /> <br /> However, it is Fassbinder and you get your solution here. Broken dreams are so alive and unrelenting to alienate audiences and drive them into a depressing stupor. Just what the doctor ordered. An early classic that shows remarkable progress compared to its first films submitted just 2 years ago.
