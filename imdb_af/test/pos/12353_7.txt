If anything, William Girdler was an opportunist who wanted a piece of action in what was popular at the time. I mean, a blaxploitation flick in Louisville, Kentucky ... what would it do? I can only imagine the enthusiasm he had to get Pam Grier, a very hot item, to die in his photo. If you're pretty familiar with the genre, Girdler's Sheba, Baby doesn't necessarily carry too far away from the formula. In spite of a change of location, the film still deals with a relentless businessman, Shark, who caters to loan companies, with stoches threatening to get their signatures. <br /> <br /> Grier is Sheba Shayne, a former Louisville police spokesman in Chicago who returns home at the request of her father's partner, Brick (Austin Stoker, Assault on Precinct 13). Saba's father, despite Shark's bully tactics (.. his man in town is Pilot, a wannabe gangster, equipped with stools that aren't as threatening, rather buffoon-like in nature, so skinny they rent men Outside the town to shoot up the Shayne Loan building, his company won't give up, and it eventually costs him his life as a warning by using brutal force leading to the death of him. Saba will get her revenge on everyone responsible for his father's death. In other words, Shark's ass is grass. Can you dig it? <br /> <br /> Seeing Grier with a Magnum is enough to sell this particular movie, the novelty of Louisville is part of the package. You even get a speedboat rush, Grier in shooting with gangsters (.. not necessarily the most polished kind that would be used to seeing in a Chicago or New York during this time in blasting operations), lots of blood comes from bullet riddled bodies torn by firearms and colorful characters (like a wimpy loan shark in the pimp dress called Walker and Pilot which is one of the least scary mobsters you'll probably see) that appears during the movie, most with the accident get in touch with a very harsh Saba. The plot itself is nothing special, but Grier is always worth watching, and Girdler orchestrates many action sequences to entertain his target audience. A modest success for Girdler, and one of his more perfect films.
