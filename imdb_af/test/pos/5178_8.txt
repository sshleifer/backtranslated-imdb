My whole family enjoyed this movie, including 2 small children. Great values ​​without sex, violence, drugs, nudity or curse. Also no special special effects of the dollar were added to try to deceive viewers of a poorly written storyline. A simple little family fun movie. We especially like the songs in the movie. But we only heard part of the songs ... Usually at the end credits ... Would like to buy a soundtrack CD from this movie. This is my 4th Bill Hillman movie and they all have the same guidelines as mentioned above. With all the movies out there that you don't want your kids to look at, this Hillman has no risk rating. We love his movies.
