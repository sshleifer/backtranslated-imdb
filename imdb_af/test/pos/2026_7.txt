Rock Star is a "nice" movie. Everyone is nice. Even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice are really nice. Chris is a nice guy learning a lesson in life. He goes back to his girlfriend Emily, who is also nice. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, despite all the beauty. Maybe I'm just accustomed to all the fears of the X Gen music. In some ways the movie was a caricature of Rock Stars and not hard enough to be credible. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg's play is pretty good. Jennifer Aniston played her role well, but it was uncomplicated. She was a pretty girl. <br /> <br /> See it. If you've ever been to a rock concert or seen Spinal Tap, it'll see.
