You have to see it to believe it. Shot in Hollywood on the strip in the middle of the sloppy, anything goes 70s, this cheaply made movie should really pack the inner theaters in the day. Then again, I bet it had a week. Actually, it's pretty hilarious. The acting is terrible, the direction does not exist, but the hair, clothes, rats pre disco music and the general and out of sleepiness of the story are indignant. Sleazy, it's very sleepy. Highly recommended (if you can find it)
