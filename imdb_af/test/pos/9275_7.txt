This documentary is as unique as it is. And while D'Amato's pedigree was erotic, the movie managed to remember a few decent clips of the movies you remember from the past, Cinemax last night ... A problem ... Joe mixed up loud sometimes with soft-erotic erotica, even mixed in its gore movies. The gore movies are cult classic, going for $ 20 a doll for a print copy on the net (not peanuts for 20 year olds, people.) I want to see why this cult is classic. Also, as nice as Joe looks (he looks more elegant than one might expect), the man wanted to shock. Both "Caligula: The Untold Story" and "Emanuelle in America" ​​show our hardcore rape, sniff and beestiality (in both, you'd be surprised how far he goes in Caligula II with that one if you can find an uncut print Although these scenes may be unpleasant in a person's career, hey, he did. Also, I'd like to hear more interviews from people who worked Joe together. Maybe it's just me who wants to see Laura Gemser look like these days ... I still think she's a goddess and one of the sexiest women ever to grace the genre.
