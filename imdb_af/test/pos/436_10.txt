I just saw Jean Renoir's wonderful movie, French Can Can. It is a visual joy and a great entertainment. The recently produced Moulin Rouge is in comparison. I didn't really get the praise the recent movie received. Now I am more than ever convinced that my appreciation was correct after I saw a master filmmaker like Jean Renoir's version of the same story. He managed to get big performances from his entire role, and the big French actor, Jean Gabin, was in scarce form. The dance series near the end was one of the most exciting ones I have ever seen. It was long, but I didn't want it to end. This movie deserves more recognition than it has.
