I was very impressed with this movie of newcomer Dir. / Writer Jose Reyes. The throw was excellent. "Jorge Cordoba" performed a powerful <br /> <br /> and shocking performance as the main character of "Rafa". It is inspiring to see independent films with this level of talent. <br /> <br /> It takes talent, courage, and determination to go out and make a quality movie. <br /> <br /> I admire anyone who can take an idea of ​​concept to conception and go the mile. <br /> <br /> It's more easy for people to judge more young movie makers, but I rejoice Jose Reyes <br /> <br /> and the talented role for their successful efforts.
