I had no expectations when I started watching this movie. How surprised I was! It's a beautiful, beautiful, twisted movie that will give your mind a great workout! It's not easy. If you're just enjoying the Police Academy style, non-brain movies, it's not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with many completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story make this one of the best movies I've seen long ago! Be open-minded and you will love it!
