I am a fan of Zhang Yimou and finally found this DVD title out of the shelves of a Shenzhen bookshop after a long search in many places. <br /> <br /> This is a major departure from previous Zhang Yimou work, especially in terms of style and venue. The director himself said it was the first and only time he would ever try to make a black comedy in contemporary China. You can even say that this work is experimental, compared to its other well-known big budget and formal pieces. <br /> <br /> Filming with a hand-held camera and wide-angle lens throughout the movie, The fast paced editing and high energy performance and natural scene never let you go as soon as it gets you in the beginning no. It offers a very realistic version of modern Chinese urban sensitivity, set in Beijing in this case. If you appreciate and love this kind of black humor, you will love this movie completely. Also look for hilarious cameos by Zhao Benshan (Happy Times) and director Zhang Yimou himself. <br /> <br /> A final note of note: I find the characters in this movie, like in all the other Zhang Yimou films, Exposure of similar personality traits - stubbornness, always trying to get the chance and in the foreground . Let me know your thoughts on this. <br /> <br /> David Lee
