I'm sorry, but "Star Wars Episode 1" didn't do right on Natalie Portman's talent (and unmistakable gift). She was completely used to Queen Amidala, and when she was used, her makeup was terribly terrible. For "Anything But Here," she throws her god-fearing makeup and she usually acts. And she can't just do well, she looks good to do it. I'm a little older than she (she's only 18), and I have little or no chance to meet her, but hey, a man may dream, right? <br /> <br /> Although Susan Sarandon doesn't take a good turn in this movie, the movie belongs entirely to Portman. I was a Portman's watcher since "Beautiful Girls" (where she was younger, but just as cute). There are big things for her in the future - I can see it.
