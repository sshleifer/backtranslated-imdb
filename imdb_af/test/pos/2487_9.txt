Penalty Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins. The premise is that the nation's dissidents (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) are erected and tried by a tribunal and then got the choice of jail or executed the course of the Penalty Park. It is a 52 mile trek through the desert to an American flag, with the police, the National Guard and several other authority figures in the pursuit. The idea is that if you flag it, you're free. The tribunal consists of a lot of conservative types, which condemn all behaviors that are not like their own, and there is no result except a prison sentence or the option of 'Penal Park' for any of those being tried. There are many things in this that are still true today, which in itself is quite disturbing. The people who run the course are promised to get water at the halfway, which is not true, and the prosecuting officials are mostly a sadistic cluster who only comes up with a little target practice. It's not a very graphic movie, but it's more shocking in its ideas and themes than anything else. The scary thing is, this can happen. Not a very exciting movie, but definitely worth seeing. Warning: this can make you angry. 9 out of 10.
