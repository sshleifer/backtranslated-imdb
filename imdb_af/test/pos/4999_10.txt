The hottest, most engaging movie of his genre, Those Lips, Those Eyes, made me smile and cry as it reminds me of the work it takes to pursue a dream and pain of disappointment. Hulce and Langella are wonderful and the story itself seems to be writing. A brilliant screenplay by David Shaber (one of my favorites! - see The Warriors and Nighthawks for more ...) and beautiful sets filmed in the real summer theater where the story takes place. You can't see this movie and don't want to drop everything and get into the theater! Please check out this video if you can find it.
