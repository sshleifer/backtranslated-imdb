When I first saw the movie, I didn't believe my own eyes. In front of me there was a big and well done parody of Valentino ... see Stan Laurel bullfight this way is like an excellent fencer in action! It's a very good parody, rich in ideas, with a smart and charming Stan ... old and good like whiskey. (or the revival thereafter)
