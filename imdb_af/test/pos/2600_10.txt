The "Hunting Trilogy" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Haas! Duck! (1953) should be regarded as the comic high watermark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While rarely mentioned in lists of the "biggest" or "main" cartoons in the history of animation, they are definitely THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors such as Jones, Freleng or Avery had, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros cartoons, and especially these three, of the FUNNIEST ever made.
