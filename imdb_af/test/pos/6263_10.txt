A beautiful little movie about introducing movies to China. Capture the astonishment of the first audiences of the film, as it is described worldwide, and use the actual Lumiere movies for most of the actualities. I disagree with other people about the bad behavior of the British co-share. I thought he was good, but the Chinese chief really stole the show. Anyway, I found myself with most of the movie with a smile on my face. People who fear subtitles may notice that much of the movie is in English (which, for some reason, gives subtitles as well as the Chinese on DVD).
