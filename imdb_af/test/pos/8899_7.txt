Asterix and the Vikings are the first animated asterix movie in over 12 years since the 1994 "Asterix Conquer America". It also has the honor of being the first digitally colored asterix animation, which makes the largely entertaining story much more breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Each scene of this movie is portrayed alive in brightly cheerful colors that are closely linked to the color schemes of the comic books on which it is based. The character designs are also relatively close to the cartoon, for better or worse, to retain the simple but unique look of the characters. To be simple in terms of character design, it can be more time and effort spent on real-time animation, which at the same time overtakes many other large-screen movie films. Character movements are very fluid and have a quality that resembles that of a modest budget; There is always something moving in every scene and no evidence of the usual cost cutting animation shortcuts. 3D computing is seamlessly incorporated with the traditionally animated 2D art. The spectacular style makes the 3D elements more like traditional cartoon paintings than CGI models. <br /> <br /> The storyline takes many of its elements from the "Asterix and the Normans" comic, and that's where its biggest mistake lies. As an adaptation of the said cartoon, "Asterix and the Vikings" takes far too many freedoms with its source material. Long-term fans of the cartoon will undoubtedly find much to dislike the movie's story and the lack of source compliance. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, one can see this story as a very nice one taken on its own without comparing it to its source material. Highly comic, well-written jokes pepper the optimistic writing. The funniest parts were the many pop culture references and jibes in today's 21st century. Mobile communications, the shopping channel, commercial airlines and even sports cars are spared a lot. Excellent chemistry and action by the film (I watched it in English in the end) although a few voices like Cacofonix I found really annoying (but I think it's all part of his character). <br /> <br /> If there is anything to criticize about the story, this is the lack of "asterix". This story looks more like Justforkix's story of teenage romance and "age" with Asterix and Obelix only playing supporting roles. This gives a very great sense of steel, as many of the story's elements are the usual staples of such teenage movies. Distracted and split at times it only succeeds in hitting the spectacular comedy and traditional Astrix elements (the Romans, the pirates, etc.) to prevent this film from falling into ordinary mediocrity. <br /> <br /> While not the best installment in the Asterix animation movie library, it is definitely one of the funniest, best scripted and the most beautiful animated. DVD looks a little hard to come by though ????????
