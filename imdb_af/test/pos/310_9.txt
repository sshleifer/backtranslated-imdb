Following the success of the first two 'Godfather' films in 1972 and 1974 respectively, Francis Ford Coppola made an ambitious effort to realize the reality of the Vietnam War, which ended with the fall of Saigon to the Vietcong in 1975, to start. ? The plot was loosely based on the book 'Heart of Darkness', a story by Joseph Conrad about Kurtz, a commercial agent in the African jungle who acquired mysterious powers over the natives. Coppola retains much of this, including such details as the split heads outside Kurtz's headquarters and his last words, "The horror, the abomination?" <br /> <br /> In the film, Sheen plays an army captain who has the mission to penetrate and eliminate in Cambodia with an extreme bias, an ornate officer who has become an embarrassment to the authorities? On his journey to the river after the renegade's camp, he experiences the demoralization of American forces, high on dope or drunk with power? <br /> <br /> Although, due to tracks forced on Coppola, the film of innocence was accused when it was first released, it was the most serious attempt to curb Vietnam's experience and a victory of the war film genre ?? In 1980, the film won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography and Best Sound? <br /> <br /> In 2001, "Apocalypse Now" was released again with fifty minutes recovery? As a result, the movie can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it is ??
