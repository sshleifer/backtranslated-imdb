Monday, earlier this week, I had ever been affected by the lovely leaf in July, and I was a horror fan, wanted to see something scary. I thought of The Ammityville Horror 2, but I won something better. I was at my friend's house and he had the VHS Evil Ed. No cover or anything, he didn't even see the whole thing himself, but he told me it's about "a guy who gets crazy and kills many people." Well, this movie was very shocking, I have never seen the real brutal nature of sadistic violence to this movie. They bury Ted Bundy and Ed Gein both! It's also funny, referring to The Evil Dead Trilogy (and plus the Evil Dead 2 poster anywhere in the movie!) The movie is about an obsessive-compulsive, fun guy, a movie editor. He is then loaned to another department in the building and sent to the beautiful but violent world of Sam Campbell, the Splatter and Gore division. Eddy's new boss, Sam Campbell, tells Eddy about the big break in his movies, the gruesome Loose Limbs series, and he needs Eddy to make the movie a little less violent so they can be shown across Europe. Eddy hurriedly regretted the fact that the images and scenes displayed to him by the lonely suburban house were sent to his work, and then there was really nightmare. Imagine yourself in its place! The acting is great, the overbubbling is a bit funny (Sam Campbell's voice is often found funny, the same with other actors). However, the overbubbling work is pretty well done, I give this movie a 10/10 and this is a good introduction to the Gore subgenre for Horror. Very good, Nightmare, bloody ....... You just have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> Quote from movie: "Where is the Bever rape scene in the f ** k?!"
