The history of TV to movie adaptations is filled with aberrations, which almost certainly proves that tradition should never begin in the first place. However, there are a few examples that can only pull it out. Rising Damp will initially be the last sitcom suitable for the big screen treatment as this hilarious series is based on the smallest of northern bedding. Also, writer Eric Chappell is not paid enough to spend time making a completely original screenplay, and he has harvested a series of TV episodes and merged them to form the body of the film. That in itself does not necessarily mean that the script would fail. David Croft and Jimmy Perry did the same thing with their dad's army script and it worked out great. Although the episodes of the early Dad's army, with their solid pace and leftover plot, led them better to adapt to the adjustment. However, the rising moisture episodes were high energy issues from the first scene to the breathing climax. As a result, as one story ended and another started, the screens in the film became unfounded. Another fall for the movie version of a TV series is the inevitable comparisons made. In this regard, the film flickered compared to Rising Damp's brilliant series. Despite this, Rising Damp rises the Movie to be entertaining and sometimes uneasy. It may not be surprising that the best moments occur during sequences specially written for the film. This includes a rugby match where Rossiter makes a brand new conversation. Indeed, while all the role players deal perfectly with their role (a sub-standard substitute for late and really Beckinsale), it is Leonard Rossiter as Rigsby who shines the most. Indeed, Rising Damp had to be made as a movie, just as Rossiter is eligible for an Oscar, so is the wonder of his acting talent. Criminal, he wasn't even nominated. Eventually, the film fails to fit the giddy heights of the TV series, while keeping its own as a comedy in its own right with a few beautifully played moments. Recommended display. <br /> <br /> One last thing: The opening and ending music is by far the worst in film history.
