Looking at alternative realities, which are real-life considerations and just a fantasy, is a brand new thriller that will make you wonder and really make you think. Try to get a copy of it and see for yourself! I recently watched it at a L.A. movie festival and it was by far the best one in the group I saw. It helped that it was about something, unlike the others that were sifted. It is very well geared and the production value is moreover. I will compare it to Jacob's Ladder by guessing what the true reality of the world is in which we are involved. You should definitely try to hunt this movie and if it is at any festivals near you, try looking at it.
