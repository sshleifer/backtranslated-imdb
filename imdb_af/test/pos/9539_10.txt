It's a movie I love above all others. I try to repeat the most important film venues in Oakworth and Oxenhope whenever I can, helping to rebuild these magical features that look so unique to this movie. It is reminiscent of a softer and more manageable age, with its unspoken claims that people really do matter, that family life is not just another disposable one, and that life is really worth living (although sometimes we can doubt ). In short, a movie that will soon bring tears into my eyes may have helped with the deep-tuned music. Some melodies are young (like the Perks' tune, played on a trombone, sometimes with spoons), the moving melody when the family sets off for Yorkshire without knowing what lies ahead, and plays the ghostly little one on a solo clarinet. (or is it an oboe?) that precedes sudden changes in the child's feelings. <br /> <br /> It's so much a grown-up movie for kids, calling on the eternal child in all of us - a key that buries deep and apparently long lost values ​​and feelings within us , repeatedly revived, which is usually wiped out by the demands of modern everyday life. It is a film about basic human goodness and decency in which we are left to the viewers to do what we want, and there is welcome humor that is sometimes added at hand, such as the arrival of the aunt or more earthly level, the bedroom scene on Perks birthday - "Good Bert - as it is your birthday!" I need to know every scene, every line of this movie, and yet so wonderful is the magic that every time I look, it seems like I am opening a box of pleasure for the first time, enjoying every moment - sometimes humorous, sometimes. Well, very different. As Peter says in the movie, "It's perfect - more perfect than you know". And so it is !!!
