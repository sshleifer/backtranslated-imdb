Being a little bit of an expert on rubbish, I stumbled upon this little treasure. Action, romance, crooked police, violence. It's all here and not a single one is considered right. I was in love immediately. Then a strange thing happened the second time. I became addicted. I thought it was going to be a rental and a trip. <br /> <br /> Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie. He didn't have the money to make it look good, but he did it anyway. It is very laudable. It also shows that he made the film for herself. I don't know how many of you have heard Rudy Ray's music, but if you don't, he has a whole series of albums coming in the fifties.
