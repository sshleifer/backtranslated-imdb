People who thought THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK had sucked heavier than the black hole swallowed probably didn't see the movie that Vin Diesel's deadly killer started and probably didn't intend to do so. Too bad, because PITCH BLACK doesn't really kick big ass. <br /> <br /> Targeted by genre veterinarian David Twohy, (WARLOCK and the excellent but underlined BELOW) and written by brothers and sisters Jim and Ken Wheat (LIES, SILENT SCREAM), start PITCH BLACK with a 'ALIEN' esque prologue. When a freighter / passenger ship is severely damaged by a freak meteor shower (in which the captain is also murdered), co-pilot Carolyn Fry (SILENT HILL's Radha Mitchell) made an important decision: ditch the cargo or the passengers? Near the ears of the occupants, the accident landing unleashed her eventual action. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter, the catastrophic landing was made on an ancestral rock that once held a mine colony. Among the survivors are a few settlers, Shazza (COLORE'S Claudia Black) and Zeke (John Moore); an Imam (Keith David) and his young followers (can you say "boys and girls" red shirts); an antique dealer named Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); A young boy named Jack (Rhianna Griffith) and the most controversial group members: a Marshall named Johns (the extremely slender Cole Hauser) and his prisoner ... a dangerous killer named Riddick ( diesel). <br /> <br /> How the group dynamics shake up, makes very dramatic tension, especially with concerns about Riddick and how many people he can cut and gamble if he ever gets away. But no one comes alive here, as the saying goes, and the biggest twists have less to do with how they come together, than how they will survive when they discover the unthinkable. They are not alone in the planning practices. Things that are hungry, conversations, and quick things are being dragged around, just where they can't be seen, living in the dark where they can survive and thrive. They want the flesh of the new arrivals to satiate their appetites, but they can't get out in the grinding day to feed. <br /> <br /> Does the phrase "total eclipse" make things a little more interesting? For sure. Hence the more than appropriate title. <br /> <br /> Vin, more monosillabic than Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry on its hottest day, dripping more testosterone than sweat, has a field day here with a character that really looks like a successor or two, and Hauser, who threatens and threatens, is just as good as his father's wings were at the fencing villain. Surprisingly, though, Mitchell holds her own and runs strong and sympathetic as Fry. You wouldn't expect less than a strong show from Black, she was once Aeryn Sun, and his set didn't disappoint. (Bad is her role no greater, but that's all I will say about it.) And David makes his usual indelible impression as the holy man whose faith in hell will be tested by himself. <br /> <br /> The pace moves faster than Riddick, who slides behind his prey with a shovel in his teeth, and as soon as the darkness falls, the horror and tension are never solved, almost as in other classic scenes. fi / horror flicks. boots. But if imitation is really the sincere form of flattery, Dave Twohy and the Wheats deserve a huge decline to get this one right with a vengeance and to put an end to what is anti-Hollywood to the maximum. <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil the surprises, so I won't say much more, except if you saw CHRONICLES first and were not too happy, PITCH BLACK anyway gives a chance. And if you haven't seen it, definitely start with this one. <br /> <br /> I don't know what Vin has been up to now, but he can definitely be worse than calling these guys again. I would like to see what they would dream next ...
