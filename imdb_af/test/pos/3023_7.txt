A serial killer, Carl Stargher, is kidnapping and killing young women by drowning them in a water-filled cell. He is arrested by the FBI but is in a coma and his latest kidnapping victim is waiting in a cell to fill up with water. <br /> <br /> Look at the above premise and you'll see that a lot of people have seen everything before looking at it. The magic of Mark Protosevich's script is that he changes a higher old chestnut plot into something other than you expect. Calling the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter Stargher's mind and completely put another movie up. <br /> <br /> It won't be enough to make the cell a different class of thriller, but director Tarsem Singh creates a visually striking surreal thriller. The cinematography by Paul Laufer where impenetrable primary colors emerge is stunning, but Singh doesn't end there, things like costume design where Stargher wanders around his idiosyncratic universe with abundant costumes has a visual impact that makes it so much more than a run of a milling player <br /> <br /> What stops THE CELL becoming a classic movie, but starting to become more and more aware that the whole movie is turning the footage rather than a natural to have narration. We see a third character, an FBI man entering Stargher's domain, but it looks more like a confronted plot to just set off for more beautiful but very disturbing moments. It should also be pointed out that it is a rather disturbing thriller with an atmosphere that is very depressed and it stops the movie if it's not nice. One scene where an FBI agent tells a case where a pedophile just knocks a rap to later cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair that you can reach the bud. You will probably need to see a massive amount of vibrators until you see another one as disturbing as this one
