OK, so I admit it often looks like most of the Sylvester / Tweety cups have exactly the same plot. Sylvester tries to get Tweety, but repeatedly fails and is always mutilated, often using a bulldog. I think it's like Wile E. Coyote chasing Road Runner (in other words, mammals should never go to birds). "All a Bir-r-r-rd" has the same graph and puts it on a train. In a way, the best part of these cartoons sees what kind of schemes Sylvester comes up with to try Tweety. We know he will fail miserably, but it is also funny to turn Tweety into a bad ass (if you have seen his very early characters, you will see that he is not "cute" at all, but actually has had a cruel line). This one works mainly as a way to pass time. <br /> <br /> By the way, I thought I saw - I mean naughty, I hit - Sylvester passed a piece of luggage called Friz Freleng on it.
