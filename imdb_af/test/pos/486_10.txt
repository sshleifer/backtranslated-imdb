I just watched it for the second time today and I have to say with my whole heart that it's about damn time that they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings. Such a waste of human life as this story might have been a little, will come from that. And Eric is warmer than ever. Too often in the movies, First Nations people are considered to be other than everyday people. We are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people. Hey, we're just like everyone. And this movie just showed it. We hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in the search for justice. It's really bad that the big movie companies can't see it. I can't wait until it comes to DVD. Thanks to those who chose to show this story as it really was.
