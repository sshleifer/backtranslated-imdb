Looking at this movie, I was amazed at how media perception could form a person's opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree but very unreliable young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard set up the cards with great songs. As with all the celebrities of today, they are often criticized for their music, as well as their appearance, styles, and so on. It had a great effect on Karen who made a fight against her eating habits and lost weight, eventually causing her death. This heart felt movie wasn't initially something I thought to look at. But when I started to see it, I was addicted. In the same way as the Tina Turner story, this film relieves you and allows you to see the life of the young artists. The acting was excellent and even after almost 20 years after it was made, the direction and dialogue were still entertaining. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't looked at it yet. It is incredibly accurate and emotionally loaded.
