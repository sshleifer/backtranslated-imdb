This movie would have made the typical Hollywood tear fighters shameful. The emotions portrayed are moderate and underestimated in a very comfortable way. The plot is clickable, with a leading role in a terminal illness (it is not a spoiler and is established early in the movie.) The performance method is somehow unique from most love stories you've ever seen - Not even a kiss was exchanged and yet you will feel the enormous flow of love between the two leaders. Initially, I accepted this "limitation on emotions" to be something similar to the typical "eastern values", but later decided on them. <br /> <br /> This movie has been underestimated so that if you compare it to movies like "Cinema Paradiso", CP would have been manipulative in an open way. So it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I have this strong feeling that Hollywood loves movies (or love movies everywhere to be accurate) is glorious romance or passion and names it as "love". I'm sure we all have our own definitions and I won't say these features are mutually exclusive. But I would dare say that the movie will make you wonder if there is an extra dimension you have with your loved one. <br /> <br /> It's very clear that I really enjoy this movie. Given the fact that the movie is so clear in appearance, it is paradoxically one of the more "movies" I've seen lately.
