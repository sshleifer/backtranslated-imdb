It's a movie that has a different look - if you haven't seen it for a while or a first look - if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on a play of the same name, it is the story of an older actor who manages a Shakespeare repertoire company in England during World War II. It deals with his stress of running a Shakespeare every night while experiencing problems, such as the theaters, and a company of older or physically disabled actors - the young, incompetent people are being taken to military service. It also deals with his relationship with various members of his company, especially with his dressing room. So far it sounds rather boring, but nothing can come out of the truth. While tragic in general, the story is told with lots of humor and emotions running high. The two male leaders both received Oscar nominations for best actor and deserve it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a human drama, theater - especially Shakespeare, or who has ever worked in any capacity. The backstage performance is another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers.
