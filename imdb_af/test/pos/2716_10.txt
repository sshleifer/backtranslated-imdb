I resisted to see 15 Park Avenue, despite recommendations that reject the film as a rocky subject of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top scenes. <br /> <br /> Once in a while, movies like Park Avenue 15 are coming and wiping your feet. <br /> <br /> The movie understands your attention fairly early and there is no moment to rest on it. Aparna Sen did a wonderful job of sticking the audience to each line of the movie. The impeccable character development, "just right" amount of emotions and a mysterious end to all this ... <br /> <br /> I have a new respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi. She is again expecting page 3 and Mr. A wife. Iyer. Prof. Anjali's role is very well developed and Shabana is fully entitled to the character. Rahul Bose, Shefali Chaya, Waheeda Rehman adds incredible flavor to the movie. <br /> <br /> I define "tipping moments" as thoughts of scenes of a movie you consider endlessly in your shower, to your wife / girlfriend / mothers at the door. 15PA delivers many "torches", especially the conversation between Anjali and her mother where the mother is careful when talking to Anjali about her thoughts. It immediately brings Anjali's personality to the audience. <br /> <br /> The end is a very bold statement by the director; probably too popular for the Indian audience; but deliver the elements to promote the movie of "good" to "big" status.
