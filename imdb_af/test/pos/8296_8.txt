The family happiness is crumbling when the rich father Ward (Michael Ontkean) gets poor from the start and can no longer support the family. Then the mother Faye (Jaclyn Smith) should take the role of breadwinner in the family and start working to support the family while managing family life at the same time. Not always as good, but as good as she can. Family life hardly gets easier when the father learns that Lionel (Joe Flanigan's "Stargate Atlantis") is gay and also lives with his lover John (Joel Gretsch "The 4400"). Dad makes Lionel clear that he is no longer in the family. Lionel is the one who meant most to her sister Anne (Leslie Horan) during her performance, as the family neglected her. Anne can't be the fact that their father cut the ropes with Lionel and therefore she runs away from home. As it was not enough, Greg (Brian Krause "Charmed") was in the marines and sent to war. The storyline in this movie can sometimes feel slightly thin, though it still has a lot of realism in it, which makes it worth seeing. As this film illustrates very sensitive relationships and situations, I would believe that it is best appreciated by an adult audience, although it will not be hurt for teenagers to see it and to think ahead of their adulthood.
