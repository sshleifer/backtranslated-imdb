Reading the comments I made through the obvious effects of this wonderful movie has on viewers. But how can you see this movie and not reflect that the fun dialogue was a subtle and so daring reprimand to the authorities "in control" in what was then the USSR at that moment in history? It was not just the souls in the time and place of the action that was revealed. The superficially asked questions are challenging when addressed here and now. Who are the right "co-workers"? I am surprised that the writer has stayed out of jail. I read somewhere that great stress can be a catalyst for producing great art. This film is a masterpiece of misdirection, apparently somehow pointing, while the audience is asked to "look over my shoulder, what I'm really talking about." What courage.
