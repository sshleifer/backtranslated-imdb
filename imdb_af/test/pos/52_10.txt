This is a must-see movie. You will laugh, you will cry, and when it is over, you will wish there is more. Well written and compelling, this movie enters and holds you. The casting was perfect, the characters purposeful, and the outstanding achievements. "Nanny" is the standard to which all women must adhere: strong, forgiving, protective and never judgmental. "Nanny," to me, is the hallmark of what a Christian mother and wife should be: a true pillar of society. If I was half the wife, "Nanny", I might consider doing well. I would have been ruined if "Nanny" died at some point in the movie, but because she didn't do that, I would definitely buy it if it came to DVD. I can only hope the story goes on and that Ruben goes back to Lackawanna to rebuild the town, piece by piece and person per person.
