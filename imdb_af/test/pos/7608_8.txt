Of course, many experienced reviewers who like things like Star Wars and professional crap will definitely drag this movie and say very bad comments about it. Josie Gellar (played well by Drew Barrymore) is part of a news report team and she is offered a "real". ') work - she must go back to school and find out which teens are like these days. Well, it goes well, until Josie remembers her terrible time at High School and gets upset. But she was never hip, was never cool, never popular! <br /> <br /> Sit back, relax and enjoy with Never Kissed! <br /> <br />
