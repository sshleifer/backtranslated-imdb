The essay of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any film in recent years. The characters are interesting, even if it is a bit predictable. The comic timing written in the screenplay is more than enough to make for a well-behaved suspect. If you are sure, you know the end .... WAR! Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set would probably not appreciate the more subtle references, they will surely appreciate a galley scene! Great movie!
