Don't let any reviews (critics, IMDb users or mines) affect you to see this movie. I only read the plot provision and are intrigued. After watching, this film, in my opinion, is definitely worth seeing. It gives a perspective on life that many people probably didn't want. However, it is not, as Leland himself says, a movie that "can be wrapped in a neat package with a bow and everything." Other user reviews on this site claim that they have a psychological background and imply that the story is not feasible. Of course they missed the whole point of the movie, which is disappointing. to say the least. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a well-regarded, well-directed movie. The story is not a good feeling, but I feel if you don't get away from the movie that feels good, you may have just missed something. To characterize it as an 'art house', I think is unfair, but if our society keeps labels, it's probably the one that fits. If you find out that you know everything around the world, I suggest it. If you feel movies should be an escape form of the world ... you won't find it here. But if you see it, you can just find something in yourself.
