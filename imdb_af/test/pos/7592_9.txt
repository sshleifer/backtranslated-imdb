Although little more than a pleasant 11 minute musical distraction (this is considered a "Tabloid Musical") every Sunday is one of the best-known and precious documents in film history, as it is a valuable look at the emerging talents of two. from The screen's most talented and beloved musical artists: Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland. <br /> <br /> Although it is often referred to as a screen test of types, manufactured by MGM to test the adolescent appeal of studio contractors Durbin and Garland, whose options were allegedly coming for renewal, this claim is not quite correct. By the time every Sunday was produced in July 1936, Deanna Durbin's contract with MGM had already expired and she was signed by Universal immediately a month earlier in June 1936. <br /> <br /> A provision in Durbin's MGM contract allowed the studio to exercise an option on her services for up to sixty days, as she had not yet started working on a photo at her new studio. . As Durbin's debut vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, was not ready to film yet, MGM chose to exercise its option. Although officially was under contract to Universal at the time, Durbin got back on the MGM movie that filmed this pleasant short topic with fellow adolescent singing hopeful, Judy Garland. <br /> <br /> That, along with Garland's much more extensive, upfront professional performance / training (which includes appearances in several early film pants), can explain why every Sunday often seems to favor Judy Garland over Deanna Durbin, what Garland gives more lines to talk and an original song ("Americana") to sing while Durbin presents the popular classic art song, "Il Bacio" by Luigi Ardiiti. Certainly, it would be perfect for MGM to want to benefit from one of its own contract players over another of a competitive studio. <br /> <br /> Ironically, although Garland's character is the more openly proactive one of the two girls in this brief, it would be Durbin's physical and impulsive "Little Miss Fixit" screen persona at Universal that would drive her to instant worldwide superstars as the world's first "Teen Idol" with her debut vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, while Garland's more passive "wistful wallflower" adolescent image would see her common supporting roles in the opposite regular screenplay Mickey Rooney and (in ZIEGFELD GIRL) the upcoming Lana Turner put in the role. Not until her fifteenth MGM function, 1942 'FOR ME AND MY GAL (which was also her first full "adult" role) Garland would call the solo above - the title bill and "solo attraction" status of a true superstar who Durbin scored six years earlier. It is therefore totally inaccurate to argue that Garland was the only "superstar" attraction of the two girls, as Durbin reached this status with press public, almost a decade before its MGM rival. Literally in exclusion at the time of her signing, the evidence of the screen strongly suggests that Universal was much quicker to realize Deanna's full superstar potential than MGM was at Judy. It is noteworthy that almost every noteworthy achievement that Garland achieved at MGM, of superstar billing, with starring roles specially written to portray her talents and appeal, to be invited to her bases in the courtyard of Graumann's Chinese Theater to plant, to receive an "Honorary Oscar" in recognition of her talent, Deanna Durbin received well before her talents. MGM Contemporary. Anyway, every Sunday is a beautiful, totally unpretentious musical short. The plot line (Durbin and Garland use their singing talent to save Durbin's grandfather from the violent retirement by the city council performs his Sunday concerts in the park), performs the plot lines of both Garland's "Let's Put On a Show" music with Mickey Rooney and Durbin's 100 MEN'S THE GIRL. Unlike Garland's later BABES films, the short never seriously deals with the insignificant storyline, and therefore runs eleven minutes of running. <br /> <br /> Of course, every Sunday's true magic is watching the already remarkable performance of Durbin and Garland's talent / screen conditions at the start of their legendary careers. Both girls, even in this early stage, had remarkable screen conditions and are completely natural and untouched in their presentation as both singers and actresses. Garland deploys reasonably from the screen with vitality if she literally sticks out the lyrics to the "Americana". As she looks with the necessary hand gestures over the number socks, Judy literally seems to chew on the words of the song as she screws her mouth out and puts her eyes in her intense zeal to show what she can do. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Durbin's offering of "Il Bacio" is much more modest and muted. Although quite appropriate for her "classic" selection, Durbin's delivery of Arditi's waltz is much more of the traditional "stand a sing" variety than Garland's physically-emotional turn. Nonetheless, although "miniature diva", Deanna does nothing to pay attention to herself, with her candid eyes, brilliant smile and artificial delivery, she keeps the screen with the "jazz baby" Judy, and their beautiful demonstration of "Americana" in the short final, it is a pity that more producer Joe Pasternak could never realize his dream of mixing Durbin and Garland in a musical feature film (because Universal refused to lend "Number One Asset" Durbin). <br /> <br /> A valuable document of the emerging talents of two remarkable and completely unique talents. See this one if you get a chance!
