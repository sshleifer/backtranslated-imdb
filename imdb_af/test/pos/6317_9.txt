I saw Le Conseguenze Dell'Amore at the 2005 film festival of Rotterdam. It was the first of ten movies I saw there. <br /> <br /> Le Conseguenze left the strongest impression of the ten films. From the first shot you know the movie is going to be something special. The beautiful cinematography frightened me of what can be done with a camera. The music is also the same as the footage, which complements the colorful and stylish architecture-like images. <br /> <br /> Toni Servillo plays the main character in the movie, Titta. He is a tax expert who went wrong and stayed in a hotel. Every week he brings a suitcase of money to a bank and the story is about it. <br /> <br /> He is always very controlled and shows almost no emotion to anyone; Look calculated and well dressed. He has a habit of ignoring people who have no meaning to him. For example Sofia (played very well by Olivia Magnani), who works as a barmaid in the hotel where he lives. Although she worked in the hotel for two years, he never greeted her, even if she greeted him. One day she confronted him and the next day he sat at the bar instead of his usual place at a window. From there, the story really starts and will unfold in a strong story of love, sacrifice and the mafia. <br /> <br /> I won't spoil the rest of the movie. See this movie if you like stylish movies like those of David Lynch, The Godfather, etc. Don't see it if you're an action buff.
