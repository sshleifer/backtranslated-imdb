I read and watched both Gone With The Wind, it was very difficult not to compare this film with the original. Although I thought Scarlett, the novel, was wonderful, the movie didn't add up. It was a completely different story. Of course there will never be another Scarlett and Rhett, except Leigh and Gable, but the new actors did a good job. I loved how the book and the movie wrapped up the story of Gon With the Wind, because after reading it, I had a revival of disappointment because it just stopped and left the readers wondering what happened . Scarlett completed the story very well, and Alexandra Ripley did well on the book. I just wish the movie followed the story more, though it was in itself excellent.
