Hollywood movies since the 1930s treated gays as lepers. In the condemnation of homosexuality, the film industry only reflected what the oppressive society of its day considered ideology. For example, in the 1962 Otto Preminger melodrama "Advise and Consent," straightforward actor Don Murray was cast as a strange congressman who commits suicide rather than confessing his alternative lifestyle. Gay movie characters have covered a lot of land since "Advise and Consent." In the 1997 movie "In & Out" (** 1/2 from ****), heterosexual actor Kevin Kline is thrown out as a homosexual teacher coming out of the cupboard on his wedding day. While the Conservative Hollywood said on Thursday that the Congress Quarter should commit suicide, the liberal Hollywood dictates today that the gay English teacher should be embraced rather than Maced. <br /> <br /> Basically, "In & Out" preaches good citizenship in the pit of a politically correct comedy. Director Frank Oz and author Scott Rudnick endorse honesty as the best policy because honesty always ensures happiness. High school teacher Howard Brackett ("The Big Chill" Kevin Kline) will only be happy after he comes out of the cupboard, just as his one-time but now-thin fiancee Emily (Joan Cusack) will only feel happy when she can break her diet. Eventually, the film claims that straightforward society will accept gays when homosexuals with more honesty and sincerity can act upon themselves. The lucky issue of gay tabloid reporter played by legal actor Tom Selleck effectively dramatizes this remarkable comment. <br /> <br /> Rudnick's lightweight script beautifies the real life event that occurred at the Oscars when Tom Hanks paid tribute to a high school teacher. In 'In & Out', Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), a blonde Brad Pitt-style bimbo-type actor, wins the Oscar for the appearance of a fruity foot soldier. Drake honors his mentor Howard Brackett during his acceptance speech. Not claiming to stop there, the candid Cameron reveals to a live television audience that Howard is gay! Suspects, paranoia and horror are instigated as the media descends on the sleepy town of Green Leaf, Indiana. (When would a named English teacher spark such a massive media concern?) Among those reporters, Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck from "High Road to China") and he wants to do a week-long exclusive one at Howard. However, Howard doesn't want to do anything with the hooker hunting media, especially the difficult Peter Malloy. Howard denies Drake's gay charges to everyone, including his fiancee and his mother. Malloy leaned because he smoked a kick. The revelation turned Green leaf upside down. High school principal Tom Halliwell (Bob Newhart) struggles nervously with all the media coverage. Halliwell warns Howard that his marriage was not afterwards, he will have to give him a pink slip. Meanwhile, Peter advises Howard that his marriage to Emily will fall at the last minute, and he will be there to record the outcome on the camera. <br /> <br /> Howard transfers to sound bands over macho men. He struggles to reform himself. But Howard's efforts are useless. Debt swells in him. And then there is Peter Malloy, who drives him to clean up his homosexuality. Eventually, at the altar in the eyes of God, Howard broke out. Of course, the groom Emily Montgomery was flown by Howard's gay confession. Predictably, the school eats Howard, but he shows graduation. Drake also points out, and hurries to Brackett's defense. Not only did the school rob Howard of his work, but they also gave his teacher's award of the year to someone else. Drake appeals to the principal and wins Howard's unanimous support from the community. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in Rudnick's configured script is Howard himself. Rudnick made a character to be true, whether gray or straight. Howard Brackett weighs more than a saint as a sinner. He helps one student get into college, and he leads the teams. How often do you hear from an English teacher who also doubles as a coach? Everyone at his high school adores Howard. He does not have an average bone in his body. Furthermore, Rudnick and Oz ask us to believe that no one else in Green Leaf is gay. Where's Howard's gay friends? Are they too scared to come to his defense? No, "In & Out" is not strictly aimed at homosexual audiences. Oz, whose screen credits include cute comedies like "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" and "House Sitter" as well as Rudnick teeter on a politically correct tighthead. "In & Out" is not a gay recruitment movie. The filmmakers are not interested in what Howard or Peter Malloy asked to prefer the gay lifestyle. Instead, Oz and Rudnick are only interested in a thin point: Is he or is he not gay? They flatter it to involve the community's response to the answer. Finally, when Howard admits he is gay, the filmmakers use the rest of the movies to show how a conservative, Norman Rockwell-like town can accept him despite its difference. <br /> <br /> The most shocking scenes in "In & Out" are probably when tabloid reporter Malloy makes a lip lock on Howard. Straight guys kissing each other in a movie about a gay identity crisis are as scary as they are false. Kline and Selleck grind their faces together that look like more of a head-on collision than a closed mouth. Nothing like the controversial 1994 British film "Priest" comes in and out as an impressive but laborious piece of social propaganda with its communicative message. If "Ellen" was not the TV equivalent, "In & Out" would probably go to TV as a new sitcom. Looking in and out is not so much about the issue of gay or straight, but how to be a decent person in the last days of the 20th century. What makes 'In & Out' an acceptable comedy about sexual intolerance is that she commends equal opportunities and pity on queens and shorts.
