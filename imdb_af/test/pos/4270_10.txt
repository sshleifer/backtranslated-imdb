As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good movies, like good literature, let you think, reflect and predict. This movie made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses shadow, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also like the fact that, despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not look like adolescent or rogue like other movies I've seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other. Excellent soundtrack, with songs you don't hear on the radio. This is a reconciliation with life / spontaneous road trip film that earns more than just a second glance.
