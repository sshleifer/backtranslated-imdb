I must admit that I absolutely loved this movie. Of course, I know you know that "Malcolm's in the Middle" star Frankie Muniz, and the ever so nice Amanda Bynes "The Amanda Show" played in these children's comedy as two friends, I'm sure we can all - late too. The movie is about a boy Jason Shepard (Frankie) and his friend Kaylee (Amanda) goes for an adventure in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> As it starts, Jason is a typical 14-year-old boy who wants life's problems every day. One day, Jason is being arrested by Mr. Wolf (the big bad director) hit. Jason's English paper is stolen by Wolf and begins the adventure with kaylee to earn his father's trust. They fly to Hollywood in search of Wolf to get him back. Frankie and Amanda do all kinds of crazy stunts to get Wolf back, and all he has to do is Jason's father and tell him he has stolen his idea. But the end is not a real surprise, as it is the good proveles and wins. <br /> <br /> The story is cute and fifth grade humor, but what do you expect it to be rated PG. I really believe this is one of the best family comedies. Not only is the children's great, extraordinary casting well written, but it's good fun. It made me laugh and fell in love with the innocent message. I highly recommend it and don't even want it with someone who gave it zero out of ten. The unemployed critic is not unemployed. I give it (well I voted ten out of ten) a perfect one.
