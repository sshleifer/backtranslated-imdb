I hope, from his seat on the comedy throne of Heaven, that Spike Milligan can see and enjoy this movie, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said to write it, "I almost got angry "to look at. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of the Irish village of Puckoon and its problems are when the separation between Northern Ireland and the Republic is set up, through the center of town and more worried, through from the graveyard. This causes some deceased, buried in the Catholic cemetery, to be in the Protestant north. The local priest, assisted by a wide variety of eccentric residents, attempts to move the bodies under the darkness again, thereby bureaucratic British border guards. <br /> <br /> It was inspired to play Irish comedian and poet Sean Hughes to play Madigan. He shares the innocence, especially in his to-camera pieces (usually where he interacts with Richard Attenborough's voice review, which is believed to be the author / director of the film). Daragh O'Malley plays father Rudden, is also very laudable; and the rest of the cast, of household names such as Elliott Gould and Griff Rhys Jones to people who are usually called "little parts" - like Spike's daughter. Jane playing Madigan's wife gives 100%. The credit for that is not a small part of the wonderful characterization that Spike gave in the original book. <br /> <br /> I can argue that the movie is a little too long, or that Elliott Gould's Irish accent left a little to be desired, but they would be just small points and nothing to take away from the excellence of this movie no.
