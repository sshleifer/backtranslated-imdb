It's along the line of comedy of mistakes, wrong love that is transmitted one after the other, blossoms and goes over? Kinda cat and mouse situations ?? Torches of passion, sparking, caught and postponed, maybe she loves, he loves or they love? Circle of emotions, evolution, release, hiding, but not hiding, want to let him know, want to let her know, let them know? Good ensemble throws in despite the seemingly confusing mix of emotions from different parties involved. <br /> <br /> It's a refreshing charm, accidental, free and easy on earth - not Hollywood glamorous like Notting Hill, but many human feelings, weakness, vulnerability a-flowing. Yes, everything revolves around an accidentally (lost and found) love letter. Kate Capshaw, owner of the town's bookshop, featuring a variety of characters portrayed by Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Tom Everett Scott, Gloria Stuart, Alice Drummond and Geraldine McEwan as the apparently unaffected Mrs. Scattergoods. Romance is in the air, love is everywhere. You appreciate the talented Kate Capshaw. ("The Alarmist" is another exciting little movie to watch: Capshaw has a wonderful chemistry with David Arquette, and Arquette with Stanley Tucci). <br /> <br /> "Notting Hill" is satisfying in his story about Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant's glittering pair, and the wonderful support of his circle of (London) friends. "Love Letters" is beautiful in its particular (Loblolly) small town, and its story includes Kate Capshaw's exiled wrinkle effects on her friends and neighbors. Both maybe fantasies, somehow, made the latter more feasible if it happened to you. And if you appreciate words or poetic lines, it can be the movie.
