I found this movie on Netflix and had to add it to my queue. I was not disappointed when I got it, as it was just as funny as when I saw it at a local drive-in theater. <br /> <br /> It culminates in, with a smile from the various characters as they begin their journey across America on the "Honky Tonk Freeway, America on wheels." It was a strange comic role for William DeVane as I remembered him as Kennedy in the 1974 TV movie "The Missiles of October" and felt that no one could derive the dramatic character as well as possible. <br /> <br /> It reminds me a bit of Dick Van Dyke in "Cold Turkey" where Van Dyke played the local minister. DeVane's role as mayor, minister and activist was typical of small towns, and it makes his character amusing and real. <Br /> <br /> Howard Hessman and Teri Garr as the spoiled family in the campfire were also on target for the time. Anyone traveling countrywide with small children (Are we still there?) Will appreciate those scenes. /> <br /> The scenes of a small town struggling to survive reminded me of the small town I grew up with, but they deal with the charm and humor you often see in small towns. has. It is sad that many small towns disappear because of the highway system and this gives a realistic and humorous view of what they had to do to survive. (Using zoo animals anyone?) All in all, it's a lightweight comedy with no specific message, but a humorous look at America in the early 80's. Worth looking at if you just need a little good courage.
