To speak relatively, if you only saw Hector Babenco's "Pixote" (1981, Brazil, "pi-shot" pronounced), after seeing a number of films dealing with street children, juvenile criminals, children in the trouble (Truffaut's "The 400 Blows", Bunuel's "Los Olvidados", De Sica's "Shoeshine", Nair's "Salaam, Bombay!", Bresson's "Mouchette", Nugroho's "Leaf on a Pillow" etc.), Can One Fear That The Fate of the Child Shown in the Movie Can No Longer Affect One, as it is already "de-synthesized" after going through the emotional rollercoaster ride through the previously quoted films. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this won't be the case. For Babenco, his film tells in such a realistic way (as a movie reviewer tells it in a positive light) and that his central children's film, Fernando Ramos da Silva (13 years old and then a street child himself) gives such peaceful, wounded performance, mourning in its simplicity (that hardened face, those lonely and longing eyes) that one is hard to be pierced in any way. (Such a feeling can reach such an increased realism if one learns that the child has only lived but had a short life after being involved in street crime and then murdered.) <Br / > <br /> In about the first half of the film, Pixote and his fellow street children and criminals spend their time in a repressive, state-formulated reformation school, where cruelty and humiliation, rape and murder are the norm and culture where they forced to confess to their "crimes", in spite of the fact that under Brazilian law, minor criminals are not "punishable" for their offenses. For these children, the dubious freedom offered by the streets is more preferable than the hard rehabilitation provided by these supposedly well-meaning authorities. Within the walls of this supposedly protective settlement, these young souls will soon discover that love and care of parent figures cannot be found anywhere, if not to some extent. <br /> <br /> (For Pixote, the only form of escape comes from puffing grass and cut glue, secretly smuggled into the Reformation.) <br /> <br /> a small-scale "revolt" bursts to finally express and then fulfills their collective desire to come back to the outside world - their "home" - the intensity and form is such that one cannot avoid thinking to the school's uprising in Jean Vigo's influential "Zero for Conduct". It's just in Pixote, the uprising is on a gutter surface. <br /> <br /> If Pixote and his small group are back on the street (the second half of the movie), they involve robbery, pimping and drug trafficking to care for themselves, after which they become Sueli, an abused but friendly prostitute , meet. Sueli wants to accept the four lost souls willingly to rob her clients and to provide more than maternal care (at least to one of the children). <br /> <br /> One would have thought that street children eventually found one person who could give them the love and warmth they lacked in their lives. But as dubious as the freedom these children believe in the streets, this newly found "mother figure" can not only last forever. <br /> <br /> Jealousy, crooks, differences and murders just put the kids apart - and for good. And during the definition of the scene where Pixote, who is caused by the circumstances, shoots not only Sueli's arrogant American client but also his fellow-street couple, Ditto (more than a son of Sueli), he literally goes back to "infancy", as he sucks from the right breast of the disoriented woman, and from there, and then his shaky desire for parental love, the image itself sad and disturbing. <br /> <br /> Sueli, probably coming back to her "senses," sadly pushes Pixote back from his "nourishing" position and rejects him for good. So, in a silent moment, Pixote, with the young old face and the turbulent eyes (not quite different, but in a different context, becomes the young boy's mean in Elem Klimov's worse "Come and See") , put his jacket on and take his gun (yes, a gun!), and go to nowhere, walk along the train tracks and start the morning light just to show up. With that scene, Babenco can only make a tribute (among many other homages in different movies!) To the iconoclastic final scene in Truffaut's "The 400 Blows". <br /> <br /> But while we know what happened to Antoine Doinel three years later in the short film "Antoine et Colette" (as well as in three other feature films in the following years), and we were hiding in the dark over ahead of Pixote after he finally disappears from the last frame, this is the last time we'll see this real street child (despite the fate that has finally hit him). <br /> <br /> "Pixote" shouldn't be nearly as whimsical as "The 400 Blows" or as hallucinatory as "Los Olvidados", but it still stands out from films of similar theme and texture as because of its simple, raw power.
