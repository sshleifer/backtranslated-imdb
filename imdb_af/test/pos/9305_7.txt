If you know something about the Manhattan project, you will find "Fat Man and Little Boy" at least an interesting portrayal of the events surrounding the story. The film is in all ways a very realistic depiction of these events, and in many ways it is almost too real (like some radiation poisoning scenes). Paul Newman, as usual, is brilliant in his role and always manages like a real person on the screen. The supporting role, such as John Cusack, Laura Dern, Bonnie Bedelia and Natasha Richardson, is also pretty good. However, this film is not one of the best examples to make a real story in a movie. Big movies can take a real story and just use enough artistic license to engage his audience for the whole movie. However, this one tends to drag a bit through, and some scenes (such as John Cusack and Natasha Richardson's love story) could be completely eliminated without much loss to the film. Still, there are plenty of interesting facts and little humorous bits to at least interest the audience to watch the whole movie. It does not always entertain, but it is very accurate, fascinating and will consider the audience with something. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
