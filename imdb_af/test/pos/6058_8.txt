THE D.I. (4 out of 5 stars) Wow, I definitely didn't expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did. I have never heard of it until one day I saw it in the discount video bin. I thought Jack Webb was playing an army drill instructor might be good for a chuckle, but thought the drama would turn out to be compared to such a recent movie DIs as depicted in "Full Metal Jacket" or "An Officer and an gentleman ". Boy, was I wrong. This is probably the best work Webb has ever done ... far away better than its one-note "Dragnet" performances. Delivering his difficult old dialogue is just brilliant ... in his patented deadpan monotone and yet you know the man means every word of it. The story may look a little hokey compared to the more violent military movies that followed, but I still found the movie fascinating and compelling. Even a completely unnecessary musical intervention in an army club hacked me. Anyone know where to get a copy of the amazing Ray Coniff song, "If'n You Do, Somebody Else Will"? Webb plays the toughest drill-drill instructor ever ... and he is under pressure to kick the dead man Private Owen, but through wave he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and he is going to get out and scream! Good stuff!
