THE ENGLISH PATIENT not only has everything (doomed romance, tragic war, great characters), but it does have a way that no other movie does. It's a spell binding story told by flashbacks with incredible performances by all involved, spectacular visuals, characters we care about, and the most raped love story ever told. A film landmark, the best movie of 1996 and one of the best of the 1990s.
