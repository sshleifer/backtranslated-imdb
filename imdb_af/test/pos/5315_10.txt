I appreciated this movie, because I'm sure. There are subtleties I missed. Wonderfully thrown, no overworking or Clich√© show or plot. Use a tragic event to reflect multiple relationships, how the people in each relationship are linked (or disconnected) and perceptions of life, which position each holds in the relationship, in life, and how they hurt the confusion, joy, and deal with disappointment to discover that things are not what they have observed to be. Initially I thought there were "observers" and "the perceived", but this is not the case, we are all connected in some way and our perceived separation is only in small grades. I recommend the movie to everyone especially in education, social work, religious counseling and every other person who breathes.
