This is the best movie I ever saw. All the artists are old Turkish theater actors, they are wonderful in this movie. It is sometimes said that they do not act, they live it, you can really see it in this movie. The director is also competent, you can't see many moving cameras, but the positions of the cameras are also good. But after the play, the most outstanding part is the content of the movie. It brings happiness, enthusiasm, desire to live, the importance of real friends to people. We have all lived individually today. In this movie you see that there is someone other than us. And above all, you see that the most honorable feeling in the world is love, love your friends, love your darling. All people should see this movie ...
