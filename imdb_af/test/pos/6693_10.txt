Life consists of infinite possibilities; some known, others are mysterious and destined to remain so. And what about the great unknown, the rich that knowledge has no established boundaries or parameters? Who is to say what exists or is possible? Valid questions that are all picked up in the story of a particular individual's personal journey, a strange and dramatic odyssey that rests facts and logic in 'K-PAX', led by Iain Softley, starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. . In the aftermath of an incident in New York's central station, a man named Prot (Spacey) is transported to a psychiatric hospital in Manhattan, where he takes care of Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges) is being delivered, which attempts to uncover the truth about his patient, claiming he is from the distant planet K-PAX. It quickly becomes a challenge for dr. Powell, as Prot, with his calm, direct, emerging way and a propensity to produce (he eats banana shields and everything, and Red Apple Apples are his favorites) is pretty convincing. But this is Powell's work, as well as his nature, to be skeptical. However, Prot's claims remain intact and even under the most intense investigation and watchful eye of Dr. Powell, who finds himself in something of a crisis. Prot even tells him the exact date and time he will be leaving for K-PAX, a scheduled return trip that Powell allows, but a short time to sort it all out. And Powell can't just think he's a real alien creature. And this is something he must solve quickly if he ever gets to know the truth. And he must know. The truth is, after all, the only thing that will release itself in its own mind. <br /> <br /> Softley made a sensitive, thought-provoking film that challenges the viewer by maintaining the mystery. Surrounding Prot while being forced to think about your own concepts of what is actually possible. And as you never know for sure about Prot unblocking, you can identify with Powell, as the situation looks from its point of view and tries to solve the riddle right with him. Softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real feeling to be confronted with something truly unique, as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that Prot can only be what he says he is. And in the context of the reality about which the film is available, it is an exciting matter to turn your mind around. How do you respond when all the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations we set ourselves? While in the heart of the film, there is a resounding depth of mankind that is evident not only in Prot but also in Dr. Powell. All that cares for an extremely impressive and gripping drama. <br /> <br /> As we expected, Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant performance as Prot, giving his character inside, emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time. It's a unique individual, and Spacey brings him with care and the ability to share those moments that are especially revealing, adding the credibility of the character and credibility of the story itself. For this movie to work, it is essential that we believe who and what is Prot; We do, and do it. Spacey just pulls it out. It's an unforgettable performance, which develops a character that will stay with you for a long, long time. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Jeff Bridges joins Spacey equally, and makes a very real person of dr. Powell. This is a fairly simple role, and the challenge for Bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make it unique in its own right, which was not a small task to Prot's character. And again, for this movie to work, it was necessary that Bridges come to the event. And with exceptional skill and the perfect professional he is, he surely succeeds in it. Bridges infuse Powell with an underlying complexity, and so in his performance it reveals the interaction between Powell and Prot, and sometimes intense. It is a demonstration of two of the best actors in the business that do what they do best, creating a dynamic that is vibrant and inspiring. This is a good job by Bridges, who never tries to steal the screen of Prot, which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher notch. <br /> <br /> The supporting film includes Mary McCormack (Rachel), Alfre Woodard (Dr. Villers), Ajay Naidu (Dr. Naidiu), Vincent Laresca (Navarro), Kimberly Scott (Joyce), Conchata Ferrell (Betty ) and Saul Williams (Ernie). An entertaining, emotional film, 'K-PAX', is a treatise on possibilities, as well as an exploration of the ever-evolving complexities of the human condition. It is a film that requires an open mind and rewards those who can approach and embrace it in its own terms. In the end, this makes you realize how really K-PAX is; And it appreciates Prot's journey, and just how much we all share and share with people around us, humans or strangers. And this can only make you think about your own journey - where you were and where you were going. And it's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10. <br /> <br />
