Emanuele Crialese has done a fantastic job with one of those movies that has been hanging in the back of your mind for years. This was Respiro (see comment and synopsis here in IMDb). <br /> <br /> Now, with the wonderful young talents he had on the screen for the first time, he takes the audience in a dark void. A literal dive in dangerous waters. The subject is migration. In this case, from Italy to the New World (the name of the film). A great thing it calls for its US edition "The Golden Door". <br /> <br /> The story of a family who leaves everything and holds the rest of the risks - it's their lives for a dream. <br /> <br /> I hate spoiling the show and telling the story. So I will attend Crialese a bit and all his team did so brilliantly. <br /> <br /> First of all, choose to stick to what he knows: instant sound as much as possible. That means the whole movie. The textures, the pain, the nuances of reality are always mixed with the smells, the heat or the cold, the sweat and the blood, life and death, as lively as in real life. <br /> <br /> The squeaks of bent metal and grinding wood, the notorious drunk of the wind and the ominous sounds of big engines and ship horns are one of the points that this movie entails. <br /> <br /> Camera work is in the hands of a French couturier. The symbolism of light is present at the very first shot (again, almost the very first shot of Respiro) and throughout the film through intimacy and a terrible sense of despair. The intricate sounds and the very gray and grim portrayals of people who are the cramped and dirty boat they dare to hope are fascinating. <br /> <br /> Light is used lightly, almost every character in the dark, discovered. The beauty of every shot, and every scene is accentuated by the costumes and the perfectly selected physical features of the actors. <br /> <br /> Again, as usual, Vincenzo Amato is definitely on its own. He is the father of two sons (the same actors who are fifteen and twelve and now nineteen and sixteen) with all the power he always transports to his very complex characters. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gainsbourg is so-so. I think she never achieved the perfection she achieved in The Cement Garden and in her very first film: L'Effront√©e. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's just that she looks a little uncomfortable in her role. <br /> <br /> The places and sets are hard and compelling. They almost play a character. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most remarkable character is the one played by Filippo Pucillo, the dumb younger boy. The contrast here with his first role is complete. Then he played a full-fledged child who was so indifferent to anything around him. Now his character is all expression. And just that: no words. His eyes tell the whole story with sublime power. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's one of those movies that won't be very well received in the States. It's absolutely Italian in everything. It is so Italian that the language is mostly one of the many dialects that are much older than Italian itself. In the US, this movie may be a bit too much for Americans because of the subject. But anyone who remembers the story of their families when they arrive in the States will see this movie with awe. <br /> <br /> Again, the minimalism that goes hand in hand with Crialese's ideas is back with a closing scene in the water. Only this time it goes from underwater photography to air. <br /> <br /> All in all, another great and very well-told story of this movie maker who just won 6 prizes this year (2006) and was nominated for the Golden. lion. Not a small act!
