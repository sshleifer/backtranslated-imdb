The philosophical, meditative tone of this movie makes it one of a kind. I just want to give it 10 stars. That said, but what struck me with that particular force was what I might have done wrong, its Art Direction. Many of the indoor shots have a rich blend of color blends that are apparently based on many underrated Munsell Color Model advancements and complementary compositions. This probably makes the film unrealistic for contemporary eyes, but for me it is very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself. I think this movie is actually unique to this quality, and if for no other reason does it deserve a complete, careful, digital recovery. Fox, are you listening?
