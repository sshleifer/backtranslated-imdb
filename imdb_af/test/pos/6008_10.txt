Ted Danson was a good choice to play Gulliver. Although his background was mostly comedy, he shows here that he can do as well or maybe better (although there is a lot of humor in it). It's hard to make a blind eye to his American accent, especially because his character is English, but it's just a small thing. <br /> <br /> All the villains are equally well-cast: James Fox, Edward Fox, Peter O 'Toole, Warwick Davis, John Standing, etc. Despite the fact that most of them are small people or giants, they are 100% credible in everything they do and their motivation is very clear, eg. The Lilliputians' incessant suspicion of Gulliver, Grildrig, the (giant) dwarf's hatred of him to enchant his position as court doctor. Dr. Bates's attempt to show Gulliver is insane, so he can marry Mary. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen is big like Mary Gulliver (another 17th century English character with an American accent but never mind). She is a deeply tormented character because she has been waiting for her husband to return for nine years, and when he finally speaks, he talks about small people, giants, a flying island, and talking horses! Mary, despite the strong fantasy element in the story, is a very credible character. <br /> <br /> The special effects are breathtaking, especially if you think it was filmed on a television at a time when CGI was in its infancy. It looks very realistic if we see a 6 foot man by a city full of people with a length of 6 cm. <br /> <br /> The comos are also good: Omar Sharif, Richard Wilson, Sir John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ned Beatty. All major actors who play a strong supporting role, complementing the Danson's amazing acting ability. <br /> <br /> The Houynhnhms and Yahoos are probably the most effective element of the story on the satire side of things: a society of talking horses who doesn't own any of the burdens people have, while the Yahoo's primitive , disgusting people are forcing powerless and appointing their leader, depending on how disgusting he is. Gulliver and Mistress's study of them is also well done and shows the differences and similarities between people and Yahoos. <br /> <br /> The best version of "Gulliver's Travels" is by far one of the best mini-series ever. .
