Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his full features. And I suppose most people saw only a few cuts from his pre-function days when he died in decades and dozens of comedy cards. It's really a shame, as some great shorts are waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> If anyone sees this movie, they have a great chance to see Chaplin's better shorts. because Chaplin herself chose these three shorts and merged them with a little narration to make this 1959 movie. It's a lot for several reasons. First, in Chaplin's earliest films from 1914 to 1915, his character of the Little Tramp is still in its earliest incarnations or completely absent. Plus, even when he is there, he was often temperate and self-centered - something very strange from the Little Tramp that we have grown to love. Secondly, because the shorts selected were in good condition. If you watch this movie, you don't have to worry about screaming film with gaps and lousy musical accompaniment that doesn't suit the action (a common problem). /> <br /> So, for a good look at Chaplin's shorts at their best, this movie gives a chance. It's sure to give you an excellent laugh.
