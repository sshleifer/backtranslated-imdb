I watched it again after I didn't see it since it first found out (in '97), and it still made me laugh aloud. It's been skillfully written, Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are both perfect in their roles, and if you can watch Bob Newhart in this movie and not chuckle, you're more of a man than me. <br /> <br /> For that matter, I think the scenes where Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline, where Kevin Kline listens to the "How to be a Man" box, and the after- (almost) wedding - Scenes with Joan Cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, the last scene is a little excuse for a happy ending, but ... some movies are perfect.
