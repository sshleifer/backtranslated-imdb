I saw it at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival and enjoyed it very much. It worked for me as a somewhat strange comedy, because I don't like horror, but there were only a few minutes I had to close my eyes. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was good, the costumes and settings were not far from BBC quality, which is great for an indie movie. I like the way the plot turns and even meanders, it surprised me in good manners. I even warmed up to the Willy Grimes character, which I didn't like at first. It would have been better if there was any motivation for the woman who was so interested in going to the island. It was much like a plot device. <br /> <br /> I love Dominic Monaghan, and he did a good job at pratfalls, horror and at the more considerate moments. Nice voice in the narrative too. <br /> <br /> It will be a fun and unusual date movie.
