I think the costumes were excellent, and the hairdressers also performed well. It has the very authentic feel for that period. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it was the computer magic or if it really was. Some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background. I was especially impressed with the scene of that bridge. <br /> <br /> The main characters that the actress also performed well for us are a nervous, witty woman who knows how to use herself to deceive men into getting what she wants. <br /> <br /> The scenes were hilarious. Although it was about 2 hours long, but it was never boring. a very good entertaining movie.
