Soderbergh is a fantastic director, but nothing he could think of could defeat the incredible cast that he had collected for this highlight of persecutors. Obviously he knows this from the coming. The term "star vehicle" has traditionally been used to refer to a movie that builds around one star. What this film does is just a whole bunch of Hollywood shots and even shine brighter than before. The last scene says it all - all the stars sit with nothing happening and nothing is said. We just see them socializing as if it were a scene of a reality show where George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Don Cheadle just kept up. So the story is not important at all - it's not where the greatest pleasure comes from the movies. If you want a smart movie, keep it better at 11. But if the stars look, it will make your day.
