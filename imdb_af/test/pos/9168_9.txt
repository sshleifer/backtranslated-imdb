As I said in the title of this review, it hurts me to say it, but "hitch" reaches the pinnacle of what Hollywood romantic comedies can ever hope for. I was a critic of both genres and this is the namesake as long as I can remember myself, but with an almost tragic note, "Hitch" caused me to "somewhere" around two hours of my life. a ludicrous spends a smile plastered over my face. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this movie may be misogynistic and suspicious, but it does have a certain sense of humor about which the subtlety can only be described as British. It's a wonderful attempt by Hollywood to make (or a remake as the case may be) a movie that addresses all our wishes for a romantic comedy that can make us think and laugh at the same time. I give this movie a 9 out of 10 unconditional and most elusive. Something you will hardly see me do in the near future for a Romantic Comedy, or so I hope.
