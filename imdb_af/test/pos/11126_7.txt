"Fame" is a very well done portrait of the students living in New York City's High School. The film focuses on a group of students who dream of raising it while completing their craft at the well-known school. Director Alan Parker matures each of the marked students on the screen so you can feel connected to each other. The music here is contagious and fun. The dance is exciting and fresh. The film eventually became the basis for an Emmy-award-winning television series featuring debbie Allen and some of the other film actors. One of the more enjoyable "dance" films of the 1980s. Receive Oscars for music. 8/10
