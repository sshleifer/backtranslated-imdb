The "everything I have is 5 bucks and my wedding ring ..." scene was a riot. I also threw on the scene in the pub where Hyde sniffed the horse paradise and flew the bird to the Japanese man and said "Pearl Harbor friend". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure, because I can't count that high. <br /> <br /> Funny thing, these 10 rule requirements. Looks like they'll be too late to make your comments too long. I hope I don't make it up to 1000 words before coming to line 10. <br /> <br /> I'm two more lines short. Forgive me while I think and drink, or drink and think. It depends on my hands being faster than my mind. All right, I think I made it to the 10 line limit. Thanks for reading!
