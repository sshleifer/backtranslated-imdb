Although I saw this movie in French, it is certain that it has lost something in the translation, lack of accent, and so on. It was an excellent, fun movie for a lonely night in a hotel room. -in what accurate and positive are the complexities of individual sexuality, gender and finding a place within the communities one should be - male, gay, urban, 30-eh, etc. I was very proud of French television to show such an honest and positive portrayal of the gay community. While the fact that the gay main character ends a bit "straight", it's disappointing, it's life, and sometimes it does. It's a good movie, whether it's alone or with a date! A very pleasant experience.
