Travis and Sandy (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr.) are committed to selling their animals to a Mormon group and leading them across the border to a settlement. What they don't expect is to meet the infamous Clegg killers, with their wounded leader, Uncle Shiloh (Charles Kemper). Ward Bond depicts Elder Wiggs, the main voice for the Mormon group moving the wagon train to the Lord's destination. Along the way, they also get 'Doctor' a Locksley hall and his Hoochey Koochey wagon. They like to help them. <br /> <br /> Lovingly driven by Ford, paying close attention to detail with realistic problems, any group will be experienced. during a rough wagon trail. The film has a wonderful movie that consists of character characters with a sarcastic star in the movie, which is actually a blessing to watch, if it is not just a change of fit. Young Johnson and Carey, Jr. are really good, but it is Bond's movie to shine as he has the best lines. Johnson is the one who understands robbers and brutes like Shiloh and will certainly be useful when certain conflicts can develop if the Clegg boys ride alongside them. <br /> <br /> I'll have to say this is one of his best and most appreciated westerners and looks great.
