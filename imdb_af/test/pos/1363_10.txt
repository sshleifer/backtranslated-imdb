Simply put, there are two parts of this series that make me cry until my eyes fall out. First: The part where he had to wash the toilet, but eventually drank the toilet water while thinking it was the hot director giving him a golden shower !!! (I laughed so hard!) <br /> <br /> Second: The part where he tried to be worthy of a swimming school instructor. He was like a pro dive, but as expected he couldn't swim (pretty much at least ^^). But the funny part of it was when he finally reached the end and said "how was it" or something. It was so friggin hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see this anime series, I highly recommend it. One of the best I've seen. <br /> <br /> Definitely the funniest!
