I'm really surprised that this movie has only a score of 6.4 from the time I made this review. Although I'm not exactly a good movie, I think it's one of the best movies that Dietrich has done and it's a pity that it is no longer highly regarded. I think much of the reason I liked so much about the movie is that the usual dull Dietrich persona as the "über vamp" is not present and that her role should actually do her. I just hate filming to film after movie in the early days of her career, where she looks more like a caricature or cliché as a real woman. I don't necessarily estimate Dietrich for the stupid vampire films she made in the 1930s - audiences loved them and they made her known. But here she showed she could really act. Watch her in movies like MOROCCO, BLONDE VENUS and THE BLUE ANGEL, who would guess she was well-thrown to play a gypsy! I was totally prepared to hate the movie because of this decision, but it worked - she was pretty credible and fun to watch! The movie is essentially a vehicle for Ray Milland and Marlene Dietrich. The other supporting characters are very secondary to the movie. Milland is a specialized spy in the former World War II Germany and in his attempts to escape, he stumbles on a fairly lonely Gypsy (Dietrich) who immediately takes him to fulfill prophecy - in other words, her new lover! Milland is rather stuffy, but reluctant to travel in her wagon - even to paint his body and urge his ears to look like a cigar (hence the title for the movie). Over time, he began to realize that under her very unashamed outside a woman and romance slowed down. <br /> <br /> The movie in a word is "charming". A beautiful romance with a good dose of comedy and fun - just the kind of picture you want Hollywood to have made. Also note the performance of Murvyn Vye as "Zoltan". He was very magnetic in the short time he was filming and I just love his deep and beautiful voice. <br /> <br /> Finally, a sad note to consider. While the film is set in Germany, no mention is made of the upcoming Gypsy Holocaust. During the war, the Nazis wiped out a large percentage of gypsies in German territory and the final end of the film is therefore a bit far-fetched.
