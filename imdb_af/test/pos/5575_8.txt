I remember ignoring the TV series when it first made its debut because of its 'look' with the Jim Hensen muppets. However, recently a friend made my loans for his Farscape DVDs, and I just realize a terrible mistake. <br /> <br /> As with any TV series, there are episodes that shine and what are not. I drive the adrenaline and emotional rush during the great episodes and suffer from the darkness. However, I endure regardless of the core story that connects all the episodes. What I'm talking about is the growth of the main characters and their love for each other. Let me warn you, this is something that is absolutely irresistible to look at. I can't recall any other TV series (Babylon 5, Buffy, Angel, etc.) that brings so clever and intelligent such a heartbreaking and exciting ride. <br /> <br /> I think it's at the end of the Fourth Season, things have finally been tightly focused and I'm shocked at the decision to cancel the series. I am anxiously waiting for the release of the miniseries and invite others to discover this incredible jewel.
