(Some spoilers included :) <br /> <br /> Although many commentators mentioned this movie surrealistically, the term fits poorly here. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surrealism means: <br /> <br /> "Fantastic or inexorable imagery": One doesn't have to explain how many ways a skilled ten-year-old boy in general and his prosperity are looking in Die driver's seat of a red Mustang can be fantastic: the curious can read James Kincaid; but if you asked how he was behind the wheel of a sports car, he would surely protest: "NO WAY!" What fantasies and irregularities the movie offers mostly occur within the first fifteen minutes. Then we get more iterations of the same, in an ever harder and more uncomfortable progress, which, far from unpleasant, is soon predictable. Not that, on the other hand, it was literally credible - but it was unfair to put Motorama in particular with this error, any probable suspension of unbelief exactly on the typical movie maker and viewer's value scale since the Raiders of the Lost Ark "has become a clash. <br /> <br />" Hallucinatory ": How do we know what a hallucination is as part of a human being does not know that we have one? hallucinogenic drugs "enjoy, but if Motorama looks like this, then I lose the reason why someone would take them more than once. Of course, there is sometimes a bad trip. The movie must be one of those words. <br / > <br /> "Juxtaposition of words that was startling": How many times a ten-year-old can scare you by saying, "Oh my God!" when he likes something or "Damn!" when he doesn't? Two interjections are about par for the course with this writing Can any sense of the surrealist in passing for dialogue reveal only the naive of the emerging American generation's speech patterns. <br /> <br /> "A world completely defined and portrayed, but that makes no rational sense:" Motorama's world does not make any sense, but it is about as fully defined as a cartoon in a primary school newspaper . The many guest stars in the role-players all play a role, even less intelligently than our little hero, who exclaims "Damn!" in the eye of a lash, but needs a few seconds to relieve the lame lie. And even * his * character, despite appearing in virtually every scene, does not get significant development. Here is hardly any reward for any viewer who is sympathetic, as I must, enough to know him better and understand where he comes from. A vague sense a much better story and protagonist struggles to get out. <br /> <br /> "Fully recognizable, realistically painted images are removed from their normal contexts and re-combined within an ambiguous, paradoxical or shocking framework." No, we see a sequence of stereotypical and increasingly dilapidated billboards, petrol stations, greasy spoons, cheap hotels and their low-cost country-side residences, exactly where they belong stereotypically. <br /> <br /> "Very responsible for the continuing ... the traditional emphasis on content." There is little content, moment-to-moment, in Motorama. <br /> <br /> Summary: Photo British millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates heading for a solid costume party, sit quietly and dumb as careful drivers. thumbs their Rolls-Royces like fragile skiffs through a moving sea of ​​desperate humanity, Chinese that they catch through the windows and protrude the glass with blood. Or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques, limousines such as those rusting above, and white ghostly pianos. In this detritus, a worn-out boy and a sick woman wanders as a maiden figure wandering girlfriend, falling asleep on the grass. He wakes up - at the Feast of Transfiguration, "white and glittering" 1945 - with a brilliant flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun. To find out that his mind became a body, he first believed that he had turned up his soul to go to heaven. Later he just explained a little less innocently: 'I learned a new word today: atomic bomb. It's like God takes a picture. "Now, * there * are just two samples of cinematic surrealism, surrealism whose ironic ripple is enough to invade his film's title: Empire of the Sun. If you're looking for a surrealist, * please don't miss it. Unfortunately, how hard he stepped on the accelerator to run his wagon through and outside the desert, awaits spectacular, spectacular, rich, subtle or beautiful scenes from Motorama's poor little Gus in his quest. <br /> <br /> No one above necessarily means a thumbs-down on this movie. Although somewhat disappointed, I cannot dismiss it, seeing the respect of another genre that illustrates it. It surely influenced by surrealism, but also by expressionism, existentialism and Franz Kafka's pessimism amid almighty power structures. Let's try for the size: Theater of the Absurd. <br /> <br /> Regarding the EB's article on this style, I am surprised at how, to the extent that The Absurd Theater is a valid artistic style, the above objections to Motorama disappear like a smoke. I am tempted to quote the whole text as support of the identification. <br /> <br /> The theater of the Absurd aims to show "that the human situation is essentially absurd, without purpose ... man is left to feel hopeless, confused and anxious.": Gus immediately Achieve his goal of getting away from a depressing home life among older parents. Gus finds him aimlessly until he reads a glittering sign, "Motorama", and decides to win the lottery he promises. As others have already announced, this ambition appears to be illusion. Although the game never disappears, the sponsorship corporation has no intention of ever winning, and can mislead, confuse and mislead ways of deceiving. He, like others, is finally disappointed in his dream. <br /> <br /> "Absurdist playwrights have therefore done away with the logical structure of traditional theater. There is little dramatic action as conventionally understood characters perform, serving their activity to show the fact that nothing happens to their existence. Not to change ... a timeless, circular quality occurs. "" Language in an absurd play is full ... repetitions ... repeat the obvious until it looks like nonsense. " Under a sometimes "dazzling comic surface," we find "an underlying message of metaphysical distress." Gus's obsession with a stupid game, his language language, the plot device in which he changes a dark future and / or return to an early moment and another but still pale turn - so much fits now. While an admirer of the surrealists can do better with a few movies, Spielberg, Motorama's fans, as it really is, must find other travelers - not in addition to it - in the works of Beckett, Ionesco and Genet . br /> <br /> But one can't quite stop here. After his disillusionment with the game, Gus returns to Phil, (the love), the first servant he met, and the one who treated him thoroughly, although he also shook him - advertising a service station "Be full-filled! " Under Phil's supervision, he teaches a life to wait for cars. We can note here that the absurd playwright Beckett entitled his most famous play "Waiting for Godot" and that Godot should read our "God". God is also one of Phil's decisions. Furthermore, as the indirect result of his previous encounter with Gus, Phil is poorly disabled and goes into a throw with his arms straight horizontal. In the last scene, Gus, now Phil's protege, says he wants to hear music. We hear nothing, but we see Phil rocking his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm and Gus approaching and Gus responding. The end. <br /> <br /> Finally, to a writer I am currently reading, the Anglican theologian William Stringfellow. If this rebel lawyer is not recognized as an architect or oppressor of Liberation Theology, who is more a Roman Catholic than an Anglican movement, he may have to be. Police cruelty and corporate greed are a cliché in the movie, including Motorama, but Stringfellow supports such sentiments with impressive warranties from Scripture, tradition and reason. <br /> <br /> His most important work is an uncovering of the earthly activities of those fallen angels who refer to the Bible as authorities and powers. Principals, writes Stringfellow, are behind all our popular three's: pictures, institutions and ideologies. All this desires to worship us by making false promises. The more involved in an image, an institution or an ideology that becomes someone, the more his own personality becomes exhausted and becomes a slave to them. Promising power, control, and immortality, they deliver incessant helplessness, chaos, and death. As in essence, forces defeat, they can do nothing more. Yet, they deceive people with the "rule of the earth" that God promised in the book of Genesis. In fact, none of us controls an image, an institution or ideology that is inevitably bowed to its own hegemony and self-preservation. They take on their own lives. "Dominion" is a mistranslation: a more accurate version of the Hebrew will be "stewardship". But this is a doubt beyond a more fundamental problem: Most of us fail to see God delegate this power to Adam * the fall. We have no reason to assume that we, his descendants, still practice it. On the contrary, it must be clear that demonic forces have stolen it from us. <br /> <br /> One can add two observations from CS Lewis. : First, that one's conquest of nature is a mere illusion, and a rage to cover that one really talks about conquering some men by other men with nature rather than the instrument; Secondly, unlike the general belief, Satan is not a good time for Charlie. He can first gather pleasure, but he is very indifferent to them and pulls them from anybody firmly in his trench, and lets his prey sit in front of the fire and feel sorry and sorry. <Br /> <br /> Now, applying these insights to Motorama, they seem to be remarkably reflected in Gus's experience. He is, if not nice, at least a pretty little boy before the victim of the Motorama game. The first signs it advertises are shining. However, the longer he goes on, and the deeper the journey to the main corporation's headquarters, the villain becomes. He is lonely, meets no one else who plays the game. The stations that issued the cards also fell into ruins or were manned by zombies. The people he meets on the road are more and more ugly, deceptive and hostile. (The fact that the authorities respond to a common dictator does not mean they can maintain one another). Gus's humanity is leaked out of him, as he is not only completely self-centered and unaware of the needs of others, but partially blinded ... upset ... prematurely aging while childless in the literal sense of linguistically. Eventually, even his precious Mustang was taken away from him in an accident, and he had to continue in a dead's wreck. However, after doing everything he had thought was expected, he presented himself to the principal in his proud tower to receive his prize. Using the biblical power to be confused by those who built such monuments on their own vanity, his agents evaded him, disappointed, insulted and eventually threw him from the top floor. He falls long and hard, landing, eventually into a body of water. In other words, in classical symbolism, he DIES. He met the inevitable bad end of anyone who believed his trust in such a fraudster. <br /> <br /> But this lot only seems to be a warning in a variable future. He repented and returned to Phil and saw him the first, generous, selfless act that we had seen for nearly an hour and a half. Note that Phil is now disabled and unable to add a snake to a gas tank, he asks, "Can I help you with that?" When he saw the "help" sign, he decided to apply for the job and explained to the motorist with whom he was walking, which he thought he was going to get away from, because it didn't look so bad. to work. <br /> <br /> Of course, this interpretation is supposed to surprise and even surprise the film's "cult-classic" aficionados. <br /> <br /> If Motorama isn't quite my cup of tea, I'm at least convinced it's almost the worst movie ever made.
