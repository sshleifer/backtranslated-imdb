When I first started watching, I was trapped. It has everything I wanted in a performance show, action, mystery, big plot, and great role players. My whole family loved watching the show. It seems as if there is a big show on TV, the network is usually canceled, as it looks like this show. They go through the Nielson rating system that I think is stupid because there are a lot of junk they seem to look at which networks they keep airing. If there was only one way to vote for everyone on a show then the good performances would not be canceled. If I watch TV, I just watch good shows so now, it's not a whole lot of TVs. I hope the network will bring the performance back, but if they decide to stick to it with a stupid decision. I hope there are many people out there who feel the same way.
