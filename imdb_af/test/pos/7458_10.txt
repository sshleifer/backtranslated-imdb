For some reason I always enjoy animated ducks: Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck. Although none of them is as terrible as Duckman. Originally sent out between 1994 and 1997, Duckman lasted for a total of 70 episodes, but could easily have gone forever without being outdated. <br /> <br /> The titular character is a discombobulated, unapologetic slob and almost the worst living person in the world. He is a private detective, a widower, a peeping tom, an alcoholic, a sex maniac, a killer, a (fill in the blank). You call it, Duckman did it. But who can blame him for being such a smart guy when the world he / she lives in is so insane, shameful and just stupid? Eric Tiberius Duckman (pronounced by the manic Jason Alexander) himself can carry the whole show, but if he is surrounded by a lot of eccentric supporting characters, you just know that the trouble is just waiting to explode on every occasion. My favorite should be Willibald Feivel Cornfed (or just Cornfed Pig), Duckman's incredible deadly sidekick, who seems to be talented and highly skilled, and is constantly unaware of his friend's infinity of malice and incompetence. <br /> <br /> The typical plot will involve bizarre case inevitably moving around through his highly dysfunctional household, although Duckman's arch-enemy King Chicken (Tim Curry), a kind of Professor Moriarty in chicken form, has a few diabolical schemes in revenge for the birth of high school. <br /> <br /> Since being a teenager, it was my absolute favorite animation program, better than The Simpsons, Family Guy and even King of the Hill. Nothing will ever surpass it. There was never, or will be, anything like Duckman ever again. The level of satire, observational humor and writing is so sharp that it is deadly and the animation is done in the unique Klasky / Csupo style (anyone who understands Rugrats will understand it). It is a wonderful, highly imaginative and wild world and all with a noirish, 1940s feel. <br /> <br /> You can never have too much of this particular bird.
