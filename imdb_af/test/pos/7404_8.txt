Sometimes good things happen accidentally. <br /> <br /> I've never heard of Silverwing until late 2005. I put channels and saw something on Toon Disney with bats in a sawmill attacked by owls. I didn't know what it was, but I was motivated to keep quiet - it was hard to wait for a commercial so I could find out what it was called! <br /> <br /> Sharing what inspired me was the look of the bats - first of all, they didn't use the popular convention to give the bats "extra fingers" where their thumbs are supposed to be no. On the contrary, they have palms like human hands, but the fingers are longer and have skin areas between them. <br /> <br /> Also the faces - they look like humans (actually, at one point I wondered if they were once human, but were transformed into bats). Usually I do not like this in cartoon animals, but it worked here. The story is a human story, albeit about bats and other animals (no different from the Lion King). <br /> <br /> What I saw on TV was the last two parts of the "trilogy." I missed the start of the first one, "Towers of Fire" (the second overall), but mostly I saw each of them. However, I found that I wanted to understand what was going on, as the first part wasn't switched on and I wouldn't have caught it yet. <br /> <br /> But I saw that it was based on a book. by Kenneth Oppel. How happy I paid attention to it and wrote it down - I was very disappointed when I learned that the series is NOT AVAILABLE! It wasn't even made recently that it made sense that it wasn't available yet. <br /> <br /> But I didn't just find the Silverwing book, but also the two successors Sunwing and Firewing. When I read the first book, I listened, "Is that it?" Not only because many of the series are not in the book, but I didn't see the animation, but the Silverwing book (otherwise a good story) doesn't end as much as it stops. Only one loose side is tied. Shade and Marina meet the Silverwing colony at Hibernaculum. <br /> <br /> In fact, Silverwing and Sunwing (in my opinion) had to be published in one volume because they make For a complete story together, but not separately. <br /> <br /> In fact, the animated version takes some elements of Sunwing (eg Orestes, lifting the ban to see the sun) and some are completely original. It's not perfect, but it's definitely very enjoyable. I enjoy both versions of the Silverwing saga. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I am pleased that it will eventually be available in June. It was a long time to come, and it is worth waiting.
