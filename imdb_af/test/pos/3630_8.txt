The Duke is a very silly movie - a dog becomes a duke! But it's a very fun movie. It has some of the funny pranks that have lots of kids movies, but (thank you!) No bodily fun jokes, as so many animal movies forced to have! Usually, it is only dogs that are dogs and humans. . . Well, people. The "good guys" are nice and attractive. The 'bad guys' are ridiculous, and of course, the pun of many jokes. But there is something worthy about this movie, because even if it's silly, it's not for every cheap laugh like 'Home Alone' and others. Crocket, Simon and Buyer do an excellent job of playing Black. and Tan Coonhound "Hubert" who becomes the Duke after his beloved owner, a real Duke, dies. For the most part, they do just like dogs, no 'talk' or human emotions and attitudes. However, they do stereotypical poodles, and Hubert falls for her, just because she is a poodle. Come on! These are dogs - they have a different image of beauty! <br /> <br /> Overall, charming, fun and enjoyable.
