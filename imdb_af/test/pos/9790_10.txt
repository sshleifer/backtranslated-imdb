Bobby and Mikey are two little boys moving across the country with their divorced mother to start a new life. Shortly after the family settled, their mother married "The King" who was eventually an abusive stepfather, especially for Bobby. So Bobby decides that he will fly away from the abuse in his birthday present. <br /> <br /> This movie was hard to watch, especially the abuse tones. It was difficult to look at an innocent, playful little one, being abused and being frightened, and withdrawing from the young man. The acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> I cried the whole half of the movie. There were also some funny scenes in the Monster Brew and the dog that found the pop bottles. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't suggest that small children see it. It was a movie that was painful to watch and yet it really did fly.
