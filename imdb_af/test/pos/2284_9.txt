I'm an Australian currently living in Japan. I watched this movie here on TV and was very impressed with the accuracy and honesty in the depiction of Western and Japanese ideologies that clash. Whoever wrote the script and directed this movie should have a good knowledge of what it is like to be a stranger living in Japan. The only part I thought was Hollywood-y was when Tom Selleck's character kissed the woman in the middle of her office and she let him down. Public exhibitions of love are not really acceptable here. Finally, a film that highlights the true 'gaijin' experience! 9/10
