It was one of my favorite programs when I was a kid. It had everything - music, stories, a talking squirrel, and wandering daisies. I wanted to be one of those hippie chicks singing and swinging on a swing. I'm 35 and I grew up in South Jersey, but we have three New York channels with our cable connection, and I think it was on Channel 11. They just don't make such shows anymore (I know that makes me sound very old), and I feel like growing up with just 9 channels on our TV, but I always got something cool to watch. I just talked to another person who actually looked at this look. She is three years younger than me, and she grew up in North Jersey. I would like to see this series on DVD, so I could show it to my 5 year old daughter, and she could see how stupid (but good) things her mother had watched! I just found a VHS band of a few episodes, and a music CD of the show on ebay, and I bought them upright, though they were a little expensive. I can't wait to get them to live the great memories again!
