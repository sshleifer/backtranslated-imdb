Detecting the night shift in a sneaky police station, stumbling across an alcoholic haze, detective Mickey Hayden cannot be said to have a fine grasp of reality. But if a clash on the head exhausts enormous psychic visions, things really get strange. Soon he is on the trail of a serial killer and unraveled the mystery of his beautiful first victim, the elusive Alice. <br /> <br /> The role of a bitter burnout is tailor-made for Keifer Sutherland and he makes the most of it. The plot is typical series killers, but it has enough times, turns and real surprises to raise it above the regular genre and even make a painful low budget. (One wonders what this movie could have been if some money was rewritten for a few more and a few more.) <br /> <br /> All in all, 'After Alice' is a pleasant diversion to anyone, but to fans of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books, this is a real surprise. From the top reality in which things rarely look like they look, to more obvious references - a killer called 'The Jabberwocky', who leaves playing cards on his victims' bodies - there's an 'Alice' reference at every turn . Below is a list of the one I have uncovered. As they found themselves, half of the fun, I tagged them as spoilers. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Cast of Characters <br /> <br /> Mickey - In a sense he's Alice, wandering through strange landscapes, with strange characters, but Harvey , recognizing its true nature, identifies it as the fearless, knotty White Knight. <br /> <br /> John Hatter (Mickey's boss) - Is he really "crazy"? You're the judge <br /> <br /> Claudette - an African-American transvestite. Obviously, the black queen <br/> <br /> Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her the Red Queen, but her brutal nature especially refers to the Queen of Hearts. <br /> <br /> Gideon Wood - Suspicious of As the Jabberwocky killer, its ambiguous role is more suggestive of a snark (or perhaps a boojum). <br /> <br /> Harvey - His role as unofficial guide to 'wonderland' and his name, tempting another well-known movie, makes me think he should be the White Rabbit. <br /> <br /> Dr. Vera Swann - Her last name and relationship with Mickey represents that white queen. <br /> <br /> Other connections <br /> <br /> Mickey's adventures begin when he chases a man in the white and a (rabbit) hole. <br /> <br /> Mickey drunk says his cat stops grabbing him (Cheshire Cat) <br /> <br /> The killer is revealed by the tinplate. <br /> <br /> Just like Alice's adventure in the book, the climate conference ends in playing cards. <br /> <br /> The statues in the garden look like giant chess pieces.
