"Valley Girl" started Nicolas Cage's career and was an 80th version of Romeo and Juliet. It's a definite example of an 80's teen classic. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie, but it will never be "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" as the ultimate 80's teenage movie, because if not for "Fast Times" then The 80s generation of teenage flashes will just be a big hit on the head. That's for sure.
