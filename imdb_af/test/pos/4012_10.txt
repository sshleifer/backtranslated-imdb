This is probably my favorite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! Always make me feel good and feel good when I watch this show. There is just something wonderful, hard to describe. <br /> <br /> Some of the episodes also seem to sync with music albums. Here are some examples. (The episodes start again when they end - but don't play end credits until the end, but always play the opening credits. With most episodes, the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some continue.) < <br /> <br /> RADIOHEAD, PINK FLOYD, BO Dylan. <br /> <br /> 2.02 'Double bogey' Kid A / OK Computer (episode plays at least 4 times) <br /> <br /> 2.14 'Saturn' Kid A / Meddle / Shot Of Love <br /> <br /> 2.19 'World without Alex' Kid A / Wish you were here / Pablo Honey (episode plays at least 4 times) <br /> <br /> There are clues in the episodes telling you which albums sync. Child A can sync with every episode!
