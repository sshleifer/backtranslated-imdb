an excellent, thoughtful historical drama - well-played, painted, shot in ways that convey accurate visual images of the Congo, and with more than a few moving moments, especially for those who care about the history of Africa and imperialism. However, a good amount of valuable content is translated into translation, and because names, acronyms, etc. are difficult to follow. so i would strongly recommend checking out a neutral source like wikipedia to get a basic sense of the story depicted (and subsequent history) before enjoying the movie. If you have the DVD version, there are also some useful historical backgrounds. there is a point to the end of the movie where the name of a character who then speaks with an American accent is actually pronounced - a simple Google search of "lumumba film censorship" or something similar will be a real fascinating (and perhaps disturbing) revolve around the production of this important film. This film, together with a little out-of-the-box research, helps dozens of other films related to Central and East Africa and / or imperialism, eg. Hotel Rwanda shakes hands with the devil, various adjustments of Conrad's heart of darkness, and even "Ali" when Muhammad visits Ali Kinshasa.
