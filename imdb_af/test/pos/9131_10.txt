you loved the Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Vertigo, Oldboy. And I guarantee you will love this one. it is a brilliant thriller. The story is so simple yet so gripping. It keeps you at the edge of your seat to the end. The slow moving scenes, simple music add more perfection to the movie. it is so real. the show is top class towards the rows ... they are too perfect. whether I would put it in top 10 thrillers ever made. Most entertaining thriller I've seen for a while ... ***** / ***** my voice helps me move this movie up <br /> <br /> you'll love it. ..
