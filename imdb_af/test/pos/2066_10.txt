Definitely a movie for people who just ask to be entertained and who do not consider their films. <br /> <br /> Plenty of action, very good dialogue (eg, fun to quote), a little plot and things to be tried everywhere. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had good chemistry. Violent, but not sorry. The fact that the female part was the capable action is a pleasant turnaround. <br /> <br /> Seeing the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoying putting it back in my favorite movies. 3 or 4 months. I initially hired the movie because Samuel L Jackson was in the movie, but was trapped in the events surrounding Samantha's quest to regain her memory and never looked back. <br /> <br /> All your cerebral people out there - Switch unbelief for once, take yourself a little less seriously - you may actually enjoy yourself!
