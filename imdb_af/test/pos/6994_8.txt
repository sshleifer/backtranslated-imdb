Pitch Black is a surprisingly good movie. I wasn't a fan of Vin diesel before I saw Pitch Black, but after seeing Pitch Black, my respect for Vin Diesel went up. He did a good job of playing Riddick who wanted a man for many murders. His character is cold and makes many decisions that surprised me, as Riddick gets on the ship and saves his own ass so everyone stays to die. I like this movie and how it deals with human instinct. This movie is low budget, but this movie will show you don't need great special effects and lots of money to make a good movie. I think all the characters made this movie. I give this movie 8 out of 10;)
