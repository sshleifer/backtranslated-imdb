It's been almost 25 years since I saw this movie. I will consider this movie as an everyday classic in a drama category. Anthony Queen is one of the most wonderful shows ever. In a matter of minutes, he takes you from tears. This movie represents a beautiful picture of how humanity changed after World War II. How much of the generation and the emerging lost his innocence. It took me a long time to find this movie called "The 25th Hour". These types of movies aren't a money maker, but it's certainly a treasure for some. I am very surprised why this movie is not widely used for the media, so more people can enjoy this picture.
