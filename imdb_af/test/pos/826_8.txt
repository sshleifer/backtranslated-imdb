Like Steven Seagal, I'm also a great Van Damme fan and have followed most of his movies since the beginning of his play. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Van Damme takes on the role of Jack Robideaux, who is a policeman who has just moved to New Mexico to work as part of the border patrol in New Orleans. Looking for memories of his past, it is up to Jack to put an end to a group of Ex-Navy Seals of illegal drug smuggling in the US that killed his daughter. <br /> <br /> Overall I found this movie Be very good, Van Damme is 48 years old and can really move. The action scenes are very intense and the movie even throws some plots to make you guess. Unfortunately, Van Damme didn't have the same intensity as he said 10 years ago, regardless of The Shepherd: Border Control is the 3rd straight solid film that Van Damme made possible to open the door for a bigger project. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to a Van Damme fan or fan of action movies in general. The Shepherd: Border control is a good movie, not as good as death, but better than the hard corps. Make sure you try this one, you won't be disappointed.
