Du rififi chez les hommes is a brilliant film that examines criminal thoughts and allows viewers to have a better understanding of criminals who are basically no different from ordinary people like us. What director Jules Dassin shows is that the criminal has families and they care about them. Therefore, they follow a strict court of law. For them, a family is not just women, mistresses and children, but also casual acquaintances and close friends. Unlike many who find it difficult to believe, Jules Dassin has not tried to glorify the crime in his film, as Rififi makes it clear that the crime never paid. It shows that all kinds of bad activities result in similar people. Due to his philosophical attitude, Rifif is worth looking for his technical finesse. Seeing one of the movie's most brilliant rows about breaking a safe, one would find it difficult to accurately accurately match any criminal thoughts. It's a scene that no one dared in Hollywood.
