I mean, let's face it, all you have to do in modeling is for photos. The rating is so over the criticism. However, the performance is entertaining, especially with Tyra Banks, Nigel Barker, J Alexander and the supermodel Twiggy. I watched the season 5, 6, 7 and mid season. It seems American Idol has become sexy, but I'm a guy and I just watch it because of the hot girls sitting in their bikinis! The show can be very boring. Tyra tends to go over and over and it is really off-putting. Anyway, would I recommend it? Yes, would I recommend it to women who want to join the modeling business? None.
