"New York murder" is an entertaining entry into the Charlie Chan series of movies, but if you pay attention, many plots show themselves to the eye-catching eye. Going to New York City for an annual police convention, Chan (Sidney Toler) meets the former Scottish yard investigator, Hugh Drake (Frederick Worlock) on the same flight. Now in the service of military intelligence, Drake is tracking Paul Narvo and his Hindu servant, presumably for sabotage around the world. Drake is of the opinion that, by contacting Narvo's elusive wife, he will be able to combat the position of the master criminal. <br /> <br /> When Drake in the library of George Kirby, president of the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation, Charlie theorizes that he was murdered by a recently discovered toxic gas called "tetrogens", administered via a glass pellet release poison when broken. Kirby calls to bring all his guests together, Chan and police inspector Vance (Donald MacBride) ask those who attend, as one of them can be the killer. Among them are Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), a fellow Oxford student of Drake's actress Jun Preston (Joan Valerie), unknown to Drake, but requested to attend him, Ralph Percy (Kane Richmond), the lead designer at Kirby's airline company, and Keith Jeffrey (John Sutton), Kirby's stockbroker. Kirby Butler Boggs (Leyland Hodgson) is also a suspect, especially after number 2 Son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) caught him to steam a cablegram, the contents of which are Boggs himself. <br /> <br /> There are some other cleverly planted characters in the proceedings as well. Mrs. Narvo appears as Patricia West (Marjorie Weaver), and unlike Drake's suspicion that she can lead him to Narvo, she is actually underway with her former husband and a disastrous marriage. She is involved with David Elliott (Robert Lowery), head of a chemical research firm, and thus a suspect in the tetrogenic corner. <br /> <br /> As with many Chan movies, racial commentary must be violated. . This one offers two distinct children. When Kirby's black servant is brought in for questioning, he says he knows nothing about Drake's murder, that he is completely in the dark. Chan's response: "Condition seems contagious." <br /> <br /> After inspection. Vance's order was to upgrade all Hindus in New York, Jimmy Chan said on their arrival: "They all start looking at each other. Me." Actually, the scene offers one of the elements of comic relief in the movie, like Shemp Howard portrays the Hindu mystic "The Great Rashid" but was actually uncovered by police to be shorty McCoy artist. <br /> <br /> Before the film is over, two victims fall into the clever Narvo - his ally Ramullah and the plane magnate Kirby. To uncover the killer, Chan, in collaboration with Elliott, is organizing a test flight aboard a new TR4 bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule on the plane the day before the plane was planted. Before it could release the deadly poison, the Briton got Fenton the falling capsule in the middle of the air and revealed that he knew about the plant. Arrested and brought in for questioning, Chan states that Fenton is not Narvo. The true Narvo reveals himself if he offers a poisoned cup of water to the nervous Fenton, who is anxious to maintain Narvo's secret. But Chan was smart enough to be cautious about such an attempt and unveiled the real killer - Narvo, now in the guise of stockbroker Jeffrey, following a car accident. <br /> <br /> Now for the plot holes. During the first investigation into Hugh Drake's murder, police maintained that fingerprints appearing in the library do not match those of any of the guests. Jeffrey / Narvo was present at dinner. It has already been established that Drake had one non-party visitor in the library, pharmacist Elliott. If the fingerprints didn't really belong to Narvo, then it was a problem. But also at the end of the movie when Narvo Fenton offers the poisoned water, how did he think he would get away? Will there come with everyone there as a witness? But even better than that, how would a sabotage world like Narvo have the time and set itself up as a New York City stockbroker just makes sense. <br /> <br /> For lovers of trivia, there are a few more points mentioned. In the film, number # 2 Son Jimmy is a college student studying chemistry, as he comes to Pop's help to resolve the issue. In the previous Chan movie - Charlie Chan at the laundry museum - Jimmy was a law student. <br /> <br /> The poison gas formula will be reworked in a later Chan movie, this time by Monogram with Roland Winters in the Chan role in "Docks of New Orleans". In that story, poison gas is released from broken radio tubes similarly to claiming its victims.
