... it might wake people up someday. People who can resist the urge to separate each one, and who sees the 60's for what they were. People who can see that were the individuals who made those times; not the other way around. <br /> <br /> The "Forrest Gump" equation is a good one. Both films watch the 60's, but "Four Friends" is about people, unlike caricatures. VF delves deep into the thing that FG (reasonably successful!) Is trying to condense and classify as nothing more than a background. But while "Gump" throws the 60's away in an attic like old toys in a box, "Four Friends" picks up and embraces every toy, so the lines fade between what you like and what you are. <br /> <br /> If you associate romance with shoe polish, you will hate this movie.
