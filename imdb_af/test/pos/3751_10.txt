I liked it better than House Party 2 & 3. The movie was screaming and cool at the same time. Chris Stokes, who directed the film, has a very humorous cameo in it as a car repairman; watch his mother playing the main character, John John's grandmother. And you can hear her the title song "Down to the Last Minute" at the end of the movie as the credits role. She is very funny and also a very good actress. The young actors staring into it (the main trio), and who is actually part of the IMx music group, did an excellent job. For this movie I didn't pay much attention to this R&B group. Now I'm a fan too. The music number in the House Party scene alone is worth watching the movie. I was pleasantly surprised. I loved it.
