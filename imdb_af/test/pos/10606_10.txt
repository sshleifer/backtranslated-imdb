If you're looking for a movie that doesn't take him seriously ... if Haggard is for you. I have to say before I write anything more, if you haven't seen any of the CKY (Camp Kill Yourself) videos, the movie will probably not be so funny. My advice is to watch some clips of the videos that Bam and his friends made. Haggard didn't take himself seriously, and that was never the purpose. Throughout the movie you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot, which can be annoying, but it is nothing out of control. Even through all that the plot doesn't stay focused on and the story of Ryan Dunn's character doesn't unfold pretty well. This plot I told is based on a true story (for the most part) of Ryan Dunn's ex-girlfriend. Brandon Dicamillo is by far the best character in the movie. He has a lot of talent and knows how to make people laugh. He stole the movie if you ask me. Overall I love this movie for its simplicity and straightforward strangeness. It's a Bam movie, it's not going to be normal. Haggard is full of hilarious quotes my friends and I have been using since the first time we saw it. I saw the movie 6-7 times and get new stuff every time. The soundtrack is just as good. Everything from Gnar Death to New Order and some techno. Just don't go into the movie with high expectations, let it unfold and then judge for what it is.
