Alejandro Amenabar, the young and talented Spanish director, clearly shows us that he is a serious filmmaker. Anyone who doubts it should look at his latest movie, The Sea Inside. It is a movie that is rewarded with numerous awards, not only in Spain, but all over the world, where this wonderful film has been shown. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, you might want to stop here. <br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro is a man confined to bed. To be quadriplegic, he depends on the friendliness of strangers for everything. Since his accident, Ramon only thinks in one thing: how to end his life! This is the moral issue in the middle of the story, based on the real Ramon Sampedro's life. <br /> <br /> Mr. Amenabar tells the story from Ramon's point of view. There is nothing here that is false or manipulative on its part. After all, he relied on facts known in his country, as this matter became a fourth reason in favor of euthanasia, a theme that nobody in that country wanted to handle in Spain. <br /> <br /> With its backdrop to being a predominantly Roman Catholic country, Spain has developed into one of the most democratic societies in Europe, a distinction that is more noticeable because of its long years dominated by a dictator. Yet, despite the advancement in that society, the idea is to take your own life, something that is not clearly understood by the majority of its citizens, which is still this subject as something not done in their country. can be considered. <Br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro was a man who loved life. He lived an intense life as a young man when he appointed a sailor to discover the world. With no money, it was the only way to see other countries, to experience other cultures. Ramon's love affair with the sea is something that people in Galicia learn to love from their childhood. Imagine how the same friendly sea is the one that takes Ramon's life away, as he knew it! In a second, Ramon goes from a vibrant young man to a vegetable! <br /> <br /> The experience of Ramon's family is broken. Suddenly they have to set aside everything to take care of him at home. His brother and son-in-law are stoic people who are practically dealing with the situation. Their lives become something of a memory, because Ramon's life comes first. They tend to plead the sick without protesting, or blaming Ramon for the sacrifices they have to make to keep him alive. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Sampedros cannot understand Ramon's wishes to end it all. Didn't they stop having a normal life to care for him? This moral issue weighs heavily on these uncomplicated and simple people because they do in their minds that came naturally. <br /> <br /> The second subject of the film is the legal issue of euthanasia and the things that people mean Suddenly, Ramon's life is in their desire to help him put an end to his suffering. There is Julia, the lawyer who has disabled herself and is suffering from a scarce condition. There is Rosa, the fisherman who is abandoned with Ramon. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem makes a brilliant Ramon Sampedro. His transformation is total. We do not doubt from one moment that he is none other than the paralyzed man on that bed. Mr. Bardem can only use his face to capture all the emotions within Ramon. Mr. Bardem really makes this man. This is perhaps Javier Bardem's best role in his career. He surpassed his own award-winning performance as Reynaldo Arenas, the late Cuban poet he portrayed in "Before Night Falls". <br /> <br /> In the supporting roles, Belen Rueda, makes an impressive appearance like Julia, the woman who is fighting her own physical problems. Lola Duenas is also effective as Rosa, the related soul who loves Ramon deeply. Celso Bugallo, like Ramon's brother, shows a man at a crossroads of his own life. Mabel Rivera makes a compassionate Manuela, the son-in-law who never asks for life, but tends to make Ramon without questioning why she should do it at all. <br /> <br /> Mr. Amenabar also compiled the haunting music score for the film. He is a man who never stops surprised. One wonders what his next project will be, but he wishes him success in whatever he will decide in the future.
