Susie Q is an original and not like the other bad Disney movie. *** Spoiler *** A boy named Zach moves to a new town and has problems at school, he is good basketball. A girl in the 1950s died with her boyfriend when their car crashed from a bridge. Susie (Amy Jo Johnson) of the power rangers - pink ranger - helps Zach as a ghost to get a necklace, as he has to explain to his sister about her ghost, and finally get this necklace, Susie goes back to the bridge she died. up and then she gets into the haunting car of her boyfriend and drives them up. later when he misses her, he finds a girl who looks just like her. (Do you believe in reincarnation?) Susie Q is a good movie to see from time to time, but they barely give up because Disney has to upload everything with stupid movies and I give it a <br /> <br /> 7/10
