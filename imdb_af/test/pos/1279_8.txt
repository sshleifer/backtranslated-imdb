A sloppy man, known as Bill, lives in a small, dry apartment, with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on the wall, and his typewriter for the company. Only the man can write nothing to write. He walks around the streets to people, just to see where they are going. Maybe it will give him inspiration to write. He started following a well-dressed man holding a bag. He's been following him for a few days. While sitting in a cafe, the well-dressed man sat at a table on the opposite side of Bill, asking why Bill followed him. The well-dressed man says his name is Cobb. Cobb then surprisingly tells Bill that he is a burglar, and even starts taking Bill with him into homes to steal things; although Cobb insists he is not going to steal other people's homes. He says he likes to let people know he was there and interrupts the things they take for granted. For example, he puts on another man's pants in a man's pants. <br /> <br /> The movie is sometimes also featured in flashbacks. The director used this technique in greater abundance in his recent feature Memento. Bill finally decided to cut his hair and put on a suit, on the advice of Cobb. He meets a blonde lady in a club that has the date, the owner, a naked man, who is very dangerous, she says. We see a scene where a hammer is used by the bare man's men on a man's fingers in the Blonde lady's apartment. These are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us, and they will all fit in when we come to the surprising conclusion.
