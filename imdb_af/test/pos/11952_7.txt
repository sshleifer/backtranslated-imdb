It is from the very same creative team behind "Better Off Dead", but is not quite as good as that amazing teenage comedy. It's great fun, but it's all over the place and just not quite that funny. Curtis Armstrong was used to lessen influence (he was incredibly funny in Better off Dead, Bobcat Goldthwaite is hilarious, Cusack is good, Demi Moore is Demi Moore (only with better hair here.) Overall his fun, and as a person of Cape Cod, the feel of an 80s Cape Cod summer is very effective, for some reason this movie feels more "mainstream" than "Beter off Dead." There's not quite as much leftfield absurdity going on here. If you are a fan of John Cusack and Savage Steve Holland, it is definitely recommended.
