I watched Asterix and Obelix in Operation Cleopatra, which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic comic. Like the cartoon, the whole movie is full of jokes based on words, anachronistic jokes and slapstick gags that rarely fall flat. <br /> <br /> Asterix and Obelix are Gauls who use a strong drink to fight the Roman legions in their homeland. Gaul. Here they end up in Egypt to help a friend build Cesar's palace (yes its terrible) in three months to prove that the Egyptians are just as good as the Romans. <br /> <br /> The reason I picked it up was because Monica Belluci is Cleopatra. She is good, but the role is not much more than a cameo. Although she is rarely in the movie, I don't care because she is so clever and the jokes are so funny that I was hysterical. I loved it. I loved it so much that I can't understand why the movies have never been released in the United States. <br /> <br /> The input DVD has the movie in English dub. This is pretty good, especially when you consider it If you see it in the longer French version, the words (and therefore the jokes) are not always clear, as they are heard. If you read the names incorrectly, the jokes are lost. Most of the jokes between the full French version and the shorter English dub look exactly the same, although some have sometimes changed for the better and sometimes the worst. Personally, I will stick to the dub when I see it again, because it's easier to pick up the jokes and enjoy the humor. You will really want to see it if you like punches and low foreheads, but smart humor This is a great comedy
