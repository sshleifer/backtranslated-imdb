One day I was navigating through IMDb, when I talked about the wonderful adventures of Mr. Wonderbird stumbled. Noticed how unclear it was, I decided to look up. Thanks to Digiview, it didn't take me long, so I bought it for a dollar, and when I got home, I watched it, though I have to say, I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> Three of The paintings in a king's apartment, a shepherd's dog, a chimney sweep and a self-portrait of the king (who is as selfish and sadistic as the true king himself) come one Night while the king sleeps, one day in life. The shepherdess and the chimney sweep escape, while the king's painting calls the police to catch the couple. Fortunately for the couple, Mr. Wonderbird comes in to help them, often mocking the police and the king. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD case describes this movie as a "surreal visual delight and an underestimated entry in the history of classic animation." backgrounds look a little bizarre, and many of the characters are strange. These include the depressing citizens of an underground city and hungry lions calmed down by the music of a blind man (which looks like Andy Warhol), not to mention Mr Wonderbird himself is somewhat eccentric. The film is very creative and mostly fun to watch, and its only fault is that it can be moved slowly. But overall, this movie was very good and it is recommended by you. <br /> <br /> Degree: B + (Awesome)
