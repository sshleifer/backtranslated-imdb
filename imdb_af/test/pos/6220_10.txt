Jäniksen vuosi is one of Jarva's most political films. It strongly opposes the authority of today's authority in the life of the ordinary man, and how it has alienated completely from nature. It challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare community. <br /> <br /> Vatans (Antti Litja) - suffocate buy the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations - try to overthrow the chains of society by escaping All in the wilderness of Northern Finland - just about realizing that the concept of a 'free country' is not so unambiguous, in other words, society has the ordinary man at the balls. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes Jäniksen vuosi so exceptional - besides the visual and humorous luster - is how it looks like the whole political atmosphere in Finland in the 70's, as well as the whole identity of Finland as a nation. Vatans are like an archetype of a classic finn in its solitudeness and social distant. As nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of our Finns, the whole idea that it is slowly being taken away by modern society, makes Jäniksen vuosi emotionally exceptional.
