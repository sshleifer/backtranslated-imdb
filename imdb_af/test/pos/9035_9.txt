Intruder in the Dust (1949) Dir: Clarence Brown <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> Excellent "South Gothic" story, adapted from the Faulkner novel, about a black man, accused of killing a white man asking a young white boy to help him prove his innocence. Lucas Beauchamp (Juano Hernandez) is something of an anomaly in this small town. He is a black man who owns the country he lives in and does not think much of the sick social order that usually holds peace here and in many similar small towns. So when Lucas is found to hold a gun over Vinson Gowrie's body, he doesn't shoot any less, young Chick Mallison (Claude Jarman) (who once saved Lucas after Chick fell through the ice while on his land hunting) fears that the city eventually has the chance to "make Lucas a *****." Arrested, and with a great chance of being healed before the night is up, Lucas reaches out to Chick for help, because the only person he knows is "not confused with ideas". Chick asks his uncle John, a lawyer, to defend Lucas and while the man is being bothered by his own ideas, he agrees and they race against the rally to save Lucas's life. <br /> <br /> The movie has an unusual openness to its time and is mostly free of moralization. The attorneys have a tendency to speak incredibly self-confident dialogue that sounds mostly like something from the printed page, but it has minimal impact on the tone. It is a recognition of the rich characterization of all. Juano Hernandez, who appeared mostly in Oscar Micheaux films, is wonderful like the proud Lucas. Porter Hall as the murdered man's father, perhaps the best role I've ever seen him, and Elizabeth Patterson as a cheerful old lady who is sympathetic to Lucas's case, stand in support roles. The environment is perfectly realized. It's actually filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, Faulkner's hometown. Brown also uses the crowd in an effective way, it is always an anonymous gang against a single person (like Lucas when he is arrested or John when he goes to his office), it is very threatening. Or the grotesqu√© of the whole town gathering at the prison saw the lynching as if it were a parade. The note is an absolutely sounding scene when Chick and his friend Aleck collect evidence in a cemetery. Robert Surtees (THE BATH AND THE BEAUTIFUL, THIRD SECOND TO TOKYO, BEN-HUR) shot the photo. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 out of 4
