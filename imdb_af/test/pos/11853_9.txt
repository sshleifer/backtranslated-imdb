The best romantic comedy I've seen in years. Not the kind of slick on top Hollywood stuff by Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler and much less poisonous than a Hugh Grant epic. Julianne Nicholson and Jay Mohr were thrown perfectly and both gave fluent professional performances as the fianc√© couple who decided to spend some time sowing their sexual oats before marriage. Instead of strictly speaking, the writers and director confronted a nice mix of human feelings and comic action. Nicholson is as good as the uncomfortable seductress and Mohr does a good job as the man who hesitates into the game, but soon finds himself a little too much. We only see enough of the supporting characters to finish the plot without distracting from the main story. Andy Richter (serious friend) and Helen Slater (apostate single mom) are exceptionally good. There is enough meaning and emotional complexity to make it much more than a standard boy-farce. Indeed, with just a little better pacing and a little bit more cut this movie would be a top ten comedy.
