Jordan takes us into the swallow side of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt by nineteen-year-old Jimmy (Heath Ledger) to bundle a local gangster job and have to change it before coming to him. The gangsters, led by Bryan Brown, are a threatening bunch with a humorous streak in them. That's what the film does, because we always see gangsters like a rough bunch to screw you badly. But this link also your funny leg. A cleverly structured script by Jordan has characters that cross paths and are captured in the web plot.
