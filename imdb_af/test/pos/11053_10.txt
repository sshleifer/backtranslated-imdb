Garbo's first spoken words in these 1930 movie-electrified audiences and became part of Hollywood legend. Garbo became a star in her first American film, The Torrent, in 1926. And audiences waited for this film to see if Garbo could make the transition to talkies. She has. And while Pola Negri, Vilma Banky and Renee Adoree were down the road because of their accents, Garbo attacked for another decade. Despite the turmoil of this film, Garbo is really excellent, especially in the opening scene with the equally large Marie Dressler as Marthy. The two big stars trade dirty looks and sharp words while enlarging each other while having a few drinks and setting the tone for the rest of the film. Garbo was 25; Dressler was 60. Charles Bickford is OK as Matt, and George F. Marion is good as Old Chris. Marion created this role on Broadway in 1922 and also played it in the 1923 silent version with Blanche Sweet. This Eugene O'Neill play is a true classic, but strange has never been filmed again. Anna Christie is one of Garbo's greatest performances. And despite the turmoil of the film and the fury of the story, she is truly a miracle. See this one for Garbo and Dressler!
