I really enjoyed this movie. I found it very entertaining because I captured the romance of the centuries-old culture of the century. There are no messages. There is no violence and there is no open sex, just healthy 1947 style entertainment and Dennis Morgan had a chance to sing some very good songs. A very good movie.
