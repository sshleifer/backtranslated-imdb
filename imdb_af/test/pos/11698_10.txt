Come on from Oz, I probably shouldn't say it, but I find many local movies that don't have the coherent flow with a bad storyline. This comedy is lacking in nothing. Great story, no overwork, no melodrama, just brilliant comedy as we know, Oz can do it. Do yourself a favor and laugh until you fall.
