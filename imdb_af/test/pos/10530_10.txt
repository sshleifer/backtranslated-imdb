Brilliant work. Wonderful actors dissolve as brave and courageous characters. All the memorable parts in a more than intriguing and catching action. The casting is perfect. Both of the stars like: Armand Asante, Bernhardt, Kier, Denier. But also for new faces. I was very impressed by the young actor playing the boy's gang member Mustafa. You trust each of the Turkish gang. Very convincing is Michael Barral and all white-force followers. I admire the music beating of the main theme of "Children of Wax". This soundtrack is a beautiful mix of Turkish, hard rock and Udo Kier's humming ?? And at the same time, Children of Wax has a story that focuses on racial conflicts. The intolerance and cruelty between the skinheads and the Turks.
