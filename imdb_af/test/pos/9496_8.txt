I thought this movie was really good. It eventually ends up with the viewers Leila has to remember what she had. Leila was sick of her husband Jim, who was more concerned about work than her. He was so in his job that he forgot their anniversary. He was also very sloppy. She couldn't take it anymore so she was gone to see if he'd miss her. The movie shows that he misses her, he even tries to make the night he wasted. He went to her and tried to bring her home. She ends up with another man named Schuyler. He looked like the man she had always been neat and noticed. Eventually, she sort of shadows when she looks at Schuyler's shoes and the way he dropped his cigarette on the floor did Jim the same thing. Jim ends up making lots of money and cleaning himself. Leila thought in the end that she had to keep her husband, because that's all she really wanted and he changed.
