This film was not a good movie, but definitely a good movie to see with your family, especially children from 10-15. There are good topics discussed in this movie, such as bulls, the environment, and work to make things right. Jimmy Buffet's music was a plus and the view was wonderful. The young actors were excellent and this is a movie I would expect on the Family Channel or the Hallmark Channel. In addition to a few words in the dialogue, a middle school can show this movie to start discussions in the classroom. Hopefully this will be shown in Drive-ins this evening so more people can see it. This followed Carl Hiassen's book well, and it was fun to see him in a comedy.
