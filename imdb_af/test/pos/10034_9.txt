It is true that "they killed with their shoes" a highly fictional version of George Armstrong Custer's (Errol Flynn's) life and career, but a remarkable one, especially with regard to the Battle of the Little Growth. Because it's not a given that a 1941 movie is trying to portray both American American cavalry and Native American leader, Crazy Crazy (Anthony Quinn) in a favorable light. I was almost requested to say that "Little Big Man" in his unqualified anti-Custer attitude seems to be unbalanced. Furthermore, one should not be deceived by the title of the picture? It's not just a movie about the Battle of the Little Big Horn, it's a movie about what the unreliable West Point cadet, the famous Civil War hero, the Indian warrior, and the last but not least. /> <br /> The film begins with Custer's time at West Point military academy, where his sincerity and careless behavior lead to regular demerits. During a tough military exercise he meets his future wife, Elizabeth Bacon (Olivia de Havilland), who, like Custer himself, is a resident of Monroe, Michigan. Custer aims to hear her, but the outbreak of the Civil War calls him away. Custer's legendary bravery is shown in a series of battle scenes, the largest of which is devoted to his involvement with legendary southern cavalry general Jeb Stuart during the Battle of Gettysburg. While on leave, he travels to Monroe and Elizabeth's courts, promising to give her a marriage. Immediately after the war, Custer and Elizabeth Bacon were married. <br /> <br /> With the Civil War, Custer is demonstrated, does not get a real commission and, through the laborious slow process of promotion in the small, professional US army. While he was drinking, his wife entered into his name with former General Winfield Scott. Custer is commissioned by the American 7th Cavalry, which he leads to be an elite unit. Custer or Crazy Horse is unwilling to fight, but eager businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through Indian countries, in clear violation of previous treaties. Custer explicitly recognizes the right of the mad horse's cause, but is in the battle to do his duty as a soldier. He simply puts the conspiracy of the money interests into a letter he writes on the eve of the battle. <br /> <br /> "Their Death with their Boots on," although short on historical accuracy, is as good as war movies and Western in the 1940s: Both Custer and Crazy Horse are played by major actors, and the Indians or The Southern Confederation is not disapproved, and the court scenes with beautiful Livvy de Havilland are just charming. The only minus, and that's why I can't give this photo a full 10, is the demise of racism in the portrayal of African American servants; Elizabeth's servant Callie is the stereotypical, overweight, benevolent, superstitious black mum. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting that the movie doesn't find fault with Custer or Crazy Horse, but with the greed of the railway companies, Washington pushes politicians with semi-criminal methods to get the assurances they give to Native Americans. given, to break. Just a few years later, the insinuation that American entrepreneurs might even think that they would be questioning the distance would probably be taken as a hint that filmmakers were communist sympathizers. <br /> <br /> Needless to say they The fact that Custer's excessive aggressive tactics often stupidly leaves out the importance of his involvement with Stuart, and does not mention the lack of exploration before the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Nevertheless, Custer was regarded by his contemporaries as a war hero and had a spectacular exploitation to show in the campaigns of Brandy station, Gettysburg, Trevilian station and others, although his weapons were not decisive for the Civil War. Anyway, "They died with their boots" is a well-made war film with Western elements, three outstanding artists (Flynn, Quinn and De Havilland). ), and presents a positive image of Native Americans, as well as a negative one on big money, which will not be seen for several decades in the major Hollywood productions. It would earn a 10 if it was not for the racist minstrelation of African Americans.
