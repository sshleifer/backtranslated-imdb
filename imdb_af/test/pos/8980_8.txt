In flashback, the film began in 1989 with Charlie award for his role in defeating Communism. I have to admit that my heart sank as if it had to endure a serious, boring and long life story. How wrong I was, because the short scene is as close as the movie ever gets boring. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of entertaining and amusing essay and cracking dialogue in some of the most unexpected places. The next scene after the award ceremony is Charlie in a Hot Tub with some naked women and a man trying to invest him in a TV show. Another spectacular scene is about three quarters in Charlie's movie, a group of his pretty sexy secretaries, Phillip Seymour Hoffman's CIA Man and a bottle of Whiskey. Regarding the dialogue, it's for a line, "the senator says, he can teach us to type, but we can't learn to grow tits. Okay, boyish boyish I know, but the movie is littered with good lines. <br /> <br /> What Phillip Seymour Hoffman does well, he steals every scene he is in. Hanks is OK, but surprisingly to me was Julia Roberts who is very good at the role of a rather eccentric Texas Oil Millionaires. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's War is one of the best non-music Bio photos in a long time, as well as that weird thing that is a movie that entertaines, amuses, and everything inform equal measure.
