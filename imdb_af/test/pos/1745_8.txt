While Disney has been the animation studio for the past 70 years, there were always opponents to their rule. When this review was written in 2009, companies such as Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman, released animated movies that can be said to challenge Disney dominance. Back in the beginning, in the late 30's and early 40's, when Disney served cinematic banquets such as Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the competition was provided by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer. Despite the release of two very laudable films, have they never bothered the market? their characteristic feature is the commercial failure of Mr. Bug Goes To Town, which was issued the same week as the attack on Pearl Harbor (which gave the American public something more meaningful to think about looking at the cinema to see a cartoon!) Made film in relative darkness fading, is a travesty. <br /> <br /> In a patch of overgrown garden in the city a lot of bugs are in danger. People use the land as a short cut, throw junk and cigars, and other dangers, right on the bugs' homes as they go. Mr. Bumble, spoken by Jack Mercer, has the fear that the future is dark and wonders how he can ever raise his daughter, Honey, in a safe environment. A highly unscrupulous creature, Bagley C. Beetle (pronounced by Tedd Pierce), offers her a safer place to live if she takes his hand in marriage, but Honey is much more interested in her childhood, the constantly cheerful and optimistic Hoppity (pronounced by Stan Freed). Hoppity believes everything is about to be resolved better, but stay silly when Bagley Beetle and his few comic sidekicks manipulate the crisis to their own devastating end. Only at the end, when their plaster becomes the foundation of a great new skyscraper, the flawed loyalty changes back to Hoppity when they look at him to divert them a new, safe home from the destructive influence of man. <Br /> <br /> What really works in this movie is the beautiful characterization? All the errors are cleverly developed and designed for maximum audience appeal. The bumbling villains Swat the fly and Smack the mosquito (hilarious names, if you stop thinking about it) are especially memorable. Equally admirable is the storytelling? even the youngest of children can enjoy this story while at the same time giving a message to older audiences about how human messiness impacts on wildlife survival. Time has inevitably dated some aspects of the film, and when viewed, the audience must occasionally accept and forget about signs of general age. But in general, Mr. Bug Goes To Town a perfect, funny and very smooth animation with a worthy message to start.
