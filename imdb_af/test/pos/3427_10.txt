Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is rarely a favorite of mine, said everyone should watch this movie because it is something that can help to heal the world .... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most striking movies I've seen and delivered on Tutu's comments .... I've read a lot of comments and while ranging from good to average to commenting on the choice of actors ... The fact is that it's one of the most extraordinary events in our world. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission ............................. the White Policeman launches a chance to free himself from brutal crimes and the black man tries to make sure he doesn't get away with it, it sneaks into the humanity of the people and the enormous need for healing that we all need .... <br /> <br /> Definitely a thumb. .... To everyone involved .... Again, I'm proud to be a South African ..... <br /> <br /> An interesting comment can be found here: http: //www.biz-community.com/Article/196/97/5223.html
