Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is now based on a little bit of formulas by Japanese school drama anime. The formula goes a bit like this: <br /> <br /> 1. The main character is from the outside world, and has superpowers. <br /> <br /> 2. There is a very beautiful and sexy girl in a supporting role. <br /> <br /> 3. A normal character is there that shares the lead in the story. <br /> <br /> 4. Unusual things happen in a normal social environment. <br /> <br /> 5. Sometimes the story is about the main character and the normal character related to the existence or destruction of the world. <br /> <br /> 6. Absolutely no effort is spent by anyone to get all the magical powers. They just got it. <br /> <br /> 7. Usually people outside of this tight nit group are not aware of their superpowers, and continue with their daily lives. <br /> <br /> So there you have it. Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi was made along these lines that became the success formula for comics and anime in Japan. Although it follows a beat formula, the series is superbly crafted and the episodes are always put in an interesting relapse within the normal social settings that always result in unusual circumstances around Haruhi Suzumiya. Every player in the story brings some unusual insights into daily life that we are not usually aware of. The philosophical twist of their insights is to make this series extra entertaining. The footage was first done and beautifully done. <br /> <br /> The crazy ideas that Haruhi always has with intricate settings of the story can give you headaches from time to time. This is further complicated by the fact that the episodes are played out sequentially which adds to the confusion. When I looked at the episodes in the chronological order, some of the plots eventually made sense. I recommend doing the same. It is much more entertaining to see the series so.

Let me know if you did.
