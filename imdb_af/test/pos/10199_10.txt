In 1933, Hitler and his "National Socialist German Workers' Party", which of course all known as the Nazis, prompted their handle more and more. Early in their turbulent trampling of the German people, they and all artists, newspaper men and filmmakers called in their Nazi headquarters so that they could be informed of what the newly declared 'Third Reich' (also known as 'Empire') of they expect. <br /> <br /> When the master director of the German film's silent-impressive and expressionistic era, Mr. Fritz Lang called to meet Herr Goebels; He listens attentively and says nothing. Immediately after leaving the minister of Propaganda's office, Herr Lang went straight to the station and took a passenger directly to Paris. Not even back to his residence, Fritz Lang did not return to Germany (at least not until many years later). He stayed in France and eventually immigrated to the United States. * <br /> <br /> MR. managed to work in America and for many years created a variety of beloved, solid and essentially literate upper echelon films. In this smörgåsbord of titles is today's lucky subject, WESTERN UNION (20th Century Fox, 1941). /> <br /> Typically, a movie about the Old West and Pioneer Days requires both quality and quantity of cast. WEST-UNION qualified for both necessities. We are treated with a fine spectrum of main talents as well as a supporting role that makes just about every minute and every scene a pleasure for our senses. <br /> <br /> The capital is Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore. Other prominently displayed are people like John Carradine (not playing a vampire or other scary guy but a doctor), Geor Ge-Smart Summerville (veteran character actor, Silent Film veteran and graduate of Mack Sennett's Keystone Comedies), Chill Wills (always reliable support player and former singer in "The Avalon Boys") and bad old Barton MacLane. At this mix we have names like Russell Hicks, Victor Killian, Minor Watson, George Chandler, Addison Richards, Irving Bacon, James Flavin, Francis Ford, Frank McGrath and Kermit Maynard (Ken Maynard's brother). <br /> <br /> PROMINENT in the American Indians is: Chief Big Tree, Chief Thundercloud and Mr. Jay Silverheels. It is also a major representative of the Aboriginal peoples of North America. It is a great, particularly impressive and memorable example of the Red Man, the Louisiana Native, Iron Eyes Cody (Espera DeCorti of Sicilian Immigrant Parents). <br /> <br /> Filming the fine outdoor scenes is in place in Arizona and Utah and available in the highest grade Technigolour. (There is no Monument Valley, but then it is the province of John Ford.) In some ways, this movie is a far more amazing achievement than we might think; because it took a kind of magazine story, adapted to the taste and idioms of pre-war America of the late thirties and early forties. All this is done by a German born director who was only in Hollywood and America for the shortest time. <br /> <br /> In its final analysis, WEST UNION, while perhaps not the most historic one is not an accurate example of the Western Genre; we just don't care. It counts in all the necessary categories needed for a good night at the movie! So, who really gives small details such as "accuracy"? <br /> <br /> Long and the 20th Century Fox a rating of ****! <br /> <br /> NOTE: * We only saw a special at PBS station WTTW, here in Chicago. It was all about all the movie actors, directors, and other artisans who came to power the Nazis in America and Hollywood retreat. (It seems that filmmakers and scientists at this time were the biggest export to Germany, namely that the Scientists who built the Atomic Bomb and future NASA people came from Europe.) <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
