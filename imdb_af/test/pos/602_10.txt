Jim Henson as Kermit, Dr. Teeth, Rowlf and Waldorf. <br /> <br /> Frank Oz as Fozzie, Piggy and Animal. <br /> <br /> Jerry Nelson as Floyd Pepper, Robin the Frog, Lew Zeeland and Crazy Harry. <br /> <br /> Richard Hunt as Janice, Statler, Beaker and Scooter. <br /> <br /> Dave Goelz as Gonzo, Dr.Hunnydew and Zoot. <br /> <br /> Charles Durning and Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> Comedy by Steve Martin, Carol Kane, Orson Welles, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor and others. <br /> <br /> This is the first Muppet movie of the billion others to come out and is also the best, by far! It's about Kermit the frog goes on a trip to Hollywood and meets the other characters along the way. This movie, along with the fact that it is good, has excellent songs performed by the Muppets, including Rainbow Connection, you can picture it, move right and others. This movie, unlike the other Muppet movie, carries a strong sentimental value to me. It's such a nice movie. Also noted it is many cameos with Steve Martin, Mel Brooks and a dozen others. <br /> <br /> My rating-A plus. 109 minutes. graded G.
