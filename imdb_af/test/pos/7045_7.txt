The Essential "Let's get ready for summer movie." It's stupid, goofy, and maybe a touch dated, but my kids just saw it and they laughed as loudly as I did when I first saw it. In the style of all "little guys towards the settlement" movies, so yes, the plot is very predictable, but it's hot and funny. And no, it's not Bill Murray at his Bill Murrayest, but he started stretching into what was his first lead. Strange, to see how little of the "fresh young faces" in this movie did much more.
