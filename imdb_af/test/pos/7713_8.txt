The eighth, and thus the second to the last short of the Animatrix one, is the only one like that. It takes two of the most important types of filmed entertainment inspiration from The Matrix, combining them incredibly well. It is incredibly true to the trilogy in that aspect, the tone. The animation is a beautiful, awesome Anim√©. The style, which is ubiquitous in this, is Noir. The plot is appropriate, and the storytelling, as well as the music, is in the right place. The sound in general is fantastic, and really helps the mood and atmosphere, along with the drawings and designs. The tuner is impeccable. This is one of only two where people also repeat their roles in the movies, and both have Anne-Moss, who is the only one to appear in this movie. It's one of the best of the nine, and also one of my personal favorites. It's about ten minutes long. The pacing is perfect. It never slows down much, but it is not overwhelming either. The end could not have been more appropriate for this. It shares a nine-and-a-half minutes with Kid's Story, and it's well done and informative. I highly recommend it to any fan of the universe and the two genres that make up it. 8/10
