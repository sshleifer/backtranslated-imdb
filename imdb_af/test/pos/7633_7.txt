"L'Ossessa" (released in English under many titles and the first of them is definitely "The Horrible Midnight Horror Show") is one of the best Italian rip-offs of The Exorcist. To really appreciate this movie, you need a sense of humor. "L'Ossessa" is at the same time sleepy (but naive), pathetic and sometimes even moving. <br /> <br /> Danila (Stella Carnacina), an art student, goes to an old church to see the image she's going to recover. It is a wooden image of Christ, a demonic Christ, perhaps already overcome by evil, or to fight it, or to plan deeds. The face shows infinite torment. The statue dates back to the 15th century. Danila is impressed by the sculpture shown by the sculptor - the image looks almost alive! She lives with her parents. Her mother Luisa (Lucretia Love) lives a dissolute life and does not care too much about acting. Her father, Mario (Chris Avram), sees everything with sobs. <br /> <br /> The timber image will soon take on a human form (Ivan Rassimov) and possess Danila in the carnal and spiritual sense. A wonderful scene! Danila (the beautiful Stella Carnacina) was possessed by the devil, violated, possessed by the devil and now follows his orders, she will try to seduce. others. Isn't she her mother-in-law Luisa (Lucretia Love) who enjoys her pleasure when her lover sweeps her with a lot of roses? There is a scene that is so ridiculous to be sublime and over, as Stella Carnacina despaires through the narrow streets (owned by the devil?) From a small Italian village crying out her heart. Luigi Pistilli is a very good exorcist. His performance is as usual as intense. The exorcist scenes (especially the last battle) are very, very amateur, but it will only improve the fun (and / or emotion) if you really have a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Stella Carnacina is beautiful and looks fresh and innocent, and it is a factor that adds to your pleasure when she is naked, but I think the movie can explore her natural beauty more. Lucretia Love is a very good sleaze companion (her naked scene with the roses ... well. :) <br /> <br /> Other Italian exorcist rip-offs I would recommend for: <br /> <Malabimba ( very messy and uncut and digitally restored) <br /> <br /> "Evil Eye" (Malocchio) - "The Exorcist" was the main source of inspiration for "Evil Eye", but other movies, for example, "Rosemary's Baby" should also be taken into account. "Evil Eye" is completely over the top. Not so thin but with very beautiful Italian and Spanish actresses. You'll roll around the whole movie. The movie is ridiculous, the story doesn't make sense, but if you see it in the right mood, you might be moving! - a deadly sect, possession, murder, despair, love, investigation and beautiful women around the world. A wild ride! <br /> <br /> If you like "Evil Eye", see also "Ring of Darkness" (Un'Ombra nell'ombra). This film can be found in the alternative market. Search this title in the IMDb. There are good reviews about it. <br /> <br /> P.S. - "L'Ossessa" has many different faces. It is exploitative, but it can also be serious and moving. It's cheap, cheesy ... sleepy (but not so much) and it has an underlying "moral" message. This strange brew can sometimes be very funny. We all know that "L'Ossessa" is an "exorcist" rip-off, so why can't we see it in its own terms? Yes, Mario Gariazzo tried to make a quick buck, but he could get the most out of a shocking budget. The story is well told, the film is atmospheric and overall, the actors are dedicated to their roles. See the movie with an open mind and you might discover two or three new things.
