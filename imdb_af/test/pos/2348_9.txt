I like this movie, the second Naruto movie. I enjoyed the one in the snow, a little better, although I got a little redeemed here because I wasn't sure where certain things were supposed to happen or when. Still, like the first movie, this one also has a nice time for an hour and a half, enough time for a nice, well-developed movie with some very cool battles. The story begins with ninja from the village hidden in battle with unknown attackers. It then shoots Naruto, Sakura and Shikumaru to hunt a ferret for what they think will be an easy task. They soon find out differently as they are also attacked and Naruto is divorced from his friends after he fights a strange young warrior in armor. They were both injured and overtaken by a caravan and shortly after Naruto was invited to join this strange organization who wanted to create a utopia. Of course, everything is not as it seems and there are many battles to go around. My favorite was the one with Garaa who fights this strange woman, who takes him very lightly, which is a very big mistake. The closing battle is pretty good to involve Naruto and this strange man who is a better villain than any of those in the previous movie.
