In this presentation, one should only see the current Westminster Kennel Club's annual offer to see the parallels. Outrageously funny and captures the true essence of the competition. One can only imagine the whites of the producers and the wonderful ability of the artists. I would also have named this movie for a Globe Award and feel it is one of the funniest things I have ever seen.
