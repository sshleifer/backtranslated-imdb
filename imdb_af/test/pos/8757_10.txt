I was very curious to see the original six-hour miniseries on which Steven Soderbergh's latest film was based, and now I have the right to say one is no better than the other. They are both intelligent, involved and extremely entertaining. The only real benefit the miniseries have over the movie is that it is three and a half hours longer, so we get to know the characters more in depth. <br /> <br /> There is no false note to be had in this production, one that you definitely need to make time when PBS broadcasts these versions in 2001. You won't regret it.
