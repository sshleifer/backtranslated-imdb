The film Night Crossing captures the feelings experienced by the vast majority of East Germans during the period 1961-89. I lived in West Berlin in most of 1967 and traveled through the Wall in East Berlin on a weekly basis. Why? Excitement, crossing a border in a Soviet ruling country, the flavors of East Germany and the feel of East Germany. That's why Night Crossing is great, and it's exciting. I was arrested by Vopos in Checkpoint Charlie and locked by a man in his leather jacket and dark glasses. I'm led to believe Stasi. If I see the movie, I can smell cheap diesel and cooking oil, I see the outdated vehicles, the clothes that the public wore, and the frightened in shop windows. It brings back memories of realizing how happy I was in a free country. In 1988, I toured the GDR from East to West, North to South. East Germany has changed little since 1967. The Trabants, which have broken down continuously, were still the main mode of private motor transport, the stores still have nothing to attract me, uniforms were still commonplace, but the people, the ordinary people were open and nice as you trust got it. Watch Night Crossing, it's as close to the truth as any movie you see on divided Germany, even closer than two other favorites. The Spy coming out of the cold and burial in Berlin.
