Beautiful Candace Bergen as the widow of Perdicaris is kidnapped and played by a raging Sean Connery by Sheik Raisuli as ransom. The incident came in 1904, as Theodore Roosevelt elected in his own right for election to the presidency. Brian Keith as Roosevelt issued a wonderful statement to the Sultan of Morocco, 'Perdicaris Live or Raisuli Dead'. A good example is to portray the United States' muscular foreign policy. <br /> <br /> But in this adaptation of the incident, the famous statement is the only true thing about this story. The Perdicaris involved was in fact one Ion Perdicaris who was a Greek immigrant and a dilettante playboy. In fact, Perdicaris gave up his American citizenship years ago and was back as a Greek citizen. Remember, though, his trouble was enough at that time. <br /> <br /> The distressed girl makes better screen material, though it is such a widow and her two children in danger. Of course, as presented here, some of our European powers also use the incident to get their foothold in Morocco. The intrigues are far above one brigand's demand for ransom. <br /> <br /> The Wind and the Lion are rare history. But it's a nice movie and Sean Connery is always fun to watch. Brian Keith also fits my concept of Theodore Roosevelt and the screens in the Roosevelt home are true to all the stories being told. John Huston is the once patient state minister John Hay, who inherited Roosevelt from his predecessor, William McKinley. <br /> <br /> But children do not use this movie to read a history mission about Theodore Roosevelt era.
