Let me just start with the fact that Tourist Trap is a better movie than 99.9% of the horror movies recently released by Hollywood. If you don't believe me, see Darkness Falls or Them. And it's definitely better than any of that crappy directly to videos like Stab, Bleed, The Pool, and so on. One of the major problems with the movie Tourist Trap is that it is never really an audience. When the film was opened in 1979, the MPAA received a PG rating. Anyone who knows horror movies knows that a PG on a horror movie is usually the kiss of death for the movie. (Director David Schmoeller talks about this problem on the DVD's commentary track.) There are exceptions, but like Poltergeist, who also received a PG rating. However, there are big differences between Tourist Trap and Poltergeist. Tourist Trap was not a big budget Hollywood movie like Poltergeist, and was not manufactured by Steven Spielberg. This alone was enough to ensure Poltergeist success. (For those of you who have seen Tourist Trap, you will even scratch your head on why the MPAA rated this movie PG. The 'heartbreak' scene alone should be enough to hit the movie and R-rating. with the pipe in the back with the blood flowing out of it.) I have to admit that, when I was young, I watched a copy of Poltergeist in the video store rack, picked it up, saw that it was rated PG and put it back on the shelf in favor of an R-rated movie. Years later I finally saw Poltergeist and realized what a good movie I had missed not to hire a PG horror movie. From then on I would never review a movie based on his rating. That's probably what happened to Tourist Trap. People like me with Poltergeist will probably overlook it in favor of the R-rated movie. Most likely it would also be a teenager, most of whom are targeted at these types of movies. Friday the 13th was also not a masterpiece, but did very well at the cabinet due to the fact that it was classified R and then heavily advertised by Paramount. It found its audience and made enough money to grow various persecutors. If you see it, Tourist Trap is as good as Friday. The 13th. The same can happen with Tourist Trap. We could see Tourist Trap 2, 3, 4 and so on. Regarding the film, Tourist Trap is an entertaining horror movie made on a very small budget, but it is well-acted, well-targeted and well on many levels. Chuck Connors is a riot as Mr. Slausen and give the best performance in the film. Special credit should be given to composer Pino Donaggio, whose score for this film really is that separates it from others and gives it its creepiness. The music in the screens where the mannequins are involved is especially creepy. Donaggio worked on the horror movie Carrie and many other films since Tourist Trap. He has done exceptionally good work in the film and continues to deliver the films to this day. The weakness with Tourist Trap is that there is never an explanation of Davey's powers. Perhaps that's how it's supposed to be. He just has them, and we have to accept it so the movie works. We accept it at some point, but then the script has incidents such as Davey calling the phone in the shop while in the basement of the house. In that case, Davey is limited to using his powers? Can he make a phone call in Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles? What is his series? These are things that people who don't care about this movie will probably point out as mistakes. Others will accept it as a mistake. I accept it. There is not enough of the kind of questions generated by this movie to make me hate. This is a horror movie. It should not be expected of us to read it too much. Many people called it the 'killer mannequin' movie. I assure you that no mannequin kills anyone in this movie. The mannequins are controlled by the power of Davey who uses them as weapons. This is a common misconception about this movie. Some people have a problem with the mannequins and some even say they're just foolish. I think they add to the overall creepiness of the movie. Overall Tourist Trap is a great fun rental. *** (out of 5)
