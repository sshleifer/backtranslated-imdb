Before I start my review, there is a quick lesson in the Australian snake that can help you see the movie and understand some of the other reviews from Australia and overseas. <br /> <br /> In Australian snake, "thongs" are a pair of rubber sandals (not confused with the same American word relating to the buttocks that reveal the underwear), "stubbies" are a brand of Australian short, a "stump" is a small bottle of bottle and a "stump container" is a foam insulator for a small bottle of beer. <br /> <br /> If you like black comedies about small criminals, you'll love this movie, unfortunately many on IMDB with poor stomach and no appreciation for dark humor. reviewed this movie which unfortunately this movie seems to be more mediocre than it is. Many reviewers also compared it to Lock / Stock and Pulp Fiction, while being the same genre, it's a completely different and original style. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have also put this movie on by using Heath Ledger's characters to use the dead-born brother to open the story for this movie and guide the story without realizing the movie carefully that his brother was killed is by the same villain who wants to kill the character of the pagans, it is explained halfway through the film, but not clearly enough for most to understand. <br /> <br /> This movie also reminds Lock / Stock and Reservoir dogs, as it is the Director / Writers debut feature, and for a debut feature it is as well as these two movies, in fact, like Lock / Stock and Reservoir Dogs, I rate this movie as a 10/10 for a director / writer debut. Unfortunately, unlike Tarantino and Ritchie Jordan, he doesn't meet his expectations in his subsequent films like Ned Kelly. br /> <br /> This movie is one that you definitely add sho uld to your DVD collection and is one that keeps many different views pretty easy.
