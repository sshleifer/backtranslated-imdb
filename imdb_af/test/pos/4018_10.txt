An interesting movie based on three of Jules Verne's novels. Taking into account the special effects and computer-enhanced animation of today, this movie is a historic marker of cinematic ingenuity and imagination. Karel Zeman brought the lithographic images of the original Jules Verne texts to life. This is a must for classic science fiction and history buffs. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 9 out of 10. Enjoy!
