This production of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is by far the best I have seen. Although it may not have the production value of some of the more recent adjustments, it has the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Jacobi's portrayal of the disturbed Prince is versatile and sound. His performances of emotion range from hatred to sadness, love of revenge and everywhere on the map, but without shyness or obstruction. In fact, some of the more powerful rows take place when he represses them, with silence, soft speech and thoughtful expression. Whether he interprets Hamlet as angry or healthy or not. Well, you have to decide for yourself. I changed more than once. At one point it seems that he thought himself wisely and only plays madness, but suspects that he is actually actually angry ... a revelation for himself, beautifully captured. After performing the part of Hamlet on stage more than any other actor in history, Jacobi's affinity for the role comes as a surprise. <br /> <br /> As far as the production itself is concerned, it is presented as a "filmed copy" of the play, with little special effects or fancy camera work, minimal sets and no musical accompaniment to talk about. This production is based on the acting ability of the cast, and the words of Shakespeare, to evoke the emotion and interest of his audience. And it works. The other players are also the best, especially Patrick Stewart's Claudius and Claire Bloom's Gertrude. Together, the cast offers a seamless ensemble. <br /> <br /> The last (but far from the least) element that stands out for this production is the game itself. Here it is presented in its entirety, a rarity on film. But strangely, I've never noticed the time. I was too busy getting trapped in the story. I suspect you will too.
