On a routine mission in Iraq, a group of Delta soldiers repair a computer hard drive from an Alqueda training camp describing the place of weapon specialist Dr Walsh. After ending his top secret weapon development program, Dr Walsh found an alternative source of funding and set up a new research facility in the notorious Belzan forest in Chechnya where he developed weapons and sold to Chechnya rebels. The Deltas team has been sent on a black mission to get the doctor and his technology before the Russians get him and his lab. What the Delta team soon discovered is that the doctors' latest weapons are a herd of great carnivorous bats genetically modified to develop a taste for human flesh. I found this movie much better than I expected. There is a lot of action and lots of blood. It is more or less what you would expect from a creature trait. The acting is not great, but it is acceptable. I've probably seen it worse. Generally, this is a pleasant movie for what it is. A good popcorn film.
