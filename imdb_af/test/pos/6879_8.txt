Notorious HK CATIII actor Anthony Wong is once (well ... not really - he was a policeman in the DACHTER OF DARKNESS movies and some others ...) not a psychopathic weirdo in EROTIC NIGHTMARE no. Usually acknowledged for his role as a complete wackoo in such CATIII "nasties" such as THE FAVORITE THEORY and THE EBOLA SYNDROME - this time Wong is at the end of the nastiness ... <br /> <br /> Wong plays a man who goes to a wizard who promises to give him very good dreams, at a price. The dreams about which Wong is involved have slaughtered faithful donkeys with smokin-warm schoolgirls, but the dreams come with a price that is more than money. The wizard can manipulate the dreams and, with the help of a sexy ghost, wasting Wong out of his cash and business, killing his family and killing Wong himself. Wong's brother comes to town to find out what is going on and finally finds that his family's murder is the work of the evil wizard - but as it turns out, Wong's brother is a beautiful baptismal wizard himself, and with that help from the wizard's abused wife become the tables on the wizard and his schemes. .. <br /> <br /> EROTIC NIGHTMARE is one of the more enjoyable CATIII movies I've seen for a while. Absent is the eager and dark feeling of some of the other CATIII entries such as RED TO KILL, THE UNTOLD STORY or MAN PORK CHOP - EROTIC NIGHTMARE, although worse in terms of sex and subject matter, is more "fun" than some of the more serious movies of the genre. More similar to ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA - a more "carefree" CATIII entry that survives in terms of nudity and a little bit of gore, without being too many comedies. Definitely worth it, especially for the genre enthusiast. 8/10
