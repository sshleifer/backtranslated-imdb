I think dirty dance was a good movie, they tried to make another haannae that was good, but it was nothing like dirty dancing. I'd like to see another dirty dance with the same people. without them I think it would be a mess. Many times movies are made, and when they try to add more, they start to change people. I want to see dirty dance, have another to see what happened after they could be together. Patrick and Jennifer did so well together. This film was made in 1997 to make the other one. but this time starting where it left off and keeping the same people in it.
