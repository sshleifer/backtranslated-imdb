I have a problem with the movie snobs who believe that Americans are unconscious semi-literate, unable to appreciate the subtlety of the more sophisticated Europeans, Les Francais, lesson Italian ... just about someone from le continually to whom English is a foreign language. If the humor in "My Father the Hero" is different from that of "Mon Pere ce heros", it is because the French sense of humor is different from that of the American. Not better, not "smarter", just different. If you think it's a bit for Hollywood to borrow from the French cinema, just consider how much the French cinema borrowed from Hollywood in the first place. Where would Belmondo and Delon be without Bogart? Truffaut without Hitchcock? Jerry Lewis - not known for his subtle and cerebral style is idol in France. Go figures ........ Monsieur Depardieu is exceptionally good as the unfortunate divorced father of an early 14-year-old daughter on holiday in the Bahamas. Unknown to him, she offers him to the other people at the hotel as her lover, so she makes more interesting for a boy she has her eye on. Not surprisingly comes complications. "Hommages" were added to "Green Card" and "Cyrano de Bergerac" was added amusingly, and M.Depardieu goes very well - of course. He does a good Maurice Chevaler impression with "Thank you for little girls," which is actually funny and tough when she hears. Everyone believes that he is the best of a 14-year-old girl, stands up and leaves two - two, while he is moving away, fortunately unaware of what is happening. Turning at the end of the song to recognize the expected applause, the expression on his face is invaluable. Without him the movie would be very average. With its large instant graphics that dominate the screen, it's great fun. No pecs, no six packs - just a real human kind. Moldable!
