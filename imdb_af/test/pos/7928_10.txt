(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> Russia in the 13th century. The opening shot shows the relics of the last invasion: murky uniforms, human skulls and a horse's skeleton. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) chased away the Swedish army and impressed the Mongol ruler to such an extent that he intends to promote him to the rank of captain. But Nevsky replies, "die in your homeland, but don't leave it". He plans to fish, build and trade ships. But he warns of a more dangerous enemy: closer, mean and no possibility to buy himself out: Germany. Their goal is Novgorod. They have already reached Pskov: Mothers and daughters suffer from their fathers and sons. The devastating workforce spreads the raffle. Rich traders want to buy their freedom (always a place for some anti-capitalist p.). But the "ordinary people" are ready to fight. They want to be Alexander as their leader. Pskov is burned on the ground. The Teutonic Knights feel invincible and have only a smile for Russian women who are helplessly watching their fathers and sons slaughtered. Babies are thrown into the fire while high dignitaries of the church are watching and remaining idle. In Novgorod: Olga Danilovna has two admirers: rich and brave Gavrilo and long and sorry Vasili. She promises to marry the bravest. Vasili calls Alexander Nevsky in Perejaslav. The prince decides not to wait for the attack, but to strike immediately. Even women are sitting on a chain armor ... The intruders want to attract the "Russian bear," but Nevsky's stratagem is testing: Peipus Lake is his war zone. His men know the area, but the Germans, who are heavier, will break through the ice ... <br /> <br /> Open your eyes and watch the impressive battle scenes ever filmed. It's not just the multiple extras (but I think in this patriotic exercise), but Eisenstein's masterful management of such a large number of individuals: he divides sections like pieces on a chessboard and almost every shot looks like the composition of " a painting by Rembrandt or Rubens (including horses in fantasy devices). Russia in winter looks intimidating in itself, but Eisenstein's visual imagination is hors concours. Dogs of bodies are immersed in cosmic light under an endless horizon. In the evening, Olga and other women search for survivors with torches. A popular hawk sits on his master's dead body while a crow is waiting for the right moment to pull out the old one. Eisenstein's direction and Prokofiev's score make ALEXANDER NEVSKY the "Rolls Royce" among propaganda films. Nevsky is of course Stalin's alter ego, and the Russians are tall, beautiful, heroic, and they have a perfect hairstyle. The Germans have beard joints and look like members of the Ku-Klux Clan. The actor who plays Vasili gives a one-man four-character show: first waving, then heroic, youthful lover and comic relief. Cherkasov's main duty is to look heroic. In the end, Nevsky-Stalin shows his generosity: He forgives the "little soldiers" and exchanges the knights for soap. Only a beard killer and a traitorous clergy are being transferred to the gang. He does not forget a final warning: Whoever comes with the sword will die by the sword. He kept his promise. 10/10
