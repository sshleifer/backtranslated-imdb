Certainly, there seems to be only about 17 minutes of real content in each episode, but it's definitely fun to watch. You can crumble in your chair, as a friend sticks his foot in his mouth, shot or shake and shake your head as a ridiculous line. The panel of hosts has more of a good, friendly (dare I Canadian) style of commentary compared to American American reality programming. I think the people complaining about this show are not joking. They take the shoulder more seriously than the show takes. Keys for the VIP are a great caricature of reality programs, sports TV culture and the club zone. I hope they do another season, and I'll be interested to see if a US version appears. It's definitely a fun, original premise.
