As this movie unfolds, you begin to feel the confrontation of human existence. With your questions, inner wars, unresolved puzzles about the meaning of life, you will feel this movie with every piece of your body. Charles Darwin begins a war with a completely predictable ending. War with God. His theories look like the fact that God has nothing to do with man. He has nothing to do with the wonderful world we live in. Savage, hard, ironic and chaotic, these words surround the thought of the character cast into a universe of material truth, slowly pushing hope for God out of his mind. Nevertheless, the film as Charles Darwin still sees and looks beyond God in the universe of infinite Evolution.
