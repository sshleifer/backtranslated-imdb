As a non-harassment I will not comment on the great men's theory that changed the world 150 years ago. Safe to say, science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind faith. Nuff then said. <br /> <br /> The movie was produced by the BBC, and to be honest, it can be shown fairly easily on television. While the play is excellent, the movie itself is not really worth getting a full blown cinema release. That said, if it reaches such a wider audience, then it is. But I saw a lot of time-acting plays on BBC TV and they were good at the final standard of this. Just don't drive too much of a big tension team if you see it. <br /> <br /> In some ways, I apologize to the movie almost exhausted on a limb for religious fundamentalists. Although this gives a good sense of tension, I couldn't help getting the publication of The Origin of Species much faster than it actually did (you'll just wait until the end). And it was much more than I was ever aware of Darwin's struggle with himself and his wife, Emma, ​​who almost depicted him as a kind of insane, sometimes uncomfortable. There are many other errors and facts that are missing regarding the real story of the origin of the publication, but the whole assumption of the movie focuses almost entirely on the difficulty with which Darwin locally confronts the book and a small part on the death of his beloved daughter Annie. This gives the film its most moving scene, where Annie walks away while she asks for a final time to hear Darwin, telling her the story of a captive orangutan who died of pneumonia. Though, you'll probably feel a bigger connection with the primate in that scene than with Darwin's daughter. <br /> <br /> Early controversy, which apparently surrounds the US movie, will work well to promote it and ensure that many more people will see it. But to be honest, there is very little in it that insults any mythical deity. She has scarce news about a theory that has been around for 150 years. But, if fundamental Christians (and many other religions we are all aware of) like a poster or two, where possible, move, I think this movie is such a good excuse than any. Personally, I can't see what all the fuss is about. But maybe they're just getting around ...
