Considering Flight and the Clown Bagatelles as performed by Bill Irwin is the funniest (both in terms of physical comedy and verbal and visual gags) performances I've ever seen. My dad signed this special band when it was only broadcast in the 80's and my family has loved it since then. We call this reasonably constant. It is a crying shame that copies are not readily available for purchase. A few years ago I had a bad VHS copy that I bought from a specialist distributor, but Irwin's performance deserves a proper DVD treatment with a restored version of the original performance and interviews with the artists and producers, as well as more examples of modern clowning. <br /> <br /> Bill Irwin's talent earns more exposure to mainstream audiences than he enjoyed in his limited-release release. I share "Odd of Flight" with friends very often and even though I am always greeted with a small amount of skepticism when I mention that it is a mixture of clowning and vaudeville. I still have someone to see to see it without loving it. If the forces ever appearing on this IMDb list are considering abandoning this and other Bill Irwin jobs.
