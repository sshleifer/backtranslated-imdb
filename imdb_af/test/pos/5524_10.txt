The work title was "Don't Spank Baby". <br /> <br /> Wayne Crawford became a successful producer, films like Valley Girl, Night of the Comet and others, although he wasn't moderate in this little Gem. And little-known Abe Zwick had to get a lot of work from this movie, but didn't. Filmed at Moberly Studios in Hollywood Florida, at the same time, the early Tarzan movies were filmed. This movie is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract. The movie was originally shot with a little nudity and many more graphic treasures. For reasons known only to Tom Casey, the director, the bloody parachutes were given a sheet of LSD, and the nudity was removed. Although this version is worthy of those who are so inclined, the original version would have packed me according to the original version to make it on the Slot Classic 70's Classic Classic.
