I totally disagree with the person who first commented on this movie. For me, this storyline deals with a man with growth hormone disorder who tries his best to look for the love he desires. He met his best to fit into society, which didn't seem to him. <br /> <br /> He then met someone who treated him with the best friend's love and showed the way to receive the love he always wanted. the man who created all that happiness in return, got something important from the giant, which is the love of family and spouse. <br /> <br /> And the comedy, it's just part of laughing at the audience on some part of the audience. the performances. <br /> <br /> And I have to admit it has torn me a little.
