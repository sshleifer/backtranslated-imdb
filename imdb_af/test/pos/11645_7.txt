Before I see this movie, I suggest that the viewer get equal treatment and consideration as the perpetrator who portrayed the victims of the crimes. There are many films about crime victims. This one is about the killer. <br /> <br /> "Dead Man Walking" finds realism in the simplicity of the story: there are no cracking attorneys who will save William Poncelet and no dramatic twists and turns. The film doesn't try to put it in a good light; He is guilty, he is indignant, is a racist and was responsible for the horrific murders. Given all this, we are asked to do something very difficult: look at him as a man in spite of his crimes. In this way, the film doubted the idea that the death penalty offered "justice". Whether you're for or against the death penalty, the film questions whether the perpetrators can find redemption, inequality in the justice system and the appropriateness of the death penalty. <br /> <br /> Great performances by Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. In particular, the last moments of the film show the true depth of Penn's ability.
