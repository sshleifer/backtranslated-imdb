It's a fine, understated film and Rip Torn, known as him, is a seriously underrated actor. I read Howard Frank Mosher's novel many years ago. How well Craven captures the book and the beauty of Vermont's northeastern kingdom! I had the good fortune to grow up in VT in the 40's and 50's and still lived there when the "Irasburg Incident" took place. I didn't see _Stranger in the Kingdom, the incident Craven / Mosher (and another Mosher novel), but this movie inspired me to find it.
