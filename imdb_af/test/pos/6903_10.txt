(Note: I sold the dead at the Glasgow International Film Festival on January 20, 2009.) I sell the dead is a jet black horror comedy that was late in the Middle Ages, and star Dominic Monaghan (Lost, Lord of the Rings ) Ron Pearlman (Hellboy), Larry Fessenden (Session 9) and Angus Scrimm (Phantasm). <br /> <br /> The film is opened with the tomb of Willie Grimes (Fessenden), who is still indignant and inexorable, being dragged to the guillotine. and executed. His apprentice and burglar Arthur Blake (Monaghan) is locked in the tower in anticipation of his turn when Father Duffy (Perlman), a whiskey-swilling priest with an unhealthy interest in the occult, visits him with the apparent intention of recording Blake's final confession. However, it soon becomes clear that Duffy's main interest lies in the more ... other worldly side of Blake's exploits. Most of the plot from here is told in flashback form, as Monaghan Duffy fixes with stories of his macabre career. <br /> <br /> Initially, Grimes and Blake start out as simple, clever crunchy snatchers, serving the horrible dr Quint (Scrimm), a reckless, corrupt anatomist who uses extortion as a lever over our two anti-heroes, takes a rather unhealthy pleasure in his work. The two have their first walk in with the undead, if one night they send Quint them on a mission to a dark moonlight to locate a corpse that is mysterious at a crossroads, according to some ancient customs. But there is something else about this body. This one is wrapped in garlic cloves ... and buried with a stick through his heart ... After a terrifying encounter, they not only design a plan to free themselves from the twilight doctor hijackings, but they also expose a mysterious subculture of occultists who will pay good money for bodies, and even better for living species of the undead. This leads our fearless duo into the hidden underworld of the "ghoul hunt" trade, where they are not only in vampires, monsters and zombies (and another paranormal entity for which I will not spoil the surprise), but also competitive ghoul hunters the form of the innate and murderous Murphy clan. <br /> <br /> I went into the Sale of the Dead who expect a low key, slightly distracting, low budget holder. I wasn't prepared for the incredible imagination, giddy humor, quality acting, great dialogue, thick atmosphere and mere personality that made me sell Death a strong early contender for my horror movie of the year. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a few rough sides, the production values ​​are really great for such a low budget movie. It seems to have been made for about $ 20m, and I was surprised when the director told the audience that it was significantly less than half of it (though he didn't want to give exact figures because the film was still sold to distributors) ). The "look" and tone of the movie is somewhere a visual booklet between Tim Burton and Hammer Horror, with clever Little Creepshow-esquire artwork inserts. The plot is wonderfully surreal, but the idea of ​​a hidden underworld running parallel to everyday life, but what the general population is unable or unwilling to believe is one that really makes a good sense within the context. of the movie. /> <br /> The acting, as you expect from this cast, is moreover. The characters are washed out surprisingly well, especially Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their crisp lines with just the right amount of deadly tongue in the cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic. Angus Scrimm also plays in a somewhat short but memorable role as the gently threatening, violin-playing anatomy Doctor Quinn in a good performance. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - I loved it. It's been a long time since I was so entertained by a movie. I struggle to find anything bad to say about it. Mark my words, it is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will discover and fall in love 20, 30, 40 years under the line.
