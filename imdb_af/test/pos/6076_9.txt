Was curious to know the name of the Tuscan town where the filming in Italy was done. I know the villa's name: Villa San Girolamo, would like to know the exact location in Tuscany. The cinematography is excellent and it would be great to visit that area. I would also be interested to know the location of the desert shooting. Travel largely in Europe and Africa and would be interested in visiting the areas around which the book and film are based. Please email me with any information on the sites anyone may have. We will be very grateful. And if anyone knows if the Tuscany villa is still habitable, it would be great too. I am waiting for any information and I thank you in advance for your time.
