In Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, the owner of a cigarette factory Louis Mahé (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is engaged by correspondence with Julie Roussel and does not know her. When July arrives in the island to marry Louis, he waits for her in the docks, but Louis does not recognize July in the passenger boat and finds that she is completely different from the photo she sent to Louis. They marry and Louis shares her bank accounts with her. When Julie's sister wrote a letter to Louis asking her sister to write to her, Louis discovered that the woman was not Missing July. He also finds that the woman has cleared his bank accounts and left the island. Louis and Julie's sister hire an efficient private detective Comolli (Michel Bouquet) and Louis travel to France in search of the woman, but he has a nerve collapse in Nice and is filed with an intense sleep therapy in a clinic. He recovers and finds that the woman, actually Marion Vergano (Catherine Deneuve), works in the Phoenix Club Private in Antibes and lives in the low-budget Monorail Hotel. Louis breaks in her room and when she arrives from the club, she tells her she was happy with him, but her former dangerous lover, Richard, was squeezing her. Louis is still in love with Marion and escapes with her to the countryside. But Comolli is chasing Marion in France, accused of killing Julie. <br /> <br /> "La Sirène du Mississipi" is a film noir by the great director / writer François Truffaut, with an unconventional love story of passion, murder and love that hurts. The femme fatale Catherine Deneuve is amazing, probably in the top of her beauty and is beautiful to see her face and the topless scenes on the road and in the room. Jean-Paul Belmondo is very athletic, and the sequence of escalating the hotel wall is impressive. Catherine Deneuve makes this film worthwhile and gives credibility to Louis' passion and lust. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Sereia do Mississipi" ("The Mississippi Mermaid")
