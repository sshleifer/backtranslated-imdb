Lost is one of the most amazing and exciting experiences I have ever seen. It's not just coincidence, but every time you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a whole new direction. <br /> <br /> For example, take these casualties, the US marine, which Sayid gives way to become a torture, is Clancy Brown, who plays a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he plays Kelvin Inman, the Desmond partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh? Yes, right! <br /> <br /> I think we should all wait to see what is next in the life of the miracles in that strange island, in the middle of nowhere. Know that many of my favorite characters, Desmond, Sayid and Mr Eko, have an unclear destination. <br /> <br /> I believe with 24 and The Shield, it's one of the best TV shows ever, of course. , keep Twin Peaks in a special place.
