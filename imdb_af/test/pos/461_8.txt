Many literate, intelligent drama about a group of international travelers held virtual prisoners in Hungary in 1956 by invading the Russian Communist regime. Kerr and Robards play lovers, she is a British baroness, he is a Hungarian freedom fighter she tries to do a little for his country. Other New York theater stars of the time Anne Jackson & E G Marshall play an American couple traveling with their two young boys, including Ronny Howard in his screen debut. Jackson's character is extremely pregnant and not anxious to give birth in a soon communist country; She gives a passionate plea in the third act of this film that endures the naturalistic plays we got today from Redgrave, Fonda & Streep. Lead the suit Soviet wolves are Yul Brynner, beautiful as commandant and on his sexiest since playing the opposite Kerr in "The King and I". He is mean and nasty and terribly confronted by his attraction to the beautiful, patriarchal and heroic Kerr. This is one of the great transitions of the last part of the Golden Era or American film. Do not miss it.
