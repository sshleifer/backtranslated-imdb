You know, before I saw this movie, I had little sympathy for those caught in criminal cases. I mean if they were arrested and charged, "they should have been guilty" I reasoned? <br /> <br /> I formed this opinion in a few years. You see a good friend of mine, once working as a detective in some of the more sober areas of Sydney. He regularly complained that his policing efforts were wasted due to 'bleeding heart' lawyers and magistrates. He'll pick up the villains in the morning and they'll be back on the street by noon. It took his toll ... they carried him. He stopped. <br /> <br /> Since then, he has argued, not unreasonably, I thought creative evidence came together, to find the bad things they should be ... well ... "acceptable". <br /> <br /> My arguments about the rights of innocent people He said, "What are the chances that you will ever be arrested and charged with a serious crime?" He would argue. And because he was a legal citizen, the weight of his argument convinced me that he was right. Of me or any of my family or friends who are charged with murder or a serious offense, was zero for anyone I thought. <br /> <br /> Hmmmmm. As mentioned earlier, this wonderfully enlightening documentary sees everything changing. <br /> <br /> I'll send him a copy.
