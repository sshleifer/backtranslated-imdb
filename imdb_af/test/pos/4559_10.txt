Chris Farley and David Spade only three movies ("Coneheads", "Tommy Boy" and "Black Sheep"), but it was really the "Citizen Kane" of their events. Farley plays Thomas Callahan III, the alienated heir to a car parts company. His father, Big Tom (Brian Dennehy), generously offers Richard Hayden (David Spade) to look at him. Big Tom marries a "ten" (Upper Derek), so everything must be fine. After Big Tom suddenly dies, Tommy and Richard must try to sell a half-car to save the bankruptcy company. From then on, the film is a great excuse for Chris Farley to do what he does best: make a mess of everything. <br /> <br /> When this movie first appeared in the theaters, I saw it with my grandfather. He found out early that the Upper Derek and Rob Lowe characters were hiding something. But you can completely ignore it and simply promise Chris Farley's antics. Nothing is safe about his stomach, and hell has no anger as his happy attitude. The scene where he set the cars on fire, and later the deer scene, made a pure laugh. Chris Farley and David Spade were truly John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd of their era. It is a pleasure to always think of "Fat in a little coat".
