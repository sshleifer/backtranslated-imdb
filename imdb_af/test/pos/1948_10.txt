This movie is so 1980s and that's what I love so much. It is an excellent task to convey the feeling of that strange decade. The reality that Russian nukes can erase you at any time. Reagan in the White House tells everyone that things were good while more and more social programs were cut. Young people fell out, but not as far as their parents did in the 1960s. Young people still went to school, they just smelled so much that their sensitivity was dead. Nothing they did, even the death of one of their classmates in the hands of one of their friends. How strange it is to realize that the murder was wrong, but you're not sure why. Looking at the characters dealing with the crime is fascinating and tells of a very sick society. Glover is wonderful, Keanu is wonderful, Hopper is incredible. One of the most memorable movies I've ever seen.
