A fascinating piece of documentary documents about a husband and wife and their marriage told the eyes of their son. We all want our parents to live happy lives, that their marriages were full of fulfillment, love, and happy memories. Unfortunately, many of us know that this is not the case with their own families and that of their parents. This wonderful little documentary is told by the camera lens and emotional perspective of the son of a family who have just experienced the death of their mother. The boy who is a documentary filmmaker has filmed his older family for many years, as he says "offspring". Three months after the death of his mother, his father remarried his long-time secretary. The confusion of this incident stunned the family and pushed the boy into the lives of his mother and father in the past. What he reveals is a fascinating look at the lives of two ordinary people who would like to have married so many of their generations, and have caught up in family life. They found them just had to make. A woman who at times found bitter loneliness and unbelief and a man who buried himself in his work. She and intellectually heartily, he is a much simpler individual who finds most of his pleasure in the silence of his work. Of course they are wrong for each other, so much is clear. Yet they put it out, for what? Well, it's part of the mystery, sometimes they show love for one another, if it's not always a lot of love. You won't find really shocking revelations here, except on both sides of infidelity, which is in good stead that makes it such a jewel. You really feel that it can be your own parents if circumstances are different and indeed one of the lives of your own parents.
