My friends and I came together in one house to watch it on Friday night before going to the bar. It was the only program we ever missed out on opening hours. This is one of the best comedies I've ever watched if it wasn't the best. David Jason was brilliant and was often compared to Buster Keaton with his cleverly stunted stunts. I wish I could get the series on DVD to watch again. He had a wonderful ability to make dumb things credible and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions. He is a completed "Trip and Fall guy" and I remember remembering how a trailer once saw people showing people how to do it professionally. Surely he is the one who teaches this art to people. He just saw it in other programs he did. Pshaw, this program shows how multi-talented he is. I was lost on why David Jason refused another series because it was one of the best things he ever did and I was a fan of it since he did this series. It is said that he did not like it, as it testified to his early career. Well, it might have been the right decision when he took it, but now his career has progressed so far. I believe it would be a good time for him to do a series that makes him look back at his "secret life" full of blunders he doesn't see. Rod
