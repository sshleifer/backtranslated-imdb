Talking about competition features at the Split Film Festival, we have titles from around the world. China, Korea, Canada, the US and Australia and many of these stories indicate that the world is actually a valley of tears. Modern love ... that's for sure. <br /> <br /> In that movie by Alex Frayne, two younger married people and their sons travel from town to the coast to visit the man's uncle's grave and house that has raised him long ago and died in death has. mysterious circumstances. The coastal town looks like something in an American horror movie where the town is bizarre and people are unusual mutants. But episodes in Alex Frayne's pastorella cannot normally be described as abomination. In fact, it is a very interesting drama where we see relationships and horror through flashbacks and more. In this story and of course the psychological facets of the actors, we are shown that the film is a spectacular eccentric Australian film. So is the case of Frayne. Always something new and fresh. Visual intelligence and unique sensitivity of some Australian directors are amazingly good. Frayne's movie is great. There is something in the Australian landscape that shows their movies as special as we see in FRAYNE's modern love and in Law Law films Lantana and Jindabyne. <br /> <br /> It seems like it's going to be in the future titles of Alex Frayne.
