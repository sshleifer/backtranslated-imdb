I decided to extend my review for my favorite movie. Unlike other war films that focus on the event, Apocalypse Now takes the viewer into a psychological main journey. The mere surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, but you can't hide your eyes from it. Based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse New, his main character, Willard (Martin Sheen) in madness, probably descends the same way Kurtz plunged into madness. The production of this film is notorious for its delays caused by the monsoon season and for Brando's unprepared performance (he reads his lines of tickets). There is a documentary title Apocalypse Now: A movie maker apocalypse who shows hell has all gone to do it. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is one of the best known and most popular in any movie. As the knife of the helicopters is heard in slow motion and napalm dropped in the trees, the song "The End" can be heard at the Doors. The next shot is Willard in his bed with the fan on, so the sound of the helicopter coincides with the fan. We are informed that he is doing special missions for the army, mostly murder. When his next mission is given to him, he is amazed. "To load a man with murder here is like giving a speed ticket in the Indy 500." The man he had to kill was a respected colonel who went mad and isolated himself with the people of tribes. Kurtz spends horrific acts performed by these people and he must stop me. However, Willard does not go alone. He is carried on a boat with several soldiers and they come across various battles. Along the way they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore "Hoorah" about the war. Willard thinks if Kilgore is so crazy, what can Kurtz be. There are many scenes depicting Willards, bumping into the madness: the tiger attack, the battle of innocent Vietnames, the incessant rain, the stuffed dead bodies spread and the deaths of his crew. When he reaches the Kurtz connection, he is greeted by the townspeople and a hippie photo journalist (Dennis Hopper). Instead of killing Kurtz right away, Willard starts talking to him and begins to doubt his conscience about what to do. Kurtz wants to die on the other hand. He is tired of the war and wants to go as a soldier. Willard kills him with a machete while in harmony, a buffalo being sacrificed by many people. As soon as they realize their leader is murdered, instead of killing Willard, they take him as their new king. Willard rejects the offer and leaves them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography here is absolutely breathtaking. The colors are grain-free, something that is rare in older movies. I can watch it mute and admire the beauty of the scenery. <br /> <br /> The acting ensemble is great, with everyone playing well. Many criticize Brando for some reason, but I think he is hiding his role as a depressed insane who is defeated by the war. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack and the score haunt and give the mood for the movie. I wonder what instrument they used in that guitar-like sound when the credits roll? There are many parodies of this movie, but my favorite quote comes from Marge Simpson when she explains to Homer. A character of the same name on a police show is like an idiot: "Your character offers comic relief for the show, like Um, Marlon Brando in the Apocalypse." Those who saw the movie know why it's hilarious.
