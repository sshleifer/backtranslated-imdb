Surprisingly good "average streets" type of crime drama. Predict elements of "Goodfellas" and "Casino". Joe Pesci's first major role. Smart dialogue. I think the Maltin guide gives it a bomb rating. I can only guess nobody really bothered to see it. <br /> <br /> Seeing it at Tarantino's film festival, he said Scorsese had used some of these actors in Raging Bull.
