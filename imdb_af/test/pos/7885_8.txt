New Yorkers simultaneously with this movie will remember how reflective of its time it is and how well-cast and crew captured America, New York City of that era. <br /> <br /> Norman Wexler's writing defines the different worlds the different subgroups live in and Avildsen's direction brings phenomenal appearances everywhere. Peter Boyle's wonderful talent is displayed as never before or since. Obviously this is the best character representation ever reached by Dennis Patrick. <br /> <br /> What I always remember from JOE is the fact that I came out of the theater in a virtual state. To know that the screen depicted is under the surface of neighborhoods in the five stages of New York City. <br /> <br /> This movie should be remembered.
