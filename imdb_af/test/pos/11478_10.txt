Despite its ultra-low budget, "Sorte Nula" is the most successful Portuguese film of 2004. And I have to say, a well-deserved success. What I love for "Black Nula" most are the intricate details that Fernando Fragata has gone to make you interested in what's going on and what will happen next. It is very detailed and excellently advanced for a seemingly simple love story-stray thriller. What is even more pleasant and ironic about it is that the characters are in the same situation. Neither of them knows the whole story and is left to their own assumptions and makes Sorte Nula a cut above the rest. It's definitely not a movie you want to go out for a bathroom break, as you'll definitely miss something important. I feel that one of the most important features of the film is the environment it determines. It's creepy but hilarious at the same time. I read somebody who quoted this movie by saying, "... it was like watching Hitchcock ..." and I couldn't agree anymore !! I like movies like that, all of which you need to pay attention to fully understand what's going on. 9/10
