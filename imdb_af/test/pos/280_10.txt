At the beginning of this film, which I watched in the early hours of IFC, I was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort. The feeling of being caught up with no way to escape was so powerful that I didn't know if I wanted to continue. Although it didn't seem to me to be much of a choice, it was so compelling. . <br /> <br /> However, the feeling of discomfort has gradually diminished (although it has never completely disappeared), and I felt in Tessa & Bobby's preaching and really only hope that they can return together. <br /> <br /> Just a moving, powerful story fits into a small package. I had no idea that Sarah Polley had anything to do with it until she experienced her trivia, so now I love it even more. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend it. ... If you're lucky to catch it one day on the Independent Film Channel, or enough to find another way to see it.
