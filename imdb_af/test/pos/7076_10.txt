After renting out one real thing the other night, I learned to respect my family and not take their health for granted. I have never seen such a real version of a cancer victim on the screen as Meryl did. She deserves the Oscar nomination, but she has some tough rivals in the run. All I can say is a beautiful movie, large of Streep and Zellwegger. Meryl Streep reveals her true ability in this great movie!
