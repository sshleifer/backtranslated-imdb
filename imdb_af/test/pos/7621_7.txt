I'm not sure if these other people have seen the movie - some could not follow the "complicated plot". He's a billionaire who owns an oil company that also happens with great game hunting - wow - it's really far-fetched. Anyway - his new "drilling machine" happens by breaking a glacier and on the other hand, a world is separated from our own time where dinosaurs and cavemen wander. Nothing breaks this, but it's certainly not ridiculous. Anyway, the rest of the movie is about this T-Rex they find (what the billionaire, Boone, claims to be there), is hunting and hunting. Look, it's a guy made for TV movie. Of course, the special effects look cheesy - they didn't have CG - they did the best they could and for a MFTVM they did a lot of work for the time. This movie has to be made for the big screen again. I'd love it and I'll be the first one. Since Dinosaur with today's special effects will hit the guys, it'll be fine!
