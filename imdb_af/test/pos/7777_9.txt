It is a pity that this movie no longer played in theaters. It's a rich, textured love story with credible, all-human characters that are too busy to play and protect their hearts to recognize the real thing when they experience it. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this movie is the institution in Chicago, among hip, artistic, literate, middle-class Americans who discuss poetry, music and literature. Another is his Royal Fineness, Larenz Tate - and if you're even a half fan of her, you should see this movie! His boyish excitement and vulnerability are perfect for Darius' role. Nia Long also shines like Nina, who longs to tell Darius that she loves him, but is afraid of breaking "the rules." A great movie to look at your couch on the couch.
