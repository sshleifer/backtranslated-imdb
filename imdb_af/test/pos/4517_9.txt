Amazing, stunned, brilliant, wonderful. These are the four adjectives that stand in my mind when I begin to describe "The Kite Runner". Khaled Hosseini's book adaptation has already captured many thoughts, and it is rumored that he himself broke out in tears after watching the prime minister. I have to say before I even start reading the book before I saw the advanced performance of "The Kite Runner". So, my judgment and view may be slightly biased. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that although I think the book was better than the final product of the movie, it's not bad at all. I mean for a two-hour movie, it has the earnings response. Things seem a bit quick in the last twenty minutes, but apart from that, it has succeeded in doing the book. It caught the mind and imagination of millions around the world. The magic woven by Khaled Hosseini gives us a sense of repentance of joy, of sadness, of pain, of loyalty, is clever in this adaptation. Especially in the very first scene, when young Hassan says, "If you tell me to eat dirty, I'll. But I know you won't ask me." Such a touch line, intends to capture the hearts of many. The two young actors were brilliant, absolutely fantastic. Especially the boy who played the innocent but loyal Hassan, a boy, who refuses to give up a kite, he caught because he promised his best friend that he would bring it to him, just to abuse him. become by big bulls that beat him and used him sexually, and then punished by his best friend as a coward. The whole act is so touched that it cannot water your eyes. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is well placed, except the last piece. The point when Amir learns about his true relationship with Hassan, reads Hassan's first and lastly not to him, when he breaks in tears, feels helpless, lonely and repentant, who has rushed a bit and felt that Amir was behind him. facade was. In the book, Khaled Hosseini assigned about 10-12 pages to describe Amir's state of mind in that position. But he made it in the penultimate segment of the movie, when Amir stood before his commanding father-in-law, Hassan's son, his cousin, Sohrab. The end was well deserved and I'm sure will be appreciated. It felt that the torch was being transmitted from one generation to another. <br /> <br /> Get over to the technical aspects. First, the acting. Just one word-wonderful. From start to finish, young Hassan and Amir, their father, his friend, Rahim Khan. Everyone is excellent, especially young Hassan. Secondly, the direction was wonderful, along with some brilliant camera work. The background score was also impressive. From the outset, the credit card came to an end, and I especially loved being Amir in the mosque in Pakistan, the western and Islamic mergers, which were made extra special. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's definitely one of the better movies, and it's a welcome break from all the Iran-inspired movies we drive all year round. 9/10 !!!
