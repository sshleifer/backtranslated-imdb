Definitely a "must see" for all film noir fans. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a fine script and a sharp, razor-sharp direction, a top throw comes together and works like a well-oiled clock to produce a crackerjack psychological thriller. . <br /> <br /> Wonderful characterization articulates the film's powerful message of racial and religious tolerance. It is difficult and almost unfair to challenge any particular achievement because there is no bad link throughout the company, but Robert Ryan, as the hateful and violent, white supremacist, is really on the back. <br /> <br /> Making this movie in the 1940s would have been very courageous. Now, over the years, at a time when contemporary movies are dominated by a ridiculous abundance of dirty language, bare breasts, crumbling and deafening soundtracks, it is refreshing to return to the basics of quality filmmaking with reading like "Crossfire". <br /> <br /> Another low budget jewel from the Hollywood archives.
