It's funny how time went by and never saw this movie ... until last week when I was like a game. I saw it twice in a week and it wasn't enough yet. This is a good movie and I would love to see it again. The story is wonderful and it really moved me. I would like to live such a story. The actors are great, the music too and you can dream about your own love story. I just hope that someday I will have the opportunity to learn dance like Johnny and Baby. I feel like dancing people and bring them together. I think people should learn to dance ... it helps a lot, especially in a relationship. It's great to feel the dance in your blood and in your body.
