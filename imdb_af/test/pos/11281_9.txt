God cuts himself with a straight razor, after which he gives mother mother earth, which then gives birth to the gods, son of the earth. <br /> <br /> It's a one-and-a-half-hour movie depicting a dark version of how God made the world. Its surreal, dark and poetic. The most important aspect of the movie for me is the footage. She shot in a very grainy black and white film, using both slow motion and normal blasting. Sometimes even fast movie and stop-motion. The scenes are long and thrown out, placing a very strange mood. No sounds were recorded during filming (I don't think), the sound effects were then added, such as troughs, water and other surrounding sounds repeated over and over. As you may understand, this movie is definitely not for the impatient person. <br /> <br /> I often felt that it was similar to David Lynch's Eraserhead, but this one is even harder to understand and even pulled out, but it's good for me, I like that kind things. It's definitely not entertaining (at least not the Hollywood type), so if you are going to watch it, I suggest you set it up. Be open minded, and besides something like the end of 2001: a space odyssey.
