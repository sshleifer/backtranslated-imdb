In a critical scene, such as Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) lying in the Swimmers Cave, she writes something out loud by Hana (Juliette Binoche), stating that "the light has gone out and I am writing the darkness ... "A sentence of such a poetic beauty can no longer be perfect for the spectacular glory of the far-reaching English patient. With such a dramatic sweep that holds one firmly on their feet, and a strength over the film that doesn't come up, this film proudly celebrates the secrets and romance of World War II, with elements of Casablanca and Lawrence Of Arabia together with some independence in the form of Tuscany. <br /> <br /> The English Patient draws the heartbeat unashamedly and takes us through a mysterious first act, a romantic second act and a beautiful ... beautiful final act, and it is not. wonderful fitting and setting, it is the show by Ralph Fiennes, who keeps us sympathetic, even though Count Almásy is a very unlikely character from the start. Usually regarded as a villain, he shows contaminated but ultimately human colors as a man through a desperate love he has to fulfill. Many will criticize this film, based on the so-called "glorification of adulterers", but those who know nothing. The contrasts between the two periods (before and after the plane crash seen at the beginning) are spectacular, as the patient is the righteous man who is suffering from what he has done, the evil that was once in him was absent, while the man of Before the accident is an individual like anyone else. He wants this woman, but he can't have her, Fiennes brings the human traits from Almásy in some way absolutely NO other actor. There couldn't have been a better actor for the job. <br /> <br /> So, if you take this comment to heart, watch the film, those who call it "boring" or "contemptuous", know nothing and should be ashamed of such a one-dimensional view on the movie, a view that they have not studied or corrected, and probably do not intend to rectify. The English Patient is the best of every film ever won by the Best Picture Oscar, and for so many reasons hidden in their poetic triumphs.
