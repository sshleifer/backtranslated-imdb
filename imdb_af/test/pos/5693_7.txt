While on holiday in Northern Australia, Gracie (Diana Glenn), her husband Adam (Andy Rodoreda) and her younger sister Lee (Maeve Dermody) decide to take the Blackwater Barry tour in the marsh for fishing. Their guide Jim (Ben Oxenbould) uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote spot. When they stop, they are attacked by a large crocodile that snaps their boat and immediately kills Jim. The three survivors climb a tree and when they realize that help will never come to save them, they decide to find a way out of their sheltered place. In the muddy water, however, their boat is overturned and the crocodile stole the trio under water. <br /> <br /> "Black Water" is a tense, realistic and dramatic low-budget movie and in line with the early warning, based on a real event. The acting of the unknown Princess Glenn, Maeve Dermody and Andy Rodoreda is also credible with this simple but terrible story. There are many similarities between this movie and "Prey", but in different environments. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo Profundo" ("Deep Fear")
