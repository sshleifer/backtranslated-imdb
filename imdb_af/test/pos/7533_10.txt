"Nagisa no Shindobaddo" or "Like Grains of Sand" is an incredibly beautiful story about teens and girls dealing with the condition of becoming one with whom they are. This movie is not about homosexuality, but it's about sexuality. <br /> <br /> A married girl, Aihara, will definitely make the viewers think about what is behind the real girl. Does she love Yoshida? Or does she love Ito? Or did she somehow become a lesbian because of the "incident"? (I doubt it). <br /> <br /> And what about Yoshida? Does he realize he loves it eventually? Well, we all know he loves him as a friend. But you will never know when you see this movie ... haha ​​:) In the end, Aihara (with Ito) delivers an exceptional message to the audience: what is it, no matter if you are a boy or love girl. And I have to tell you, I'm so dense that I didn't even get it. ^^ ;; This is because of the not-talking scenes. You must try to understand what the characters think and say through their actions and NOT what they say (especially the last part ... well, boy, it was confusing!) This is a confusing story, but it is beautiful. :) This movie is definitely one of the best Japanese movies I've ever seen (and trust me, I've seen enough).
