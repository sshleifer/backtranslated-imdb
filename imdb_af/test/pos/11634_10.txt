Yes, barney is nonsense, but when I was a child, it made perfect sense. <br /> <br /> I didn't get any smarter, but I enjoyed it. As a child I was mocked because no one could say my name, I changed it. Since I was 4, I went to the name Tina of Barney because I could tell she was from another culture. I'm now 17 and barney is a big part of my life. ... my name came out ... I can't be the show I grew up no matter how stupid it looks. <br /> <br /> I don't care if I'm blocked, I have nothing more to say. they should not make the minimum of 10 lines because some people do not have much to say. OK done
