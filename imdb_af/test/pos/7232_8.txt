Once, Troma, the company that brought our cinema classics such as: The Toxic Avenger, Rabid Grannies, Poultrygeist, Redneck Zombies and Surf Nazis Must Die, decided long ago to adapt Shakespeare's famous play, Romeo and Juliet. This adaptation decided to beautify the story by adding kinky sex, extreme violence, genital samples, body opening and incest. It has created a bizarre but hilarious film. Anyone who goes into a Troma production should know what to expect, and it is irregular and perverted comedy with many political inaccuracies. Expect numerous buttons for other Troma movies and lots of reused gags (flip cars and head squashing). Many may think it sounds like a fool that only moros would be funny ... they might be right, but at the same time they might be relieved and enjoy the madness and thoughts that Tromeo and Juliet are. <Br /> <br /> With a big role, a funny script (by James Gunn and Lloyd Kaufman), an appropriate soundtrack and very good visual gags, Kaufman has managed to turn what is right upside down and to take the hell out. everyone. Get some popcorn, grab a beer, invite your friends and enjoy Tromeo and Juliet for what it is, a Shakespeare with many balls. The end. <br /> <br /> 4/5
