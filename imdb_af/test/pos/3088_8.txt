Having seen this movie, I find it hard to understand why so many people hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs to the top 250 of all time, but in his genre it's a good movie. I know not many people find it amusing to see a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' in a comedy. Many people still believe that some things shouldn't be laughter ... they're wrong. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks did an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights. I also saw the original Robin Hood movies, but I've never had such a good time watching them as I did with this one. It's just a continuation of hilarious moments and parodies of famous people and movies (Winston Churchil, The Godfather ...). <br /> <br /> I recommend to anyone who wants a good laugh to watch this movie. For those who think Robin Hood should not be wasted, you are wrong, but you should not look better because you will probably be offended. I give this movie an 8/10.
