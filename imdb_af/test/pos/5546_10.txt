It's a romantic comedy, so it's really a fairy tale, but an unconventional one. Cinderella, rather than living in the ashes, lives in a covered castle in the suburbs with a beautiful man who is not a prince. She finds her prince, but he is not so beautiful. Instead of a castle, at least initially, she gets a little bit in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> Pfeifer, Stockwell and Ruehl lead a full-fledged cast as a bit above the characters. <br /> <br /> Demme reaches the highest level of movies in my mind. He creates a world I want to enter - a Manhattan neighborhood and a street life with life and community. <br /> <br /> I wish IMDb linked to reviewers' other comments. I would like to know what other movies the people who embraced this one hate. I am always looking for lots of laughter and for nice places to live at least an hour or so.
