Many of us who went through high school probably did it well without taking a physics course - I know I didn't. But after watching this program, I definitely wanted me to. <br /> <br /> This documentary is a guide to the "Holy Grail of Physics" - striving to unite all the fundamental forces of the universe into one "master equation" that Einstein has during the last years of his life disrupted. Brian Green, a professor at Columbia University, presents us in this mind in a wonderfully simple way and gives us a greater appreciation for the universe in which we live. <br /> <br /> We start with the tempting possibility of a 'master comparison' that can unite and explain everything ... * everything! * In this universe, including the four fundamental forces we know exist: electromagnetism, strong nuclear power, poor nuclear power and gravity. Green takes us on a tour on how our understanding of the universe came to light with the work of Newton, then Einstein, and later on the revolution of physics on the quantum plane. <br /> <br /> But it is at this point that we are experiencing a problem that has been bothering physicists for years, and one that no one has solved yet. How can we unite all these forces that we know together? We find, as Green constantly reflects on the whole problem, that the answer to this confusing problem can be in the strict theory. However, if we have to describe the universe in terms of string theory, there is a huge price to pay. <br /> <br /> It appears that mathematical equations of string theory from the mind, which, as a result, we find that we may be filled in a universe, not just 3 dimensions you and I see every day plus 1 (for time), but rather that we can actually live in a universe of * 11 *. dimensions. But the mathematics arising from that theory does not stop there - the possibility exists that there may be parallel universes; some of them right next to you and me! Can we possibly take such a theory that has serious consequences? As Green points out; we have not yet fully invented, but we do know that the mathematics that came from these equations already show us that the universe still shows us a lot. <br /> <br /> For those who fear you won't understand the concepts in this program - don't be afraid. Professor Green does a wonderful job of doing away with the maths and harder concepts of physics and rather focusing on the * concept * - which, if you take away all the maths from a monstrous animal to an incredibly simple and transform, as Green constantly points out, 'elegant' concept. Viewers of this program need no previous background in science; the concepts are so simple even a child can understand it. <br /> <br /> When you complete this program, you will truly understand what a wonderful and mysterious universe we live in.
