This is another classic Seagal movie. He walks, no, cross through the patriot just all the other Mega Seagal movies. Nothing even comes close to the challenging Seagal in this movie, except perhaps the part where he has to get a cure for this so-called "plague" and he starts throwing things over the lab, but it all works out, I mean, she Master Seagal, he must win. What about his outfit in the movie, masterpiece, he had chosen himself. It's great that everyone in the movie dies after being exposed to the virus, but Seagal doesn't even get a cough. The incident at the end when he killed the thick man with the broken glass, genius, I bet Seagal also thinks of that one. This movie is pure and simple. great plot, great characters, and Seagal.
