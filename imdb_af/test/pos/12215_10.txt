Someone asked why it was canceled. I tell you why Because "reality" is making money. The display area was canceled so that they could replace it with a "reality" view. It will haunt NBC, I and about half of my high school. About 1,000 people have pledged to boycott NBC until they bring this performance back. in my area (I don't know from other places), but they had a good thing with the Sci-Fi channel where the Sci-Fi channel will show the last week episode at 7:00 and then NBC show the week's new episode. At 8:00 am, it was wonderful because it gave you some refreshment about what happened in the last episode. I was so angry when I learned that the show was canceled and they were just going to church!
