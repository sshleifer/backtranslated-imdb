It is clear that Ponyo can be seen as just not another stupid, animated film that a studio can do to survive. It's far from it and it can easily be described as a fascinating, beautiful movie experience. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Miyazaki has another masterpiece. Now, for many, it is said that the least of his achievements in making movies, because of some of his "certain strange factor" is not there. It is true. The moral and insights that are not quite as clear in his previous films are very much in the picture. Ponyo is not too difficult to understand or understand. His idea, I believe, was to make a children's film just as suitable for adults as their children, and not to be too complicated. He reached it perfectly, and he also did not lose a substance along the way, which is why it gets a 10. <br /> <br /> In addition, the movie itself is so annoying from the start, and the way it is presented is so beautiful. It sometimes upset me because I remembered how they all were signed by Miyazaki himself. I was not so relieved and happy after watching a movie, as I watched for a while (another movie not to be missed). Everything about Ponyo was absolutely stunning and breathtaking; even the music for it was pure perfection. The only bad thing to say about this was the English dubbing. Don't get me wrong, they were also good, but I saw Ponyo about 2 weeks before it came out nationally, and I believed in some parts that it would have liked some of his Japanese dialogue (not not everyone, however, also enjoyed the "English way". All in all, everyone should see Ponyo; it is absolutely flawless and in another league of movie-making completely. Lastly, and don't mind me, but I won't be surprised if Ponyo got a Best Picture nomination because there are now 10 movies that can be nominated for it. It's just as well.
