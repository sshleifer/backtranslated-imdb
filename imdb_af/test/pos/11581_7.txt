I think it's quite an achievement to be able to offer a true tail to an audience for an impaired man; a tail in which the protagonist will spend most of the film on his back, in a bed and cannot move completely. And yet the performance in the movie's effectiveness is a dramatic piece; as a reminder of a true story and I think as an argument why people should have the right to die if they wish. But the film is not a political statement and perhaps it is happily away from too many scenes of debate, although it includes one for the sake of argument. More so, it is one of those strange language films that portray his main character as a cripple, who can do nothing but talk to the people around him and yet be so enchanting and compelling anyway. <br /> <br /> As opposed to being an out-out argument, the movie is more a sweet but timely dramatic piece about another person who wants something or is looking for something; The only difference is that by achieving this "goal" it means ending one's life and it will be achieved by not physically going anywhere. Javier Bardem plays real life Galician Ramón Sampedro, an individual who dived at a very early age to clean water that was too low for such activities. It laid him down for the rest of his life and his desire to die is the focus of the film by Chilean director Alejandro Amenábar. We've seen so many movies in our lives where characters have certain 'goals' or targets that we need to meet before the movie is over to provide a satisfying audience experience, but the change in fit in The Sea Inside is soft; It does not involve young, energetic, attractive heroes who go to far away places, but a real person to something so much to them. <br /> <br /> Even if you have strong policies, pro or anti-euthanasia, you may find yourself hoping to get Ramón what he wants at the end of it all anyway. The film sets its toes up very early, with Ramón giving a speech on why he wants to die to look after family members, instantly introduce the situation and be subject to the watching audience who may not know what the film is about. Interestingly, some family members are "anti" that he wants, which can put any member of the audience who feels strong about the subject in their respective shoes. But the purpose of this setup is to tell the audience: No, it's not one man to something that the whole family supports his entire family to the end. Quite easily, the film could have gone a route in which it is the Sampedro family, to everyone else, but some are anti-Ramón's idea. some are too young to admit what is really going on and others are apparently too confused to even have an opinion other than what they just want Ramón to hold a little longer. They love him. <br /> <br /> The Sea Inside is a story of a sacrifice of all kinds. Ramón is a quadriplegic and it is his perspective where we see things. This is something that irreconcilable viewers can be or the movie can look like it's strange. We are presented with a film from the perspective of a victim rather than an author or a main character in a movie that always causes the cause and effect of driving. But this is not a criticism and it is a credit to the director for delivering such an approach in the effective way it is. The film asks questions; It offers a scenario to his audience. If you were in Ramón's position: what would you do, or think or dream or talk? Consequently, dreams about attorney Juila (Rueda) are not shot so much for the audience's pleasure, as they are such a small window in one man's escaping fantasy from his trouble. <br /> <br /> Julia's study deteriorates somewhat later as she begins to share some similarities with Ramón, and that is when she starts with strokes resulting from her own illness. This feature looks timely in the progress of their relationship and adds a further component of relationship to an already interesting friendship. This is because Julia feels the physical pain and limitation, not in the sense that she can't stand up and walk, but I think she realizes the value of life given how emotionally bad she previously felt. While the film is based on a true story and covers the subject of euthanasia, it feels more like a drama on Earth about a man in a situation where he is willing to fight for what he wants, but must do it verbally. Watching movies like The Sea Inside is refreshing as it not only refers to history and gives us insight into it, but as a stand-alone movie, it delivers on an emotional and engaging level.
