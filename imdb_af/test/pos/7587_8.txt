Having seen this briefly on VHS tape with the Summer Stock feature, I just regrouped on the TCM website every Sunday. It was the film debut of 15-year-old Deanna Durbin and 14-year-old Judy Garland outside her two older sisters. These two teens show their musical talents with a solo by Deanna of Il Bacio, then one of Judy of "Waltz with a Swing" for the two climax with "Americana". The light plot of this 11-minute movie relates to the possible unemployment of Edna's (Durbin's real first name, as addressed here). Grandpa's management work at the park due to low attendance. With the help of the two girls, you can probably guess what's happening there! Contrast is not only marked with Garland and Durbin's musical choices, but also with their height, poise and movement. In spite of everything, they did very well in the end and it is almost surprising that MGM Garland chose while Durbin was already contracted at Universal. This card was made, but was briefly allowed to return since its three-year-old feature debut. preparation of stages. Judy himself would make her first feature (Varkskerm Parade) at the 20th Century Fox, as MGM decided which movie would be his next star. It would be Broadway Melody of 1938, where she would perform the show number: "Dear Mr. Gable. You made me love you". But back to this brief, every Sunday offers a warm and wonderful look at two star singers at the start of their legendary careers unaware of what the future holds for them ...
