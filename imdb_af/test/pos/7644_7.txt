I watched this movie on HBO and I had a good time. <br /> <br /> The director did a good job. I absorbed myself completely in this movie as soon as it started. Norman Reedus' performance is cool. I expect more cold movies to come from him. <br /> <br /> I was so absorbed that I sometimes wanted to grab Norman's gun and shoot that snake girl. Hehe. I like the movies when innocent girls with the men play tricks with tricks. The end was what I wanted :) <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with moments of change. You expect it, but something else happens. <br /> <br /> Initially, those massive images were cutting eyes very painfully. <br /> <br /> Although not shown when Norman Reedus changed currency notes? Or do I stand in the fridge. :)
