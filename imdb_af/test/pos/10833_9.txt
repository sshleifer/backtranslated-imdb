Giant Robot was the most popular Japanese TV series ever seen on Indian TV. It was aimed at children and for the first time we saw a robot in our lives. <br /> <br /> Many Indian children have even seen a machine outside school textbooks for the first time. <br /> <br /> The series also showed a child in an adult organization that fights evil. Undoubtedly, many of us who have seen Giant Robot in our childhood desire our own robots and, as a stop-over, look at our computers the same way. <br /> <br /> This show also portrayed ideal adults (referring to Jerry, Johnny's girlfriend and Unicorn chief Azuma). We have grown to respect Japanese progress and still regard Japan as the ideal Asian nation. <br /> <br /> At that time, there were no satellite TV channels in India and the broadcaster didn't show much of Disney cartoons. . I think that was how children's series like giant robot appreciated. Nowadays there are Pokemon etc, but they are not as fascinating or enticing as Giant robot.
