The Stooges are back and harder than ever. "Brideless Groom" was, in my opinion, probably the best Shemp movie. <br /> <br /> Shemp had the opportunity to inherit from his uncle $ 500,000 (probably more than a million dollars compared to today). BUT! There is a catch. He must marry someone today at 6am. Shemp is a bachelor with not too many admirers, except for a high aggressive, annoying singing student of his. But he doesn't want her, he wants someone a little more on the Victoria's Secret model kind of women. But of course he has no choice as he is not Collin Ferrel himself. But if it is printed in the newspapers that he must inherit all that money if he is married, his ex girlfriends are on the "I want my husband back" attack! <br /> <br /> What a great stooge flick! It is there with the winners of all stooge flicks! <br /> <br /> 9/10
