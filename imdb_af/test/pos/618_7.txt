The first half of the movie has scared me out of hell and I'm usually not easy to scare, but the second half of this excitement didn't work very well, but still very scary! A good thriller, rather than using simple ways to make good horror. Low budget, which is unfamiliar with Russia, and made in Europe. but still nice, and yes, there are also some laughs for good business!
