This is a nice little movie about a man (Peter Coyote) who is experiencing the perfect suburban middle-class life when police suddenly fell into the house late at night and murdered a man 27 years ago . <br /> <br /> In his prison cell, Coyote tells his wife about the fatal events of 27 years ago and how he came into contact with Wayne Kennedy with the man he allegedly killed. <br /> <br /> From here the story is told. in flashback fashion and the more you learn about Wayne and Coyote and how they met and what happened when they were interested in the lake, you get. <br /> <br /> The play is not something to rave, although the man playing Wayne Kennedy is pretty scary enough. The real strong point of the movie is the mystery of what actually happened on the mountain. The woman spends the movie digging clues to the mystery and every time something new comes, we are treated with another flashback that reveals more of the riddle. This is pretty good. <br /> <br /> As far as Lifetime TV movies are concerned, this little movie is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
