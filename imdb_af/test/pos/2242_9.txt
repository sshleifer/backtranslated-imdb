Well, so there was the odd hole in the plot, you could go through a zeppelin, but how good were the emotional things dealt with? It would have been so easy to go down in cheese, but the writer pulled it off. The image of the ex female cyber man who makes crying sounds as she / she has seen her reflection after regaining her emotions is one that will stay with me forever. It's been two times that the samples have been soft-edged and briefly sympathetic, the former being the last Dalek of series one, but by Jove it worked. Add to that the other female woman who was upgraded on the eve of her wedding, and Jackie Tyler recognizes her husband after she became "cyber" and you have a permanent throat lump. Keep it up!
