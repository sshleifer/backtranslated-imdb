This episode from Buffy was one of my personal favorites. Also number three of Joss's personal favorites too. The episode had very little dialogue and despite the fact that the good people at the Emmys decided it deserved a nomination. Unfortunately, it didn't win. When Hush first appeared, it received about 6 million viewers, which was the highest season of the season. It should tell you something. Although there was very little talk, it managed to persuade people to vote. The guy characters (who played my mime) were some of the frightening creatures that the show produced (or any network TV show I've seen). Nothing is creepier, then a lot of silver-bound men come to you with a skull while you smile away. I think that, despite the lack of dialogue, the actors did a fantastic job on the episode.
