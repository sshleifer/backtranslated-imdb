It was such a funny movie that was soon forgotten, probably because there are so many teenage and young adult comedies. The movie is not as predictable as you would think. Crawl is an unattractive but fun and caring and more importantly a very dedicated friend. Still, an unlikely match for Rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly friendly boyfriend at home. If he helps to feel more comfortable at school, showing her the environment and encouraging her to socialize more, they become friends, but they are completely platonic. When she realizes her boyfriend can imagine, she doesn't feel right, she seems to love her boyfriend, but she looks as if she enjoys her beloved life at college, not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility . You have a good idea to learn what a good friend Crawl is, if he tells her he will help her get married. When her boyfriend suggests her for the whole family, she kicks Crawl and puts it on the spot. He told the whole family he was suggesting to her, and gave her his diamond ring, which stands out, she was all the time (he had to come from money or something. Well, they never saw a close-up of the ring not). The message of the movie was not to condemn people according to their appearance and not to judge people before getting to know him. Rebecca's boyfriend, who loves her parents, has made him drink his new girlfriend after Rebecca (Amber Thesan) and Crawl, so Rebecca broke with Crawl. They thought they were a few. Although they were not, Rebekah was angry with him, which, if you think of it, was dishonest, as they were not a few, but I think they started holding each other. And I think she thought there was more. The movie never showed they were actually a couple, they left it open to the viewers to decide. They never even kissed, although there was one part they almost did. It was one thing that most viewers misunderstood. Many people saw it and said it would be a nightmare for fathers to bring their daughters home or a shock, but they were just friends all the time, even to the end. And she didn't imagine him as her boyfriend; They never told her parents they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did. Even if he never became her boyfriend, they could still have been friends. In the nineties, some reason was five-man men, and there was this great stereotype that the woman of feminine men had (not that there was anything wrong), thought it came from the fact that women like the type-sensitive type, crawl seems to be through his friendship with Rebecca. but when I watch the movie, I must admit, if I look, I thought I'd go for the first boyfriend. Yet it was a creative movie that tried to teach a lesson about friendship and others.
