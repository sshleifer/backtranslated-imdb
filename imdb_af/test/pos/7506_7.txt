PLOT SPOILERS !!!! Dr Boch (George C. Scott) is head of medicine at a large NYC hospital. He left his wife, his children denied him, he was incompetent, drinking a lot and thinking about suicide. There is also a killer moving around in the hospital. Then he meets VERY strange Barbara (Princess Rigg) and falls in love. She wants him to run away with her - but can he completely stop his old life and start a new one? <br /> <br /> Very strange movie with an Oscar winner from Paddy Chayefsky. It offers a suicide main character and shows us a hospital full of overworked nurses and incompetent doctors. It manages (somehow) to make it really funny. It's not loud humor - it's VERY black humor. Also the play is right on target - Scott is just big (and Oscar nominated) here. You see him trying to keep his common sense in a totally crazy situation. Riggs character is more than a little strange, but her way of working works and she is also incredibly beautiful. The writing is strong and brutal - but never too much. I think it falls to the end of the ball with a situation going over, but it's still worth seeing. If done very seriously, it would probably be impossible to take. Also look for Katherine Helmond in a little bit and Stockard Channing and Christopher Guest in unredited bits. I personally had problems taking it seriously. From what I heard hospitals, it was bad back in the 1970s, but not anymore. See it for the acting and essay. I give it a 7.
