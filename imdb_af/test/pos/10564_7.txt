I'm not quite sure why I ordered Fingersmith from Netflix - probably because I enjoy BBC dramas, it was on a list of recommendations. I didn't know what I was planning to see. The plot I will only generally describe, to not spoil it for anyone who will see it after I have seen my review, has more twists and turns than a mountain road in the Rockies, of the kind that is usually " caper "occur. movies. They are very unusual in a period drama. I didn't read the novel (and I'm not going to do it). I was completely unprepared for the surprise that the first segment on the DVD ended and equally surprised by the subsequent turn and turn. Nevertheless, it is maintained by the two young principals extremely well (especially by Sally Hawkins, such as Sue and Elaine Cassidy as Maud) and starring supporting roles by Imelda Staunton as the mother figure in a house of thieves and by Charles Dance as the rich uncle collecting pornographic material and saving young Maud from the mad house where her mother was his secretary. The lesbian relationship between Maud and Sue is the "big news" in the movie, but not really its hub. The centerpiece is a plot to steal the fortune Maud has to pay on her 21st birthday. The twists and turns in the plot add tension, though not much credibility, to the movie. No viewer will probably doubt that Maud and Sue will somehow come together - unlikely - as the credits role. Although one is raised as an ady, and serves as a collector of pornography, and the other is a bag that serves as a woman's girl, the author obviously means that they will eventually live together. It is a bit difficult to swallow, as everyone conspired to cheat the others. Despite these discussions, I liked the movie well enough. It does not deserve the praise of others. The most terrifying and interesting plays take place in the madhouse where one of the two young women is confined to being able to escape and return to London to bring the story to its unexpected conclusion. Sally Hawkins (Sue) is a very impressive young actress who can convey her character's cascading and changing emotions with her facial expressions and eyes. No doubt we will see more of her. I certainly hope so.
