All the comments so far about this movie are negative, but I have to say I found The Net. Few movies can keep me on the edge of my seat, but one did it. Another plus is that most action / tense movies are full of language, but this one has little profanity. I found this to be a nice movie to watch. However, I'm a little biased, a great Sandra Bullock fan. * Wink *
