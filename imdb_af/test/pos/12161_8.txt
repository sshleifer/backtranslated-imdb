Britain and France declared war on Germany in 1939, but then almost all of Europe fell under the leadership of the Nazi war machine. Britain began almost the beginning of the war, with scarce supplies and with an air force hit ten to one by Germany. But the will of the British was firm, supplemented by their new prime minister, Winston Churchill, who stated, "We will never go". On August 8, 1940, the Battle of Britain was underway. But for the first time since Hitler's declared position to conquer the world, he hit a wall. Although the British Royal Air Force surpassed it, the eight-day offensive climbed in September and October 1940 in September. German lugwaffe victims climbed to two thousand three hundred and seventy-five lost planes and crew. Hitler's anger was busy, but he had to elicit a short time. Responding later in the year, Hitler launched a massive fire bomb attack on London on Christmas Day 1940. When I said that there was never a disaster movie to oppose the real live footage of London in flames, this assault would be an understatement. Perhaps the most surreal effect of this chapter in the "Why We Fight" series is that British citizens from their underground shelters will come to the bombings to resume what remains of their lives above ground. Even if you look at it, there's no way to understand the living abomination that these people had to go through, as the city of London was left in virtual ruin. <br /> <br /> But the Nazis were stunned and stunned. Everything that Hitler wanted to believe in freedom and democracy is now on. Instead of being weak and smug like the French, the British will not give up without a fight. And the battle they did, taking the air fight to Germany and responding in kind with attacks on the German homeland. It was a turning point and forced Hitler to reconsider his strategy.
