The mourning and almost unbearable melancholy of Amalia Rodriques' music goes to a place in the soul that can only stir music. In her voice and magical presence lies the beautiful pain of the Fado, an art form that I was unaware of seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> For me, the success of this beautiful and lovingly crafted documentary is the fact that the filmmaker resists the temptation to edit and simply enables us in the magnetism and elegant passion of this icon to share. There is an inevitable corruption between the Portuguese Fado and American Blues. <br /> <br /> Documentary film entertainment at its best transports us to a previously unknown reality. and after we get this look, we are transformed. <br /> <br /> Abrigado, Sr.de Almeida
