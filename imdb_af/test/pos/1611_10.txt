Is the sea side resorting to the sad, arid places they are always portrayed as in films and novels? Certainly, this movie, along with the contemporary Do Not Look Now, shows Venice as a particularly crooked and decadent tourist trap. For a more light approach, see Just Married with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy. If I have never been to Venice, I cannot be sure, but it is a perfect place for this bleak but striking spectacle of Luchino Visconti, one of the great stylists of world cinema. After watching the movie I now wish for, I got the Thomas Mann novella, it's based on (which also inspired an opera by Sir Benjamin Britten). Since I don't know the back story and the movie has little in the way of plot or explanation, I'm still wonderful about Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde) obsession with young Tadzio. Is he a homosexual? A pedophile? Or is his desire for the beautiful youth a little more innocent? Maybe Tadzio reminds him what he could have been and knows he'll never be. Those who complain about the slow pace of this movie should be clashing and kung-fu: at 2 hours and 15 minutes it is not very long, and it moves at a quiet but barely slow pace. The film benefits from the surprising music of Gustave Mahler, on which Aschenbach's character is clearly based. Dirk Bogarde gives a moving performance, and the film is characterized by the presence of Silvana Mangano, one of Italy's beautiful beauty, like Tadzio's mother.
