I haven't seen this fine movie in 50 years, but I'm still commenting on it anyway. <br /> <br /> While JACK WEBB's movie was undoubtedly meant to be an entertainment --- which provided Marine basic training at Parris Island in realistic terms as a tough character building exercise - it was said the army was afraid the movie would discourage recruitment. It didn't work like that. The movie showed that the entry of the Marines was a bigger challenge than most young people had ever realized, and (guess what?) Is a huge challenge, exactly what many guys wanted. I personally got many guys who joined the signals shortly after the DI. Lines at recruitment centers were suddenly so long, the Marines had more recruits than they could handle. <br /> <br /> That's how it goes. America will always have the youth who want to make themselves the best - while the slackers and born losers do not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> What we do NOT have in 2007 is any movie that inspires patriotism, commitment to any kind of service, positive values, and so on. What we do have are films that inspire the airbags to be headers, the beer drinkers to taste beer, other negative values. Exhibit # 1 is that the airhead teen travesty and beer guzzling epic SUPERBAD is now # 81 in the All Time Great Movies list. Values? What do values ​​mean?
