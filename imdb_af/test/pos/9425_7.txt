It's a good late night movie! What I mean by that is that I really enjoyed my $ 3.00 VHS copy (now I have a $ 6.99 DVD copy!) Many nights just before bedtime or when I have insomnia. There's just something about this movie that makes it easy to look in repeated views. It could be the fun that Basil Rathbone has in 'The Secret Weapon', which carries various disguise that deceives bad guys and Holmes's assistant Nigel Bruce (Watson) but not the housekeeper (Mary Gordon). It can be the spying, code cracking and WW II theme. It may even be the light touch that the director uses to deal with the imminent situations, while Holmes finds himself moving the story. Whatever, "secret weapon" is merely a pleasant and pleasant detective story that takes us back to a time when the Nazis are seeking world domination and this with the comrade's bonus between Watson and Holmes. Whether you agree with the patriotic speeches and noble "save the world" themes of this movie or not (I think they are right!), I find that they just add to the taste and fun of this fine old adventure movie that stops repeated views. I rate it a pleasant 83/100 points.
