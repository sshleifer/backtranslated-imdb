What is often overlooked in Agatha Christie's stories is her progressive, anti-conservative attitude on a number of issues - from the role of women to the impact of tradition on people's belief in the supernatural. In "Nemesis" you can see many of those sub-texts - but you can also find a good old-fashioned intriguing puzzle that keeps you in the dark for the most part. Also the lifting of "Nemesis" over other series entries ("They do it with mirrors", "4:50 From Paddington", etc.) Is the fact that you can really feel in the critical moments before and after the revelation of the killer the tension. And finally, Jane Booker is welcome to protect my body anytime. (***)
