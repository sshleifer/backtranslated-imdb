I like this movie. Unlike other thrillers, you know the killers very well. You also learn the two detectives they hunt. The killers are two high school children. They are very intelligent and want to prove that they are smarter than the police, so they plan the "perfect crime". We all know that this crime will not come out perfectly. What we do not know is whether they are caught, or maybe just one of them, or even not. Somehow I was hoping they'd both get away with it, though I didn't know if it was the movie's intention. <br /> <br /> The story is told in a good way. You get to know the people involved. The character of Sandra Bullock is nice, but has her own secret that works against her. Ben Chaplin is pretty good as Sam and the two kids are both good. The scenes between them are the better scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think you can say the movie is pretty good and not as predictable as you would think. For a fun night out with a movie, 'Murder by Numbers' is a good one.
