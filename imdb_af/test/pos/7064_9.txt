Meatballs have been a big hit in my family for over 26 years! We saw this movie when it came out for the first time and have seen dozens of times since. Bill Murray is at its best and is the best in the scenes where he reaches out to a lonely pre-teen boy and befriends him while leading his CITs at once to a rogue scheme! The role-play of characters is fun and many, and you really care about them and the relationships they have with each other. It's not another scary, stupid, teen sex festival. It's funny and sweet and just about all fun. Anyone who sees it will enjoy themselves. This is a must-see. Watch out for Spaz - he is by far the best character! (Especially during the camp socially - while Bill Murray shoots it for the camera - just look at Spaz behind him, dance with the poor girl he chooses to dance with!) By far one of my favorite comedies of all time!
