Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett. <br /> <br /> Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, it looks like a forgotten movie. It seems rather ironic to me, because it's actually one of the first movies I remember. My mom took me and my little brother to see this movie at The Garland Theater in Spokane when it only came out in the mid-1970s and I still remember it. <br /> <br /> I'm reminded here, but I believe this move is about a staircase accused of a crime he didn't commit and the law goes to him. I believe it should be Alaska in the 1800s. A narrator tells the story of the staircase played by Mike Mazurki. Really, it's a very good movie with a good environment. This can be compared to the 1981 movie Death Hunt with Charles Bronson. The two films have a very similar story line. The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult-oriented movie while Challenge is a family-friendly movie. <br /> <br /> Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both quite old when this movie was made, which I find impressive if one thinks this movie is filmed in the Alaska wildlife. It was the last film that Tay Garnett made before he died, just a few years later. They were both since the silent era.
