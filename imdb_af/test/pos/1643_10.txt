Wow! It is difficult to add my feelings to this episode in words. Ice is one of the best episodes of season one. This is my favorite of the season. Six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of the Arctic with an unknown organism that causes murderous aggression cannot make the drama better. Paranoia ranks highly because even Mulder and Scully have uncertainty about each other's common sense. I heard people complaining about this episode's similarities with the movie 'The Thing'. I didn't see it, so I won't know. Ice is more than just worth watching, just to see that Mulder and Scully really test their ever-evolving confidence. This episode is intense and end-to-end. You won't be disappointed!
