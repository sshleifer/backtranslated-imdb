"Pixote" is one of the most powerful, shocking, and moving movies to come from Brazil. It's about the lives of street children on the streets of Sao Paulo and Rio De Janeiro, and it's centered on a ten-year-old boy. The camera follows them in an almost documentary style, from the youthful detention center (where most staff are as corrupt as the police) and back to the streets, and it never turns away from the horrors of the city. Prostitution, drug use / trafficking, corruption and murder are all witnessed by these youths; Yet it is something they use painfully. Director Hector Babenco uses real street children as the actors, adding to the film's brutal reality. Although not for everyone, a movie I highly recommend. An emotionally devastating movie. <br /> <br />
