This era was not only the beginning of sound in cartoons, but of a cartoon character that would fall into history as the world's most famous mouse. Yes, Mickey makes his debut here, in this joyous story of life aboard a steamer. The animation is good for the time, and the plot - though a little simple - is very jolly. A real classic, and if you ever get it on video, you won't regret it.
