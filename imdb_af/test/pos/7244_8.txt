As always, Joan Hickson is wonderful like Jane M. Subtle, sharp and aware. I don't want to work on her acting as it is praised on this site. I would like to criticize some of the smaller parts as the rest of the cast was chosen by director David Tucker yesterday. <br /> <br /> Liz Fraser's performance as Mrs. Bent (the mother of the missing girl Nora) is a joy to watch. Subtle and deeply moving as the alcohol-dependent grief mother desperately loves and misses her daughter. A good long shot from her monologue (thank you Tucker!) So she can be fully enjoyed. I was moved when I first saw her when it was broadcast and I was moved again, now I have it on DVD. Brava. <br /> <br /> Joanna Hole as Madge's tour guide I find very amusing. She is on the verge of overtime, but her role can have it. She is as funny as the over-organized guide who wants to do well with everyone on the bus, I find her hilarious. Her response after pulling everyone on the bus is wonderful. As always: to perform comedy, it must be very serious. And that's what Ms Hole does. <br /> <br /> I hope the two ladies have good careers (as I live in Holland, I don't know if they have, not all theater productions can be searched ...). The shows on the screen deserve it. <br /> <br /> Pieter
