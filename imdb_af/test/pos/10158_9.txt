I've brought in a lot in the Hitchcock series lately. I always find myself one of his movies if I'm at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video. As I said before, Hollywood lost it incredibly, I need a reminder that there are great movies there. Not to mention, I want to be a movie host, not a movie buffer. Is there a better way to do this than with Alfred Hitchcock's movies? <br /> <br /> The man who knew too much is another big and exciting thriller that starred Alfred's favorite leading man, James Stuart, and the woman stealing Dorris Day show. They play husband and wife on holiday with their son, but when a spy tells James about information that another spy can arrest, his son is kidnapped and held for ransom. James just seems to doubt Dorris and her ability to get ideas on how to get their son back, but she does a good return and eventually ends the hero of the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting again, I would say that Dorris was the one who took the whole role. James did a good job, together these two made you sit and never move through the movie. I loved the little comedy at the end that Alfred added. You will see what I mean. I would always recommend this movie, despite not being the best Hitchcock movie, it's still a treasure. <br /> <br /> 9/10
