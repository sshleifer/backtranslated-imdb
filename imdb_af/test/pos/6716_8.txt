"Life Force" is a truly bizarre adaptation of the novel "The Space Vampires" by Colin Wilson, written by Dan O'Bannon & Don Jakoby. A joint US-British space exploration team makes a surprising discovery: an alien spacecraft resting in Halleys Comet, containing three entities that look like humans, one of them a female beauty (the oh-so-transient Mathilda May) . <br /> They take these discoveries aboard their own spacecraft. Big mistake. <br /> <br /> It appears that these creatures drain people's lives, and as American colonel Carlsen (an intense, edgy and dedicated Steve Railsback) and British S.A.S. Colonel Caine (a firm Peter Firth) watches in horror, an infection of vampirism overwhelmed London, with the fate of the Earth in balance. <br /> <br /> This photo is definitely not in imagination. It sometimes moves slightly, but offers so many strange and imaginative ideas and obvious footage that it's hard not to be amused. The first director Tobe Hoopers's three-photo deal with Cannon Films (he followed it with "Texas Chainsaw Massacre II" and the "Invaders of Mars" reminder) makes it something really unique. Recording elements of sci-fi, vampire movies, zombie movies, and the worldwide saga is like nothing I've seen before. <br /> <br /> Railsback and Firth are strongly supported by such strong Brit actors as Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart, Michael Gothard, Aubrey Morris and John Hallam. Mathilda May is very memorable as the staggering, mysterious villain; It certainly doesn't hurt that she performs much of her scenes in the nude. Also worth noting is a moving music party by none other than the "Pink Panther" composer Henry Mancini. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous it may be, but I also found it fun. It is flamboyant and spirit entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
