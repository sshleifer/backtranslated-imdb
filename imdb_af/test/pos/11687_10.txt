One of the biggest successes for the decline of Western Civilization, the film breaker Penelope Spheeris's intrusive breakthrough, is that it may appeal to non-punk fans on the hardcore deed. More importantly, it was caught a moment in history before the movement became completely "marketable", when bands would play (or at least try to play in some cases) in thanks, dirty clubs to an audience that had so much. self-respect if they had respect for the ties. For the fan, like me, there are precious interviews with some of the quasi-legends of LA's punk-scum, some dead, some still living and still hard-working in the scene. <br /> <br /> Performances and interviews include The Circle Jerks, X, Black Flag (in pre-Henry Rollins days), Catholic Discipline, Fear, Alice Bag Band and the most memorable (in my opinion) is the germs. While I knew of some of the ties and performances in the movie (The Jerks and Black Flag mostly), I only heard rumors about the lead singer Darby Crash and some of the footage in the movie he looks like, if not the, epitome of the punk movement. He does not take himself too seriously, he likes to drink, sometimes when he speaks, it is completely gibberish, and the attitude he brings on stage is funny and free, exciting. A performer like that will probably scare Steve Miller and Jackson Browne. <br /> <br /> Decreasing Western Civilization may not turn on any non-punk fan looking for this movie (it's hard to find on video), but it doesn't necessarily have to turn them off either. As a kind of anthropologist who had crept into the party, the Speeris found the behavior of these people, their motives, their strokes and hatred, and the power they were on and off the shade. Some of them are almost as usual, some do not, but they are just offensive to those who are not too open for things. In addition, the movie is a must-see for the kind of kids who think they are punk fans just because they listen to Good Charlotte and Blink-182: if you scoop the right scoop on the movement and genre of rock you profess to love , the pioneers have a chance.
