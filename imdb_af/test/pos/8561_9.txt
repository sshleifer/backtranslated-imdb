I agree that this movie has achieved its goals perfectly. I saw it at Showtime as a teenager late in the evening and back in college. I thought it was funny. And there are boobs everywhere! There seems to be a lot of these movies made in the late 70s and 80s, from R-rated movies such as "Porkys" to soft-core "Au Pair Girls"; It is a pity that it seems to have fallen in popularity. The thing that made HOTS great was that, like the previous two movies, it's a lot of fun. HOTS is like a maid-power version of "Animal House", with the girls forming a mastery of all kinds in campus llamas. On a lace note, everyone who designed the "Hooters" girls outfits should have seen this movie.
