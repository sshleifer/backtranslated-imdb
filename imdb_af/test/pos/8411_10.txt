I always loved "Gone With The Wind" and have seen it many times. However, his end not only left me "hanging" but depressed, with a hopeless feeling. Finally, in "Scarlett" Ripley took us to a very probable and satisfying end to the original story. <br /> <br /> It follows that someone from Scarlett's obvious intelligence (as originally written) is eventually getting big. Although, like most people, I fell in love with Scarlett in GWTW, I was tired of her constant undisputed infantilism to the point of excitement. And I was disappointed that Mitchell didn't show Scarlett with the obvious intelligence to even make an effort to grow emotionally. Fortunately, somebody finally did. (After all, it's not that turbulent immaturity that was inconsistent with her beauty and intelligence, why Rhett finally informed her?) I think Ripley did an excellent job of describing the lengthy process and Whalley-Kilmer did it excellently to portray it. Joanne WK has all the fire, exuberance and intelligent sparkle like Vivian Leigh, and she is definitely at least as if not more beautiful. <br /> <br /> There was, and will always be, one Clark. gable. However, if I had to pick an actor from the thousands that I was exposed to in his biography, it would definitely be Timothy Dalton. Dalton has the same elegant charm Gable has done, which is essential to Rhett's character. I can't imagine someone else who can come close. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were excellently cast and the only actors who could possibly have played Scarlett and Rhett. I think both of their performances made for not only the late actors, but also the spirit of their characters. <br /> <br /> I played the whole role. Julie Harris was her usual beautiful presence, and Jean Smart was a beautiful kick! Even Ashley's character was nicely played by Stephen Collins, and the progress of his relationship with Scarlett was completely credible. <br /> <br /> The story has become a little bit in Ireland, but so is life, and I still have it entertained. <br /> <br /> All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the fruits of Ripley's imagination. I wish I wrote it! <br /> <br />
