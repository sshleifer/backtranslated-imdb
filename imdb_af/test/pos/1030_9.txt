Oppenheimer was a BIG series (this was the first thing I saw Waterston) and it's too bad copies are not available. A similar situation exists for "Glory Enough for All", a British series of about the same time, about the discovery of insulin. I'll pay a good price for both of these on DVD. Is it really that hard to get Oppenheimer on a DVD that can be played in the US? Another very enjoyable series, again of about the same time, was "Danger UXB". A series on the dissolution of UneXploded Bombs, hence the name. The one you can get from your local library. <br /> <br /> Pete
