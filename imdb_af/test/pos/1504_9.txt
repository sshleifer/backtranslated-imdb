It's an interesting movie. I think it's very humorous, though the humor is very black. Fulci is good and funny to perform, it is a very funny and truly crazy "self-portrait" of an artist ("I make horror movies. If I were to make love movies, nobody would buy tickets ..."). And it's also really SEXY movie: Almost all the time there is some "action" or tension going on; and very sexy girls / women ... Perhaps this is the core of why someone starts movies / art in the first place ... This is a true psychedelic journey, perhaps the best drunk or similar state of mind. Of course, there are also many nasty gore scenes, as this is Lucio Fulci. In fact, some of the scenes are very disgusting. Anyway, this is one of the three best and most complete Fulci movies I've seen (the other is House By The Cemetery & Zombi. He's seen The Beyond.) Actually, the writing overnight, in my opinion, is pretty ingenious . You can see this movie as a portrait of an extreme neurotic, or a person suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (fashionable words): The character has a forced need to confess "crimes" or bad thoughts; He did not even do crimes in particular. And he asked himself all the time: What if I did it? What if I want to do it? Did I do this? Do I want to do this? He overreacts and exaggerates his thoughts. I'm sure Fulci is interested in psychology, and maybe even read some of the area; For example, in his "Home at the Cemetery" video, there is a character called Freudstein. This is perhaps the most concentrated and straightforward personal movie that Fulci did. I also like the simplicity of photography / pictures in this movie. The only thing that disturbs me a bit is sadism, especially to women; I don't quite understand why? Is it entertainment? Is it art? Is it horror? Anyway, overall, it's really interesting and well-made movie, definitely recommending classic movies at least for fans or anyone interested in this genre. For others, it may be too much.
