This 1955 Produce's Showcase version of the musical Peter Pan with Mary Martin has the prospect of showing most of the original Broadway films, including Kathleen Nolan and Wendy, who were, of course, an actress than the girl they did for the 1960s. -colored play hired. It is a pity that most people are no longer black and white, because in many respects this earlier production - which does not even appear in the IMDb list, when you put "Peter Pan" in the search engine! - is better than the smaller color version most people watched. I got the original on the disk and then did work to make it look digital and sound better. Now, if I put the 1960s version on it, it looks like a comparison. I suspect Mary Martin chose herself without a doubt to choose this original 1955 w / w Showcase television version. <br /> <br /> As an added plus, the disk I got was also showing the original ads and opening promotion. How far the 1950s look - such an innocent time compared to today. I miss it.
