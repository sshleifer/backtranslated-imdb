"Head" is a film that has kept good since its original release in 1968. The movie is a complete contradiction with the Monkees image. It offers the Monkeys in a way that their supporters never saw them; men with real thoughts. The Monkeys were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film makes fun on their image, the entertainment industry and corporate America. The soundtrack contains their best music. It's a movie worth seeing over and over.
