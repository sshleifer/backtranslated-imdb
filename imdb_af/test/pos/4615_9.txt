I saw and blown away at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2:37! A scene of panic opens this movie, at 14:37 in a high school in Adelaide. This scene is left unresolved as we return to the beginning of the day and are introduced to the teens ready to go to school. The audience is intimate with each of the main characters, examining the daily issues that teenagers face - including drugs, debauchery, gay, pestilence and violence. Each scene is again played by different teenagers' perspectives, and reminds of Gus Van Sant's Elephant. This is a remarkable film by Mr. Murali K. Thalluri, the first time. It is made with non-professional student actors, and works through an unprecedented 76 concepts of a script. It features beautiful performances by a number of student players, especially Teresa Palmer in the role of Melody. This comedy movie is both intimate and enticing with a surprising and disturbing end.
