I would suggest that only the Valiant is one of the most original and intriguing and in some ways strange films that Peck ever did; daring, surprising and one of his very best western (no, of course, not a western one really, but a military chronicle, sometimes better). It's pretty low? Budget, but, oh, very original and striking. It's one of those that gets a real buffalo, sometimes gets; movies no one has told you yet. You say ??? That sounds interesting or interesting? And it surpasses your expectations. <br /> <br /> All in all, the script shows a level of maturity that is unusual for westerns ?? and it reminded me somehow of ULZANA; This is also no nonsense at all. <br /> <br /> Peck looked like a young and tough, somewhat gloomy and stoic officer; and there are many unexpected attacks such as the blonde baby kissing and flirting with the one she decided not to marry, perhaps a sense of hair for justice and retribution. <br /> <br /> Even genre ?? wise, ONLY ?? is so much more than a military story ?? it's just an action drama, a suspense movie, a commando / action thriller ?? the strangest combo imaginable; a lot of soldiers in a special mission to prevent and stop a possible indigenous attack? - The crazy decision not to take all the available troops to the place where those Natives can be stopped? but just a handful of people? And this plot never takes a crapete? Like most would and did. The interest in people, people and their reasons and actions never falls off. <br /> <br /> An appropriate word about Peck himself; he plays with brio, and although I usually find his famous movies, it is unsatisfactory and boring. In such small outings I find all Peck's gloomy and even different shine. He was an unusual star. <br /> <br /> I recommend this extraordinary movie.
