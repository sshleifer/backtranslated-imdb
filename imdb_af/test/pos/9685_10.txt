This film was boundless in humor. I absolutely cannot believe these people can get away from it. Johnny Knoxville didn't cross the line ... he knocked it all out! It was better than the first ... ALL AWAY! The thing I found about the first movie was that the shenanigans were somewhat as if it were on the phone. Show. NOT THIS TIME !!! they made quite a 180 degree flip ... the whole role is so outstanding in what they do and not the stunts were crazy ... but the music basically fits every situation ... GOOD WORK !!!! If you are going to look, make sure you use the bathroom before going to the theater, keep a strong stomach in and remember not to spray your drink out of your nose.
