This movie tries to run away to the typical 'I fight because I am obliged to defend the homeland. The NAZIs are all bad guys, I'm against them '(typical of German war films). How? By not talking too much about it, and just referring to the war and the POWs. Yet I would like to see a German film that would be something between the extreme of Come and Sea and the "bad NAZI's" Das Boot. I say this because, apart from this factor, the German films are the best that portray the 2nd world war and the German side. You can easily see the German hierarchical relationships, very different from those in the US Army. <br /> <br /> It's a movie trying to get a real picture of what Stalingrad was, and I wasn't there, and I doubt most people were there, but if I was a movie would choose to depict this battle, it would certainly not be the whole American enemy at the gates. Why do I say this? Because even the best soldiers are not heroic and the circumstances see their own lives instead of the homeland. This applies to all the ranks, and ultimately you see Paul giving the example.
