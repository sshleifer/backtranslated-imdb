Soft Spoilers <br /> <br /> .... and it's 'top ten of all time.' I accidentally stumbled across 'Two Hands' (maybe it made an overall - no excitement) on the IFC, and I couldn't believe I didn't hear about it. Now that Heath Ledger is getting better known in the US, I'm sure it's more available. At the time, I told friends about the movie, and no one could find it anywhere, except the occasional IFC. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the black comedy / gangster genre, it fits well with my other favorites, and everyone in the movie really wants to end up with what they deserve. Bryan Brown is hilarious as the main gangster who makes origami with his little boy and plays scrabble with his henchmen. Also hilarious is the quick editing fate of a random car thief. Even Heath was pretty good at it. By then I reminded him vaguely of a brief series on Fox called Roar. Hopefully Gregor Jordan will make another hit, but as far as I am concerned, it's still his best.
