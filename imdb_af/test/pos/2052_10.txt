I thought it was a good action movie. A very good role for Geena Davis. She is a very versatile actress. One of my favorites next to Angelina Jolie. I actually watched The Long Kiss Goodnight at the new Tomb Raider movie. That made me think, Charlie or Lara? Which one would win in a fight ??? Anyway, both women are very strong, intelligent characters who are fun to watch. Especially when they kick shots. I just hope to see Geena soon in another movie. She seems to be out of the limelight a little too long. It will be especially nice to see her in another movie with Samuel L. Jackson. Now they make a big duo. Watch this movie if you don't. You won't be disappointed.
