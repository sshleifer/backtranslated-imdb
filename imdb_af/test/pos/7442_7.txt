This movie was definitely written only with FF VII fans. I am someone who has never played the original game and watched it with a friend who was a series fan. From a visual and technical point of view, this movie is as good as "The Spirits Within", if not better, but from a story point of view, I was pretty lost. One big plot of weakness that stood out to me was the scene where "all" of the children who died of geostigmma were brought by the three Jenovites to the healing "reunion". Everyone said there were about 15 children in everyone ... Hmmmm ... I thought this Geostigma was a disease of pandemic proportions ... I understand why they did this (time, budget, CPU) but it just looked like Cheesy after all the explanation on how the bad guys needed to collect everyone who had Jenova cells so Jenova could be reincarnated. The caption version we had (a fan sub of the internet) was a nice direct translation and therefore it probably added to my confusion. <br /> <br /> It hit my interest in FF VII, however, and I read a few hours on the FF VII wiki about the main characters and the plot. As soon as I read the Advent Children wiki, things made a lot more sense. If you are a video game or Sci-Fi fan, this movie is a good movie, but as a previous review said, it comes down to a 90-minute battle. You never know one of the characters, and apparently do not jump the story from scene to scene without much explanation, although some explanation may only be needed. Thanks for wikpedia.
