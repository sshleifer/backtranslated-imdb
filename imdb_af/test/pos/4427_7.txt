Video Vault By Shawn K. Inlow <br /> My Architect: A Boy Travel 2003 - Nathaniel Kahn Not Graded: 116minutes Vault Rating: 7 <br /> <br /> What a Father's Thing to be. "My Architect: A Boy's Journey" follows the filmmaker of Philadelphia, Nathaniel Kahn, for desperately seeking answers from his father, well-known architect Louis I. Kahn, who died this 30 years. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn died in a train station in 1974 and left more than one family. The funeral service, when the filmmaker was just a boy, we would say, an unpleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> We find that Nathaniel only knew his father and his passport from his sporadic visits with his mother, who, we are told he loved deeply. This movie is about a boy looking for his father and maybe himself by visiting his work, as if the beautiful structures are kept secret. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn was probably a gifted architect, but "architect" is a cold word. The man was a large-scale sculptor who spoke in luxury silence and art from his craft. <br /> <br /> Among its notable works, which have been lovingly explored in the film, are the Salk Institute (1965), The Kimball Art Museum (1972) and the monumental capital complex in Bangladesh (1983). The part of the movie where Nathaniel first visits Dhaka, Bangladesh, finds the job, but not the man. <br /> <br /> The movie benefits greatly from the fact that he had many photos of the very public man while working in New York City. and as professor at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania. Many of Khan's contemporaries and associates also help to find the filmmaker's ghost father. <br /> <br /> However, the viewer does not seem to be in a particularly satisfying place. The answers Nathaniel Khan is looking for are hollow. Not good enough. <br /> <br /> In scenes where the director meets with his half-sisters, both of different mothers, one can feel the tension of the years, the oblique and sore. One can expect them to burst into anger, but only the camera saves them from hostilities. Each of these children lost something visibly. <br /> <br /> It may be pointed out that Khan, who was a driven perfectionist, never got rich. Instead, he became remarkable. It was as if he had sacrificed his family for his art. This is a loving and sad thing. <br /> <br /> April 28, 2005
