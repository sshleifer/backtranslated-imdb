Read This: <br /> <br /> BOYZ THE HEAD IS A SCENE BY SCENE, FULL RIP OFF OF THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Two friends in the hood, one focuses on intellectual pursuit and the other is an athlete. The friend who is an athlete becomes involved with the wrong people and is murdered. (The athlete just happens to be Washington from 'Welcome Back, Kotter'.) <br /> <br /> It hurts me that people don't know it. It blows my mind every time I go to a video store and Boyz a Hood is in the 'Drama' section while Cooley High is in 'Comedy'. It's an embarrassment. This movie is both funnier and more dramatic than John Singleton's rip-off. Singleton would at least have had the dignity to speak that his movie was Cooley High, but no, he never said a word. However, boys 2 men called their hit record to this movie.
