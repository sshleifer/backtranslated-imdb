I didn't really concentrate on the larger genocidal aspects of the story (although the terrible images at the beginning are very strong). I was really taken with the human story of the girl and her family. Imagine you do not know your life whether you are typing a time bomb into your interior. I was really seeing Yasuko being rejected as "infected" by the bomb. The image that stays the most with me is when Yasuko stands in front of the mirror her hair combs, quietly looking out in lumps.
