Someone saw this movie as a "waste of time" because he expected the "beautiful scenery of Brazil and Portugal", but then everything looked "washed out" or bleak or something. I believe this person missed the whole part of the movie. That is the reality. The point of this movie is to show that life is not ideal, and to show what people in their lives are going through for family, love and survival. A young man leaves his trench in Sao Paolo, Brazil, to go to Portugal to his mother's homeland after her death. He discovers that everything is not free and that Brazilians are being watched by indigenous people from Portugal. He eventually finds a life, a love, but the story doesn't end as expected, and it's not a story of a fairy tale. The part I had the most was the finite song, "Zeca Bailero (Honey Baby)" by Gal Costa. It fits so well with the movie; especially the end.
