Junior high and high school teachers will find "The Cure" an excellent teaching tool, both as a company for Huckleberry Finn or as a single lesson. Although AIDS should be mainly, the strong sup-text of friendship and love, as developed between Eric and Dexter, is a powerful message for teenagers. Authors based on the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective. I also suggest a focused class discussion on how Eric develops from manipulative user to friendly friend.
