I saw the printed version on Encore. <br /> <br /> Students Paula Henning (Franka Potente, who was also in the cultural favorite "Run Lola Run"), are stars as a serious medical student who comes to a prestigious school in Germany. But she soon discovers that some students are missing out and the bodies they work in the anatomy lab are incredibly fresh ... <br /> <br /> I grabbed hold of the printed version on Encore. It hurt a lot (the words that do not match the lips really touched), but I still liked what I saw. The acting was good, it was beautifully photographed, it wasn't too horrible and I was never bored. Even more refreshing was a nice heroine who fought back when the bad guys went to her. The (soft) nudity was, in a refreshing twist, masculine! A previous poster called Benno Furmann (which is excellent) showed his buttocks, but I don't remember it. Regardless, this is a well done, scary and excellent thriller. Of all I've read, the original German version is the best (I don't doubt for one second), but the print version is viewable. I give it a 7.
