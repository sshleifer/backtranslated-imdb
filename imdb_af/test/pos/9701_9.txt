I was a big fan of the Cky videos, Jackass, and Viva La Bam for a long time. They had a good run and I expected my laugh to end. But it has not yet. This movie opened my mouth all the time. I still laugh randomly. I went to the theater with low expectations and thought it wouldn't be better than the first. Oh, how incredibly wrong I was. <br /> <br /> There were many good moments in the movie. If you are discouraged, do not like randomly placed raw humor, or if you don't like the first movie, you probably won't like it. But with that said, I almost watered my pants to laugh so hard. It had all sorts of different pranks, masochistic humor, toilet humor, puking, laughing, some great traps and massive damage to all the role players. Ryan Dunn even branded Bam's backside with a long-standing image. I'm sure you can just imagine how raw this movie is. <br /> <br /> No pain, no profit? Right? This movie has already done well, which makes theaters all over America laugh so hard, they will want it, it can take longer. I know I did it. This film didn't feel at all, especially with the credits that the footage continues. But I still wish it could last forever. Now, let's wait and see when they release Jackass Number 3! Overall, an excellent movie, if you can get past the masculine nudity and some sickly images. Keep your kids out of this movie. They do not have to see it, at least until they are older. Support the crew and buy it when it comes out on DVD! I know I will.
