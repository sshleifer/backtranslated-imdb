"Nobi" or "Fires On the Plain" is a film that is so excellent at so many levels that there are not enough good things to say about it. My only regret is that I couldn't see this 1959 film earlier. <br /> <br /> Being a filmmaker, I tend to watch movies for their artistic merit, based on dialogue, acting, photography and even efforts to stay true to costume. Ultimately, I want to know if the film is true enough to reveal the human condition to make me think without suppressing what the director wants me to think. <br /> <br /> "Fires at Level" is a wonderful movie because it fills a portrait with realistic human reactions to the dying fires of a great historical disaster. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is a condemnation of war at all levels - like any good war movie. War is terrible, bloody, destructive. It is also murderous on the psyche. However, what is fundamental about "Fires on the Plains" is its unapologetic look at Japanese soldiers. It shows that they are slowly collapsing under the weight of American fire and their nation's inability to make war. A fatalistic code that encourages death before surrender is at the heart of this madness. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see such an honest and brutal look at the bitter fruit of Japan's 14-year-old military accident. of what the Japanese call the "Great Pacific Ocean War". Ichikawa, revealing what the Germans called the "war life", the fate of the common soldier. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is interesting, as Japan today is even difficult to fully cope with its wartime fanaticism, the subjugation of conquered peoples, the racism of its war against the Chinese and war cannibalism by soldiers and officers, not only practiced against each other, but also against allied prisoners. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa produces a strong representation of the victimization of soldiers through a confluence of bad political decisions and cultural pressure. <br /> <br /> This sharp inquiry is done skillfully by portraying the doomed soldiers as people who at different times fear, brilliantly display laconic humor, enriched dialogue with his subtlety, and a plot whose complexity is denied by the desert environment. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's portrait is a dirty and painful tapestry of defeated men. The tubercular Tamura, played as a wilder and soft soul by Eiji Funakoshi, is a good soldier who cannot leave his humanity, although he is so scared and lost as his comrades. Before leaving for a hospital that will reject him as too healthy, Tamura is given a hand grenade by a superior who, as the hopelessness of their situation is recognized, commands Tamura to kill himself. <br /> <br /> Why Tamura's hopelessly ill-prescribed and military unauthorized unit is not commanded to give up at the beginning of the movie. Ichikawa makes it clear that the war is over and everyone is just waiting to die. As Tamura leaves his unity for his hopeless search for physical and spiritual salvation, he sees his comrades unnecessarily digging an airshift. They look like bodies that look up from their own mass grave. <br /> <br /> Later, we look at the overworking hospital's medical staff leaving the dying patients to a particular American artillery barrage. The pathetic patients who are eagerly trying to survive from their huts look like pathetic, serpentine creatures that draw themselves from an almighty power. You know they won't survive. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa makes it clear that the only thing worse than a defeated army is one that has lost its honor by abandoning its humanity and its comrades. As Tamura stares through Leyte's jungle, we become the noble, the dying and the exploit. Cannibalism sticks out its ugly head as soldiers start to eat each other rather than surrender to American "corned beef". <br /> <br /> When the men speak of surrender, the propaganda of how Americans kill prisoners becomes by a worldly-hosted soldier revealing that approaching Americans feed and care for prisoners of war because, unlike Japanese, Respect brave soldiers who are forced to give up. <br /> <br /> It is the Japanese who are planning to fight for the emperor long after resistance has lost all meaning. Those who are willing to fight to death will be killed. This is the war account. <br /> <br /> After shooting a murderous and cannibalist comrade, who had previously offered his own body as food, the fatalistic Tamura's careless surrender also appears to be a suicidal form of suicide. His death is a lonely image. Was Ichikawa trying to tell us about the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live, but who is still trapped by his own suicide culture codes? <br /> <br /> If someone watches the movie carefully, he or she will see that absolutism and fanaticism are the enemy. The Americans are portrayed as a technologically advanced people who are prepared to use that technology in the form of relentless military force - a lesson that transformed Japanese post-war society. Ichikawa's film is not so level that it indicates America. Ichikawa points to the sedimentary layers of Japan's destructive policies that created the war and then to continue it if everything was lost. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa does not mention the nuclear weapons falling on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. He doesn't have to. The slow destruction of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines reveals the seed of Japan's boom.
