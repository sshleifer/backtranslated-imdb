I always thought Batman Returns was a good successor to Batman. The story was an interesting one and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton performed well. Plus, we can see it, Tim Burton was a genius and made the comic book character more justice than Joel Screwmacher ever did. <br /> <br /> Plot: Oswald Cobblepot also knows if the penguin (played by Danny Devito) is left by his parents as a child to deform. He used it as an excuse to masquerade a sinister plot to kidnap Gotham's first born children using his goons (Red Triangle Gang) and a very shady magnate Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken). Max Shreck later made Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed out of a window by Max Shreck and is revived by cats. Later, she develops cat-like features and tries to destroy Max Shreck and Batman. Her reasons for destroying the dark knight are not explained. <br /> <br /> Advice: Batman Returns is a classic. It has a dark feel in terms of atmosphere. Tim Burton has always had a talent for making grim wallpapers, which looks attractive. Micheal Keaton is still sharp as Batman. Danny Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin. If you think of it, he would have made a better Violator for the movie Spawn as John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry ever could. Max Shreck is one of Christopher Walken's best roles. The main reason I like Batman Returns is that it's fun. It's not just creative, but also fun. Something very big budget movies these days are lacking. The Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton has decided not to. You don't believe me, look at Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Thanks for giving Christopher Nolan back life with Batman Begins in the series.
