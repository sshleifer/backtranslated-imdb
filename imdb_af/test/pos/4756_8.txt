A team of tough, villainous New York policemen, led by the rugged, stubborn Buddy Manucci (superbly played by the always excellent Roy Scheider), goes to a group of nasty gangs involved in a kidnapping ring after one of them hit is. Director Philip D'Antoni, "Bullet" manufacturer and "The French Connection", creates a powerful, eager, slender amoral no-nonsense tone, keeps a steady pace and shifts action scenes with significant frost roaring power. Don Ellis's thrilling wizard raises the grief-intensive intensity, while the exhausting Big Apple sites and Urs Furrer's rough grain kinematics greatly improve the overall grungy realism. In addition, the severely discriminating criminals of criminals in this picture are suddenly blurred: the titular plow uses harsh, brutal and morally questionable strong-arm tactics as a means to put an end to the enforcement of the law and there is certainly no code of honor under the thugs. and thieves populating the cunning urban abdomen depicted in this movie. Merry supporting performances by Tony Lo Bianco as worm, sniper snitch Vito Lucia the Undertaker, Richard Lynch as foul psychotic hoodlum Moon, Bill Hickman as Moon's equally cold partner Bo, Jerry Leon as funky flatfoot Mingo and Joe Spinell as parking garage attendant. An extremely wild and exciting stretched heart-in-the-throat mondo destructo car chase qualifies as a definite highlight. The climatic shootout also delivers the movable property. A real bang-up little winner.
