John Leguizamo's one-man games were hit or miss: Mambo Mouth showed his intense characterization and timing, but the material was average. Spic-o-Rama also scored the former, but this time the material was funny, Freak is a classic, followed by his disappointing sex-o-holies. But his stuff in Freak shows his genius and when he is in the spotlight he is without a counterpart. <br /> <br /> Freak's semi-autobiographical look at the journey of a young man has power and resonance. I don't think it's even creator. knew. By giving us the chance to see his soul, Mr. Leguizamo gives us the opportunity to produce our own lives on its own and there can be no bigger gift that an artist can give. The willingness to drop, expose and share the wall is too frightening for most actors. They use characters to hide behind, but JL goes with full throttle and throttles any pretext. Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor were our best cultural observers / comedians / actors because they spoke of their hearts to everything they saw in society and the truth gave slashing humor. Combine it with a good actor's gift and be in the moment (not to mention a human being) and you'll see John Leguizamo have the power to do the same. At least in Freak he does. <br /> <br /> From birth to its first big break and every life-changing moment in between, a viewer sees our host and other characters in their most private moments, experiencing all the pain, hope and humor. Looking for drained and lean muscular JL, the evening's end listened to his sweat to give an audience; Spike Lee's fluid camera work captures the actors' nuances until the last lip curl and slowly shines. The scenarios range from drinking with his machismo-fueled father (when he was 9) to seeing a Chorus Line with his gay, deaf uncle; his first friend's evil humiliation when he caresses naked, is eager to have sex. A nightmare first sexual encounter with a big German woman in the back of a Kentucky Fried Chicken follows a failed attempt to pick up a "drunk decayed Catholic" in a pub at St.Patty's Day. Climaxing in a serious uproar with his mother and father, it is here that he shows his true genius: he plays a scene between these two characters and himself and his brother with such a dramatic / humorous intensity. You forget you only see one person. There are no costume changes, bad wigs, lighting tricks, or makeup. Just an actor giving her everything. It's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> Other actors / comedians who stand out now are Eddie Izzard and Chris Rock, but they don't dive as deep as John Leguizamo. It's not a criticism, not a long shot. I love their work, but Freak is different. It moves in a no-b ******* way. It's the best one man to get out there and nobody can touch it for a long time.
