Swift's writing is really more in common with Kafka and Orwell than with fantasy adventure writers, so it's curious that Gulliver's Travels was considered a children's book. Lucky Kiddies! <br /> <br /> The same goes for this movie. There are some very horrible versions of this story, which should be why people are reluctant to look at this version. I mean, it's a TV movie and it comes from moped Jim Henson, so how do we expect anything else? <br /> <br /> Look again - beauty comes in the strangest places. Kids love this movie enough to go through it all three hours, but it also takes time to get Swift's dark vision right. I hate special effects, but here they are used to carrying the story forward instead of just shining us. Please note that producers have made the effort to recruit classical actors such as John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole who perform their eccentric roles perfectly. <br /> <br /> Dramatically, the romance between Gulliver and Glumdalclitch is touched and gripping, as well as funny (she is a girl but twenty times its size). The frame story has a theme about absent fathers that many children will meet. And the part about Gulliver in the asylum represents an element of horror in terms of power abuse (apparently derived from Val Lewton's Bedlam, 1946, another forgotten masterpiece). <br /> <br /> The VHS always turns For a few cents into the bargain, which is an insult to the very big artists who bring this thing along. I encourage audiences to recognize a good thing by getting this movie and inspiring others to see it. Although it offers a lot to offer children, adults will find it good for such classical artists as Aguirre, Brazil, 1984 and other serious fantastic works.
