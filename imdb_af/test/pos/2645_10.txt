It was such a good movie. It was done with such a beautiful design, such as symmetry. I like the way classical music is linked to the classic art of earth, space and beyond. It was such a fluid, thought-provoking masterpiece. I loved how the monoliths never changed, though primate, earth and space did. I loved how it was a question of "Do you need me / us now"? The film has expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, finesse, gentleness, courage and innocence. What can you ask for from a mere movie? Maybe a complement movie. Any Valuer of 2001: A Space Odyssey will find the movie 2010 is the complementary movie of 2001. 2010 is more story oriented than 2001.
