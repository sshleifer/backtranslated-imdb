I watched this movie a week after the death of Ichikawa Kon - I suppose if there is one way to relieve the passing of a great director, it would be a glass of wine for him while he was one of his watch best movies. Ichikawa had one of the best characters in the Japanese movie, but if he never had a distinctive style or theme, he often looks overlooked compared to his close contemporaries such as Ozu and Kurosawa (he was a little younger than them, but not much). He is one of the directors who express author theories - it is likely that his wife (who wrote the script for these and many other films) was so much responsible for the quality of the movies as he was. But at best he was as good as any Japanese movie maker at the time. In particular, he had great technical skills so he could tell complex stories in an accessible manner. But in terms of theme, this movie can hardly be simpler - war is hell. No, really, it's hell. <br /> <br /> Fire on the Level does not follow the normal war genre rules. There is no real start - we start as the miserable Tamura, who is a regular private (although it implies that he is more considerate and educated than most of the others - at one point it is shown that he understands English, but he climbs when the other asks him how he knows it) in the hospital, as his unit is already in a terrible state. The soldiers are defeated and starved to death. They are no longer an army, just a rag group of refugees - hunted by the locals and almost ignored by the Americans, who have more fish to roast. Hungry and despair drives the soldiers to the brink and beyond the madness. <br /> <br /> In typical Ichikawa style it's not all just grim - it's oddly funny in parts (a very black humor of course). /> <br /> The highlights of this movie are the outstanding performances of the lead and the vibrant photography. The characters, in their entire humanity, but also their total loss of humanity, are too credible. It's that rare movie - one that will refuse to erase itself from your head, even if you forget it.
