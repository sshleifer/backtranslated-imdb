Wow, "The curse of Michael Myers" which is a good movie. Sharp, entertaining, creative and a clever plot I love. Many hate the 'Thorn' concept, I love it. I think it gives the Halloween series a plot. Marianne Hagan is a wonderful actress and is in an excellent performance, especially for her first film and Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence are also good. My only complaint is that why wasn't Danielle Harris in this movie as Jamie? She wanted to return, but the producers said no. I thought J.C Brandy was great, but I love Danielle Harris. Still, I love Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers. I think The Shape's mask looks the best in this movie and George P. Wilbur is the best Michael Myers ever. Incredibly creepy and exciting, Halloween 6 lines! <br /> <br /> I adore this very violent but incredibly enjoyable movie. The Halloween horror series - by far the best in the genre. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
