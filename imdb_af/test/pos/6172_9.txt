I am a dedicated IMDB visitor for several years. This is the movie that finally forced me to write in a review. <br /> <br /> I caught this movie by chance (the opening credits were gone when I turned my TV one morning). I thoroughly enjoyed the movie for many reasons, all of which were well covered by other reviewers - the cheerfulness, the forgotten history of the Czech pilots, the subtle charm of the supporting characters, the fatalism of the main characters and the first person watching during the battle scenes. <br /> <br /> But the element of Dark Blue World that really stands out was the lack of dramatic effects, especially during the battle (and that's a good thing!). While the pilots were flying in the battle, they did not accompany any musical score. No manipulative shots of worried spouses / girls were intertwined, every little airline did not elicit a patriotic cheering and viewers were not asked to swallow incredible James Bond-like pilot heroism. . Instead, the audience is allowed to feel the melancholy, fear and isolation of these single pilot fighters while trying to stay high during battles. While comrades are being shot down, our torn cries are spared and the typical (but obedient) revenge-based heroine is spared. Instead, the other pilots unfortunately and quietly see their fellow pilot's fate. In fact, they need to stay focused on their own safety and goals at the moment. We briefly experience the pilot's breathing and the background of the engines as we watch the audience a friendly spiral. And then we must fight back in combat mode and focus on survival. <br /> <br /> Too often in Hollywood we get the emotions we're supposed to feel, spoon fed and there's no room for the viewer's imagination. "Dark Blue World" maintains a vivacity that captivates and engages the viewer so we can invest in the film and fill in the gaps and spaces by using our own thoughts and feelings. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie, worth seeing.
