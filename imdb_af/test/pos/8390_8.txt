It's just about showing how wrong you can be. I didn't expect this movie. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill movies (although I chose the second one) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double bill). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature movie production - technically his most superior - including the last good performance of Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me that his films are good (I didn't hate them). He found water in reference, reverent, self-supporting juvenilia. <br /> <br /> Then I read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and I hate it! Certainly it thrived on a typical QT and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were some great characters. But on page it was more young garbage, largely ruined by the great importance of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me think seriously that I didn't see the movie. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I just thought when I had the opportunity to watch the movie with a Tarantino Q&A in London. I thought it would be worth it to hear him in Q&A as I know about interviewing how entertaining he can be personally. <br /> <br /> So little was I ready for the sheer fun and glamor of Inglourious Basterds. </ br> Easy, Mr. Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown is a triumph. <br /> <br /> Yes, the references are there, but they don't mix the story, they're not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunted, but he works well, with little to do, but looks aggressive, and nothing hurts the movie as I feared. While admiring Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof to bolster the excitement of the big stunt scene, her lack of any acting ability was a key issue for the movie. The same can be said of Tarantino's own appearances in various films, especially Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote. <br /> <br /> What really makes this job is how big it is. The spaghetti-western atmosphere for a lot of style, dialogue and performances is wonderful over without falling too far into Kill Bill's cartoon quality. The violence is so great. The audacity is so great. Brad Pitt is so great! In the trailers, the Hitler moment and Pitt's performance bothered me, but in the context of the movie they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune's blush samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne of Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a lot of James Coburn vibe for him and of course a suitable Lee Marvin edge. <br /> <br /> Christoph Waltz (who I didn't know yet) and Melanie Laurent (who I first noticed in a brilliant French-English British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and I expect both to both will be used in the future. Tarantino clearly did not lose his eye for casting, which left him in Proof of Death. Waltz is the same size in his performance. Chilling, but theater. He is Fonda of OUATITW, Van Cleef of Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinal innocence, but difficult, a fighter. They both blinded here. <br /> <br /> That every member of the movie gets the fun to get what they do while they don't enjoy themselves just having fun and trying to laugh, help great. The laugh - and there are many - comes organically. Just Mike Myers comes close to the tip and pushes it too far, but his scene is ruled in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who is drawn directly from the form of Attenborough's Great Escape leader. <br /> <br /> All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful prosperity, but those who work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow combustion opening and a glorious intro for the intricate Basterds, the pass never leaves and in two and a half hours flies to it. <br /> <br /> It also looks nice and marks it as a return to the real movie. - making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, were inspired by Morricone. <br /> <br /> The movie is rushed and hilaries. After a summer when almost every movie disappointed me, it came as a great surprise that the real fun and entertainment, but also an impressive movie, should be this one, if I never believed it in the script . Welcome back QT.
