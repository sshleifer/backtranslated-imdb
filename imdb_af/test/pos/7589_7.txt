Every Sunday is an eleven-minute short subject with the talents of two of its young youth contract players, some of which will develop in minutes in players of the minutes. It is interesting and entertaining to see the contrasting styles of Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin as they play Deanna's uncle on a Sunday concert. <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody knew how big both these young ladies would be. I always wondered why Mayer Garland and Durbin had to go to Universal. L.B. always had cultural predictions and it was the man who had Jeanette MacDonald at his studio and later such beautiful soprano voices as Jane Powell, Ann Blyth, Doretta Morrow, etc. had. <br /> <br /> Judy definitely had her glory career at MGM, but she paid a heavy price for it. Deanna, along with Abbott & Costello and several Gothic horror monsters, preserves universal photos. She was smart enough to get out and keep it up. <br /> <br /> So, in their slaughter days, Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland.
