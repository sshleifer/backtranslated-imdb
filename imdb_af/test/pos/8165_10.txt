The first time I heard of Last Days was when I rented DVDs and I was interested in being a member of the LDS Church. I found this movie very warm and in many areas I cried. The reason is that too many years ago I knew a young man who knew Aaron (played by Steve Sandvoss) in Last Days, but unlike Aaron, this dear young man did not survive the ordeal. He eventually became life after his church, his friends, and his family denied him because he was gay. There were many people who didn't think the things shown in the movie were really happening in this day and age, but the pity and sadness was what they were doing. For those of you who are gay and young, you should see this movie and if you are a Gay Mormon, you really should see this movie. Plus, if you get the DVD, there is help for you listed in the DVD. Teenage suicide in the gay world is very disturbing and this movie touches it but the part is hidden to some extent. The acting and the music are excellent. This movie has chosen every movie house it has shown, but it only showed in big cities and has a very limited edition. For those who want to see this movie, I recommend the DVD edition. The only people I know who don't like the movie are members of my own church and they haven't seen the movie because of the subject of gays and the LDS Church. See the movie, experience the story and feel the emotions that are shown in this movie, what you feel will not be disappointed.
