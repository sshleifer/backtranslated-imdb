If people were really this stupid, I could be the SRW - Supreme of the world. In this one, Knotts plays a subdued bean bank for a little water town that is led by a group of curved single zones, slightly brighter than it is. If things for the crooks look a little shaky, they go to a framework of the patsy Figg. A lot of laughter, as Knotts does his usual fascinating, stumbling action. I especially appreciated the extension cord scene; infinity at its highest level.
