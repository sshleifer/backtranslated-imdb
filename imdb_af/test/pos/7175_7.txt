How important is the director, anyway? In this film, made in the politically turbulent times of the late 60s, where social organization questions were the first conflict, ask the question of making a movie that turns the camera off the action and just the director, William Greaves , wants to reveal. This is an important job as it seems that no other movie shows the problems of closing, organizing and setting the scene; it reveals the role of the crew, which most directors honestly want to completely disappear and that the invisibility is essential to the lifting of unbelief; and it also takes into account the role of performance and mini-dissertation and how they match / does not match reality and what it has to say about how the director ultimately affects reality (if at all). <br /> <br /> The documentary or pseudo-documentary or fictitious narrative (whatever you choose through your interpretations of the themes) has its brain in the over-educated, over-intellectual crew, its intestines in the lost artists who struggles to understand the vague and ambiguous directions, and to represent his heart in the director, who stands the desire to portray, to express without any idea how to do any of those things or why he wants to do it. It's a movie that deliberately repeats banalities just to see if they can become more than banalities. It's a movie that sometimes shows multiple shots simultaneously, just to give the editing to the audience and also to reveal how different shots change perspective. <br /> <br /> It's an important job and something that everyone's interested in the industry. and watch and understand the film-making process. This, like many experimental films, has no real mass audience appeal - it's not for them. This is for the industry, and for the 60's, being asked to do with a group tension media that still relies on a single "voice" and "author". <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
