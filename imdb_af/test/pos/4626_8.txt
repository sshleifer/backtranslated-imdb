2:37 succeed in showing us what Australian teenagers feel and not say. These are the stories of real children and I think we will be naive to think differently. The only new thing 2:37 really brings us an Australian point of view. We often look at troubled American children, but often fail to connect with our own teens. Performed with clever and artistic cinematography, however, (with immediate recognition of the disappointing final song) I lacked the musical direction in sophistication. I applaud the fantastic pouring of this movie. These are regular Aussie children who invite a lot of sympathy for it. Great performances everywhere and you can't get Gary Sweet top, this movie reminded me why sometimes high school sucked and unless you squeak, whether you want hot and fuzzies, go and see 2:37.
