"Snow Queen" is of course based on the fairy tale of the same name, collected in (at least) Andersen's Fairy Tales - and unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales, this one holds the spirit of Faerie, a performance is not easy to understand and well understood by many people, especially among Americans. Talking animals, random bans, incidents of gnomes, dragons and demons should not be asked in a fairy tale; they are as naturally an element of Faerie as, gravity is in the scientific world, and the reason or explanation for them is quite along the point of the story. The story is also not bound by modern Hollywood rules of composition: directly, often to the point of being largely linear in smaller works, and obvious (at least at least). <br /> <br /> With this defense against the general criticism of those who do not understand fairy tales, "Snow Queen" is a beautiful film with wonderful visual effects, skillful acting and good sentiment. The only mistake in the movie was, I think, not that it was too fantastic, but that some parts of the dialogue were too brilliantly modern in snake and expression, a mark of its otherwise timeless nature.
