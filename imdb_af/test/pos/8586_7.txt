It's always nice to see a movie we learn about history in Africa, because it's definitely too little. However, the film shows Lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist one ... I found it difficult to sympathize with this kind of leadership, but the movie is somewhat like tribute to the man. There was too little content, explaining how the man had to get up in the first place, and "let the whole context of Belgium" go. It is therefore worth seeing if the acting and photography are excellent, especially Mobutu himself. I just wanted a better political analysis.
