Well, someone who enjoys traveling 120km in the highway, eating McDonalds and driving the air conditioner twenty-four, and Fox News without a flight, found this documentary interesting. One thing I picked up when talking about North America, I assume this documentary was Fabrique Au Canadie. For Canadian bashing I will leave it to Bill O'Reilly. <br /> <br /> The result of oil depletion will all affect, especially those in large Australia, Canada and the United States. I'm sure Green Peace no longer incites gas, no longer means SUVs, without realizing that people living in sub-zero temperatures can die to death. <br /> <br /> As someone who has studied economics, I know for a fact that we live in a world of limited resources. I will give the documentary props to try to present a balanced view of oil depletion. However, I am studying a degree in journalism, this documentary is full of charged messages - Republican and warmth. What the Democrats did not send troops to Vietnam? <br /> <br /> If you are going to host an economics and resources documentary, it's best to leave the political bashing on the one side, as it can shut down a potential audience. Focus on the issue of finite resources. At the end of the day, it is best to open the mind of the mainstream as it is not good preaching for the minimal chorus. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy documentaries like Fahrenheit 911, and End of Suburbia, not for their political bias, because they remind us that the world is not so safe. Certainly, I like to shop and waste consumers as it is not tomorrow, but if the world ends tomorrow, I'd rather die richly and consume the living beep. <br /> <br /> For potential documentaries out there, just give people facts and let viewers make their own thoughts. If you try to tackle your political views as a balanced documentary, people will smell a while away for a while.
