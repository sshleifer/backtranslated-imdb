I saw 'Born' last night, and I have two thoughts on the film. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I appreciate it for the total turnaround of a Michael Bay movie. No dialogue, highly stylized grain B&W photography, some of the most truly horrific images ever set to film, and a very compelling use of sound (which nobody else really picked up). It is a reflection on a theme, and it dares to go where most filmmakers not only in terms of images but of production and concepts. This is a movie that most people do not understand, and if you read through these comments you will find a lot of people whose lack of ability to find this movie in their slender "pretense" with The zest of a gibbon skipping find the bars of his cage at feed time. It really shocked and disturbed me, and the last time a movie got it right, it was a while ago. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is a thirty minute short run over an hour and a half. I understand that there may be artificial merit in the use of repetition and monolithic pacing as a bludgeon, but in this case it not only helps to keep everything together. Imagine being approached by a tattered man on the street grabbing at the shoulders and saying something that totally confuses the essence of your being ... but then, instead of crushing you and grabbing in his aftermath, he doesn't like talk and talk and talk. By the end of the movie I watched from time to time. <br /> <br /> It's not fun, people. This is disentertainment. That's how you program what just glitter looked at. Watching movies to be entertained will frustrate, confuse and perhaps make you angry. You don't approach 'born' like a chocolate cake you want to eat, because it tastes good. You approach it like something on the menu you've never heard before, something you see through the kitchen door, which is dark and glistening and turning on its dish. something you order because it will taste good but because you just need to know how it is.
