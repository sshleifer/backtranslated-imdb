John Schelesinger's career as a film director was extraordinary. We watched this movie when it first came out, but wanted to see it again when it was recently shown on the cable. The film has a faded look, as it is being watched today, yet it is interesting because of the intense performances of the two principals. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, please don't read any further. <br /> <br /> Chris and Daulton were two childhood friends who came from middle-class backgrounds. Chris went to a seminar to be a priest, but quit. Daulton has become a drug user and dealer for a while. The two lives seem to run parallel, as the couple become involved in an illegal activity that will prove their short-sightedness. In fact, it shows how both young men miscalculated in their attempt to deceive the CIA and the Soviet Union. These two were somehow so naive to think that they could do something bigger, and better-equipped people who couldn't even think. <br /> <br /> Chris's motivation is legal because he feels furious. in discovering the private role of the agency for which he works in dealing with other nations, in this case Australia, something he finds coincidental. When he is involved with Daulton, we know the whole thing is doomed because no one in drugs, like him, will ever pay for anything. In fact, Chris and Daulton did not understand the extent of what they were trying to do or the consequences. <br /> <br /> In this period of his career, Timothy Hutton was an actor who took place. He proved that he had talent with his work in other films. So it was a natural choice for Mr. Schlesinger to choose him, a choice that pays well. Sean Penn was also a young actor who showed an intensity, as one had not seen before. In fact, Mr Penn, we were reminded of a young Robert Mitchum. Both actors' contributions to the film are incredible. One can't imagine who could play this duo, but they. <br /> <br /> "The Falcon and Snowman", while not aware of other great John Schlesinger movies, are an interesting look at our not too distant past.
