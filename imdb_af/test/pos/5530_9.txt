It was one of the lines in a trailer over this movie and for one time the public did not exaggerate. All six of the top players here are 99% of the time on the screen, so they should be good. <br /> <br /> It is always fascinating how certain plot sites can be worked for a highballing comedy to a deadly serious situation. Mary Boland of the ditzy and Charlie Ruggles of the henpecked play their usual characters who plan to drive all the way to California. To share expenses, they advertise for someone to share the ride. They get Burns and Allen and a dog sample. The same premise was a deadly serious one who was several generations later in California. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you are traveling with Gracie Allen, you know you'll absolutely try to determine her Monty Pythonesque reasoning. all over the world. And if that's not enough, get in W.C. Areas, part-time sheriff and full-time porter who live with Alison Skipworth in sin. But then we didn't dig into such things. <br /> <br /> Don't miss a true classic comedy from the thirties.
