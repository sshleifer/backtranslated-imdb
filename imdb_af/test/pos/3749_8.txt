A woman and her aunt go to Scotland to find her elusive fianc√©. This is a very malignant movie due to the unbundling, but until then it is interesting, benevolent, sincere and with fine set design (developed by William Cameron Menzies for 3-D projection). Veronica Hurst is captivating and delicate, kind of a chic British Marilyn Monroe, still in love with Richard Carlson, who conceals a family secret in his disgusting castle. There are even bats in the bell! It moves quietly to the final extraordinary piece, when Hurst and her aunt (Katherine Emery, also the narrator) sneak out of the castle at night to venture into the maze and find what they are looking for in his center. As a child I always remember this order - there is nothing scarce (or claustrophobic) than not finding your way out of a 10 foot high fence maze. Of course, the two women are divorced, which sets the stage for exciting excitement with horrible music. The end result is really disappointing, as Carlson's epilogue at the end makes some sense for all the exciting, even challenging, sympathy. Worth to see.
