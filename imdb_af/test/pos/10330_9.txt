I absolutely loved this show. Never understood why it is called Bug Juice. I had to be about 13 when it came out. I remember they ran it on Channel 4 over the summer holidays, between Pugwalls summer storms and rescued by the bell or something. I remember sitting there and wishing I was also at the summer camp - ha ha. All the kids in it looked like they had so much fun, it's all about "discover who you are" and "grow up." First kiss and all those things. I remember there was this very cute guy in it, I think he was the main reason why I got up that particular summer that morning. They should have more teenage docu-sails like this, I thought it was great!
