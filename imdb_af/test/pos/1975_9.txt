It was a good movie, I would compare it to the movie The Game. You get to the end of the movie and can't move ... your brain is removed and shaken (not stirred) and back in your head. Don't plan something for this movie. You will need time to think about what has just happened. <br /> <br /> Don't come to this movie that expects the Matrix style to spend more millions on special effects, but these movies special effects come from the actors, they keep you engaged, no, they suck you in and Don't let go of the whole movie. Great play, big plot ... very nice movie, I can't say enough. Also very original plot, lots of twists and ideas I never thought of. The end is suddenly and makes you hang out and wonder, was it really? Is it really the end? Good end, not to say it's bad, just wonder and a little apart. <br /> <br /> Big movie for those who like action, like a good plot (don't get up for a bathroom break On this movie you get lost) and like mind games, because that's exactly in a nutshell what it is.
