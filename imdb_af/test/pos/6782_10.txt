This game is an action / adventure with battles. There are very long periods without fighting, but at other times you have to get rid of different kinds of monsters. The monsters are not like anything you would see in real life, and they have to get rid of to continue your quest. The whole game is a quest. You play Adam Randall whose father contacts him from the other side and asks him to save him. The game is from the mid-1990s and must be played in DOS. I used Dosbox and could play the game very well. The graphics are not as good as some games, mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes look rather obscure, but others seem to be obsolete, but don't leave the game. The game is very imaginative, it is long and can let you jump when unexpected monsters come out of nowhere. Not for young kids who are likely to be interested anyway, but over 13 or 14 may like this game. This is a horror mystery action adventure battle combination. I thought it was a good game. It had to be found now. maybe Ebay. But she remembers a DOS game and you won't be able to play on today's faster computers. It will be hard to play on fast computers unless you use Dosbox. Oh, and the acting is also very good.
