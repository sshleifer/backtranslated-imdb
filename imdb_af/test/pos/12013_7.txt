A real surprise. Not exactly family fun of "Disney". Some violence, many tense moments, and a good story, based on fact. The theme of "Night Crossing" is determination. They never lost their purpose, two East German families dared to escape it all in their daring balloon. The story is both sad and heartwarming. Time is not on their side. The East German Police include and the result far from certain to the end. If you are looking for a good evening entertainment, which contains no nakedness and limited violence, then I strongly recommend "Night Crossing". It's pure entertainment. - NOTE
