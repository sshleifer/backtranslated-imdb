Okay, everyone agreed on what was the best season. The first. And Boone's death was a bad demand. The death of others was also bad. Show the directors and writers for it. Naughty boys. BUT. I still think it's the best scifi series ever! Sorry, guys, I can't help it! I see that the quality of the series has decreased after the first season. However, it is easy to accept Liam as the new main character if you are a boone. He's really ... secretive. The thing that shocked me the most was when Lilli was out of the story and how. It's something she didn't deserve! And what do we get? Some blonde chick called Renee, with absolutely no character! But these Taelons remain mysterious, and you wonder about their true plans to the end. True suspension. The conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are sometimes brilliant. <br /> <br /> I understand that when you jump on an episode of the 3rd, 4th or 5th season, you can't understand this show. But if you look from the beginning, you can just break away! <br /> <br /> The play is wonderful, the special FX is great, the music is beautiful and the plot is intriguing. See it, guys!
