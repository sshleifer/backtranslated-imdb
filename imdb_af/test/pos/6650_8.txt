I really enjoyed this Minghella epic pleasure, not as much thought of as the English Patient (a contemporary classic). The first 20 minutes or so feel uncomfortable, but as Inman (Jude Law) begins the journey back to his love, Ava (Nicole Kidman), the movie becomes speed and boundaries and becomes a very memorable, considerate romantic drama. Apparently, it is fashionable to hate Kidman right now, but I don't agree at all, and she does it well. Actually, I think the romance between Inman and Ada is poorly developed in writing (they don't really get much screen time to develop a relationship), but Law and Kidman gives them everything and convicts. Ada's journey is at the heart of the film. She becomes a strong woman who can carry almost anything. Zellweger initially looks completely wrong as Ruby, but after all, she grows on you and shines in many of her later scenes. The film has beautiful photography and set design, but never really captures the real feel of a period piece. In particular, Jack White has a long, thin hair and a pale rocker face that looks completely out of place. Cillian Murphy fans will see the talented Irish actor in an early part, and Natalie Portman actually proves she is likely to be the most striking of the movie. It's a pity she's so inadequate in 'The Other Boleyn Girl'.
