Excellent drama about 2 estranged, pampered punks going from the federal government, each for its own reasons. One, a druggy, just wants to fix a few bucks for his next, but the other has a much more sinister agenda that is partly fueled by a father's resentment. Good performances and a hot script make it a winner.
