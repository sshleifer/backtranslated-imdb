I enjoyed two of the three movies in the "Sarah, Plain & Tall" trilogy. The final of the three was definitely one of the "goodies." This is an excellent family movie with great acting by three adult stars: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Jack Palance. <br /> <br /> The storyline is simple but familiar. The only sub-par performance was by one of the children. It was interesting to see how the children have grown since that first movie. <br /> <br /> Of the three, the first "Sarah" was the best filmed with beautiful cinematography. This movie didn't, but it had the best story. It had some really tearful sentimental moments and a very nice ending. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
