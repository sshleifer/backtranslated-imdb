Forget about everything you've ever read about the Mallachi Brothers' straight-to-video release "Snakes on a Train," especially if it was a negative review. This movie is much nicer than the movie that tears it off, of course: "Snakes on a plane." Frankly, I am surprised that more people are not rhapsodizing about this low-budget Asylum release. Instead, most of the reviews I have read have nothing but criticism to say, except the idiocy dumb herd mentality, as the act was amateurish, the action did not live numerically on the ads. a horrible waste of time. Of course, it doesn't help that the title is a hint of the obvious ripeness of this movie. Actually, I felt that "Snakes on a Train" exceeded "Snakes on a plane" for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> First, the producers used real, real snakes for the last fifteen minutes when they also replaced giant snake heads or computers that generated a super-giant snake that consumed a whole Amtrak like a train. How many movies does a snake have in a train? As a result, "Snakes on a train" stand as the first movie to scale that height. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this low-budget movie uses some creepy effects. The woman who lifts baby snakes - real people - was fantastic! The special effects of her forearms that are later refurbished in the movie were visually tempting! Also, you see a little white girl eaten alive by a snake. She was as cute as she could be, no more than 10 years old or so, and she died while his nasty old giant gentleman snake head swallowed her. Not only children at risk, but the child ate! It's exactly the kind of graphics you won't find in 99% of all Hollywood exhibits. Of course she wasn't eaten by a real snake, but that is the subversive thought that counts. <br /> <br /> Third, it is one of those cursed at movies where Alma ("That Guy" Julia Ruiz), the main female character - no heroine - put a curse on her by her parents because she did not marry the man they recommended. As a result, she is filled with snakes, how many quantities of green radiator fluid grind, then a baby snake is picked up. Imagine Medusa, the mythical characters that had snakes for her, just with the snakes in her stomach. Her child of a psycho-shamanic kind gathers all the snakes coming out of her because they are on a train to L.A. on her way to see a relative of his who can bring all the snakes back in her and normally return her. Talk about a shaky character performing gastrointestinal routines. Prepare yourself for very slim, blood and gore. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the train has only about twenty or so passengers, not hundreds. Still, the Mallachi brothers seemed to have filmed this above average horrorflick on board, a real train with real snakes and they played the swing of the train on the tracks. <br /> <br /> Fifth, the snakes turn around for the first time, moving the train quietly before they become strange and attack everyone. In other words, it is voltage, voltage, voltage, before people start swallowing snake bites. <br /> <br /> Until the last five minutes when the snake grows beyond the run-off train and swallows, "Snakes on a Train" is warped, wonderful, and out-of-the-way. It doesn't have the Attention Deficit editing of a major league Hollywood movie. It's a fantasy about an unfortunate Spanish woman who is placed because of her feminist, on-odds-with-society attitude. <br /> <br /> Overall, you have gory type of fantasy stuff; thrilling snakes wandering around the train are over the top giant snake. By the way, they get aboard the train because a lot of other Mexicans bought a train worker and the Mexicans on board think the girl is so cute they let her and her boyfriend free. <br /> <br /> I think it's better than "Snakes on a plane" if you want a tough, small, independent manufactured horror movie.
