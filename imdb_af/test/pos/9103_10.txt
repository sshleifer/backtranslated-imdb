This movie is very silly and very funny. You can never ever criticize it for taking it seriously. If you've heard their previous album or have seen HBO videos from the album, you can tell the exceptionally dirty mouth, the good time this movie is, which is the fable of how the group Tenacious D originated. /> Full of cameos, it not only gives a fictional version of Tenacious D, but is also a record of musical history. The humor reminds one of Mary, because they often "go places you thought they should," but it does not have the scatological humor of South Park. This movie contains no nudity except for the moon.
