My mother is like Gone With The Wind like one can be. She has the collector's plates, the Rhett and Scarlett Madame Alexander dolls, GWTW Christmas ornaments, even a GWTW cookbook! My sister and I only saw bits of GWTW, but we knew the whole plot wholeheartedly. At a glance, my sister bought these miniseries and thought my mom would have wanted it and we were interested in browsing the novel a bit. <br /> <br /> Yesterday we decided to watch Gone With The Wind and Scarlett. We started GWTW at about 2:30 in the afternoon and ended at 6:30. We immediately started Scarlett. My mother usually goes to sleep at about 10:00, she walks up to 1:30 with us to finish it! We were sound! I love how the movie starts at Melanie's funeral, where Scarlett stopped saying, "I'll think about it tomorrow." Scarlett doesn't stay long in Georgia, she flies to Charleston in her quest to win him back. Rhett is not happy when he gets Scarlett in his home, so he goes to the family's plantation. Scarlett, who is Scarlett, follows him and they finally agree to set aside their quarrels for a while to keep the gossip in neighborhoods. Rhett starts enjoying her company again and takes her out of his boat. A storm comes up and they sink. He helps her swim to the shore of an island. Terrible that she's dead, Rhett is anxious until she wakes up. When she does, they are both swept up and made love in the moment. Scarlett will wake up in Charleston the next day, but Rhett went on to write that he thinks best if they never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Scarlett is sad and when she does, she does stupid things, in this case she is seen by Anne Hampton alone in Ashley with a hotel room. Nothing happens, but her reputation is stained so Scarlett goes to Savannah with her two spider aunts. She soon discovered that she was pregnant and decided to wait for the right time to tell Rhett. As she meets in Savannah, she meets many of her O'Hara family members and grows to keep one cousin in particular a Father column. She soon gets her divorce notice from Rhett and then decides she will never tell him about her baby just to regret him. Typical Scarlett. <br /> <br /> She decides to go to Ireland to make sure Rhett can never discover her condition. She meets many more relatives and buys a beautiful ancestral home of Ballyhara. By this time, Rhett drives Anne. It's on Halloween when Scarlett gets the notice that Rhett is married again. She goes to work the night. <br /> <br /> The movie jumps to a year later and Scarlett is very happy with her beautiful daughter Kat. She is pursued by Lord Richard Fenton, who is really an evil man, forcing a young girl named Mary Boyle to sleep with him. Scarlett meets Rhett and Anne again at a horse show. After a row accident, Scarlett talks to Anne and learns that she and Rhett should have a baby. Sad weather, Scarlett leaves and goes to Dublin with Fenton. There she cultivates a relationship with him, as I said, she does stupid things when she is sad. <br /> <br /> Mary Boyle has discovered she is pregnant and goes to Colum for help. The priest urged Fenton to help the girl and Fenton killed him after Colum threatened to tell Scarlett. Fenton persuaded Scarlett to go with him to London to escape her grief over Colum's death. Maria asks to go with her. Back in Charleston, Anne died of Yellow fever. It is made clear that she never carries a child in Rhett. <br /> <br /> In London, Scarlett sees Fenton's true colors sleeping with him when she was not in the mood. Fenton raped her after telling him she never wanted to see him again. She falls unconscious and when she wakes up, Fenton is killed. Scarlett was charged with his murder. <br /> <br /> Rhett hears about it and retrieves Sally in England to England. Terrifying of the gallows, Scarlett has no choice but to tell Rhett about their daughter. Rhett is furious with her to keep such a secret, but glad to help her. Mary Boyle, the real killer, can't be found. Scarlett is found guilty, but Maria eventually comes to declare her innocence. After the promise to help Maria, Scarlett leaves with Ireland for Rhett, as he says, "It's time to get to know my daughter." The scene for which he sees Kat for the first time is absolutely beautiful. In Ireland, Rhett sees how much Scarlett has changed and ultimately reconciled the two and acknowledges that they still love each other. <br /> <br /> After seeing GWTW, I would say, Vivian Leigh was a better Scarlett, but I like Scarlett's character in this movie than in the first. The reason is that in GWTW, you don't know why you like Scarlett. She is so cruel at Rhett and haughty and spoiled, but you love her lively spirit. In Scarlett you see how much she has changed. Oh, she's still in the lap of luxury, but she's no longer haughty. You see her becoming a real mom to Kat and a generous person for the poor people of Ireland. Joanne Whalley does and great work to play this new side of Scarlett. Timothy Dalton is not Clark Gable, but sometimes you swear you can see original Rhett in him. <br /> <br /> If you're just back and can't compare with Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton with Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable, you'll surely enjoy this movie. It's a chance to compare Scarlett yesterday, the one she'll be "tomorrow".
