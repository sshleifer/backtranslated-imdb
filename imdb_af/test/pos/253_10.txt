When I watched this movie, it reminded me of all the biggest dreams I had (mostly filled with robots) <br /> <br /> I can relate to Eledore's problems and I have an agreement with Shiro and it's a good movie to watch (if you're a Goth who is bitter and eccentric like me!). All in all, watch it before it's out of print!
