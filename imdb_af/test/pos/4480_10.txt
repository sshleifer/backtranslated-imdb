Honore De Balzac's truly bizarre short story based loosely, is a disturbing but breathtaking filming in the early part of the nineteenth century, treated as a kind of forbidden love blossom over a period of time between man and animal. Thin and very blonde English actor Ben Daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the Napoleonic wars that are lost while accompanying a forbidden (?) French painter over the rough, dangerous landscapes of the Gobi Desert. After literally walking around in circles, the two men give up ever to reach civilization. Therefore, each one (at better judgment) decides that they must do their own ways with the promise of both returning to the same exact place when and as a water source is actually found. Of course, this is how Daniels' character is experiencing the essence (a wild and untamed female leopard) and eventually forming a seemingly unbreakable bond, or rather love, with the fact that both save his life and nearly destroy it by the end of the film. The beautiful cinematography, minimalist dialogue, somewhat demented story, probably suggesting possible bestiality in about three scenes, is ultimately leading professional critics to pan the film as pretentious and prolonged junk. Although it is a movie that not only reflects on every taste, I find it a subtle but definitely left-to-the-middle mix of fantasy with a surreal and atmospheric atmosphere, underlined by the fact that more than half of movie actor Ben Daniels is forced to play against a wild animal (four leopards are actually used as opposed to just one), which dictates common sense and a little knowledge of diarrhea that it is a mad and had to be very difficult work He managed to pull off quite brilliantly if you asked me! Overall, I think 'Passion in the desert' takes a while to warm up, but if you're a patient willing to give it time, it's actually a unique, original game about you, in spite of of everything; And, unlike most platonic stories about humans and animals, it doesn't need a talking pig, monkey or rough dog to keep your interest right.
