I only saw it on January 1, 2009, and after a day I looked at it again and I want to see it again. Love everything (good, almost, about 9 stars) about it. No color, beautiful naive stories, funny gangsters, Anna, camera work, music. Well, sometimes you just want to listen a little longer and stop the music. But that is not a musical. I love Anna's acting, this naive wannabe gangster girl, how she speaks, holds the gun, everything makes me smile. No, it's not that funny, though I laughed a little, it's just as subtle. Excellent work by Samuel Benchetrit. Although 3d nouvelle looks weaker, but they are also gangsters, maybe even worse, because they steal ideas. And the last scene is my favorite. Let me feel so warm and romantic. Yes, I would recommend this movie for the romantic souls with a taste for such artistic films. And I don't agree with those who compare it to Pulp Fiction. It's not about action and distorted story, though all vignettes intersect. It is calm and perhaps too slow for most people. It's about characters, their feelings, very subtle. Anyway, this review probably won't help me (my first). I just wanted to express my appreciation. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: This movie does not have a Goofs section. Wonder, nobody saw the hand in the second part when the kidnappers decided to go home? Looks like part of the crew, hehe. I know I should put it better in forums, but I disagree with some policies here.
