This movie is a mix of a dark comedy and a drama, about two guys who worked in a butcher shop and wanted to build their own. When they finally reached that dream, they got a new problem: there were no clients! One day a man dies in the fridge, and a new kind of butcher's business begins? They start selling human flesh, saying to the clients it's just chicken ?? and start to improve their business: Human flesh is selling well! Oh! I forgot to say anything? These guys are not normal! There is really something missing in their brain! <br /> <br /> The movie has some pretty dark humor scenes, but in my opinion it's mostly a drama. One who shows us what is in the head of a psychopath, what is his motivation for what he does. I have to admit that I was a little surprised at the end of the movie, because I never expected them to discover it, but it's probably because I see too many Hollywood movies? What I mean by this is that we in Hollywood's theater always expect the punishment of the guys doing the bad things. There is always a morality that protects the "good values", despite the fact that we all know that in "real life" does not happen too much? And I especially like this movie, because it fits into a kind of cinema that is true, front-facing, without false moralities, and what "sees" on the other hand behind "conventional morality"? It only happens in independent theater (especially in European)! <br /> <br /> In addition, there are excellent performances by Nikolaj Lie Kass and Mads Mikkelsen (especially the first) in the roles of the "disturbed guys" ?? <br /> <br /> Very good Danish movie!
