Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers is probably the best sequel to all the Halloween movie. Jamie, killer Michael Myers cousin, carries a baby then taken by the black man from the end of Halloween 5. A friendly nurse helps Jamie escape, but Myers quickly speeds her and kills her. Jamie's baby is found and rescued by Tommy Doyle, one of the children Jamie Lee's babysitter in the original movie, and Myers arrives in Haddonfield and begins to kill the Strode tribe in his old home. The film concludes with plays that cite Michael's evil, the identity of the man in black, and close to the entire drum Loomis / Michael Myers story. I recommend this brilliant horror masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers was named R for strong graphic violence, extremely gore, short sexuality, language and short nudity.
