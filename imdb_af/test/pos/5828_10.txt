Yes, this show has a lot of male frontal nudity and yes, over the years the plot lines have become top, melodramatic and very unrealistic, but it didn't matter, because the show is great. You really get involved with the characters and every character, no matter how small or large, is perfectly cast. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine anyone else except JK Simmons playing the neo-Nazi racist rapist and neither does anyone else play Tobias Beecher except Lee Tergesen. The transformation of his character from season 1 to season 2 is wonderful. However, Oz OZ's character was CHRIS KELLER (played by Christopher Meloni). He didn't have relationships with anyone else in prison except Beecher (except Ronnie Barlog, but it was just to get Ronnie to stop with Keller's mistress, Beecher). Their relationship has exceeded sex and Tom Fontana actually took care of the two and wants the two to be together. <br /> <br /> I loved Vern's soft spot for his kids in the show and how Fontana made sympathetic characters from everyone. these horrible criminals we grew, even Simon Adebesi. <br /> <br /> But some plot lines were totally incredible and unrealistic: * A man builds a bomb in oz * Churches are in a spotlight in their windows in their pods and look at other men who are into something plan their thoughts - also exaggerate. * Drugs in oz * Everyone in the rehab group uses or sells drugs and sister Pete has not helped anyone in six years. * People are killed in the gym, provide cupboards and kitchen. * No one is hurting Ryan's mother * No one is fighting Cyril outside the boxing ring (except of course) * Two prisoners with tools alone in the elevator and one of them dies without investigation. * Karl Metzger (guard) is dead and nobody is investigated. * The governor holds all his press conferences at jail. All a resident has to do is say, "I want to see Glenn" or "I want to see mcmanus" and they're not being asked. * People die every week in Oz. * On the outside, people kill someone and get 20 years, for parole in eight, but if they kill someone on the inside, they almost immediately die. * No staff paid on site. The kitchen or postroom - prisoners both asked no questions asked. * Aging drugs for prisoners to replace in time. * Ryan has no friends or associates, but is never hurt, murdered, mutilated, raped or beaten. * The guys do NOT flush toilets when they go to the bathroom or throw it. * An NBA scout comes to jail to recruit an NBA player (yes right) <br /> <br /> But with all these flaws, this show is still fantastic. It's horrible, brutal, sexy, edgy, raw and innovative. Dean Winters, Scott William Winters, JK Simmons, Christopher Meloni, Luiz Guzman, Adele (the man who played Simon Adebisi), Eammon Walker, Lee Tergesen, Terry Kinney, mums, Male Alexander, LL Cool J, etc. Everyone is wonderful and made the show worth watching. <br /> <br /> I recommend renting it on DVD. Season six comes from 9/06 (next month). First five seasons are on DVD - watch them and then watch again with sound. I loved the director's comments with Chazz Palmentari. The sequence with Andy Schillinger who runs the cafeteria tables and then falls into the hole was a fantastic, top shot !! Kudos! And Kathy Bates does family business and the famous wrestling battle between Beecher and Keller - just wonderful !! Brilliant !!! It would be so strange that Meloni Tergesen's private part should be in front of an icon like Kathy Bates in that one scene !! Wow! It's beautiful, pun intended! <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for Oz: The Next Generation !!!! (as with Star Trek, etc.) C'Mon !!! Let's get it going !!!!
