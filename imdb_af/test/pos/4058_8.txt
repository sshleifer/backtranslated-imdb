It's a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it, although it wasn't so original, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great! All the characters are cool, and the story is pretty good, plus Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy are simply fantastic in this! Rene Russo is excellent in her role, and there is a lot of laughter to be had (especially when Deniro spoofs Clint Eastwood and Danny Glover's lines), plus the final is just wonderful. Yes, it's just another twist of the mil "Buddy Buddy" movie, but it works because of the fantastic chemistry between De Niro and Murphy! Plus it also had good car racing scenes! It's nothing really good, but I found it a lot of fun, and a perfect way to pass the time! But the biggest villain was very poor and was not good at all. It's far from the best Buddy Buddy cop movie, but it's still a very entertaining one, and I thought it was well made and written! And the end was quite funny! It's really nice, I really enjoyed it, although it wasn't so original, Robrt De Niro and Eddie Murphy were good together, I recommend this one !! The direction is very good! Tom Dey does a very good job here with Robert Deniro is amazing as always and is wonderful here, he is hilarious, very nice, has fantastic chemistry with Eddie Murhpy has his Popular Wonderful Things, has some very funny faces, Looks like he enjoyed himself, had some funny lines, and has a very cool character! (The Niro Rules !!!!!!!). Eddie Murphy is also wonderful here, he is hilarious, as De Niro did his usual funny things, obviously loved being in front of the camera, and while he could do this piece In his sleep, he was still fun to watch ! (Murphy Rules !!!!). Rene Russo is fantastic here! She had a cool character, and while she didn't have much to do, she added a lot of screen presence and always made her character interesting. She was just fantastic! (Russo Rules !!!!). William Shatner is astonishingly funny here and did not overdo it, and made good laughter in the film. The biggest villain is OK, but kind of weak and pretty slim, yet he did what he had to do properly. The rest of the throw is doing well. Overall, I recommend this one! *** 1/2 out of 5
