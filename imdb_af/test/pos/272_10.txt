The Stepford kids, in addition to a very good TV movie producer, show the very disturbing effect of indoctrination. It is quite a statement on how to destroy within the boundaries of what is considered 'good' behavior, whatever it is that makes one unique and an individual. I think it's a movie that parents who have a bit of thought to maintain in the hearts and minds of young people should look with their children and discuss what the movie says. I don't know if it was the intention of this movie in any way, but I have always been of the opinion that this is one of the best movie sets against the desire of children to match an unrealistic and dominant pretext of what is in the best interest from anyone other than the children themselves. One day I hope to see this movie on DVD. I'm at the exit gate ... wait.
