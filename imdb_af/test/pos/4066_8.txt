At one time, "Buddy Cop" movies ruled the cashier's office. It seemed as if every summer of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes crashed into our nation's theaters. Not anymore. Lately, the gusher has become dry for barely a drop. The drought has recently eased a bit with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a truly funny and consistent entertaining example of the genre. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston is a dedicated policeman. He is not a Dirty Harry type at all. He is just incredibly focused professional who is totally intolerant of anything that stands in the way of performing his duties, such as a T.V. cameraman. Mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and thus falls into the clutches of Chase Renzi, a producer looking for a killer hook for her "reality T.V." cop show. She thinks Mitch will give her the 'edgy' boost, it has to be a hit, but feels that he may be unlikely to carry the whole show himself. Type Trey Sellars, a patrolman-cum actor who is too much police story going on again. Of course, Mitch and Trey mix like oil and water and lots of cheerful chaos comes out. <br /> <br /> We know that Mitch and Trey will be best friends at the end of the movie. This is how friend-cop movies are supposed to work. In fact, Showtime rarely deviates from the time-honored clich√©s written by Lethal Weapon and Tango & Cash. There is high technology McGuffin to roll the ball. In this case, an automatic rifle that burns round is large enough to stop tanks.) There is a smooth, foreign bath with an accent of indefinite origin. There are chases, shootouts and explosions. We all know it is coming soon and we have a pretty good idea how to get it all done. You know what? There is nothing wrong with that. Yes, we know that the well-worn bases will be touched, but the fun here is the trip, not the destination. Showtime stress not original. Instead, his energy is drawn in his characters and humorous situations. As a result, Showtime does a skilled job with the action sequences, but shines in its comedy. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is dry as Mitch. In the past, I thought De Niro was to be a cold and unexpressive actor who was terribly hurt when he acted on comedy. But lately he has grown on me. He seems to inject more humanity into his roles. Eddie Murphy is hilarious as Trey. The best way to describe his performance is for Trey Murphy to be Murphy not as talented and out of time. Rene Russo has a drill time to play with a car-mouth show Biz Shark Chase Renzi. She stole through the movie with high Nielson ratings with awesome determination. In her zeal she boasts Mitch's life again to make it more camera friendly. She even calls T. J. Hooker himself, William Shatner, to show Mitch how to be a more "authentic" cop. Shatner is funny, plays himself exactly as we expect him to be out loud, unaware and slightly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I have to admit I'm really looking forward to Showtime and I wasn't disappointed. Ten years ago, this movie would have been a guaranteed hit. Today, it's at its best moderate business. It's a shame, because Showtime is a lot of fun.
