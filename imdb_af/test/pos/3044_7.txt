Pat Conroy's autobiographical book "The Water Is Wide" seems to be something of a southern "Up Down Down Stair", but despite the teacher-to-odds formula, "Conrack" the audience really moves with every little one breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black children on an island outside South Carolina) are actually learning, and their collective wide eyes are imperceptibly sweet. The one real actress in the crowd (Tina Andrews, an amazing artist) plays the "sticky nut" that Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charm, it all looks like a breeze. But the story is not ready for a happy ending, and I wasn't ready for the silence of the final. It is beautifully finished. From time to time the author is obvious, but director Martin Ritt is very smart to always fall back on Jon Voight's solid presence. Scenes such as the one in which he travels in his wagon, which emits his frustrations about a loudspeaker, does not add much, but the whole movie is filled with episodes that spark spark emotion and the real end is their payout. ** 1/2 out of ****
