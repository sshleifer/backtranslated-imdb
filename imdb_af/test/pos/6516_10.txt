I've seen this movie long ago, but I've always loved it. The story is about a young girl, Sally O'Moyne, finding out at a young age that when she prayed to St Anne, her prayers were answered, hence her missing meal and a mean neighbor attacking and praying her, that someone should give him a black eye to take. Well, a moment later something goes for him and he has a black eye. Sally then believes in the power of prayer and decides to use that power for good. She is well-known and loved in the area, as she has filled copy books / magazines with all her friends' requests to St Anne. Meanwhile, a local boy returned home from college (I believe) and Sally is Awesruck at how much he grew up. Sally loved him, but was so shy. Should she use her prayer power at St Anne for her own selfish desire or just watch as the most popular girls in school try to stare the man from her dreams? It is a fun movie with a grandpa who is so beautiful and Irish, brothers hilariously annoying and a sworn Irish neighbor who splashes on a daily basis with big pop. He has his own story that he wants to buy the O'Moynes property, which is a small house in the middle of two large apartment complexes (his own). In other words, the O'Moynes house is a pain for its beautiful buildings. . <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth a watch and is good enough and scarce enough to add to your movie collection. I hope you enjoy it!
