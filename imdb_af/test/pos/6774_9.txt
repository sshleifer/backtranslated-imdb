THE GREEN BUTCHERS (Anders Thomas Jensen - Denmark 2003). <br /> <br /> How do Danne stay with these films that are consistently funny, sharply written, beautifully filmed and filled with good performances? THE GREEN BUTCHERS is a dark and angry funny comedy, in many ways the Danish counterpart of EATING RAOUL and DELICATESSES, but it has more than laughter or parody. <br /> <br /> The film brings us the duo of the chronic paw head Bjarne (Nikolaj Lie Cheese) and the chronic sweat Svend (Mads Mikkelsen). Sick of their evil boss, the two parents decide to open their own butcher shop in a small Danish town, but the business is initially slow and customers stay away. When an electrician is accidentally locked up and unlocked in the meat box, Svend decides to turn the man's thigh into fillets. He calls 'chickie-wickies'. This special dish suddenly faced everyone in the village on their counter and Svend, who was unable to resist this sudden jump in popularity. It becomes a series of murderers with Bjarne acting as his unwilling accomplice. But soon, under the guidance of their former boss, many people in the town are wondering what special ingredients the two men use. <br /> <br /> Without the extraordinary performances by Kaas and Mikkelsen, the movie couldn't have risen. above the level of the average black comedy. On paper, the character of Svend may border on caricature, but Mads Mikkelsen's portrait is that of a serious, unsafe and distorted man, but Mikkelsen manages to make him frightening, funny and moving at the same time. Cheese actually plays a dual role and also plays his comatose twin brother Eigil. When I watched the movie, I never even realized it was the same actor. The other performances are just as wonderful with every character in town, refreshing, with some wonderful vignettes. <br /> <br /> Of course, the subject matter is a bit morbine and the material may not be quite fresh. , taking into account a number of predecessors who dealt with the same kind of material, but director Jensen gives it a fresh twist and manages a few real characters with the strange duo of Svend and Bjarne, with this wonderful bizarre story of two social misfits . /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
