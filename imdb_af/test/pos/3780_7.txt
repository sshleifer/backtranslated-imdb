Pretty funny stuff. Charlie was still spreading his spell when he made these dark short on soldiers in World War I trenches. Brave because the war was still going on and it was a comedy about a serious business. <br /> <br /> The gags are amusing without being hilarious or tear jerking. One successful scene follows the other, as Chaplin and his comrades try to sleep in a bunker that is knee deep in the water. (This is where we come from the term "trench foot".) Probably, the most ridiculous episode, Chaplin disguised as a tree and filled a number of German soldiers while trying to get an allied soldier caught behind the lines , to execute. Edna Purviance, Chaplin's greatest pressure at that time, is a woman who works with the Americans and is also rescued from execution. <br /> <br /> Chaplin will do pleasant and ambitious things, but it's better than most. of his shorts during this early period.
