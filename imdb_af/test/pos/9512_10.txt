I don't know what Dick's talked about, but I found this movie to be one of Japan's most exciting epics to date. Regarding Armageddon or Deep Impact, or otherwise. The morning is pale in comparison. For what I know about movies, most of the catastrophe in movies is actually the asteroid movie or one of Global Warming. It has run another course ever. A course of natural means where the earth's crust begins to erode to such an extent that it will take another piece of land with it for the ride. What the scientific teams had to do was to make a way to stop the erosion from going completely and sinking Japan altogether. In most cases, it will simply be called tectonic shift on steroids. I found the characters attractive in every way, from the child who had lost her mother to confronting her own demise among unfamiliar friends. Or the rescue girl who does everything she can to save lives in the face of the disaster. Or a man who thought he could change her mind not to be such a devil and go with him to safety, to become the hero himself and save his homeland. And let's not forget how the rest of the world just drove them back, just to be forgotten, by turning the world back on the Japanese citizens looking for help. It was a good movie in every aspect. What Dick is trying to say is that this movie was not made Hollywood, it was made in Japan, that it has characters competing with other actors around the world. The effects are very nice as he mentioned, but that's all he's been waiting for. , and nothing else. He does not have the vision of what is important to everyone, and why this film had every element of feeling, grandeur and humanity. I thought this film was top-notch, and I saw many disaster films knowing that Japan Sinks was possibly one of the most original and well-thought-out projects I saw. I really hope Shinji Higuchi will make another of such films. Oh, and by the way, I'm not Japanese, though in many ways I wish I was. I am Canadian, born and raised. And an avid movie buffer in all aspects. Prejudice visions are bitter and not worth acknowledging as an opinion. Dick you have to look at it with a more open heart and mind, look not just for the eyecup that makes a movie content, look for what's more important, and understand it. They may not be American, but the Japanese have been running the market lately for some of the most awesome and fair films ever made. That's why 25,000,000 spend only on what the doctor ordered. You heard right, 25,000,000 to make this movie. Now you tell me, was it worth it? or was it worth it because American actors were not in it?
