I remember this movie heartily not to see it in the theater. I recently received a copy of VHS and it came to my mind. While this is of course not a "big budget" movie, the play is reasonably credible and the scenery, places and costumes are well done. I just wish the mammoths were more of the picture, but when you see them, they're also well done (remember, SFX was in those days without the benefit of computers, a poor devil actually had to put all those hair and fake teeth in it) on real elephants!) ... the same effect was used on the elephants in "Quest for Fire". A better than average adventure movie and a chance for the star, Rod Cameron to play something other than a cowboy, which he also did well over the years.
