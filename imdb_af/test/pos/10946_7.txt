This movie, as my Chinese friend informed me, contains two well-known Hong Kong pop stars. While it may make the movie a mere marketing stunt, I found the play acceptable, and they are both cute. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty poor. However, the vampire features and weaknesses are used in humorous ways, creating some unique entertaining pieces. The strife between the two girls made me visit, and it made a good balance with the well-executed action scenes to create an entertaining movie.
