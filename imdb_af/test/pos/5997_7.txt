This version of the Gulliver stories is definitely bizarre. The production adds a frame story (that's what it is known for) from Gulliver back to his wife and son. At a glance, unbelievable over long and sometimes failing to pay attention throughout, but the strange images and diverse cast will keep you posted. Mary Steenburgen does the best work of the cast. Danson looks a bit out of place with his American accent. The whole asylum thing is very disturbing, but is interesting and keeps the travels of Gulliver well together. Danson's character really looks crazy, but ... he had to work a little more credibly for everyone, in my opinion. Also confusing goes from present to past. Anyone else thinks the Yahoos are the ugliest thing ever to get a TV screen (or line up)? Confusion, sometimes boring, but still emphasized by some good acting, overall wonderful visual effects, and some nice parts. NBC's First Multiple Event Films by Robert Halmi, Sr. See it for yourself to decide how it works, but I'll give it * * * 1/2 (out of 5 stars).
