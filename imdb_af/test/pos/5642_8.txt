Fires on the plain directed by Kon Ichikawa and written by Shohei Ooka and Natto Wada are a film that shows the final in World War II. The Allies are fighting the ash forces, but the Japanese are fighting and struggling for their lives in the Philippines. The main characters name is Tamura, played by Eiji Funakoshi, and he is a soldier who leaves his regiment because he is sick. All he has on him is a hand grenade, his gun and some potatoes. So he tries to make his way to the hospital to get doctor and cure for his illness. But since the hospital turned him away and destroyed, he began a long walk. Tamura stays a little cowardly throughout the film, but very civilized, when the other soldiers become more like animals using their basic survival instincts, Tamura is still human and will not break it down. A scenario that has greatly influenced me to think positively and otherwise about this war film is when Tamura comes to a completely deserted Philippine town. There he fights a dog and finds many bodies of Japanese soldiers stacked in front of a church. It makes Tamura think and even more scared than he already is. It shows that the soldier is not a brave murderer, but a servant for higher creatures and humans. After turning away from the corpses, two Philippines (a couple or brother and sister: very close relationship) come back to town to get their salt back. The main character of the movie only wants to be friendly, although he walked with them with his gun, but shot the woman as soon as she started screaming. Her brother / boyfriend / husband then walks away in fear and after a moment Tamura comes after him and jumps briefly to the refugees. He didn't hit him. After Tamura drops the salt, something very precious, he drops his gun into a river. This gesture is very important to understand Kon Ichikawa's / Shohei Ooka's profiling of Tamura and the war. To compare this movie with other World War 2 movies, it's not typical at all. Of course, all movies have heroes, but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura. He speaks everything that is human: he is manipulated, he is weak, he gets scared, he has hope. It is typical for the Japanese War two movies and for Japanese society. Since World War Two, two are not a discussed theme in Japanese society, Japanese Japanese will play the role of victim in World War II. This victimization is also very visual in this movie. One of the examples is Tamura, another one who pitched the bodies of Japanese soldiers in front of the church and another is one when the Japanese soldiers try to cross a street and the Americans are already waiting for them and everything shoot. the Japanese soldiers have worse equipment and get worse and have no health equipment. In my personal conclusion, I have to say that it is worth seeing this movie to finally see a movie from the other side than usual. It also has no nationalist propaganda that could easily be built into. After watching the movie fully, you will see the horrors of World War II to its full extent.
