This is probably one of my favorites so far, although I've seen the first one and Vloek, Legacy, and Demonic Toys. The only one better than this one is PM vs DT. Curse is the worst in the series, as the first one, and then its legacy. I recommend people to it and vs. DT to see. Those who say it stinks are so wrong, the story is well written and it's a lovely movie. It's a classic movie, even younger kids can watch and not be so scared when they look at the other. Well, this is my review, you can call me Gipdac (it's easy to know where it comes from: 101 Dalmatians series, you can see it at Toon Disney at 4:00 AM). Oh and don't laugh, I'm a guy, you'll see my reviews in time. If you want to know why I see it? I'm 12! Word of advice: Have a spiritual meal, arrrroooooooooo! I also agree with your moth-1, but why people are like the other because they are more excited than horror, and because the dolls are made to look scarce. You can also call me Gipdac.
