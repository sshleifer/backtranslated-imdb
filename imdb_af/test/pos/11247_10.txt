I'm sure all Canadians on IMDb are all familiar with Canadian content, and how many of them are ... well, we'll say, clumsy. There are a few Canadian shows that are actually worth watching, but it is definitely one of them. <br /> <br /> Simple starting point. Two guys pick up girls in a bar with certain guidelines and rules, add some sensible and clever comments from a group of surprisingly equal self-declared "Alpha Males" and you have yourself some very entertaining programs. Every episode is solid. If the "players" are subparent, there are a few awkward moments to have, and there is some soft fun on them. If the "players" are good, it leads to moments that you just have to get up and applaud, and some comic praise is given to them. <br /> <br /> The premise is kind of trashy, I know, and as a guy who is usually proud of the fact that I am elevating him above typical terrible reality television, it takes a lot for me to admit that this show is actually funny and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One thing to point out is how the Comedy Network is doing a terrible job marketing this show. For the longest time I didn't even get the point, and all I knew was somehow a shirtless man who "loves cougars". However, after I watched the show, I was amazed at how surprising it is for Canadian content (despite a nice opening credit line). So give it a chance. I still found someone in the target demographic (18-30 year old men) who actually watched the show (and not just the annoying ads) it didn't like. <br /> <br /> Bring it back for a third season, Comedy Network. It's actually a good starting point, unlike some other Canadian shows you've had (coughing * girls will be girls * coughing). I usually keep 10/10 ratings for "artwork", but I have so much fun watching this show, and I think it was unfairly judged by me, which I just had to do.
