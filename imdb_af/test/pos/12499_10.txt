During my childhood, I was plagued by nightmares such as Sesame Street and the Muppet Show. I loved the programs, but when I slept, I would dream of muppets, not the ones on TV ... but not quite the one on TV. <br /> <br /> They will talk and laugh gibberish while singing and killing each other. They will eat a bite of their cute felt meat and it will tear apart, followed by arterial bleeding. NICE! But that was the past ... I LOVE THIS SHOW! I saw Peter Jackson's MEET THE FEEBLES years ago and wondered why there wasn't a similar job. Well here it is so sick, twisted and somehow socially potentially the old Hobbit's vision. <br /> <br /> If you like this show and you haven't seen, MAET THE FEEBLES, get it on Amazon or such a movie source. You're in a surprise. <br /> <br /> By the way, Clarence will totally kick Triumph's dog ass.
