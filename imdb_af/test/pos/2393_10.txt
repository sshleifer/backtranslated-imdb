I was a guest at Eddie Monroe's 30th screening and was pleasantly surprised with the story, the great acting and the talented direction. I found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film. Powerful performances by Vario, (Uncle Benny), Sara (Jessica Tsunis) and Morris (Eddie Monroe). The supporting role-play was full of colorful and amusing characters. This movie reminds me of one of those movies that you will look back on in 20 years and discover that it has launched many actors in the stars. Much like "The Outsiders" where Tom Cruise, Emilio Estavez, Patrick Swazey, Ralph Macchio, and others can be found. Look out of Hollywood, there are new stars on the horizon and they can be discovered in a small Long Island, independent movie called, "Eddie Monroe." Good work!
