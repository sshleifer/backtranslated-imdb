This movie is outstanding! On this date of April, 8, 2007, it was on demand from show time. It was a while since I saw it, but it did come to Thomas Jane in the first role I saw him. First, you see a normal guy who looks like a woman who looks like a woman who looks close to her own path. The directors I just looked at have an open scene that is cool. Paulina Porizkova is dressed as a cheerleader type, looks very fresh and warm. To try to buy a coffee late at night, with no small bills, is hurriedly hurried, Paulina says her name on her jacket is the real deal. Meeting with his old Easter player Nick, who was played by Aaron Eckhart, was initially cool and he even gave him his wife's car to look after a business. Then he sees a silver briefcase, and changes the day for the strange and violent. There is a movie of real characters acting through the next series of scenes. But Paulina's Dallas steals the show I think. Her story of a Casey story to the doctor who is there to get a personal interview in an application is scandalous. As a rule, I have never thought that tall women are so sexy, but as with any rule, there are exceptions. Paulina is like someone who has never seen her in movies. Sexy and deadly, as in one movie with Tom Selleck, but with a never before seen malicious. If you're looking for movie to add to your collection, this one is worth it. Paulina in the nude is the price alone, but this story has everything one can hope for. Love, friendship, sex and violence in a great mix. When I saw it for the first time, it thought to me and I know you'll feel the same way.
