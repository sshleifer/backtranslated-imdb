As a long-time fan of Studio Ghibli and especially Hayao Miyazaki films, I went to the movie on the first day. When I left the theater, I had this strange feeling that something was missing, the "magical" feeling I've experienced in Miyazaki movies, but I couldn't say why it failed this time. After thinking about the other Ghibli movies, I know the reason: this movie had most of the elements of a wonderful Miyazaki anime: cute characters, wonderful key animation, a good soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi compiled and the hot story that made you feel like a high quality Japanese animation movie. However, two elements are missing: a deep story and dramaturgy. The purpose of this movie was, of course, to entertain small children with a simple story line as in the case of "Totoro", such a complicated story as Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke is not really needed, but to the other hand, this story was simply too superficial. I couldn't connect to the main characters because there was no character development, dramatic scenes were limited and didn't last long. I really only hate giving 7 stars to a Miyazaki movie, because I will give 10 stars to all the previous movies, but this time it was simply not this wonderful "ghibli experience".
