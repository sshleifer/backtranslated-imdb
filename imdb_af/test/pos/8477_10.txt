Brilliant Biographical Film ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Well, that's definitely one of my many fav. Biographical film. This movie came as a total surprise to me. I avoided this movie for a very long time. Now it was because I'm not a fan of Jamie Foxx. I'm still not a big fan of him. But I'm probably a fan now. <br /> <br /> Well, he earned every BIT of that Oscar. His performance is one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. He is truly sensational! <br /> <br /> Well the story, or the story's story, is brilliant for a biographical movie. I'm a DRAMA fan, so I wasn't bored at all. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised to have had the movie so much that I didn't see any mistakes in the movie. I think there is no fault in the movie. Maybe there are some event errors. But hey who cares? <br /> <br /> The performance of the woman playing Ray's Mother was also very good. And good Kerry Washington ?? she has so much potential. If the right role is played, she may just be the next Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> Well, the story of their movie was so EMOTIONAL, so devastated. I cried? I screamed very badly ??? <br /> <br /> I don't give a damn if things were wrong or not, cuz, this movie is crazy about me crying? And it's a lot to me! <br /> <br /> All in all a SUPERB FILM ????. One of the very best of this century! <br /> <br /> 10/10
