Initially, I found it shocking to revive William Shakespeare's love masterpiece in a greedy, violent and tricky sensual film adaptation. But once you watch it, it grows on you when you see it the second and third time, as you come across the shock and start to appreciate the movie on its own merits - solid acting, good dialogue, good order and choreography , bad soundtrack and some of the (special) effects going on. Oh and also the end. What a riot!
