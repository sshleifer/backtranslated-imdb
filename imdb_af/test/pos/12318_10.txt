John Huston completed his remarkable career with one of the most perfect and sensitive movies I've ever seen. For his farewell he decided to adjust James Joyce's beautiful short story, The Dead. Not only did he make one of the most faithful literature-to-film adaptations, he also made a movie that surpassed contemporary theater more than 20 years later. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie a few years ago, as a student at the University, I was amazed at the screen and was amazed at every aspect of the movie: acting, screenwriting, direction , costumes, settings, music, cinematography. Now think about it, I still can't criticize anything about me. Huston just knew how to tell a good story. <br /> <br /> A good credit should also go to Tony Huston. He knew better than mixing with a text that is not just perfection itself, but already visually enough for the theater. Father and son let the story breathe in the long, fascinating conversations between characters and in the meaningful silence. <br /> <br /> Donal McCann also earns credit for his performance as Gabriel Conroy. I have never seen him in movies, and I haven't seen him afterwards, but he has one of the most moving shows I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Altogether, The Dead is a great movie experience. , from a legendary director who never ceased to be excellent.
