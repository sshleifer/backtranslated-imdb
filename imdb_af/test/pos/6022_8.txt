If you want to see what can be classified as the 'stage' version of GYPSY, it's the movie for you. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy a listing of the MERMAN recording of GYPSY, you really enjoy it. Means like Gypsy's mother, ROSE. I think Midler had the volume, vibrato and gifts that Merman ever had. <br /> <br /> It is not often these days, when I listen to versions of musical instruments, that I get the tingling sensation that makes my hair nod my neck, but Bette Midler shows her talent in this movie certainly how you like their apples ..... <br /> <br /> I know you may not like it, but to me is Mrs. Means the definite "Gypsy".
