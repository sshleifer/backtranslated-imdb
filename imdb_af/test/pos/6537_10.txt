This movie brought me to tears. I must say that if I did not have a beautiful man at home, I would ask this beautiful artwork to marry me. Aaron Carter gives a masterful performance as a confused young pop star, while Timothy Barton writes quick and witty dialogue that only promotes the genius of Carter's performance. Kyle is pretty gay, but his performance was nothing short of spectacular. He is also very beautiful and cute. I am thinking of asking him for a date and giving him a very nice gift. <br /> <br /> If you want to book this movie in the future, please contact me. <br /> <br /> Nick Burrell Vassar Class of 2012 Malibu, California Malibu West 310 924 0126
