I think the movie was really good. Topic, acting and Nusrat Fateh ALi Khan's music was wonderful. Although the director has managed to show the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer from the male-dominated culture, he neglected Phoolan's character slightly, focusing more on the violence facing her.
