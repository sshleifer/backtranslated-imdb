The Beguiled was one of the few early Eastwood movies I haven't seen until I gave the DVD today. And from the opening of a divorced shot to the macabre climax, I was totally indignant. Too many filmmakers replace these days with special effects, quick editing and daring camera work instead of character-driven stories, but director Don Siegel knew how to get the maximum effect of this relatively simple plot, and the characters are credible and compelling. <br /> <br /> The story relates to a women's training school that is on the verge of various screen spells during the American Civil War. The South Supporting Ladies find a very wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood); To return to health, he began to manipulate sexually frustrated women for his own purpose. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page is excellent in the role of secretary chief and her lineage in madness is subtly conveyed. For a movie that takes place almost in one place, it never loses visual interest. There is even a chance that the normal status quo, long after leaving Eastwood's operations uncovered, can return; but the mistress and pupils descend on a dark road ... <br /> <br /> It's a completely different style of movie from the same Dirty Harry's director, made in the same year. Yet they are equally beautiful. Eastwood does well against his usual stoic anti-hero image, but there is also a mysterious quality linked to his character. We never learn much from him before his detention, and the viewer is free to decide on his well-damaged persona. Villain or Victim? Whatever you think, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed it.
