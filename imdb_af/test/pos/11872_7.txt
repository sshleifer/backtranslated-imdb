It's a very good black comedy, with a good view of how different people have a different view of the same situations. The three main characters each met a girl named Jewel, played by Liv Tyler, who is another male fantasy for each of the three men. Each of the three men goes through the same situations, but when they tell others, their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two say. This is a very good concept, probably not quite original, but it works very well in the movie. The plot is very good, very bizarre and extreme, which makes it a good black comedy. The acting is equally good, none of the actors were out of place or from their league. The comedy is very black, pitch black in some scenes, and many will be accused of it, but fans of black comedy will probably enjoy it. Overall, this movie is not for everyone's taste, but most people who love black comedy will probably love it, as it is definitely one of the better black comedies. 10/07
