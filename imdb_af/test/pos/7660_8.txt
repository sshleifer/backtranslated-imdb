Hercules' son is seriously injured during a lion hunt that goes wrong. Hercules (a sturdy and engaging performance by Beef Reg Park) must be ruled in an ominous and dangerous alternative dimension by evil and avenged Gia the Earth Goddess (a glorious divine depiction by Gia Sandri) and fights several monsters save his son's soul. Meanwhile, Gia's equally nasty son Antaius (a completely hateful twist by Giovanni Cianfriglia) as Hercules and takes over a whole city as a cruel and relentless tyrant. Director Maurizo Lucidi keeps the eye-catching story on a steady pace and shows a serious tone. This movie starts a bit slow, but really starts to boil when Hercules enters the misty and dangerous underground spirit world. Comforting highlights include Hercules who are humanoid lizard cattle, Hercules climbing a giant tree and Hercules being attacked by a bunch of crawling rotting zombies. Better yet, the bizarre spirit world, just a ghostly atmosphere (must love that persistent dense clouding mist!). The harsh rough and unclear mano-a-mano great physical confrontation between Hercules and Antaius is also completely rocked. Of course, we also get a great mondo destructo climate-volcanic eruption. Allvaro Mancori's sharp widescreen cinematography gives the film an impressive range of scope. Ugo Filippini's robust, exciting score has an ingenious majestic sweep for it. Okay, so this movie is an obviously inexpensive cute job that uses abundant footage from both "Hercules in the Haunted World" and "Hercules and the Captive Women", but it is still a very lively and entertaining skirt.
