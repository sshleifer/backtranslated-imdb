This movie has become an iconic stand-in for what is great about America. <br /> <br /> Fame is known for its music and performances. There are several notable actors, singers and dancers, including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara *, and the excellent Gene Anthony Ray. <br /> <br /> The plot is not the movie. It follows an interesting format ... but it really ends in a kind of rush. <br /> <br /> Where Parker succeeds, this movie is in periodic exaggeration - with the extremely gripping, sometimes beautiful and sincere campus music movie and performances. <br /> <br /> The movie's climax is a music dance festival of musicians, dancers, and score by Christopher Gore. A wonder to see. <br /> <br /> * An interesting note about the wonderful and highly talented Anne Meara ... sometimes talent in the gene ... Meara is married to a Jerry Stiller and is the mother of Ben Stiller. ..
