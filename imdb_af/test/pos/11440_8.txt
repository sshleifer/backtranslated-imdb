My wife and I endorse all the positive comments below made by other IMDB members. Although not a victim, it has a special charm. Enjoy and heart warming. <br /> <br /> We watched it on video at the end of a long day. We were very tired and in bed. Normally in such a situation, my wife falls out in a few minutes to sleep, that is, unless it is an exceptional movie and this one has both entertained us to the end. <br /> <br /> Perhaps younger viewers in their teens and twenties wouldn't like this, but for the rest of us it's a real gem! See it!
