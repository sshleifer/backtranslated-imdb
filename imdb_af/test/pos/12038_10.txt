It's a hard movie to come to the US, but if you can find it - and you're interested in Percy Aldridge Grainger's life and music, you're getting a surprise. It is fairly historically accurate. Richard Roxborough's Grainger looks incredible like Grainger at this time. Emily Woof's Karen Holten is rather nicer than the real Karen, but it was an inaccuracy I wanted to discover (!). However, I think what really struck me was how well Roxborough Grainger's outrageous personality caught. Barbara Hershey's Rose was also a treasure. If she looks much younger than Rose did in that period, it's more than how well she caught Rose's obsession with Percy. It's an easy movie to recommend. (I must note that when she saw "Passion", my wife had no particular affinity for (or knowledge of) Grainger and his music, but she was totally captivated by the movie.
