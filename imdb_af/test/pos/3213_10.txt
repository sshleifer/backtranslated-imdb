When the Gilmore girls started in Germany, I didn't want to see them, because to me it was just something that wasn't unique. It was a series and I didn't even know anyone about it. I later realized that Edward Hermann is part of the overboard movie (a movie, I absolutely adore). I had to see it once with a friend and never stopped again. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is good to have sex before you get married and it is good to be a coffee button and to eat unhealthy things all the time. I don't do these things all the time, but if I do these things, I feel a bit like a gilmore girl. even my boyfriend started to look at them and it says something. From season to season, the scriptures and the stories improved. They have an open mind and by being different from every other show, you want to be like them.
