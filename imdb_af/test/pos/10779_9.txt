Eric Bogosian gives such a great performance as you will ever see in an Oliver Stone movie. His Barry character is an assault rifle that is disguised as a man and he blows someone away, on or off the air, which offends him. Adapted from the Bogosian play, "Talk Radio" is a horrible and terrifying ride that won't let you down until it's too late. By then, you became acquainted with racists, rapists, paranoid, wannabe assassins and mere prank callers who listen, talk and close in the dark of Dallas nightlife. <br /> <br /> Stone behaves himself, if it is possible, let Bogosse dominate every scene, from Barry's humble beginnings to make or break when his radio program can reach national syndication. The rest of the film is as excellent as the lovers and / or co-workers who are all shared by Barry and set aside. <br /> <br /> The only thing I want to change is the recurring theme music, "Bad To The Bone". I would have used Bachman-Turner Overdrive's "Not Fragile". A better song, one that I haven't heard in a movie yet and a rich, inexorable tune whose ominous riff is like the real soundtrack to Barry's life. <br /> <br /> Listen to it!
