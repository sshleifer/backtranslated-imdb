This film is sporadic on the cable, and I never really watched it, and think it would be similar to the Bruce Willis movie "In America", with the usual striking story of American freedom. But it wasn't; It was so much more! <br /> <br /> Of course, Martin Sheen is excellent; (I've never seen him in a movie I didn't love, even though the writing is bad because he's so talented). Kathy Bates is the remaining mother, and does a good job. The real surprise is Emilio Estevez, who wasn't always in the biggest movies, but also directed this movie. Please do not stereotype him from the "Breakfast Club" movie; He's so much better at this, and I wish he'd do more non-commercial, atypical Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is realistic, as we see Emilio from Vietnam, during Thanksgiving. Kimberly Williams is acceptable as the sister, who feels she is "shameful and embarrassed" by the returning soldier, her brother; He is quite alienated from the family, and especially in this time in American history, this story is VERY relevant. <br /> <br /> I have learned a lot about post-traumatic stress, and you will be truly empathetic; This is not a violent, journalistic depiction, such as 'Platoon', it's more of a character study that makes us even more interested and concerned about the effects of the war, especially if we consider the young age of the soldiers victims. . With today's violence, it is rare that a film causes one to really feel sad and shed a tear; It does it and deserves recognition.
