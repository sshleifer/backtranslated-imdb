The Soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant on parts. You should see it for its strong characterization and the risks that the plot over two troubled individuals fall in love with. You must know the story through several other reviews, so we can talk about what is brilliant about this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the two main players are so genuine and such interesting personalities. The first is a woman who has chosen from a four-year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone entering her path. The second is a man who has always wanted to be a woman, whose pain and loneliness are shown with so much sensitivity and brilliance. You hate the former and your heart is bleeding for the latter. <br /> <br /> The second thing about this movie is the whole concept of loving whoever is one, regardless of gender. So, would you still love your spouse if he / she changed his / her sex? The film explores that idea and it is beautiful. <br /> <br /> But there is one point where the movie fails. I wish the relationship between the protagonists developed in a better way. That what they feel is love does not come to the end. But watch it, and put your thoughts on this .......
