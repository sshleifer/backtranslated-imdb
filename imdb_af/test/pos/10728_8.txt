I thought this movie was pretty good and quite entertaining for a movie that is heavy on emotion. I agree with what another user wrote about the writing that is sympathetic to the three main characters. I think that's what made the movie good. It doesn't have Mr. Or Mrs. Kramer tortured and it was refreshing, I think, to see that two people essentially do the job on their own and ultimately do the best thing for Billy. And although it was a bit strange, I actually had the music in this movie. For some reason, the music seems suitable for the journey the three main characters embarked upon. This movie flowed pretty well and didn't run out, as some emotionally heavy movies tend to do. This has been a serious situation, but has not acted too seriously. It simply told the story straight ahead and it worked pretty well.
