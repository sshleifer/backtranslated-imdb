I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and I have to say I thought it was great. The combination of humor and sincerity really made the film worthwhile. The movie was about a seventeen-year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious. The seventeen-year-old, Ben, decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls and drives and lives. It is very comical and touching. I must honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. If you haven't caught one of the shows at the film festival, it's supposed to come in theaters later this year. Please see it! It's a good movie.
