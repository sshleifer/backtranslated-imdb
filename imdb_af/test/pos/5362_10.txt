This is the kind of movie they use, amusing, heart-warming, disturbing, authentic, with convincing performances by people without nose work, bucking, eye-catching, in other words real people. Shauna Macdonald plays the female love interest, and she is so much like you want to give her a hug. Imagine, a real girl in a movie, whatever? Hollywood will hate her because her freshness is a sharp reproach on every false star in Tinseltown. This story has the same hilarious feeling as Sandy Mackendrick's classic 'Whiskey Galore', with the gnome humor of remote Scottish islanders pushing out the incidents of invaders from outside and enjoying a fine drama from time to time (the actual intervals between those times are often rather short). Director Stephen Whittaker shows a scarce skill to just right it and it is shocking to discover that he died before the release of his film, just 56 years old. It was obviously a considerable loss on the screen. Ulrich Thomsen plays very well with a German rocket scientist who went to Scarp in the island of Harris in the late 1930s to build a small rocket to carry parcels between the islands. There he falls in love with the in love Macdonald lass, and she revives love. Some wonderful colorful local characters decorate the story, and the movie is pure joy. There is, of course, the threat of threatening war with Hitler, and we learn that Hitler has executed 1000 rocket scientists who refused to build war weapons, which is a shocking statistic. Tragic love is never far from the eye, but the lips must remain sealed over what ultimately happens. This film is a wonderful example of just the kind of movies people in Britain have to make. But are they properly released? In a nation whose taste has been so devastated by reality TV shows, where repulsive kidneys have become national heroes, is there even a market for a movie like this? After all, there is no grievance, there are no near-attacks of wounds or any other's genitals, there are no drugs taken, there are no senseless celebrities moving around to be watched, and therefore wondering whether there is anything. is to interest an audience that has become so decadent and saturated that only the most extreme sensations can briefly relieve the tedium of their useless existence. Anyone looking for an antidote to the emptiness of contemporary Britain can resort to this refreshing and honest movie.
