I see Saboteur as Hitchcock's first American movie because the story is entirely in America <br /> <br /> There are brilliant scenes in this movie. Statue of Liberty Scene, Barry Kane jumps into the water from the bridge, Waterfall scene is wonderful. It's not Hitchcock's fault that he didn't have the actors he wanted. Hitchcock originally wanted Gary Cooper to be the leading roles in Foreign Correspondent and Saboteur. But Gary Cooper didn't want to be excited. Another reason Hitchcock didn't get big stars was because he wasn't one of the best directors. Although Rebecca was a great success, most of the film's success continued to go to producer David O. Selznick. For example, David O. Selznick has Best Picture Oscar for Rebecca. And Hitchcock didn't get a best director Oscar for Rebecca. Hitchcock received some attention from the foreign correspondent (1940). But Universal gave him a low budget for Saboteur (1942). Hitchcock tried to get Joel McCrea for this movie because he was willing to work with Hitchcock again with a low salary. He enjoyed working with Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent (1940). But he wasn't available. So the role went to Robert Cummings. Hitchcock called Robert Cummings a skilled artist. "I thought he did his best. He was a lesser-known actor who was willing to play a role when many great actors refused to play the leading male role. <br /> <br /> As for The leading female role, Hitchcock wanted to play Margaret Sullavan or Barbara Stanwyck for the lead role. They also weren't interested in. Universal decided to give the role to Priscilla Lane. favorite movies were. <br /> <br /> I also kept the scene at Blind Man's house, this is my favorite scene, and if we get closer to the dialogue in scenes that happen in Uncle Philip's house, we'll see No matter how intense it is, Uncle Philip (Blind Man) studies Barry Kane's character as he entered his home, and when Barry enters his home he heard Barry's handcuffs, and he realized that Barry Kane was not a criminal at all We also see his hearing ability through those scenes, for example Barry hears the sound of a car, says: "Is d it a car that comes? "Uncle Philip says" 2 cars I think. "Uncle Philip was right. We see 2 cars in the next scene. Priscilla Lane played a good job. She wasn't a big star. But I thought her performance was really good. Another brilliant scene in Uncle Philip's house is the scene where he asks Priscilla Lane (Patricia Martin). "Are you scared, Pat? Is that what makes you so cruel?" I thought Otto Krueger played brilliantly the villain. Hitchcock wanted Harry Carey for the villain. But he refused. Harry Carey is known for his role, Mr. President in "Mr. Smith goes to Washington." I'd like to mention more about this movie. But I think my post gets too long. <br /> <br /> Every Hitchcock movie is special in its own way. I'm sure Hitchcock fans will keep this movie. I rate 10 out of 10.
