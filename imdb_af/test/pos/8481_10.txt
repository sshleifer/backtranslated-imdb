Jamie Foxx is definitely Ray Charles. His performance is simply genius. He owns the movie, just as Spacek owns "Coal Miner's Daughter" and owns Quaid "Great Balls of Fire." In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted upon and not played by the man himself. Ray Charles is legendary. He is well established as a musician and the music is deep, complex and innovative ~ even more innovative than I realized before watching this movie. The film has to make new adherents to a young audience who may come to know little of his music. Ray Charles's life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes far beyond just being a different film about a musician. I confess that I knew very little about the man's life until I saw this movie. I came from the impression of Ray Charles's courage, strength and innovation as man and musician.
