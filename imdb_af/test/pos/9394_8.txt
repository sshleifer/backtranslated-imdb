Hmmmm. I'm here at a loss. I mean, I know I loved Deathbed, I know I will spread the gospel of the deathbed to all my friends and acquaintances. When you read it, I ask you to see deathbed, but I can't really say why. Maybe it's the secret of its charm. <br /> <br /> Plot? Well, kind of. There is this bed that people eat (and fried chicken, apples, flowers, suitcases and any other stuff coming near) by sucking them in the digestive tract. Bed has the ability to hold the spirit of Aubrey Beardsley behind a picture to observe and tell the events of the movie. Several people then arrive at Bed's abandoned house (Bed's habit of eating something moving, giving the place an indecent reputation), and lying down to have sex, or take a nap, or because they are not feel good and eaten, sometimes dreams first have dreams. And in the end we have the explosive final confrontation between Beardsley, Bed's mom (you had to be there) and Bed. <br /> <br /> Rather look straight, if I put it this way, Well, except for the Aubrey Beardsley section. But something feels constantly off-putting, and apparently slipping the story sleepy from one scene to the next, even if it is cheap or strange effects. Imagine Bunel being crucified with Bergman and then sleeping in a big bit of Herschell Gordon Lewis. The scene of the story moves from horror to fairy tale, comedy, existential meditation, without breaking. It's a great achievement for a non-budget student booth in the Detroit area. <br /> <br /> All in all, an astonishingly small movie that can hardly ever do any revision. See it for yourself.
