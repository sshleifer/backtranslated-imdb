I saw two hands a few years ago in Sydney, and it immediately became one of my all-time favorite movies. It has action, adventure, comedy and romance all in one (and a bit of nerve use). Like many Australian films, the plot is easy to follow, but it is wonderfully interesting. Jordan must be really proud of his work. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was just on Channel 4 in London, and my two favorite comedy scenes of not only this movie, but indeed any movie, were cut out! So if you watch this movie, make sure it's the original version.
