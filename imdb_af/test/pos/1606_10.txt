It can be hard to explain how, but this movie is a masterpiece. Maybe, because I never thought a plot like this or a movie with so few words would convey all this poetry. The true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession. Bogard is incredible and unnecessary to say that Venice is used as a perfect landscape: dark, sinking and sad as Bogard's soul. And classical music is more that a simple background is guided to human feelings. In my opinion, a classic masterpiece of European films.
