Oz is a huge series, one of televised underlined shows. It has a certain relationship with soap opera, because there is something evil that always happens and that is the unfolding of every case of evil that fascinates. From my conversations with people who are actually in prison, this is true. Each interaction has some processing in the background. Behind every action there is a scheme, a plot to do somebody else. I love this series so much that it's one of the few TV shows I've bought entirely on DVD. <br /> <br /> And, yes, I agree with the author who pointed out that there are elements of satire in it. The character in the wheelchair that offers his cheerful view of life does so with a little ironic humor.
