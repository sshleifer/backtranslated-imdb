Now, more than ever, we need Peace and Love in this world! <br /> <br /> This movie shows the great music of the Broadway show and the fantastic Choreography of the legendary Twila Tharp! I saw it again after many years, and it still works well. <br /> <br /> Thanks, MGM / UA for placing it on DVD! I like the option to see in Widescreen. MGM rocks to do so on many of their DVD releases. <br /> <br /> You must love Treat Williams as Berger and John Savage as Claude. They couldn't have chosen better actors and actresses for this movie! Beverly D'Angelo is such a 'hot mom' in this movie - I just forgot how hot! WOW! <br /> <br /> The supporting role is absolutely amazing, <br /> <br /> With the late Nell Carter making a singing comedy in a few scenes, as well as the kooky Charlotte Ray (Garrett on 'Facts of Life' <br /> <br /> The story gets a little poor at the end, but the late war's sentiment of the late 60s continues and is relevant today. <br /> <br /> It's beautifully filmed (rather on the spot) and is so colorful and beautiful and really brings the spirit of 1968 back on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie It was released in 1979 when I was 15, and then it moved, and it still moves me at 40. Some other reviews here say they think it should be earlier made. I don't think Hollywood was right. to make such a movie back in the late 60's-early 70's. <br /> <br /> The Vietnam War ended in 1975, and the whole thing came a little too close to home, I think this story should be filmed beforehand (as in 1969, 70, 71) <br /> <br /> Bravo to Director Milos Foreman! I love this movie !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It's nice to see it again, this time on DVD. It never looked better!
