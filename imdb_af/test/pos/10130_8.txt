'Radio' is a beautiful film based on a true story by the mentally challenged James Robert Kennedy, the nickname 'Radio', and the soccer coach of the T.L. Hanna High School, Harold Jones. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding, Jr. is excellent as Radio! I would never suggest to him to see him in a serious performance, especially because most of the movies I see with him are comedies. Ed Harris is wonderful like Harold Jones, but this actor is great, so it's nothing new. <br /> <br /> Spiritually challenging young man James Robert Kennedy always walks around the T.L. Hanna High School, without bothering anyone and almost not noticed. On the day the soccer ball comes close to him, he decides to stay with the ball, for the impatience of Johnny Cash, one of the best players of the soccer team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you've ever met. One day Cash decides to punish James, mock him with other soccer players and even as far as to tie him up. <br /> <br /> When coach Jones discovers that terrible act, he stays angry and punishes the team, deciding to help James this day, who is nicknamed "Radio" because of his passion for radios in general. . <br /> <br /> The film shows how Radio becomes a skilled assistant, helping the team's train despite the hassle of the players, and even getting respect from basically all the people living in the small town. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a true and beautiful story. It has a life lesson, which shows us how to make a difference, even what we call "normal". Radio has a big heart and is incapable of hating anyone, and that is a thing we must all apply to our daily lives.
