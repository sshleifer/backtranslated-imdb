We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you haven't seen Oldboy (or the sympathy trilogy for the case) you are missing out on the best movies made this century. But I'm not here to talk about them. I'm here to talk about thirst. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what you would expect. Yes it is a vampire movie, but at the same time it is also a very distorted story of romance between a priest and a young girl. I won't get into the synopsis (you can read it above), but tell you what this movie is. Chan-wook Park is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception. With some very surrealistic scenes backed by intense lighting, he sets the atmosphere perfectly in almost every scene. The movie started a bit slow, but I felt it was necessary to build a relationship with the characters. Once things start moving, it can hardly ever go to the credits. "Thirst" is predominantly a love story, but not in the same sense as you would think. The relationship between the main characters is very intense, but at the same time it is almost disturbing. Chan-wook Park is no stranger to controversy as we know it, and this film is almost as much like the old-eyed taboo. The final scene is by far the strongest in the movie, and perhaps one of the best conclusions for a movie I saw. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is an exceptional movie that I feel should see all the movie buffs. It is an exciting (and otherwise) world of vampires, and the romance is far from juicy or boring. This movie is eager, selfless and beautiful in all the wrong ways. Obviously this is not for everyone, but the chance is that you are already interested in reading this review. See it. Don't hesitate
