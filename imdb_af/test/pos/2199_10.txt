The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classical writers such as Charles Dickens, and more contemporary writers such as Edward Gory. As a musical, of course, it becomes more like the musical Les Miserables. Both deal with the grim consequences of poverty in the Industrial Revolution, and the breakdown of organized society. But these musics are different from Les Mass in one very important aspect: Stephen Sondheim, the songwriter who can adapt to any style. To be sure, he had his successes and failures, but one thing about his performances, you can always rely on: They will be something unique. Who would have thought someone would write a musical about a hairdresser splashing people's throats and making them into meat pies? Sondheim did, and he did it wonderfully. The whole show was set up in a factory to represent the ever-present catastrophic effects of the misery of those at the bottom of society, which perfectly serves the needs of the show. The catwalks and elbows are moved throughout to represent streets and roads and bridges. Techniques are borrowed from Kabuki and Noh, with visual stage hands and changes. Then, throw it all off, throw the big Angela Lansbury as the horribly practical and humorous Mrs. Lovett and George Hearn, with his operational baritone voice, as murderous Todd, and you have yourself a star musical vehicle. The rest of the role goes perfectly through the clutches of the love story, except for Johanna and Pirelli, who are a little forced. If the Johanna and Pirelli of the Broadway show could be here, it would be perfect. Hearn works while singing more than Len Cariou on the OBC album, and the accents don't sound like forced here. Through that all Sondheim's score never succeeds in the darkness of the story. As I said, he can adapt to any style. In Follies he mimics the 30s 40-year-old showtunes style. In the Otros Overtures he captures the subtle art of Asian music. In the Woods, the 32-bar Disney songs beat and Assassins covers a history of American music. Here, however, he does wonders to make his performance clear English, from song songs to operative duets and solo songs to societies to Gilbert / Sullivan style patter. And yet the performance remains deadly serious, even though it is more lazy than any musical comedy. In this is still a grim warning about the evils of revenge. Here's where this movie makes a mistake by cutting the Judge's solo in which he is guilty of his crimes. Without it, the Judge is just a conventional villain, and this movie's point is that there are no straight guys. Both Todd and the Judge learn to let go, the horrors to take responsibility for their actions, and Todd loses everything in his obsession. It was well brought by the cold repetition of the grim, but rolling Ballad of Sweeney Todd, ending the show with Todd and Lovett who rose from the grave to tell us that the end is the same. In a world full of Sweeneys, revenge is just revenge. To attend the revenge of Sweeney Todd. He served a dark and vengeful God. To seek revenge can lead to hell, but everyone does it, and rarely, as well as Sweeney, such as Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber or Fleet Street.
