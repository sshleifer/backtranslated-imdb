Some people do not appreciate the magical elements of ROS, but that is what sets these ranges apart, and the fact that producers actually decided to pack the actors in a proper time - not anachronistic wings and armor! <br /> <br /> But I'm really writing to comment on a previous poster's article. Um, Michael Praed did not leave ROS to do Jules Verne! There are 15 years between these two series. Yup, I agree and Michael agrees that leaving ROS was not a good move - but it was a sought-after Broadway role that requested him in '84 and then the dynasty with his megabucks pay slips.
