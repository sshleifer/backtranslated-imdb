If this movie is at least chosen for an Oscar nominee for the best foreign film, I'll stop waking up the night. Fridrik Thor Fridriksson proved that money is not the key to making a good movie but originality. From a cold country comes a warm but thoughtful film of a mentally ill man and his struggle against a mad world. After an insight like this, you ask if the man is crazy or the world he lives in or not.
