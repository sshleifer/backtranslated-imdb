Frank Sinatra dies in this strange little short of RCO that is now in the public domain. The film came out about the same time and the war ended. This is a good plea for religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Sinatra on the podium song. After leaving the stage, he walked into the alley and found a group of children based on his religion. Instead of shouting at the boys (or helping them to do so), Sinatra delivers a nice civic lesson on religious tolerance and compares prejudice to fascism. The kids seem to get the lesson, but then Sinatra, from the blue, starts singing a song that honestly (get it?), Kids would have hated. He had a beautiful voice, but unfortunately I think it detracts from the excellent message he has given the children about tolerance. It's a good message with too much singing - even if the man is singing Frank Sinatra. It's also an interesting curio - a nice historical piece that is often overlooked ... plus it gets pretty even though it looks slim.
