Michael Kehoe has achieved good results, especially as it is just his second start as a writer, manufacturer and director. Generally speaking, "first timers" are lacking in vision and direction when a large production is cut, but "Dominion" proves that Kehoe places in Hollywood go! Since beautiful scenery, Dominion has experienced experienced members (especially Thomerson & James) who communicate Kehoe's vast vision with exceptional clarity. Few movies can feel the slasher / horror genre mix with real action / adventure, but Dominion has achieved it completely. This movie certainly qualifies as one of the leading films in both of these categories. If you're looking for quick action with more than a kind of voltage, look no further. I look forward to Kehoe's future projects with great enthusiasm. Well done!!!
