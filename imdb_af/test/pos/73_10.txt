Yes, I am a romantic kind of music and comedy and it fits the bill! Julie Andrews at the beginning and end of this movie gives an enchanting performance with the production number "Whistling in the Dark". The rose number she does in the middle of the story when she believes Rock Hudson sees a dancing / calling girl is obvious and will make you fit. <br /> <br /> I just wish this movie could be found in video or DVD, because I will definitely buy it in a heartbeat for my home library!
