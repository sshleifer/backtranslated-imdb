Plane apart, I don't think I've been laughing so much in my entire life in a movie. <br /> <br /> I love football, but I tend to hate almost any song or movie about football if they tend to be unrealistic. It wasn't. <br /> <br /> I watched it once, it was over 2 years ago and it was brilliant. Everyone I know loved it. I remember the gay physio, the angle at about a 45-degree angle and 'Shoes' (a player so named because he once arrived for training in a new pair of shoes). Brilliant, that's what happens in park football. <br /> <br /> A certain 10/10. If someone from the TV industry reads this, taking into account all the crap you are repeating on English, you have the sense to show it again (and the Muppets while you're there). Also, someone knows whether it has been shown on BBC or ITV. I think it was ITV, so it's worth asking if they want to show it again. They must do.
