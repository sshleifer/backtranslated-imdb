A sentimental, heartbreaking family movie that took place in England in the 1920s. A young Elizabeth Taylor wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter the Grand National; Fortunately, ex-jockey Mickey Rooney is giving Liz some help. Director Clarence Brown shows some remarkable control with material that could be excessive in someone else's hands. He and writers, Helen Deutsch and Theodore Reeves, take great care to establish true characteristics and, of course, develop the story. True, there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced, but overall it is fairly influenced, and mysteriously filmed in Technicolor. The race itself is very exciting, and like many good classic players there is a wonderful three-handed fade-out at the end. Liz proves that she was a true troop from the start, and Rooney - who I usually find rather annoying - is surprisingly muted and really good. Donald Crisp is frightening as Liz's grumpy father and Angela Lansbury are delighted as her older, sickly sister. However, most of the acting kudos belong to Anne Revere, who has won a richly earned supporting actress Oscar who has Liz's wise and caring.
