Deepa Mehta's "Fire" is groundbreaking, bold and artistic. A masterful social commentary on the fate of women of conservative Indian households in the middle of the middle class, this is a film that no one should miss. Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give star performances by underlining their characters as much as possible. A.R. Rahman's music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film. Mehta uses Rahman's score and together they create such incredible sound settings that effectively depict the views of the world around Radha and Sita when looking at each other for support. This movie is not about lesbians, as many have branded it. Lesbianism is just part of the movie. It is a pity that most people tend to write the movie to name it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning.
