Call Bollywood to anyone with a little familiarity with the genre and the images that are usually erected are sticky, over the top music numbers accompanied by costumes that make Vegas look like a bastion of conservatism. This perception is not helped by the curse of oppression that invades most movies that Bollywood has approached from an outsider's perspective. Willard Carroll's romantic comedy Marigold, however, takes a different branch. It's not a nudge-wink wink watching the stupid people and their rude antics, but a sincere appreciation for Bollywood for its vitality, its lack of irony and self-awareness. It is clear that the director has a great love and respect for Bollywood, while at the same time being confused by his kitschier aspects. And if you're familiar with Bollywood, you can appreciate what he's doing here to make a true hybrid of Hollywood and Hollywood movie conventions. From one of the opening shots, a setback of the Salman character as a child at sea, talk to his grandmother (played by Helen! - how many Salman movies start with the same point of departure?) To the flashback sequence shown in the movie Marigold and Prem are filming, everyone who has seen enough Bollywood movies will recognize these references. The story itself also contains proven conventions of both Hollywood and Bollywood? the fish from the water meets the service-to-one family at the expense of personal fulfillment. The structure of the film follows the typical Bollywood plot line of the more comical setup of the first half which gives a more dramatic second resolution. Yet, the sensitivity of the movie is ultimately that of Hollywood, with its underestimated, furious humor and the story of a woman who believes in herself to affirm herself. <br /> <br /> You couldn't have inspired a movie by Bollywood if there were no musical numbers and this movie didn't disappoint with seven of them. However, unlike Bollywood, the songs are not ejected from anywhere and characters are transported to a European local or Goan beach. they exist as musical numbers that form part of the film being made, reminiscent of how musical numbers in Busby Berkeley movies were justified as part of a stage show. Or do they come from a situation where music already has a reason to be there ?? a sexy nightclub scene where Prem Marigold learns to dance or a beach scene where there are musicians (including a singer Shaan's cameo). Everything reflects the emotional state of the protagonists at the time in the movie. Often the music will take a conventional song from one genre and make a twist on it. So in one of the highlights of the film where Marigold comes in herself, is the song play quite typical of his genre? the female star singing and dancing under a row of women? but in this case it is blond Ali Larter who looks like a total natural Bollywood movie star, emotion and lip sync with the Hindi lyrics without captions. <br /> <br /> Also synonymous with Bollywood is great visuals and Marigold meets that aspect beautifully thanks to some of the top talent working in Bollywood today. The cinematographer is Anil Mehta, who was also the film artist of Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The choreographer is Vaibhavi dealer and production designer is Nitin Desai, both from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. You can really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam on this movie? In fact, the illuminated floor in one of the numbers was originally from Dholi Taro Dhol, who happens to have a built-in Marigold pattern. <br /> <br /> As far as the cast is concerned, Carroll obviously has a love of watching acting talent, as evidenced by playing by heart ?? one of the first movies for both Angelina Jolie and Ryanne Phillippe. And in this movie he touches the point again with Ali Larter. One of the main reasons the film works is because of Larter. She makes a bitchy, unattractive character sympathetic and her subsequent transformation credible and she is smart, funny and sexy because she is smart and funny. She and Salman share excellent chemistry and this is one of the greatest strengths of the film. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan plays Prince Charming's role here as filtered through his iconic role as Prem. It's old school Prem, so expect a quiet, muted Salman - those who used it in his regular strip of avatar could be disappointed? or relieved! It is a sincere and sensitive view of him, only through the poor configuration of his English lines. <br /> <br /> With a refreshing lack of cynicism and unmistakable embrace of romantic love, the film is a love letter for Bollywood and Hollywood movies. from yore.
