These two disk sets are incredible! If you're like me and never had the opportunity to really see the band, then this is the next best thing. Jimmy Page, which in my opinion is the second best guitar player ever to conquer the face of the earth (second only to Slowfingers himself), puts an incredible performance in every piece of footage in this movie. John Paul Jones, though not as well as Page, sits on one hell of a show. Although in its vibrant atmosphere its spatial bass lines are not so defined, it is on studio recordings, except of course in songs like Dazed and Confused, or Wat is and which should never be), but its wide variety of instance talent is well displayed in these DVDs. John Bonham is John Bonham, what can I say? There is no comparison, its beats look like no other, and this DVD is proof. Last but not least, Robert Plant calls as nobody else can cry. If you've ever read Hammer of the Gods, you'll wonder what is the same as Page when he met Robert Plant, why isn't the man already known? And so my review, sorry and spelling or grammatical errors, includes Zeppelin rocks.
