This one gets better with every new look. Certainly one of Paul Sorvino's best roles. Outstanding music score which was also excellent on soundtrack LP (so why is there no CD?). One of the very early dolby stereo audio movie releases. By the way, the original 35mm theater trailer for this is really GREAT!
