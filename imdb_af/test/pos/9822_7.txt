I read about 10 reviews of this movie, but didn't "take one of them" to heart. Harrison Ford is criticized for everything from his haircut to his earring and I really don't see what any of these things have to do with the movie. As I recall, he had bad hair and bad reviews in Blade Runner, but it's still a favorite among our video files. It is slower than the majority of its previous films, but not worthy of the tricks it received. <br /> <br /> I'd like to pay $ 7.50 just to see a bare Harrison Ford.
