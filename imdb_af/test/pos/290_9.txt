Breathtakingly at its best, intriguing at its worst, Francis Ford Coppala's pioneering epic "Apocalypse Now" is one of the most iconic and celebrated films of the 20th century, and in my opinion, the largest film feature centered around America's involvement in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> What I like most about "Apocalypse Now" is that it is uniquely different from any other movie of the same genre. I experienced great movies, and watched with great interest in war films. They tried to portray the "images" and "feelings" of Vietnam, but failed unsuccessfully. Films such as 'Hamburger Hill' and 'We were soldiers' fall into the category of trying to determine the atmosphere of Vietnam by portraying 'heroic battles' which are more often delivered by the zeal of Hollywood movie production. /> In 'Apocalypse Now' there are no battles, no heroes or villains. There is nothing in the film to suggest that it is intended to reflect the images of Vietnam through the physical aspects of the war. On the contrary, it is a film that vigorously investigates and explores the human psyche when it is tormented by the absolute "abomination" of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century. <br /> <br /> The sheer sheen of the play (especially the interpretation of taciturn Captain Willard by Martin Sheen), along with the spectacular filmmaking (filmed in the Philippines), which is an important realism in the context of the movie render Apocalypse Now an unforgettable epic. /> <br /> To evoke a myriad of emotions and leave us with a stream of mediation, "Apocalypse" is not for the light-hearted movie-maker. This is a masterpiece that requires multiple views to be fully appreciated.
