It's easily one of my favorite musicals of all time. Bette Midler comes so close to the real magic of the screen as anyone in her turn as Gypsy Lee's blustery, bosom, brave and very, terrifying mother. She calls for a feeling of despair that is sometimes comical and tragic, but always genuine and beautiful. Such charm and grit she is indeed a pioneer woman without a boundary. The border was discovered for the children. Who in turn has to conquer their own in a world controlled by their dominant mother. <br /> <br /> This particular version is, as I understand it, in its entirety including the brilliant choreography of Jerome Robbins, as well as the original stage directions.
