Alfred Hitchcock's more convincing narrative of a movie he made twenty-one years earlier is infinitely better than the original. Hitchcock said his first version was the work of an amateur, and although it is definitely not a bad movie, it seems right. That being said, this remake, though definitely better, is still not under Hitchcock's best work. It is certainly not to say that it is not good, it is just over a little unsaturated and it pulls it off. Hitchcock seems too eager to pull out some elements, which are parts of the movie that aren't quite relevant to the plot, which can be annoying. Some of these stretched rows, such as the one that sees James Stewart and Doris Day, eat in a Moroccan restaurant, are good because it helps determine the different culture our American protagonists found themselves, but for every restaurant there ' an opera sequence and it is the latter that makes the movie worse. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a middle-aged doctor and his wife who goes to Morocco for a holiday with their young boy. As they meet there, they meet a French man on the bus and another middle-aged couple in a restaurant. But things go wrong if the French man dies from a knife in the back, shortly after he whispered something to the doctor. The holiday then becomes a full blown nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped, causing them to cut it short and go to London to try and find him. The film has a very high degree of paranoia about it, and it manages it throughout. In fact, I will even go so far as to say that this is the most paranoid movie Hitchcock ever made. Like most of Hitchcock's movies, this one is very exciting and keeps you on the edge of your chair almost all the time, with only the aforementioned opera sequence standing out as a moment in which the voltage diffuses. There's also more than a little humor in the movie, which gives the sad relief to the morbid acts, and actually works very well. <br /> <br /> The original version of this story is superbly supported by the fantastic Peter Lorre. Unfortunately, this film does not come from his presence, but it is made by performances by the incredible James Stewart and Doris Day. James Stewart is a man who will always be a contender for the 'greatest actor of all time'. His collaboration with Hitchcock all has a surprising view of him, and this one is no different. (Although his best performance remains one in Smith Goes to Washington). Stewart wears all the courage, belief and sadness of a man who has lost his child and will do everything to get him back brilliantly. In fact, this is one of the best things about this movie; You are really able to feel the couple's loss throughout and it serves to make it more exciting. Doris Day, on the other hand, is a strange decisive choice for this movie. She is definitely a good actress, but she is more associated with musicals and sees her in a thriller rather strange (though she can slightly bend her vocal chords). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned; It's not Hitchcock's best movie, but there is plenty to enjoy and although I recommend many Hitchcock movies before recommending this one, I'll definitely give it two thumbs.
