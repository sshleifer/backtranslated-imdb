I really loved this movie. I thought it was done very well. The character interaction was done wonderfully as the characterization was. The actors were definitely credible. The plot was very deep and intriguing. Although parts of it are a bit slow and sometimes a bit boring, it is definitely worth looking at several times. The chemistry between the three main actors was wonderful. If you don't want to see it, at least look for the drama between the characters. I mean, the whole thing was just "Whoa!" It was as if I couldn't look away. The whole movie caught my attention and kept my interest, even through the slow parts. I loved this movie and almost everything about it. I loved the end because it was so interesting and, if you watch the movie a second time, make it perfect. But I don't spoil anything.
