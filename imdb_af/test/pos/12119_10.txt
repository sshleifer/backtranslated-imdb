Samuel Fuller knows war, and is one of the only directors in American film history who can accurately portray their terrible experiences in a form such as the movie. His pessimism and idealism, if it is a bit odd to mix up, work for him as a storyteller, and at the same time he is always out to tell the truth, but brutal (or in melodramatic constructs). Banned, however, deals with post-war experience, as we only get the big boom of the WAR in bold in the opening scenes for a point. The opening shot is like a big exclamation mark that apparently continues in the rest of the scenes: a dead soldier on the ground, the camera pans, we see another soldier shot in war-torn terrain. Simple, direct language. Then Fuller broke the intensity with something interesting: the title song played over the opening credits as irony and sincerity, and then Beethoven music about a shooting between Americans and the Nazis. Sgt David Brent (James Best) was shot, the battle continued, and then it was reported that he was being treated for his wounds. <br /> <br /> It can lead to one believing that it will be a somewhat conventional WW2 movie (somewhat in that one will usually not find Beethoven, and later to some extent, Wagner in placed these images), but this is not the case. Instead, Fuller makes it a 'Coming Home' kind of movie, but not in the sense that 'this soldier comes home and so forth'. Instead of really going home, Brent stays in Germany, as he has hit Helgen (Susan Cummings over the heels), and he wants to work less in the army. can marry her. What he doesn't realize is that a) she wants more for money, so she can get herself and brother food, but it becomes emotionally complex at the point of revelation for the slightly naive, but sad Brent, and b) there is an underground Hitler youth secretary called the Werewolves, which was planning to pick up where Hitler ended - small, despite the argument within the group - by the many government now embedded in Germany, fall to give them, like Brent, a blood transfusion. "With this, plus footage from the Nuremberg trials, and (as told, I think, by Fuller himself) a quick, non-pushing history of the Nazi war crimes, we get a multicolored look at a society in the harsh environment of an immediate post-war environment, while Rossellini deals with Germany Year Zero in his own way, Fuller tackles it low: first there is the love story, or what is the tragic downfall of a man who has nothing can see what he thinks should be reasonable, that it is his wife and a child on the road that he can't leave, to the revelation that he was (partially) swam. Baker and Cummings, with Harold Daye as Helga's young, confused brother, performing with the greatest detail on emotions; it is not very easy B-movies, although they could have been, then another layer is the political one, the struggle of a society to conquer, and a mentality made sensational by Fuller in order to make the Nazis a tota le non-gray area: they are angry, especially when they cancel the reason to reach their goals. <br /> <br /> Lastly, there's the lowest style, which is oddly absorbing. This is probably one of Fuller's talkie movies, which is not bad, as it is one of his best written scripts, as the characters do not speak either plain or in too much platitudes (with the exception of a small scene where two Characters are talking about the Hitler youth and juvenile delinquents, which, according to Fuller's autobiography, are probably another layer to be taken into account in the subtext and the 50s period of movies, and Fuller almost shoots it in a true European style , when not for battle scenes or battles, as editing is not always very fast and sometimes a cut will not happen for a full minute or longer, there is a strange tension coming from this, especially if there is something said by a character who is another one who is wild or suspicious, Fuller can easily go for a big close-up, but there is a more sinister, cold quality not to two people in a conversation move away without a simple over-the-shoulder ear not. But if needed, Fuller, like the big noise outside the US military office or the Nuremberg footage in Franz's reminiscences of the Werewolves, could be a beautiful stylist. <br /> <br /> Very hard to find, but it's worth it if you're also a fan of the director or WW2 movies in Germany - or even just a history buff-banned! is an intellectual experience and a strong emotional one, with a role better than expected from a B-movie, and an attitude towards the "other" who is equally damning and thoughtful.
