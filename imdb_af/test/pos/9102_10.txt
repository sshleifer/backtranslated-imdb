I absolutely loved every minute of this movie. Jack Black and Kyle Gass have certainly brought the thunder in this epic story of friendship, hard rocking and fate. <br /> <br /> Filled to the edge with unnecessary curse in every sentence, toilet noise and general rule break attitude, this movie is a must for the hard core, solid D-fans of the world. <br /> <br /> We are following the journey of young Jables (Jack Black) and Kage (Kyle Gass) while trying to make the choice to win the open Mic night and to get the best bond on the planet. be. The duo must overcome obstacles such as a room full of lasers, a man with one leg and the devil to accomplish their task. I'll let you see if they do it or not. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack itself is wonderful enough, and now we see the D personally, which makes the experience even more magical. A must see for anyone who calls themselves a stubborn D-fan. Watch out for the inside jokes of the first album!
