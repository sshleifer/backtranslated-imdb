I watched this movie countless times, and never feminized, because it is homemade simplicity, sincerity and goodness. Great characterization by all the role-players and the beautiful little steam trains that play such an important supporting role. I admit that I fell in love with Roberta in 1970, and she still touches me today. On Christmas Day on television in New Zealand, the most beautiful gift I could have had.
