The other reviewers are WAAAAY, which is why the Farscape show was temporarily interrupted. It has nothing to do with the quality of the shows' slacking. In fact, the exact OPPOSITION is true. They are getting better and better! :) I saw every episode and when you just saw them, so you really get in touch with how much cooler it gets while moving on and off, and the pitcher and Aeryn subplots are really very interesting and give it more vibe, no less . . Before it was so chaotic, slow, and rather aimless. They spent like the first two seasons running out of this enemy, but in the second two they were actually trying to do something. Also, I've never seen such a good combination of sexy gals and attitudes in Sci-Fi. The blue girl - Zahn - was cool, but not "sexy". They literally came to the point where the gals ran around in leather cords and high heels shooting aliens. Now tell me what could be cooler than that? :)) <br /> <br /> The reason why Farscape went for a bit is because it costs too much - and that's a good thing for the fans, because the show that has finally looked is really like a 60-hour epic movie, with all the movie art of the flashy stuff (ok, they use very similar sets, but the CG is good and the gals are sexxxy.) Blah blah - the real reason is because TV- profit trading programs. It's a BUSINESS, and the Sci Fi channel or those who couldn't get such a return on this expensive Farscape show as they could do with junk is like "Stargate". Lexx was actually cool until they got rid of the hot German girl and replaced her with this bizarre fatness. <br /> <br /> Anyway, yes, remember: Farscape is getting better and better until it really was a little real movie every week. Then the networks decided: "Hi people will watch an old piece of dung, we're moving on the air as long as it's the only sci-fi at that hour, so why do we spend all this money on Farscape, let's 'Budget' Stargate "people's throat and call it a" hit series "because it's like everything we play every night LOL :)) <br /> <br /> That's the way it goes. says that Claudia Black is a very cool actress, after having received her face reform, she looked very cold - one of those dynamic types like Judy Davis, and sometimes hot, sometimes ugly, like a rollercoaster ride. with Lucy Lawless in style and substance parking - both fun to watch - not just Chrichton :) And yes, you can say the pregnancy was grim, but how many sci fi shows have a LOVELY and DEEP romantic subplot that is actually going somewhere and progressing It was really cool as a novels story - the actors on the show are wonderful. toning is currently in limbo, but I hope it will be back in more episodes and movies soon, because I will definitely buy them! :-D
