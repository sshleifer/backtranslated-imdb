I know the girl who did the skate for the head girl. She once dated my brother and she was always really nice! I also live in Cranbrook B.C, about 15 minutes from Fort Steele. Haha I went there for field trips when I was in primary school. It was a bit strange to see it in the movie. I also had the chance when the movie was filmed to be an extra because there was a decisive call for them at the mall. But I didn't like it, because I didn't want to act. Now I totally wish I did. It was such a fantastic movie I bought from Ebay. It never came out here (which is strange because it was partially filmed here), so I was excited when it came. I really loved the story line and the polar bear was kind of cute. But if someone has a question about Fort Steele just ask away :)
