SOME LARGE SPOILERS, YOU ARE WARNING <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at Venice's film festival, and I have to admit it was a fan, it was VERY IMPRESSIVE. Excellent graphics, excellent music, excellent dubbing, excellent action ranges and so on ... BUT there is one. ALL movie is thought exclusively for the gamers who loved it, and so can enjoy every reference, character, inside joke (you have to joke with winning music that is especially comic). A poor man who does not see in the world of FF, of course, sees the greatness of technical part, but cannot see the inner gratification to see, eg. Barret appearing BAHAMUT TOTAL FROM NEWS. He'll ask himself, "WHO IS THIS GUY?" And I can't blame him. He can't even understand what a gamer feels like when he opens the game's music in the OPENING EXPERT, Nanaki runs in the canyon with his two cubs, crying at Midgar's ruins and then 498 years ago. Almost all the characters made a look or quote (including Reeve, Tseng and Elena), and Reno & Rude were really goofies and comedians to watch, but the final impression left to me by the movie was "hardcore gamer's last dream, but much less for a MOVIE fan ... ".
