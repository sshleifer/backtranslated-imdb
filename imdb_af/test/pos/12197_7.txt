If vampire stories are your cup of blood, then this goth festival based on the Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles should be a satisfying experience. A true consortium of the undead in a contemporary environment, 'Queen of the Damned', led by Michael Rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness, and of the unfortunate souls living there forever. <br /> <br /> The Vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), bored with a world that no longer excites him, has been "asleep" for many years. but suddenly hears the sounds of the world of his prolonged slumber change, and likes what he hears, what he is trying to investigate. What he finds is a world of new sounds, a new kind of music - driving and penetrating - sounds like the senses and makes him feel alive. And he knows his time has finally come that it is time for him and those like him to come out and face the world on their terms. By that end he became the leading man for a band - a singer and performer, unlike the world ever knew. He introduces himself as a vampire and quickly gathers another that extends beyond London (where it all starts) and will eventually take him to Death Valley, California, where he intends to give a concert that promises to something to be anything else. have ever seen or experienced. <br /> <br /> Lestat is powerful, undoubtedly, but there are some of its kind that do not find it satisfactory. One of them is Marius (Vincent Perez), a vampire powerful in his own right - the vampire, in fact, who Lestat has made so many years before - and meets, meets and plans to make Lestat at the concert. meet. And they don't go for the music. But there is something else too: at one point, Lestat accidentally woke up the "Mother" of them all, the most powerful of all the vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), who made her presence known and especially to the one she chose. to rule on her side as her King: Lestat. And at the concert, be assured Akasha will be present without delay. <br /> <br /> Don't make a mistake, it's Lestat's story and Rymer offers it in an atmosphere and rich, with many beautiful moments, although its film bites less when it says, "Maintenance With the Vampire" , or "Bram Stoker's Dracula." He does a good fit, and there are a few scenes that offer real excitement, but the film is generally not as threatened as it can be, or as much as one expects. In the final score, in fact, the amount of meat being burned wins over the actual blood raising, although there is more than a taste of gore, and more than a fair portion of the lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff . There is also good F / X, especially in the rows that emphasize the speed of the vampires, as they move faster through the air than the naked eye can discern. This is a decent job by Rymer, but he could have put more teeth into it if he played the alienation from Lestat; As it is, you get a sense of its debauchery, but not enough to get you completely involved. <br /> <br /> In "Maintenance With the Vampire," Tom Cruise has some charismatic strength to the role of Lestat, but Townsend is even more effective, with a look and an attitude that captures Lestat perfectly. He plays him with a sense of acceptance, and under close scrutiny you can even find a hint of repentance and longing. It's a good thing, and one that sells his character convincingly. <br /> <br /> Like Marius, Vincent Perez also does a good job - he is actually one of the strengths of the movie - although his character is a bit ambiguous; However, this has more to do with the way he was written than with Perez's performance, which is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Also, Marguerite Moreau, like Jesse, is a young woman who is too curious for her own good; and the beautiful Lena Olin as Maharet, Jesse's Aunt, who ultimately plays a key role in the outcome of the drama of Lestat and Akasha. <br /> <br /> And as Akasha, Aaliyah is an absolutely resounding presence. What more can one say about her than she is a gifted artist, with tremendous talent and beauty. And tragically she left us too soon. <br /> <br /> The supporting film includes Paul McGann (David), Christian Manon (Mael), Claudia Black (Pandora), Bruce Spence (Khayman), Matthew Newton (Armand), Tiriel Mora (Roger) and Megan Dorman (Maudy). With a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre, Anne Rice fans will be especially pleased with the Queen of the Damned. A film made and delivered by director Rymer and his engaging cast. By drawing attention to the drama of the story - and the way it is presented - rather than concentrating on just a few cheap tensions, Rymer managed to portray a real horror movie that definitely made a cut. above, and one that may only touch your appetite for more of the same. And it's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
