When the Romulane comes, they will not wear gifts; no, they bring war with them - war and conquest. Knowing this episode, it is a redux of the fifties' movie "The Enemy Below". The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American destroyer and German U-boat) involved in deadly war games, it is two star ships in outer space. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, the Earth fought the Romulan wars. After about 5 years of conflict, a deadlock resulted in a treaty and the establishment of the Neutral Zone, a border between us and the Romulane Empire. Now, on this star, it seems that the treaty is broken, as our outposts are attacked and destroyed by a weapon of tremendous power. Yes, the Romulane is back, testing their new war stuff, and Kirk now has to earn his wages: he has to make decisions that influence this sector of the galaxy, such as finding out how to avoid a ... an interstellar war, maybe? <br /> <br /> I think what makes this episode so effective is that it doesn't move away from the grim aspects of war, as one would expect from a mere television episode from the sixties - especially " an episode of a science fiction show. It's all very tense and gripping, like the best war movies, like when Kirk is sitting with his key officials for what a war council is. The authors and the actors do not kick around here: it is all preparing for a terrible conflict, possibly the start of another year-long battle. In the final analysis, Kirk's aim is to keep this battlefield only for the two ships - but even then, it is a quest that causes danger and possible casualties. In fact, I believe this episode holds the record for shipping accidents at the end. At the beginning of the episode, we see the devastation that such a battle can produce in that well-protected outpost. Then start the cat-and-mouse war games between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship. It's as exciting as any conflict we've seen on the big screen. Of course, if you are not into war movies, look at other things to admire in this episode. <br /> <br /> What further raises this episode is the revelation of just what and who the Romulans are - it's a kind of electric shock. Now we have even more conflict between crew on the bridge of the business. War tends to be the worst in some people. Due to even more attitudes about race in this future, the tension is growing even further - Kirk has his hands full in this one. I suppose the one weakness in the story is the convenient delivery of the malicious issue through the conclusion. On the Romulan side, actor Lenard made his first appearance in the Trek universe as the Romulan commander; He is awesome in the role, the flap side of Capt. Kirk of Capt. Pike, make your choice, to look more than a little on Spock. Surprisingly, his character is not hungry as we would expect, another eye-opening for this episode. The actor will return to this universe next time as Sarek, Spock's father, so he's nothing if it's not versatile. It also tells how the first appearance of such characters as the Romulane is usually their best shot, as it is here. They appeared next in the "Enterprise Incident".
