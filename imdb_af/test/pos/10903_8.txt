IN & OUT, in my opinion, is a very hilarious movie. I thought Cameron (Matt Dillon) was wrong to say that Howard (Kevin Kline) was gay. The part I liked most was Howard's bachelor party. This was because they had many jokes, including Barbra Streisand movies. I also thought Emily (Joan Cusack) looked pretty beautiful in her wedding dress and that Howard was looking well in his smoke. My favorite quote from IN & OUT is: "Is everyone gay? Is this" THE TWILIGHT ZONE "?" It was absolutely hilarious! The one character I couldn't stand was Sonya (Shalom Harlow). It was because she was very arrogant and cuddly. Finally, I recommend this movie to all your Kevin Kline fans who haven't seen it. Be prepared to laugh and have a good time when you see it.
