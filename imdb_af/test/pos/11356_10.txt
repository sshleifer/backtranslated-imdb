I think the film critic Elvis Mitchell of the New York Times has best written a response from In the Mood for Love when he said it was "dizzy with a romantic spirit missing forever from the theater." How true are those words! Really romantic movies are so scarce nowadays, while movies that contain lots of sex and nudity (often rendered in a rude and free way) are abundant. So, given this movie climate, Wong Kar-wai's latest movie feels like a much needed breath. In the Mood for Love is about the doomed romance between two neighbors ("Mr. Chow," played by Tony Leung and "Mrs Chan," played by Maggie Cheung), whose wife has an illegal relationship. to be like them. "But when they came together with lonely nights (while their spouses are calling on a sick mother), they fall in love and resist the temptation to go too far. <Br> /> Several factors are responsible for making In the Mood for Love a new classic among "romantic melodramas", in the best sense of that term. First, the specific period of the film (ie 1960s Hong Kong) is faithfully restored to An amazing amount of detail: the clothes (including Maggie Cheung's beautiful dresses), the music (eg Nat King Cole) and the overall atmosphere of this film evoke a nostalgia for that particular period, secondly, Christopher Doyle's award-winning , stunningly beautiful cinematography creates an environment that not only embraces its two main characters, but apparently flushes with romantic desire in each of its beautiful, meticulously crafted frames. An 2001. (It should also be mentioned that Wong Kar-wai's ordinary hypnotic visual style (understandable) was burnt down for this movie, although his palette remains just as colorful.) Third, there is the ghostly count of Michael Galasso, which goes along with slow motion sequences of, for example, Chan walks in her elegant dresses, Chan and Chow while hitting each other on the stairs and other beautiful scenes that remind themselves. The main score - which sounds his instruments as if they are literally crying - is heard eight times by various points in the film and it serves to highlight the grief and longing that the two main characters feel. Fourth, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung both perform great performances (Leung won the Best Actor Award in Cannes) and they achieved real chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> Comparing and working the above elements together creates a film that feels timeless, "dizzyingly romantic," and in a word of magic. In the Mood for Love, perhaps more than any other movie of 2001, I reminded myself why it is that I love the movie. And I think it's about the highest compliment I can pay for a movie. <br /> <br />
