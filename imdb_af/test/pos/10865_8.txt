I started to watch it expect the worst, and I was delighted to find that the movie seems to be enjoyable, slightly confusing in parts, like just starting to sing. It gave me the chance to see Daniel Wu for the first time in action, he's a better actor than I thought. He was sometimes a bit out of place. I thought Purple Storm deserves its Hong Kong legend release, as it differs from most other HK movies, it's about a man's emotional battle when faced with memory loss, it may sound corny, but when he finally hand out what and who he actually is This makes the movie much more interesting. As soon as you get into the movie, you'll find yourself grabbing it, as if you're missing one, and much of the movie will make sense. For example, I missed a little at the beginning and I recommend to anyone who sees it they miss nothing about it. So I can say that this movie was worth watching and a gratifying surprise to me that I enjoyed it.
