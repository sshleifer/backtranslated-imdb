An indifferent lineage in psychological and physical oblivion that undoubtedly conceals images of the true brutality and suffering of war in your cerebral cortex in a way that will not have many other films. In fact, there is simply no other war film like this. <br /> <br /> Director Kon Ichikawa dropped the unimaginable horror of Hiroshima's first hand just 10 days after the bomb. He said that from that day on, it would always be his mission to express the useless, empty violence that people and themselves are bringing to one another. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ichikawa tells us that there are no winners in the war ... because the roads for victory and defeat are paved with the same soldiers heading for roads that have only death and destruction. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ichikawa succeeds in bringing his message to the world through this haunting piece of theater.
