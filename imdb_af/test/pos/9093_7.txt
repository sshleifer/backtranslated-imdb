The basics of Flatliners are fairly simple. Several medical students have put themselves to death to find out exactly what the brain is doing during the event. It sounds like something a gang of bored students would do for a joke, but it forms the basis of some very creepy substories. In today's world, where Hollywood has to devise my foreign markets for the ideas of making a horror movie, Flatliners is one of those rare gems that shows Hollywood can do something different if it's hard enough. <br /> <br /> What separates Flatliners from many movies based on this premise that comes out today is that it doesn't push to be condescending or arrogant. Flatliners admit that people are going to movies to be entertained, not to moralize. In this kind of supernatural thriller, the difference that makes this restraint really is incredible. What is even more incredible is that Julia Roberts appears without being annoying or showing that she can only play Julia Roberts. The theory of darkness, that performing artists do their best work with the smallest audience, is here. <br /> <br /> The subplots of what the characters find during their loss are just about anything they make alive, and how they fall back on their current time is surprisingly good. The moments when William Baldwin's character finds his personal videotape come back to haunt him is especially interesting. That William Baldwin looks so good in the role says a lot about the writing or the direction. I'm not sure what. <br /> <br /> Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, really looks like the lead. One really feels to him the mystery of what past experience enters into and why unfolds. As Kevin Bacon's character goes looking for an old schoolgirl whose life he made hell and tells her how sorry he is, it becomes clearer what the movie is about. We can try to change the past as much as we want, but that's what we do with the present that matters most. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of Flatliners is how it reaches an atmosphere without the use of expensive, extensive visual effects. Quite unusual for what is actually a horror movie, Flatliners did not spend his budget in places where it was not needed. Much of what we see during the more surrealistic rows is a case of professional handicap, simple trick photos or stock images. Sometimes the simplest things are the best. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the movie, it feels like it's about ten minutes short. The end looks more perfunctory than conclusive, as if someone in the studio asked the director to wrap up the movie so they could bring it to a certain market time. Of course, many movies have been left with sore spots for this reason, so Flatliners shouldn't be really different. The hundred and fifteen minutes we get are very satisfying, but not too brilliant. <br /> <br /> I've given Flatliners a seven out of ten. It works well as a date trick or some late-night popcorn film. It's a good reminder that low-budget horror programs weren't always sad.
