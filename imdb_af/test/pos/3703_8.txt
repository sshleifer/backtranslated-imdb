"Caribe" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. However, it delivers a wonderful story, along with a wonderful cinematography. The narrative structure is around two narrative axes, one of which embedded the other. Each has elements that relate to excellent harmony and exist. The story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good mix of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great, and we owe it to the upcoming director, Esteban Ram√≠rez. Furthermore, the characters are very well written and masterfully complex; as soon as you become acquainted with them, you can observe their feelings without even saying anything. I can't say I knew this picture because of all the hype it generated (in Costa Rica), but rather because of the way it really is an interesting portrait of what happens when you balance people interfere with their lives. Hopefully, Caribe will establish a reference for future projects in Costa Rica, as this is a great example of good movies.
