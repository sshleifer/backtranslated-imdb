For anyone who has ever sought happiness, "Half empty" is a must see. This original cross-cultural musical comedy has hilarious numbers, which makes "The Producers" look annoying. Author Bob Patterson puts in his soul to share his thoughts on life, wisdom and happiness. He even writes inspirational comments on index cards, as his girlfriend pours out her heart and leaves their relationship. When his book on luck, "North Star" in the United States achieved zero success, his publishers sent him to Germany for a book's tournament. As they explain their decision to Bob, the boardroom breaks into an exciting song that makes Monty Python proud. From his arrival in Hamburg, Bob's complete ignorance of German language leaves him at a disadvantage. But his soldiers, impenetrable by his hosts, have real feelings toward him until a popular devotional fan arrives at everyone's response to him. <br /> <br /> The original songs float the film, which often describes the subtext of the story in slanting precision. The movie, led by Robert Peters, displays an impeccably dry sense of humor and captures their characters as if they were not acting. See it for: A case study of how good intentions are completely irrelevant; How merciless Americans are considered overseas; How little reason it takes to burst into a song, and above all, For a stupid, entertaining, unconventional laugh.
