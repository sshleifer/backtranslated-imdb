It's a good family movie with a few laughs. I wish it didn't have too much of the school play as the bully had to fill the movie. Also, it seems a bit too easy to save a piece of land because it is being built. I mean, it just flowed too easily. It makes you aware of the game. It had a nice way to imagine the piece of land that the fast runner was, but a little too slow for me. A little too hokey for me and it reminded me to go back to school. Oh, the DVD is full of delicacies, don't miss out. 7 out of 10 for the movie 10 out of 10 for the DVD with the extras worth watching. Well worth seeing!
