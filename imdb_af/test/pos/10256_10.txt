From start to finish, it doesn't miss a rhythm and I never get tired of watching it. <br /> <br /> It's unique in that it is one of the saddest and at the same time uplifting of all movies. endings. There may have been a few since (Backdraft occurs), but Cooley was the first and much more emotional.
