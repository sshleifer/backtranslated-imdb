I walked into the movie, with no expectations for the movie I was about to come, "Everything is lightened". I walked out with a joy that I almost got with American movies. Actor Leiv Schreiber's director debate follows a man on his journey through the past, accompanied by an eccentric group with a brass dance, barely English-speaking punk from the Eukra, his grandfather who believes he is blind and their crazy dog. The first half of the film is funny and clever with a very European flavor in the use of small but wonderful characters, while the second half of the film falls into a gloomy story of discovery and the Holocaust. This little movie brings out so many emotions, and so many colors, with such a wonderful conclusion and is more than just a story of relief, but also of relationships and connections. The play is incredibly powerful, the story is mysterious and interesting, and the artistic appeal of cinematography, to die. With a few brilliant and absolutely touchless "Everything is Relieved" I caught my heart.
