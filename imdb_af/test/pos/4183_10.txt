This movie, like many of their music, is either underestimated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is wonderful and in many ways before its time. <br /> <br /> The images are funny, disturbing and at least tempting. <br /> <br /> The music is great. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is not the "candy pop" sound they are associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and rebellion. <br /> <br /> MAIN, alone, should place The Monkees in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me why these guys aren't there?
