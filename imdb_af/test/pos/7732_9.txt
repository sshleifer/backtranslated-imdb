Just beautiful. It's long. No climax. Don't wait for anything to happen. Great for a rainy day. About a man in a middle crisis taking his family to a remote area of ​​the Greek islands. I saw it in my teenagers and still love it 20+ years later. However, I didn't find it in video stores. Molly Ringwald is a cute average teenager who really wants to go home and then there's a place in the place. There are no phones, no TV, boredom. If so struck with silence, man's condition is bored and then reflected. And every character does it. Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to become sexually involved with John Cassavetes' character, but he can't do it well. Gina Rowlands is the woman who loves him but is just about to give up their marriage. He demands and frustrates everyone. There is another character in the movie, a Greek who speaks improperly with Molly Ringwald, but things she is curious about. But he is annoying and horny and I didn't have this character. The place of the movie is what makes this movie so good. It will not work if there is no film anywhere else. I recommend this movie and give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.
