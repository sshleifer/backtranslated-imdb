I thought this movie was great and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the pieces I missed while bending my stomach! The critic who reviewed this movie for this site challenged someone with an IQ about their shoe size to find this movie funny. Well, my IQ is about: 135 ... I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above was not such a boring idiot, he could smile once in his life and take things as lightly as they intended! <br /> <br /> The music numbers were so imaginative! Everybody when you watch any movie over that period will see men in tights and realize how different it is for today's clothes and how funny we would find today's male population if they wear boots on a daily basis! The idea of ​​throwing a song to dance men dancing in boots was so fresh, how can anyone NOT laugh !!! (Plus, see hip-hop rappers who are ballet, are always hysterical. As a dancer, I also did ballet and hip hop and played with men who both had to do. It breaks me every time !!!) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, if anyone has not seen it yet, do not listen to the critic above ... watch it and decide for yourself !!!
