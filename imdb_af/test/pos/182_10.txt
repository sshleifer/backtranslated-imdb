In my recently submitted review, I referred to the young actress's lead as Katerina when it had to be Veronika. I was so involved with character and the action I think I wasn't so busy with names. Anyway, she and the movie are brilliant. As I said, cinematography and directors are using montage worthy of Eisenstein and his cameraman, Tisse. In addition, the production design is. Placing foreground, middle and background actors within any given mishap and scene is worthy of study. Stunning, memorable camera movement, and an end that has an emotional punch that leaves Hollywood movies far behind. Give! Heroic self-sacrifice instead of walking in the rainbow. Thank you, John Hart
