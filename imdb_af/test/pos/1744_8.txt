This is a very modest, very nice movie with a good score by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser with a striking number, We are the couple in the castle. It is quite exciting from the era and back to Penthouse Serenade just like the opening Vooruitig (Hoppity's arrival) may have inspired Fred Saidy and Yip Harburg's opening (Woody's Coming) in Finian's Rainbow six months later. I totally agree with the posters that noticed the name Disney attached to it. It would have until now been 'classic' rather than neglected. It is wonderfully inventive, never more so than when objects are barely noticed in the 'real' world having a much greater significance - both before and in the insect world. Actually, it's a classic, even if it's a minor.
