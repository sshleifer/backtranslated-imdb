The 1970s opened the door to the largest, most diverse era of film in history. Some movies were great ("The Godfather", "The Conversation", "Mean Streets", Chinatown, "The French Connection", "Five Easy Pieces", "Jaws", "McCabe And Ms. Miller" So a little worth spending the Christmas price. <br /> <br /> But each one was a breath of fresh air compared to today's corporate Hollywood, with each film being a great weekend for the cost or go straight to HBO and rent. <br /> <br /> What "decade" does so well is to experience the sudden and rarely experienced sensation of freedom to make and direct a movie , related. Maybe it's personal, maybe not. Sometimes with a clutch extras. Long before the Corporate Supervisors, Suits, Committees and Attorneys ever became part of "The System". <br /> <br /> The comments is excellent, especially Julie Chris binds and Dennis Hopper, although you listen, you will slowly find out how many great directors today (Coppola, Scorsese, Ron Howard, Dennis Hopper, Pet Bogdonovitch was named "Roger Corman Commandos". Work long hours with short pay. Shoot a movie within a month. Learn all the steps and tricks of the trade by doing it yourself. To turn on the product that was on time and under budget. <br /> <br /> See "Decade" for his message. And for a long and varied list of films to watch made by the wonderful turbulent years. <br /> <br /> Although I will not complain if IFC decides to spend another documentary solely on the most subordinate Grand Pioneer of film, Roger Corman.
