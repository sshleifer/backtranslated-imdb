I'm 17, and a leading Muppet fan, and while I love Treasure Island, Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper, the Muppet Movie deserves the best of them. It's very entertaining, thanks to the funny script by Jerry Juhl, and the movie looks beautiful, with some beautiful plays. Speaking of the songs, I really liked them, sure they are not the best song score from the Muppet franchise, but they were great to listen to, especially Never Before. Never before is one of my favorite Muppet songs with First Time It Happens and Professional Pirate. The Muppets as usual were fantastic, especially the always beautiful Miss Piggy, and the chemistry between Kermit and Fozzie was wonderful. And what a brilliant human role-playing - from Bob Hope to Orson Welles, from Madeleine Kahn (the same wonderful actress who hilarious movies like What's Up Doc, Blazing Saddles and Clue) to Cloris Leachman, from Steve Martin to Richard Pryor whose memorable guests acted as caution to not overshadow the Muppets in a fantastic movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox
