It is without a doubt one of my favorite horror movies ever! I really can't believe it didn't get much more popularity when it was released, especially when the main contenders were the usual West Craven successors and copycat horrors, Mute Witness has all the style, tension and fast fireflies of a Hitchcock / DePalma movie, along with a very sharp black comedy and a large plot. It never promises to be a good popcorn and hot dog movie, but it's hard to just enjoy the movie for what it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is on Billie Hughes - a dumb girl working on the set of a horror movie made in a Russian factory. Through a series of events she accidentally locked herself up and bumped it into filming a snapshot. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the movie is the lack of screaming that seems to have made every horror invasion movie ever. Since the main character is dumb, she can't make a noise - something that in some stages of the movie blesses and curses in others. <br /> <br /> The director studied his Hitchcock very well, even the opening scene is a tongue-in-cheek trick for both Hitchcock's "Psycho" as well as fairly generic slasher movie scenes. <br /> <br /> While the play is sometimes hammy, the whole movie holds it. Together, not only do some great scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat, but some nice little questions about how the movie will end. <br /> <br /> All in all, an extremely overlooked, well-trained and action-packed psycho-thriller I recommend for any calf viewer who is looking for something a little different from the usual Freddy / Jason / Scream / Michael Myers / Damien regurgitation at the halloween.
