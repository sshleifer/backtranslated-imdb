I am surprised that this good, above the average 80's comedy, only achieved a 5.2 of all IMDB voters. Dan Ackroyd does his usual satirical turn as an ally who gets a good opportunity to steal a contract from his prison physician. He goes back to California to begin his work on a radio presentation that claims he is the infamous Dr. Lawrence Baird. The only person who knows he is a fraudster is the drunken priest (Walter Matthau) who is welcomed by Ackroyd's new-found wealth by fading away. Charles Grodin also throws in a good supporting performance. For his genre, I think this movie deserves the same credibility as 'Ferris Bueller' or 'Trading Places'. 7.5 / 10
