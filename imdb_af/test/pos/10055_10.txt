I need to rate this movie at a 10. I'm sorry, but I think it's classic comedy. then, if you rate it to other Madonna movies ... well, what? you want to tell me it wasn't her best movie ever? didn't Mira Sorvino win an Oscar for almost the same achievement ten years later? please, this movie earns more credit than it gets. Plus, I think of it as an A + sociological study in the 80's lifestyle. Remember when you could buy the same day at Sam Goody and Cartier? remember when women with bushes were eyebrows proud? so it wasn't a last emperor, it was still good. There are some movies I want to see every day. three, actually, it picks up my day and makes me smile. If you want, "Who is that girl?" then I would also recommend "Party Girl" and "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion".
