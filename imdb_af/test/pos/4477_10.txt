This movie is beautiful in every way. It is visually amazing, and this is a good thing, as the dialogue will only take a page or two paper. The acting is wonderful; This is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a wonderful job of changing himself into an animal and mixing that wild nature with a man's exaggerated passion and honor. There is no mistake, not one mistake or wrong moment to find anywhere. It's perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience. It is not a movie for anyone who wants to be normal.
