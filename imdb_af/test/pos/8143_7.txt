"Vague Fire Flats", recently shown on the cable, is a small movie that packs a lot. Harris Ready straight with style. The screen shot by Mr. Done and Diane Fine make a good thriller. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, you might want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> The movie is the story of a young LA doctor who made a mistake and lives to pay for it. When released from prison, he wants to hide in a small town where he feels he will be forgotten. Bad choice! What Thomas Reed finds in Purgatory Flats is hell in the desert. Just after landing a job as a bartender, Thomas meets a beautiful young woman, Sunny, who is clearly someone to stay away from. The young doctor is called to help if Sunny's boyfriend Randy is shot by a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> Learn about Randy's family. His uncle-dean seems to be, but his brother Owen is a loose cannon. Everyone in the household is connected in more ways than one to the nubile Sunny. <br /> <br /> The shows are good. Vincent Ventresca is Thomas, the man who had to go to his L.A. exercise instead of making a detour to the village. Alexandra Holden is Sunny, a young woman with a tremendous ambition to escape her environment. Kevin Alejandro, Gregg Henry, Brian Austin plays the men in the Mecklin family. Nicholas Turturro also makes a good contribution to the drug dealer. <br /> <br /> The film shows a director with promise that goes far beyond this tightly crafted movie.
