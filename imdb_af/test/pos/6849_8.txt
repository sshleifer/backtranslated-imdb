And it has it in France! Why not in the rest of the world, while the studios are still getting expensive after-Grisham garbage (will anyone remember him as a good writer, and not the stupid writer of this side of Stephen King?) Has it all. Okay, the situations aren't always original, have little plots and it tends to be short or temporary, but it actually does a job of love. I would be curious to know what the budget was. AND. For once it is not a cheap tarantino copy! (Well, film noir didn't start with Tarantino, you know.) Will it be saved again by Europe, as John Dahl's movies were, so Mr Guttierez could make such another? If you've ever read it, Mr. Guttierez, thank you and see
