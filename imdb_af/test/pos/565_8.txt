I watched it on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier. It compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas. <br /> <br /> The story is of a 15-year-old black child executed for Jacksonville, FL, killing an elderly white woman based almost exclusively on identification. the victim's husband and a defense claim allegedly forced. <br /> <br /> About half of the material is from the trial; It is supplemented with footage from defense attorneys (two public defenders) explaining their case, questioning witnesses, and visiting keylockers. It is edited with a minimum of unnecessary repetition, and placed in a logical order. The camera work is pretty solid. And there is a slightly surprising epilogue.
