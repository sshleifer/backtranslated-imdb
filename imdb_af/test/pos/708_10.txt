The first time I saw this movie, I was a kid. I was ten when it was released, but since my family I never looked at movie theaters. I saw it on Network TV. I remember watching it alone and crying. It was only the second movie that was illegal for the answer (Rocky was the first) and there wasn't much yet. I can't say exactly; Larry "Rain" Murphy didn't deserve to win that Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know I admired Murphy, not so much for what he did, but for the way he did his time. Stoic. He didn't need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity. He runs because he can. He needs no other reason. I have a rule today that when I see this movie late in the night on cable television (the only time will come most about it). I have to look, no matter what I have to do the next morning. Fortunately, it doesn't often play like Shawshank Redemption or other favorites, so I still get enough sleep and never touch the story of one man's uncontrollable prison sentence and personal victory.
