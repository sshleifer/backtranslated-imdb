This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I watched about 20 minutes, a little surprised at what was going on. Then I started laughing and didn't stop until long after the movie ended. Such deadpan satire is indeed rare. Christopher Guest has a real eye for humor that is inherent to those who have no sense of humor about themselves (about 90% of white heterosexual men start). Like in "Waiting for Guffman" Guest nails middle America's idiotic self-interest on the wall. I can hardly wait for his next movie.
