I'm not a filmmaker, but I know it's hard to tell a story in seven minutes and draw your audience into character. Horses on Mars do this and more. If you watch a good movie, you don't want it to end. So I watched this movie. It is visually expansive and the microbes take on such human traits that you feel you are traveling with. <br /> <br /> Really looking forward to the exciting adventures of Mr. Anderson adopt us in the future. Well done.
