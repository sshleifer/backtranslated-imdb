This movie is the best kung fu movie of all time. Although there are no wire and special effects like those used in Crouching Tiger, this movie uses ingenuity and creative camera work to create unforgettable combat moments, and the battle tones are well choreographed and tight. There is a ton of action in this movie with very big fighting scenes, but the story is also very good, with lots of turns and turns. The characters are well rounded and have real depth to them, as the motivation for their actions and personality is revealed in much greater detail than most kung fu movies. There are some fantastic camera work in the movie, with my favorite shot starting as a close-up of our hero's face indicating his reaction. He then quickly retreated to reveal the scene in front of him as the cause of his appearance. Originally, I bought the movie to hope to see some big fights, but on several occasions I learned how awesome the play and story were. Overall, a good movie.
