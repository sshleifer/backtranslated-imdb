This film portrays the fighting life for the typical East German. <br /> <br /> The Strelzyk's and the Wetzel's were two families who decided they wouldn't take it anymore. <br /> <br /> Despite the extreme danger of escaping to the West, they feel the rewards that weigh the risks. John Hurt and Beau Bridges, who portray the various family heads, have come up with the idea of ​​flying over the heavily fortified border of East Germany. <br /> <br /> There are timely moments as they gather the necessary material for the flight. They work their day work and build the balloon at night, under the nose of the authorities. One of them is Strelzyk's neighbor (Klaus Loewitsch). <br /> <br /> The first attempt, involving only the Strelzyks, ends in failure when the balloon falls just a few meters from the border. The collapsing balloon is discovered by border guards and a ruthless search for the conspirators who are determined to try again. With the sale of materials carefully monitored, Peter and Guenter are still getting pieces of cloth to build a second balloon for their nail bites that escape freedom. The film also features a heart-warming and effective soundtrack by late Jerry Goldsmith.
