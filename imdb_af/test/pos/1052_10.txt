"Christmas in Connecticut" is an absolute gem, and a must-see for Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, a precursor to Martha Stewart, is a magazine colonist and the ne plus ultra of homemakers - the perfect woman, mother and household goddess. The only thing is, she is not one of these things - a totally ominous. Unfortunately for her, she is about to find out. Her publisher, Mr. Alexander Yardley (a brilliant comic twist by Sydney Greenstreet) gets the bright idea of ​​inviting a well-known war hero to Elizabeth's "perfect farm" for the Christmas holidays. Only thing, there is no farm, "perfect" or otherwise. The comedy involves how Elizabeth should keep her true identity under wraps so she won't lose her job. Elizabeth's colleague, John, had a farm in Connecticut to solve the problem. However, he wants to marry Liz, but she doesn't want to marry him. He offers her marriage, although he knows she doesn't feel the same way about him as he does to her. He makes the offer anyway, and assures her that he is willing to wait. And here, Barbara Stanwyck, as Liz, delivers one of the most devastating retreats I've ever heard. With perfect innocence, she replied, "Can you wait so long?" Ouch! In addition, the screens between Una O'Conner and S.Z. Sakall is hilarious. They do not look like each other (though they suspect they really do). They are competitors in the household, and S.Z. Sakall's English English is characterized by Nora's confused pronunciation of his name ("Mr. Basternook"). "My name is FELIX!" It's great how Christmas Y is this black and white movie. Great character works by everyone involved. do not miss this one!
