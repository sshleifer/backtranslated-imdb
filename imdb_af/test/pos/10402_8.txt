A documentary filmmaker examines seemingly unrelated paranormal incidents related to the legend of an old devil called the "kagutaba". <br /> <br /> From the look, the movie looks like one of those camcorder movies that has been popular over the past few months, even one that will be released next week (PARANORMAL ACTIVITY)! Unlike movies like CLOVERFIELD, REC and BLAIR WITCH, where most of the movies are in chaos and chaos, it is basically in a traditional documentary style. It has TV excerpts and interviews and the frightens are very subtle, though, except for the last 20 minutes we are in the chaos effect and where the fear factor is greatly excited. <br /> <br /> And it works. The movie is very exciting and it makes you think. Yes, you heard my right: it makes you think. You should pay attention to the unrelated details given throughout the film, and the payout is great when these things begin to interweave each other during the film. The film is also moving very slowly, which is a good thing in this case. We, as the audience, get the details on the screen, but subtle or blatant. Right now, it's a scary little movie. I am a person who is afraid of ghosts and the paranormal more than killers who have chased teenage victims away. Yes, the film gave me nightmares. There are some images here that are really disturbing to look at, including one closer to the end where it lets you go, "What do I look at?" Well, it's better, unanswered. There are about ten repeating characters in it, all of which have given authentic performances in their roles. <br /> <br /> The only thing I don't like about the movie is the end because most questions are left unanswered. The question: "That's it?" However, I thought. It left a bad taste in my mouth. However, the rest of the movie is just busy and frightening. Don't see it alone in the dark, because you'll regret that choice. Also, I can see in a few years that Hollywood would remake this movie. It will be interesting.
