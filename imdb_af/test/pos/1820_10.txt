This is the core of the early eighties! The shopping malls, the credit card machines, the food, the punk hair color, the soundtrack ... I'm in love with this movie. This sweet, intelligent Romeo & Juliet teen movie is immediately addictive. <br /> <br /> Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite directors. She really works for her actors, such as John Hughes and Steven Soderberg, so watch out -You of Sex and Real Genius. The soundtracks for -Valley Girl are wonderful. If you can get a copy of the movie, buy it! It's out of print and very hard to come by.
