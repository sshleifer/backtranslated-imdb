I loved this movie! It is therefore worthwhile to earn the long run time. I need help with the end. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> The final shot of Marie at the end - Is it to suggest she's still looking for Renaud? or maybe she was the one who wanted to revive the 13? (She was the one who initially delivered Colin's first letter). I don't quite understand it, but I know I really liked it. So if anyone saw it and remembered it or just saw it, please extend the end. <br /> <br /> Thank you
