I saw this movie so long ago, but it still remains in my memory as the saddest movie ever. I didn't cry. My mom will never watch this movie again, because it is almost painful to watch. Anyway, the story is not exactly complex. Ann Margaret dies and has to give her 10 (?) Children away. As if it wasn't bad enough, it was during the depression and she had to break the next brothers and sisters one by one. I think it was very sad for me, because I am also of a very large, closed family and can identify with every child's pain to leave their mother and brothers and sisters. Maybe I am a masochist, but I would like to see this movie again, because it was well done and the end, surprisingly, is slightly happy (at least we can smile and sob at the same time). It has to come somewhere on TV so I can see it again.
