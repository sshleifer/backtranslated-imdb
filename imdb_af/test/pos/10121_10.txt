It's a very moving movie about life itself. The challenges a disabled person must face in a country that expects perfection to be brought to the fore, so that everyone can see and hopefully understand. It must teach the societies of society that we are all human beings, and while some of us are gifted with a mind, heart and healthy body, there are decent people who exist in the world, who are not so happy, or perhaps , again the unhappy. We do not always see the beauty in the world, because we are dedicated to our 'blind' ambitions and see it only in one light "what can this world do for me !!!". Perhaps we all wish that we were like Radio, a loving happy individual ... who loves everyone.
