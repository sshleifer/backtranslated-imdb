This is the 4th film in the Karate Kid series. It has nothing to do with the previous one. The only character left is Mr. Myagi. This time around Mr. Myagi meets upset teenager Julie pierce (Hliary Swank before she was known) July with all sorts of problems, including being tormented at school, part of a pseudo-military club on campus. Of course she is trained to fight. Every time, through Myagi, Julie teaches Karate and becomes a better person spiritually and learns to respect. herself and ultimately revives her respect. I like the unique idea that the antagonist is a woman and has a man as her enemy. There are also some battle scenes that are fairly well done, very low key and minimal violence. The battle is graphical. The end is also good and a little surprising. It is predictable, but not a typical end to this kind of movie. The film, of course, has echoes of the original, especially the spiritual aspect and the learned lessons. It's not as good as the 1st mov ie, and certainly not as good as the 2nd. However, this is a huge leap forward compared to the underlying 3rd entry. It is a very entertaining dog movie suitable for the whole family. 8/10
