For a child's movie it is wonderful. As an adult and mother, I enjoyed watching the movie with my daughter. There is a lot going on in this movie. The following * can be considered a * spoiler * ... Barbie learns courage and learns not to judge so quickly in this movie. She also learns not to give up hope and master her anger. I loved the sense of teamwork you get to solve Barbie and her sister and friends to solve the puzzle. There is nothing in the movie that I found offensive or inappropriate for young viewers. In fact, I felt that the moral messages of the movie were excellent and well done. <br /> <br /> The animation was pretty good. I really enjoy the skate screens and think they did very well. There is a lot of action in this movie, so I suspect most kids will enjoy it ... not just those who really are in Barbie. My daughter actually took it out because of the Pegasus. She loves horses. But she really enjoyed the movie. My daughter is autistic, and could sit and enjoy the whole movie. She had involved many of the action scenes and parts with horses. <br /> <br /> One thing I thought was that many people object to Barbie (and Ken) because they are so beautiful. Yet I think children, like adults, like to look at beautiful people and things. That is, of course. As adults, we also enjoy watching beautiful movie stars. It's great that the Barbie character and her "boyfriend" have a lot of personality. While it is nice to look beautiful people, it gets old when there is no dust behind the pretty face. <br /> Overall, I would say it's a great movie for kids and parents will also enjoy it. :)
