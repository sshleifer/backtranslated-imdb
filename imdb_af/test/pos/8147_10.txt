Honestly, I first watched this movie because of the free sex scenes I heard it owned, but by really watching the movie, it just made me realize that there are good and sensible movies there. Truly, this is one of the most well-crafted and touchable movies I've ever watched. I am a bilingual bisexual and the film talked to me about my ministry - sex, religion, love, acceptance, etc. It gave me an idea of ​​how to deal with these problems with the help of myself and others who love me for who I am. Cox handled the movie well by sprinkling drops of heart-warming lines and some sexuality in it. This made the movie more interesting. Some people compare it to Brokeback Mountain, but I disagree. Brokeback Mountain has more drama, while Last Days is balanced.
