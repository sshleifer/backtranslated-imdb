As a high school student, I have to take a health class. this year is the subject of drugs. We learn about the damage they can cause. from what we are talking about, I still believe and know that drugs can really sprout a person. Anyway, my teacher wanted us to see it. Of course, we groan and start sleeping, but like the rest of my class I actually enjoyed this movie. It was completely real and not sugar-coated at all. The characters were incredible and credible. even the plot was extremely realistic and credible. What I like about this movie was mainly how it had the effect of the drug's effects, could be an abuse and the consequences the person had to deal with. Everyone assures themselves that nothing will happen to them. Well, we can get serious. Anything can happen in a small town, even to your best friend, like Sam and Chris. this movie shows it. A person can learn a lot to see it. it was quite effective.
