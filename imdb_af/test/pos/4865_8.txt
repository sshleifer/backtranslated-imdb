You know the concept of "guilty pleasure"? yes, you have, as you have allowed to watch - and enjoy - goonies, battlestar galactica after reaching the earth, the series, Charlie's Angels, Starsky & Hutch, the 1950s superman or Godzilla movies . <br /> <br /> here is the best in guilty enjoyment. Along with the jack of all trades in a sam-raimi action-packed hour, this half-hour lock is fast, easy to follow and loaded with spectacular babies who are fun to watch. <br /> <br /> The man who has our malicious dead, xena, hercules, and the adventures of brisco county jr did it again with this 2000 update of Charlies angels. we have charlie (voice) an unknown creature who has the knowledge and time to find people who need help, bosley (mouser) the gadgetman and three beautiful babies who kick a ** for a life. <br /> <br /> And oh what a life!
