When I started watching, I thought I had looked at some pro-Koresh amateur documents. However, I have never seen 3/4 of the footage they used. They questioned people who said the FBI / ATF had set up all these things, which so far sounded, but followed with FBI video and evidence. I was surprised. The documentary followed up with the Senate investigation into the fire, and after watching the interview and video recording, you will be shocked at how Senate and Attorney General turn their backs on David to cover the aggression by the FBI / ATF . When you start watching, you have to finish it. Otherwise you will think it's propaganda of something like that.
