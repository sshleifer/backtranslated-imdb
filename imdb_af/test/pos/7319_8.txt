Although I'm not a big fan, I'm a Three Stooges purist. I believe their best work was far curly than the third Stooge and their earliest movies are generally their best. This is because after a while they start to regain their movies and start the birthday celebration. Here in 1934 they were quite fresh (in more ways than one) and funny. <br /> <br /> Here their boys play very unlikely roles - respected doctors in a hospital! The three run amok after which stupid, beat each other and scare the pants off anyone who expects to get better. The non-stop energy and freshness make this one a must-see for fans. <br /> <br /> By the way, though I like this movie, I strongly recommend you try a much less familiar short of little educational photos. NIFTY NURSES is much like PEOPLE IN BLACK, but manages to be funny and deals with the best hospital comedy of the era - better than Laurel & Hardy's COUNTY HOSPITAL.
