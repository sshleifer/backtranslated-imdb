It must be one of the most scary movies of all time. The kind of title that ruins a movie because it doesn't evoke the plot or characters. A title like this makes a movie flop, even the French title is not much better. Bad - Truffaut & Deneuve had to be enough to sell it. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but it's worth the greatest. Clearly influenced by Hitchcock, we have an intercontinental story about a personal ad bride, her rich man, a theft, an identity switch and obsessive love. The plot here is actually very good and takes us on an unexpected journey. <br /> <br /> The thing that works for and against the film is the focus on the relationship. This is an interesting study of how these plot developments are played out in the "real life relationship" with these two people. Unfortunately, that is what the film is marching up, and finally makes it dissatisfied. We do like movies to have a real sense of finality, and it is missing here. <br /> <br /> This was the case in many of her films that Deneuve has become a sailor for directors to play their fantasies, and this time it doesn't work as well. Here is the fact that the director clearly wanted Deneuve to take her top off a few times. Deneuve is an actress who always looks deliberately and thoughtfully, so these attempts to make her look spontaneous fall flat. <br /> <br /> Basically, the script needed to be better worked out before shooting began, to make this movie firmer and shorter. But Truffaut didn't cut it, did he? So - it walks a bit, but remains interesting.
