My family watches this movie over and over. Even our 3 year old loves it. I like the "goodness" in the movie. To give the stranger a chance ... to show goodwill to a person, of course, needed for unconditional acceptance. The movie gives a sense of benevolence and victory. Another aspect of the movie that makes it so attractive is the personalities of Velvet's brothers and sisters. The bird lover. The error lover. The boy lover! Very cute and happy movie. There is one thing, but it is annoying about it. This is how Mrs Brown often mr. Brown seems foolish or foolish. She sometimes comes down when one knows everything, and he is a dim white, which he is not. Too bad to put it in such a nice story. Nevertheless, we will continue to enjoy this wonderful, old movie!
