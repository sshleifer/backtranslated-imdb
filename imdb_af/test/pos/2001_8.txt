Here is one of the more pleasant scuzzy 70's blaxploitation grindhouse items; it's a pervasively low-rent pimp opus that comes across as a sleazier version of "The Mack." John Daniels, the solid female hairdresser hero Jonathan in the immortal "Black Shampoo", gives an excellent picture of the Baron, a relentless, business-friendly, everlasting creation of the almighty flesh that rages bitter, brutal Italian rivals above the Sunset Strip. Daniels does not lead to a bad average existence as your standard gardening suburban man (with caring woman and loving children!) In a typical humdrum California small town. <br /> <br /> The strikingly absurd prospect only promises the finest, turbulent grandeur of a definite Grade B bluff photo (George Theakos deserves kudos for his hilarious ridiculous writing). Matt Cimber's pleasant tactless and tasteless direction delivers the mess through the slimy bucket, making this film a very pleasant care for celluloid wrath. Among the variety of awkward delights enjoyed here are plenty of free feminine nudity, rough dialogue, stunning Ms. Decade threads (dumbbell tops, felt heads, sparkling Day-Glo jewelry, luxury sea bucket suits), an intense funky R&B count by Smoke, some hopelessly pathetic play (the cute lady who lives next to Daniels is shocking), an unforgettable bad turn by Patrick Wright as a sadistic goon, some cold action pieces (the climatic slow motion baroque hit it seriously), more lousy travel photos of the Sunset Strip than you can shake a boar. The aforementioned screens include "the actual hookers and blades of the Sunset Strip in Hollywood", an effective dark film catcher by Ken Gibb, a few sicko sexual fetish tableaux, some raw explicit violence (a prostitute has one of cut off her breasts!), and amusing supportive performances by well-known perennial Richard Kennedy and George "Buck" Flower as some racist, corrupt, prosperous police detectives. Certainly, this movie is not art, but it is certainly artless enough to qualify as a grungy piece of entertaining sordid cinematic swill.
