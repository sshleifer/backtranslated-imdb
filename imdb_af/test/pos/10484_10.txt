Sublime - perfect - profound - a true lesson on the idealized meaning of life. We are totally trapped in Martina's and Phillipa's life voyages and <br /> <br /> Babette. Their desires, desires, sacrifices resonated long after the movie ended. See it years ago - as it was very familiar with the audacity of its subject - half of the movie was a single dinner - the audience was "oohing and aahing", as some of the courses were finalized <br /> <br /> glorious form, and laughs at the reaction of the dinners, as they are completely seduced by the gustatory pleasure Babette introduced to them, and completely amazed at the events at the end of the film. Then I saw the movie years later in my own twists and footage of life, I realize just how deep the film is. In this regard, tears flowed freely. The film's <br /> <br /> meditation over time and the way it uses a seemingly simple story to comment on life and love and art and generosity is really something to cherish.
