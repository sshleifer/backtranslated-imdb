Maybe this movie is a bit too long, but it still has a bit of charm 45 years later. The lead roles look more suited to Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. I could give less about Gary Cooper, but Ingrid Bergman is good, especially in dark hair. The movie is worth seeing for the supporting role: Flora Robson is wonderful as a mulatto servant. She is a white woman in the black plane and can have an expression of the evil or of a voodoo lover. Jerry Austin as a servant dwarf has a beautiful role, facing you despite a few long screens. As we talk about stage, Florence Bates steals most of the people she's in as a dowager social lady. I didn't understand the outcome of the railroad fight at the end of the movie and the last scene was pure Hollywood drunk. It's a strange feeling when you realize the movie title refers to a railroad rather than a piece of luggage!
