I saw a Two Sisters' languages ​​last night and really enjoyed it. Recently, I was a big fan of Asian horror movies and think it is a strong entry from South Korea. There is not much that you emit, as in the usual American horror movie, but the director maintains the cool and prosperous mood very well, especially in the uncomfortable character interactions with each other. Most of the terrorists are more conceptual and play on everyone's "there is something under the bed" fears when they were a child, but in this case it is the cupboard and the sink. I also liked how the director could just ascertain how dysfunctional this household is through scenes like the first dinner the characters have together. He is also good at revealing people's inner life and fragility through simple screens such as the stepmother wiping her look in the mirror or her in front of the flickering TV. I think this movie is mainly a search of debt and the consequences of living with that debt that hangs over you. <br /> <br /> BIG SPOILERS START (DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU DON'T REVIEW THE TWO OF THE FILES.) I followed the story very well, but started to get confused during the bag. However, I think the setback at the end definitely tied everything together. The movie is much like "The Machinist" in the way two of the character's joint debt ultimately lead to spiritual breakdowns and delusions. <br /> <br /> Here's my interpretation of the movie. The Su-Yeon we see after the girls are supposed to return home is either the error of Su-Mi or the real ghost of Su-Yeon who can only see Su-Mi and communicate with each other. The initial stepmother we see is in my opinion an error of Su-Mi. However, there is a real stepmother, and she only appears in the movie when wearing the gray trouser suit. I believe it's the right stepmother to talk to the dad in the first part of the movie and she doesn't appear before he picks her up and brings her to the house. The stepmother in front of that point is suggested by Su-Mi (perhaps part of her cleft personality?) This explains the bizarre dinner sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her as if she's crazy and doesn't remember what she tells. I think it was Su-Mi who worked out her stepmother part of her split personality. The film later reveals it as the stepmother wiping her makeup in the mirror, which is later revealed that Su-Mi is actually wiping her makeup in the mirror. <br /> <br /> I think the spirits in the house are not entirely suggested by Su-Mi, and are one of Su-Yeon or the mother or both. In the last jump it is known that the Su-Yeon wears the green dress and wears the hairpin in her hair when she died. It was the green dress they had previously shown on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother looked under the sink. It is also the hairpin that Su-Yeon wears in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother looks under the sink. <br /> <br /> The real stepmother eventually gets a bit like The Ring, by Su-Yeon's ghost. After that, the play-back scene linked everything to how both the stepmother was primarily responsible for her death, while Su-Mi played a continuous supportive role. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the "mother" Su-Yeon sees when she goes to her room to cry, in the jump it's already a ghost. Perhaps the mother had already killed herself in the closet. It is unambiguous. <br /> <br /> Other things suggested, but not clearly explained in the film, are that the stepmother, at one point, was a nurse, perhaps caring for the mother and at one somehow may have contributed to her death. It is not clear when her relationship with the father started and whether it killed the mother herself. It is also suggested that the mother also has mental problems, which a nurse requires. The stepmother refers to this when she tells Su-Mi, you start taking to your mother. I don't think she just meant physically. <br /> <br /> Even if we assume that the initial stepmother we see is actually Su-Mi, then there is the suggestion of incest as the father sleeps at her. . Is that why Su-Mi freaks and screams: "Don't touch me" every time the father comes to her at some point later? Is it the "dirty stuff you did" that she would indicate in a later conversation with the father? This film is interesting in its ability to use different interpretations. However, some of the scenes were a kind of derivative, like the woman in the black crawling scene, reminding me of the moving movements of Kayako in the Ju-On / The Grudge movies. Also, the last scene where the stepmother eventually gets her desserts reminds the Ring. Furthermore, just the idea that some characters can be spirits is taken from "The Sixth Sense" or "The Others". <br /> <br /> Overall, however, I enjoyed it and it would be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (already in production) appears. I must be honest, I have both "The Ring" and "The Wrudge", so I'm not one of those snooty types who insist remakes aren't good either. One repetition that I am very excited about is "Dark Water" that comes out this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet, but both movies are definitely on my list.
