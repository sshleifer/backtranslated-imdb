This is one of my favorite westerns. What a throw! Glenn Ford plays his part in his usual soft, controlled but firm manner. Ford plays one of the smaller farmers in the shadow of the mighty anchor farmer who wants to devour the whole area. Edward G Robinson plays the cripple patriarch of the anchorage and Barbera Stanwyck plays his cleverly twinkling wife. There is a lot of action In these westerns it is quite impressive, the scenery is nice and the letterbox size photography is breathtaking and the soundtrack is stereo! I would say that these westerns have a huge budget. It looks expensive. One of a series of great Glenn Ford westerns.
