If we compare the film industry with an ocean, we have the tendency to observe only the surface. Driven by the strong Hollywood marketing power, we've all seen war movies, such as Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. But among the spooky waves grow in silence, from time to time, lesser-known pearls. If you choose one and look carefully, you wonder why this pearl is almost unknown and why it's not already on the crown. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" is such a gem. Why does it have a lot of multi-million dollar rated actors? No. It has a thousand extras? No. It has awesome, spectacular, shiny computerized visual effects. Not at all. So what's so special? Well, in one word, it is pure past reality recreated and transferred to celluloid fifty years later. The tragedy of the most bloody struggle in history is here. Dirty, wounded soldiers, Russian civilians who lost everything in the invasion, burning villages, collapsing buildings, dilapidated suburbs, firearms, explosions, flames, soldiers fired, burned alive, tipped into their wells or smeared. everyone. But the real terror is elsewhere. People are reduced to simple pawns, without the power to change anything. The soldiers we follow in film are trying to leave the battle zone and they fail. The civilians remain in the middle of nowhere in prostration, just crying for their children killed. Mercifully, the large milling machine fuses people, equipment, towns, cities - and asks for more victims and destruction, over and over. <br /> <br /> In all this collective madness, a group of German soldiers are struggling to survive and at least maintain a minimum level of normality. They do their duty and fight bravely. But, as everyone knows, a battle is almost lost when people start to lose faith and faith. We see how all the people are leaving, how they plan to leave, how they struggle to get the very last plane to Berlin (full of wounded), how some very badly injured soldiers were treated as simulants and shots, how they forced is bringing out a small group of Russian civilians, including a young boy, a place that has literally been discovered on the ceiling of food and drink. Of course, it's just for some "superior" officials. One by one they fall dead. The end of the movie is one of the most bitter, depressing and touchy ends I've ever seen, all on the wonderful score of the Munich Philarmonic Orchestra. The war destroyed everything in its path. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must-see for everyone. A true movie lover should have it in his / her collection. The strong anti-war message should be a warning to all of us. Unfortunately, man never learns or politicians. Self-destruction is in our DNA and human pain seems to exist forever. Can we be enough to stop the war?
