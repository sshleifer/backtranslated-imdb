In the 1980s, patriotism, and in some cases flat Jingism, was quite high. "Let's get this time to win" known a line from Rambo: First Blood Part II, can almost give a summary of how many people felt at that time. A longing for the style of movies in which they grew up, flatten balls to the wall. We're good, your bad ... let's blow something up and go home. While Rambo, Rocky, and for the most part Top Rifle look more focused on attracting an older crowd. Iron Eagle went straight for the kids. Canadian writer and director Sidney J. Furie brings out everything you love and hate over that period. The kick in the pants out of 80's folk songs (never say the road, the Gypsy road, etc.) After the top, and sometimes almost incredible action adventure. Iron Eagle managed one reason ... it was F.U.N - Fun. It's the kind of movie you can turn on and sit back and enjoy every ridiculous total of 80's. You don't have to think if it really can happen, or if the play is truly credible, it's just fun ... and that's all you can really ask in this kind of movie ...
