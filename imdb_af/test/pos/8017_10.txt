Okay, so I love Aidan Quinn's play even with a bad script. This is not the case in the command. Like other viewers, it was a movie I stumbled upon and got through the cable. I didn't want it to end. Take a Cuban American Navy Ofc. (Quinn) who is an upright, incessant soldier and family man. Add a crazy agent (Donald Sutherland) looking for the world's most notorious terrorist and add a Ben Kingsley and you have the "Mission". Sutherland is a witness of the most notorious terrorist Carlos actions in a cafe on a beautiful day where he has gone so deeply on this evil that his only reason to live is to keep this man as long as he breathes. <br /> <br /> Take one soldier at a pass in Israel who is a dead ring for this man and is beaten by Kingsley and held until they realize they have a plan. By accepting Carlos by being him, or always being responsible for never helping the world of him, it makes a very difficult and guilty journey. By not helping his country, he is bound as a man and his military duty to choose wisely. So the training begins. Let's say Carlos training is right there with the academy of arts and holocausts. If I cast this intense and wonderful, written and performed movie prizes the best, I do not endorse it. All three actors can save almost any writing. Yet it is a movie that can be seen from frame one to credits. I'm not into terrorism or movies about it, but I'm addicted! Bravo returns to Aidan Quinn who once played a heavy game that could include any actor like Gary Oldman. It's a compliment. Hire it and get lots of popcorn. Oh, did I call the sex? It works better than "Last Tango!" And his educationalist.
