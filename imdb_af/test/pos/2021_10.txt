I love this movie, especially because Mark Wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end justifies the means. There is something about this movie that sucks you and allows you to feel all the emotions the characters feel. Jen Aniston is wonderful like the girl in this movie. It looks at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers came back in the day (maybe these days just got better). It takes a rainbow of emotions and has many subtle facets to let the light through. Like a diamond, this movie shines. You won't waste your popcorn on this one. Semi-chick flick, but my husband also enjoyed it. There were also some laughs thrown.
