It was a wonderful little movie that was really creative and fun - something you rarely see in movies. The film begins just after the fall of the Communist government in Russia. As a result, society seems to be in chaos and life still needs to be improved, as the old regime is gone. Dirty cities, crime and lack of housing still plague the poor inhabitants of St Petersburg. <br /> <br /> In this scene of paleness and insecurity comes an idealistic music teacher. He is among those without a home and he gets FINAL a letter from the government telling him he has a small room in a nearby apartment. When he arrives, the place is a mess, but people look friendly enough so they all have a beautiful party. In the middle of the night they were awakened by an old lady walking out of the huge wardrobe in the room. I expected half of Lucy and the other kids from The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe to come out, but they didn't. They are too shocked to do something, but decide to investigate soon. Instead of being just a wardrobe, open the wardrobe in Paris! How the apartment's residents respond to this magical gate is really intriguing. Some, like the music teacher, are excited and awe. Most of the others are more pragmatic and are mostly worried about pillaging everything from Paris before the gate is shut down! These Russian thieves are terrible people - greedy, rough and rough, but deep - very deep - are hearts of gold. I love how it is a metaphor for the country now on the brink of capitalism. Initially they run amok to do everything they can, and only later do they reveal their depth - but mostly they play much like guests on the JERRY SPRINGER SHOW! The film has lots of turns and turns and is both funny and fascinating. Over the only negative it is because of a loud language and a naked scene (though it is very funny), it is not a movie for children. It's a real shame, as with some very small editing, it could have been a good family movie.
