The martial arts movies grew in parts of Asia in the 60's, but the United States has captured the increasing popularity of the notorious Shaw Brothers films. This movie was the first to be presented in America under the Warner Bros. label. It did indeed start to make a craze here that flooded the 70's with martial arts movies. Many of the movies that are followed will be pale compared, but some are big and many like Enter The Dragon (which came out shortly after) became great success stories and made superstars out of these fighters. <br /> <br /> Fast forward almost 40 years later and this movie still holds on. Most Shaw brothers films are as good as they are today and the truth is said. No movies were made in this genre to compete with the Shaw Bros in the day. <br /> <br /> I like to think Martial arts is like porn and no one is watching porn for the plot just the action, it goes well with MA movies and most of them are just a lot of big battles with a small story. This one is an exception. It doesn't have a wonderful story, but there is one there. <br /> <br /> The chief who is played by Lo Lieh is actually under karate movie heroes. He never scares and he never fights just because he can, he is often regarded as poor and less of a fighter than most, but if he has to fight, he is forbidden and the best in life. I really loved this character. Many of the bad guys were unforgettable and the battle scenes were so beautifully presented. Even a small role with Bolo Yeung can be seen as the giant Mongolian, and Bolo is in my top 5 as biggest martial artist movie stars ever. He was also in the above mentioned Enter The Dragon. <br /> <br /> The production I have already said is great, you can't beat the Shaws, the direction was different from what I saw in movies of the 70's, the use of color was good placed and stood this movie standing and rising above the others. When the light shines on Chi Hao's hands, like him the Iron Fist, his beauty. <br /> <br /> The music was also fantastic. Fighting art films were to Asia that were Western to Italy, two separate art forms with so much in common. The countries that made these films had all the genres, but the Japanese films were what made waves like the spaghetti westerners in Italy. With their many differences, the styles of these two genres were neck and neck. As seen in movies like 5 Fingers of Death, the battles were easily compared to the Sergia Leoni cowboy stands, and the music tied the genres together so well. The music here borrowed a bit from Ironside, but it was still very original. <br /> <br /> Many films are inspired by this one, and when I see it, I see everything from The Master Killer to Blood Sports. The most obvious movie that was influenced was Kill Bill, which is the biggest of all time for me. Many of the Quentin sets used are complete replicas of those seen here and he used the music of this movie, although the music he used was borrowed from Ironside. And the battle scene at the end of Kill Bill full. 1 with The Bride and O-Ren is sometimes exactly compared to the fight with Chi Hao and the Japanese villain at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of martial arts movies, some even better, but it's a MUST SEE for fans of the genre. You can't go wrong here. The movie starts slowly but 15-20 minutes in it saves and slows down.
