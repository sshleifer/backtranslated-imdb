Without a doubt, the best Burt Reynolds movie ever! Even better than Smokey and the Bandit. It was probably the first true bloody cop thriller of the 1980s and delivered the perfect blend of humor, action, mystery and style missing in today's movies. <br /> <br /> This one has everything: a psychotic Henry Silva included on PCP, $ 1,000 a nightmare girl, ninja assassins and Burt Reynolds get his fingers aside for one with a butterfly knife. The film is based on the novel by William Diehl, who also wrote PRIMAL FEAR, one of my all-time favorites. This movie is worth watching just to see Henry Silva being shot six times, falling through a window and thirty stories from the top of an Atlanta high jump. It's probably the coolest stunt in Hollywood history, performed by legendary stuntman Dar Robinson. <br /> <br /> Robinson also played "Moke" in the Elmore Leonard movie STICK, who also starred Burt Reynolds. Stick contains another great Dar Robinson stunt. Robinson falls from a Miami apartment building and unloads all six shots of a .44 magnum on his way. Very cool stuff. <br /> <br /> SHARKY'S MACHINE is my favorite police drama. I never understood why this movie dropped the way it did. If Burt did more movies like this, he would have built him a better reputation. He proves that he is a talented director with Sharky, as well as a talented actor. Burt is supported by Brian Kieth, Charles Durning, Bernie Casey, Richard Libertini, Rachel Ward, and everyone's favorite bad guy, Henry Silva. PLEASE remake this classic movie! Get Affleck and Samuel L. and other hot actors and you have a good movie just waiting to be filmed. <br /> <br /> I give it a 9 out of 10
