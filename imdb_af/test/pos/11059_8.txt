This short film definitely doesn't push. The story is of a butcher who kills an innocent man who, according to him, has sexually molested with his delayed daughter. The film explores how the butcher serves his time and returns to life with his daughter in care, and has to live a life with no future. <br /> <br /> The graphic opening styles of a horse are slaughtered, and the full ancestry of the butcher's daughter puts you a brutal state of mind that stays with the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The funny flow of the movie is very direct and adds to its brutality. As a result, much soil is covered in the 40 minutes. You are fully utilized with the butchers non-life - especially after losing his daughter to social services and his business. His story continues in the excellent film Seul Contre Tous
