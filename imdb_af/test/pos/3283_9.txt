Okay, so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it makes a few liberals. The thing is South Park makes fun of everyone, much like the Simpsons have. If you take offense that a politician you want is fun, you might need a better sense of humor and take the show too seriously. With this said, this episode is hilarious and one of the best. All Gores depictions are hilarious, Cartman's scheme goes awry and the results will roll you on the floor. It's basically everything you ever want from a South Park episode and it's easily one of my favorites. I won't comment too much on the plot, because I don't want to give anything away.
