I'm upset and upset that the Network Talk Show has canceled Spike Feresten. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the Fox Television Network, Cancel Talk Show with Spike Feresten and replace it with Wanda Sikes? For those in the network with a short attention span, Wanda At Large has been canceled because the audience got tired of her nasty insults that would make the audience shrink and Wanda Sykes who spits her own brand of vengeful mud sling is not humorous , It is nasty and repulsive. <br /> <br /> The Fox Television Network has apparently rewarded Wanda Sikes for gaining an important appearance from President Barak Obama. There is no doubt that Wanda's recent bad tempered before the United States president is not funny and the hearing was just to deceive and please Barak Obama. <br /> <br /> Talk Show with Spike Feresten has a real sense of humor and never insulted a guest or artist intentionally or revenge. Spike's well-rounded personality has always been a joyful gift, fun of life and self. And she was completely hysterical with the AFTRA actress Mary Mae Atwill, like the 21st-century Mae West, during her first two seasons, with Spike Feresten's sketches: Judge Joe Brown, Trading Gades and Last Season's James Kyson Lee Episode where Spike talks to Erica via the internet at the show. <br /> <br /> Despite the network's budget constraints for extensive field missions and the second season's WGA strike, Spike Feresten did not reject his sense of humor or integrity. Talk Show with Spike Feresten has always come in the upcoming new talent and his comedy for Stoners spoofs by Nanny 911 and Idiot Paparazzi has been regarded as the forefront and has excellent production value. <br /> <br /> On a professional level, Spike Feresten was the best Executive Producer, and Set Producer, Brett Webster and his amazing production team were one of the best production teams I worked on in my AFTRA Career. . It would be really foolish and sad to cancel Talk Show with Spike Feresten. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, its success may be taken to Comedy Central or another network and financially speaking, which will be a valuable revenue loss for FOX Television. <br /> <br /> On behalf of the Saturday Fox Television audience, Talk Show fans with Spike Feresten, including all role players and crew, we request the Network to retain the Talk Show With Spike Feresten Franchise and the crew give a second opportunity to become a successful Fox Show.
