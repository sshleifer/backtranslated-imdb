This movie is too good for words. It is so incredibly big and funny and truthful in life. You just know to watch that the person who wrote it felt DEFIANTLY the way Jip and his friends do the movie. It was my life at one point and I would trust that I would come home to see Human Traffic ever before I could even imagine. I think you get so much loved with the characters and their lifestyle. Of course, this movie will not be older than 16 to 22 years old. There is definitely nothing wrong with this movie and it will let you down. It doesn't have a particular story line on it. The general idea is a weekend in the life of older teenagers in London and what they get. The places they go to, the people they meet, the drugs they take and the experiences they have. You have to get this movie on DVD, just to watch it, you must have it !!!
