John Wayne's first starring role just rolls me away. AMC television letterbox style, I had to look and make sure I got the right date. Sure enough, this 1930 movie was made with a 55mm wide screen process. In addition, it has some of the funniest, most realistic footage of the draw west I've seen. Wagons, men and animals are really dropped off a rope against a cliff. Trees are hacked by brave men - and brave women - so the train can move another 10 feet. The Indians are not the "beautiful boy" city lickers they later portrayed; this is the right thing. A river crossing in a rainstorm is so realistic, it really has to be. Actually, I understand that director Raoul Walsh almost lost all the guesses in this order. I could smell the wet cloth. Every day is a sadness. The different subtypes are forgotten, but the film as a whole is not. I can't think of another title that could hit the Big Trail to create a sense of living history on the trail to Oregon. Bravo.
