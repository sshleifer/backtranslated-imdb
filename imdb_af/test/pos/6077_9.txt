There have been several comments on the website that focus on the prestige of the film - and there is a lot of heavyweight talent on the show: from Fiennes and Scott-Thomas to the wonderfully spoken design and masterful direction. No wonder Andrew Lloyd Webber's acceptance speech for "Evita" started at that year's Oscars. "Well, thank you, God that the English Patient had no songs in it." Writing Oscar winners takes me to Juliette Binoche, who, in a star role, gives a beautiful show. It is gratifying to see that the dynamics that affect the Best Actor award (often going to the beautiful show) do not work in the female categories. Just as Emma Thompson's extremely well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel in "Howard's End" has proven that one of the most difficult things an actor can do is bring the portrayal of "goodness". Binoche's victory proved that it could be - and seriously sexy. Her performance in this awesome movie is a thing of beauty.
