I looked at this expectation to see the usual British tight upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinted with black humor. It was more like Eastenders Goes to Sea than we served. The scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their portrayal of a combat ship and the goods and villains under the ship's company (well at least based on my service in the 1970s). Some of the discarded lines are very greasy ("I'm not joined by the Band of Hope to just use a greasy fish maker!). My only complaint is that they haven't shown what happened to Irish Coxswain and his bride. not, or the tattooed PO and its "I Love Arabella" tattoo!
