Paul Schrader and his brother Leonard wrote Mishima, drawing parallels between Yukio Mishima's life and his work. The film was divided into four sections: beauty, art, action and the fateful day when Mishima held an army hostage and spoke to the garrison, just to mock him and his Bushido ideals from the samurai code. Mishima committed ritual seppuku on November 25, 1970, and he planned it as an acceleration of beauty, art and action. Schrader changes scenes that divert the day with three different scenarios of Mishima's novels: Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Kyoko's House, and Runaway Horse. The moment of seppuku is perfectly realized with regard to its shocking climax by pulling the camera back while simultaneously zooming in. <br /> <br /> Black and white rows are blended with the colorful moments portrayed in Mishima's novels. The black and white scenes represent memories from Mishima's childhood and youth. Schrader correlates some of these autobiographical moments with scenes from novels that are often parallel to Mishima's real life, such as his tribe, the development of his bodybuilding obsession and his advancement of the samurai code. Each of the three themes of beauty, art and action is portrayed in the chosen depictions of the various novels. The color sequence is reminiscent of early, staggering Technicolor movies, which may give the film a intended surrealistic quality in light of the subject. <br /> <br /> Ken Ogata plays the real Mishima with insufficient determination, to the general office on that fateful day and looks like the real Mishima. Schrader has tremendous risks with this film focusing on the novels he has done, and with theologically bound to both Mishima's personal life and his literary ambitions. Editing the film between the three main divisions of November 25, 1970, the black and white growing segments, and the colorful new scenes clearly indicate the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty, art and action in Mishima's life. Sometimes it is difficult to follow, and there may be little to recommend for the uninitiated viewer. *** of 4 stars.
