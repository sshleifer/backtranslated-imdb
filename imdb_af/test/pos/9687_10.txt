If you're a fan of Jackass, Viva La Bam or the CKY videos, you already know what you're into. But this is one of those rare events when a successor is better than the original one! And man packs this movie an average low blow. But I mean it in a good way. It's the same kind of death-defying, horrifying madness that we all know and love from Bam, Knoxville and Co. But this time with more laughs than ever before! With Johnny Knoxville's bad tolerance for pain, Bam Margera's affection for his friends / family and Steve-O's extermination factor plagued you, you have one hell of a funny movie. The bar for the stunts, sketch and general chaos of the Jackass team was raised. Jackass 3? Doubtful because it is almost impossible to improve on perfection.
