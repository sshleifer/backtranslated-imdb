I found this movie to be very enjoyable and quite entertaining. Good characters, good actors and enough tension to keep your interest right. The plot twist could be a bit much, but overall a decent thriller. If you like this movie, I would recommend the Spanish Prisoner, The House of Games and No Way Out.
