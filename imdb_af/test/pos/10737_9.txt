I consider myself lucky that I got a wonderful movie with two wonderful actors. Kramer vs. Kramer was wonderful to me, because I think I can connect to it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my parents are divorced. Although I was older than Billy in this movie, I felt his pain and confusion. Having two parents that you thought was happy and eventually hating each other is the worst. Through this film, I think, it made me realize that my parents are also people, and they had just as much pain as my sister and I had. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie it was a good one. Yes, it is dated and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would recommend it to many people, because I think most can be related in some way. There are funny, sad, happy and enlightening moments that are taken away by these great actors. It's a good movie and earns more credit than a 7.5. <br /> <br /> 9/10
