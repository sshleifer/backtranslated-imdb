A little silly movie you just love. <br /> <br /> Although it is quite grainy and clich√©, it still works and makes for clean fun. Five teams are doing a scavenger hunt and fighting for each other and their minds to win the whole night game - just for the sheer joy "to know that you are the best team." <br /> <br /> Noteworthy for several screen debut including David Naughton's first film role to his Dr Pepper "Be a Pepper" advertising and before his great 1981 hit "American Werewolf in London". Also Paul Ruebens knows what I believe is his first Pee Wee Herman-esquire role a year before he became known. And last but not least, Mr. Spin City and Alex Keaton themselves, Michael J. Fox, get their first film role here. Fans will remember Stephen Furst as Flounder in Animal House. In addition, there are no names, but all the funny characters. <br /> <br /> We've ever made it on DVD, but there are still some VHS copies moving around and you can even catch a late, late show. somewhere. If you do, your watch is worth it. You may hate it, but it can also become a strange little movie that you will love.
