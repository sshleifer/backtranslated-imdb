Hello there; I just want to say how much I enjoyed your review and comment on the excellent movie 'Intruder in the dust'. I believe the points you made were informative, intelligent and completely valid. It is also a pity that this film is almost never shown on television and that it is not available on DVD region 2 - I live in England. Again, thank you for your review. the actor juano hernandez was in another brilliant movie, "young man with a horn", who also died Kirk Douglas and Lauren Bacall. It was a very attractive and attractive movie with beautiful music. I wish someone who could influence the entire back catalog of movies like "Johnny Belinda", "I Remember Mama" and "The Yearling" on DVD 2, we love these movies in Great Britain. I'm not of retirement age, I'm still pretty young and my family and I love classic movies !! movies like this were so beautiful and they bring back wonderful memories. anyway ...! Thank you for your comments!
