It was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound. In the cartoon, Mickey does not wear gloves yet. He doesn't speak either. All he does is flute and play music. The song he plays is "Turkey in the straw" with several farm animals as musical instruments. For example, he plays the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and pulls nursing nails like an accordion. I packed this cartoon off the Disney Channel and I think it's great. It was based on a silent movie with Buster Keaton, entitled "Steamboat Bill, Jr."
