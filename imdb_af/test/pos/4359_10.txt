At the beginning of Little Dieter we see Dieter Dengler, the subject of the film, flying an obsessive compulsive. Or at least it's what he seems to be through the constant opening / closing of doors and with his large stockpile of food in the basement. In a way, director Werner Herzog asks a central question on how to talk about why Dieter is. Well, he is not necessarily obsessive-compulsive, because he is just well prepared. And why shouldn't he be after the life he lived? Apart from the juicyest, the most dark and exciting and frightening and just straight-haired ghost-like story of survival that is at the heart of the picture, Dieter's story is also fascinating. For example, Dieter's own childhood was a slogan in the post-war Germnay, poor in a family without much food or prospects, and pasted wallpaper for "blue in the walls". But come in a passion, an unforgettable desire (which is of course part of Herzog's bread and butter and love of man in his films), which flies, and for Dieter there was nothing but fulfilling it. What it eventually leads to after becoming an American citizen is more than what he could negotiate. <br /> <br /> Dieter is one of Herzog's most compelling, peculiar and compassionate figures throughout his career, A Man's Memory, hit by brutal memories of his time, a Vietnam POW. Although it does at least provide some of the most compelling storytelling in any documentary of the past 20 years. Ironically, the storytelling - unlike The Wild Blue Yonder - comes mostly from many and many expansions of Dieter on some of the smallest details of his time in the various prison camps (torture tactics, mistakes, brutal, miserable violence and Threats like the wedding story), leading to the most interesting and sad parts with his best friend Duane. They escaped the prisons together, but found that their trip to Cambodia would not be so easy. Now, through most of these things, the talk is something that is encouraging, that is, Dieter goes through his stories and sometimes re-enactments (in fashion that Herzog could only do, with Dieter already middle-aged in handcuffs and all through the jungle), one can imagine everything in the mind. All of this becomes even more alive to try to get these little details and the intensity of it all into a form of reality. That Herzog keeps these passages simple and knows when Dieter has to stay back in his answers makes him all the more important. He is not always quite 'normal', but unlike a Timothy Treadwell, you never even think of him laughing. <br /> <br /> So, along with his hero (whether from war or not hard to say, As Dieter disputes claiming that those who died were the true heroes, typically but perhaps true. Herzog style his film with a mix of old stock when Dieter's early life is described (the period image of WW2 scenes and the German rubble is always a fascinating sight, and Herzog gets his heel in his timing and collection with music), and in recording the footage of Vietnam in aerial photographs of jungles and fields. Herzog is also very wise not to inject politics into the process at all. There is no "I was used by the Americans" or whatever was thrown into the mix. There is even a feeling that Dieter doesn't hold too much of a grudge over everything that has happened to him, that it just happens in wartime (and of course he dropped bombs on people from his plane). Now, through much of this harrowing - and even in the smaller bits of prisons, bathrooms and lunchboxes, it's always sad. Herzog also has a level of humor in the check. One of my favorite scenes in the film, where Herzog breaks away from Dieter for a moment, is when he shows a "pupil" movie used for American soldiers who are meant to show what should happen if they leave alone in the jungle. be. With all the gears they could possibly include a knife, a flare gun and a very fast helicopter to get around (and it gets hilariously dead-pan voice-over work). <br /> <br /> But even the moments when one laughs, remembers the moments of absurdity in a time of absolute crisis and how can one never really think what it is like to be alone in a strange area surrounded by people who will do something to keep the person as a form of collateral during the war. Dieter, except knowing that flying and aircraft is the only way of life he ever wants (and Herzog ends the movie with a wonderful, elegant note where he is flying over a big plane), knows what to do survive at all costs. Yet, as in many of Herzog's protagonist-driven films, there is the near-unchanging spirit that will continue to persist if someone is strong enough, even through terrible moments (the fate of Dunae) and helicopter rescue ( is he American, or a spy, they ask on the helicopter). Dieter is such a man with a spirit, and through Herzog he is a fantastic, tragic, creative, well-shot, though perhaps too short, tribute to his life. And of course, it even pumps me even more for the upcoming dramatization, Redding Dawn.
