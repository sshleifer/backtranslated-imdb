I always felt me. Merkerson has never been given a role to fit her skills. She is known to millions as the Lt. On Law and Order. She was seen in several theatrical releases, always in a supporting role. HBO's Lackawanna Blues change it and let this talented actress shine as Nanny, a successful entrepreneur in a world that changes from segregation to integration. But the story is actually about the colorful variety of characters she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in Lackawanna, New York, a suburb of Buffalo. <br /> <br /> The story can be in any big African-American community from the 50's and 60's from Atlanta's Sweet Auburn to New York's Harlem. But the segregation integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the people at Nanny's boarding house. The story revolves around Nanny's relationships with all sorts of people, played by some of the best actors in the business (I didn't intentionally say black actors - this ensemble is an incredible variety of black talent, except Jimmy Smits, of course) I recommend this movie as a fun and colorful look on a passing day.
