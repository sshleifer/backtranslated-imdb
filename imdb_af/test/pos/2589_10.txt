After just getting the "Loony Tunes Golden Collection" (which I highly recommend), I will try to respond to most if not all cartoons individually.

Rabbit, Duck." Bags and Daffy argue over who Elmer Fudd should short. It lets me laugh every time! On the DVD it's a comment, featurette, and option to play it only music. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A + <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Disc 1: An Introduction by Chuck Jones; The Son of Termite Terrice Part 1; Movies from the Movies "Two Guys From Texas" and "My Dream is Yours", both with Bugs cameos; Bridging sequences for an episode from the "Bugs Bunny show"; the Astro Nuts sound recording session; 2 vintage trailers; " Blooper Bunny: Bugs Bunny 51st and a half year "with optional commentary with author Greg Ford & stills gallery
