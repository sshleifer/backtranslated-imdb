I was one of the few who left my way to see it in the theater. I've been thinking about it ever since. After two DVD views, I'm happy to say it's perfect. Like a big comedy, I laughed more at each look, both in anticipation of gags, but also after I missed things before. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge is doing great with creating crazy comic characters and fitting them into their world to make sense. In the office space, the environment makes the characters credible. The future of idiocy gives him the freedom to write amazing stupid characters and make them work. I'll wait to see if they release a better DVD with some real features before they buy it. But this movie deserves support on DVD not being offered at the theater.
