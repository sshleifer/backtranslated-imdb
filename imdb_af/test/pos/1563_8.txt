I just saw it on cable. I liked it. It was my interest and the dramatic choices were good. The old couple were very good and good to be subtly creepy. The cinematography is not that good, but the loose video also adds to the realism, so it's a trade off, you know? Sometimes the girl would hit the New England accent too hard. The accent would come and go. Anyway, I thought the movie was well done overall, though. The storyline was strong and dramatic tension was held because you felt they were a subtle riddle, though things were eternal. Good work on a low budget. Another good SUNY purchase movie maker. Away to go.
