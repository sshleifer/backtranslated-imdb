It's a remake of the 80's anime classic, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-hitting robot boomers. The animation is sharp, the characters are well developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular work, so the series also contains great songs. There is a fair amount of violence, but most are against robots, and there is a fan service, but nothing too terrible. The DVDs also have many extras, including commentaries, that really enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the show. A must-have for any anime fan. <br /> <br /> Also recommend: Burst Angel, Armitage III
