I'm glad they finally released it on DVD. I bought the videotape years ago and watched it at least once or twice a year. <br /> <br /> Grammer has a furious mind about him making this movie a real success. The formula is definitely not original, but it's very funny. I'm very surprised it didn't get higher in the ratings. <br /> <br /> This is known as one of my all-time favorite comedies. It's just a fun movie that makes you feel. And sometimes it's all a movie should be.
