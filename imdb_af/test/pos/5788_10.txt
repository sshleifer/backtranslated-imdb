I have the good general logic of knowing that oil cannot last forever and I am well aware of how much of my suburban life revolves around petrochemical products. I was an avid consumer of new technology and I love the power system space, so I know that even the energy crisis associated with Peak Oil will change my life significantly. <br /> <br /> The end of Suburbia shows in a rational and entertaining way just how much my entire family's lifestyle needs to change in my lifetime. I am especially worried about the future generations that need to pick up the tab for our remains, but the filmmakers are hopeful of recognizing human ingenuity and determination - and the sense of community that is likely to be through shared hardship. <br /> <br /> There is no point in pretending that Peak Oil is baseless propaganda - or treating it like the approaching radioactive cloud in "On The Beach" (ie with suicide pills ready). Even with our best efforts, times will be completely over, and I hope there is enough compassion and humanity to go around.
