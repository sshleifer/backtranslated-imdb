Summary: Kelsey Grammar, Rob Schneider, Lauren Holly, Rip Torn This movie is a classic family favorite. At least for most members of my family it is. One of us rolls our eyes to the recording of this movie and thinks, "What a silly movie." But I'm not that person. I still find this movie amusing. I just watched it last night with someone who had never seen it before, and I laughed as hard as the first time I looked at it. It's still very funny to me. <br /> <br /> Navy captain Tom Dodge (Grammar) is a bit of a black sheep in the fleet. He is the kind of guy going to play golf while on a part, cracking a ball on a golf course while sailing through it. He is the kind of guy who gets drunk, goes out and wakes up with a hangover and a tattoo on his dongle. He is not the kind of guy everyone wants to command. <br /> <br /> But Dodge is at the end of the line. He has made applications several times to get his own subscription, and if he doesn't get a part this time, he is looking for a desk, which means it's for fleet life. The Admiralty decides to give him its own boat, but they do not give it a new core. They give him a diesel sub, an old relic of World War II. His goal is to clean her and run her on the Atlantic for a war game. <br /> <br /> Of course, Dodge is a bit frustrated to give him a crappy boat when he has worked so hard to get to the point that he is there, so he goes to Admiral Winslow. (Torn) about it. Winslow explains the purpose of the war match. Diesel subs are still being sold in the real world, to name a few like Iran, Iraq and Libya. Winslow wants to know what would happen if a delegate arrived in a diesel sub-captain to the United States and tried to smuggle a nuclear weapon into one of the bases. Will they make it? Dodge and most of the Admiralty don't think so, but Winslow probably wants to know, so he designed this war game. Dodge's mission is to take the Stingray out, then try to evade the US's core fleet and inflate the US naval base. In simulated battle, of course. <br /> <br /> So, it's about as deep as the plot gets. It's not a plot-driven movie. It's a silly movie that's just a big gag. It makes fun of itself and you are not expected to take it seriously. If you have a good mute on a Friday night, I want to ask you to check it out. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (worth a look)
