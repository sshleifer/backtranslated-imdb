Count me as one lucky to see no Hastings in this episode. The poor man says dr. Watson doesn't do anything to me because he just picks up every scene he's in. Yapp is often needed for the story as representative of the official, and a small Miss. Lemon is fine for spices, but Hastings is painfully submerged to be overpowered in various episodes. If I have to sit through another void. "Oh, I say there!" I'll take the gas pipe. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, the more Poirot gets you in a Poirot story, the better. Each line for Hastings is one way from Poirot. And I've never read the books, so I really don't care to be true to Christie's characters. Many viewers / reviewers seem to have a problem separating the movies from the books. If you want the book written, then read it. I don't see the point to watch the television version if you know what will come next in each stage. Theater is not prose - don't expect a transcript.
