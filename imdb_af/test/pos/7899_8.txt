Let's see it, you know what to expect when you vote in a post-1990 Corey Feldman movie, there are probably breasts, guns and cars. say there is more to this movie than just naked ladies (I'm sorry to say), because it is mainly people who kill themselves in a variety of unusual and, as the name suggests, often "mystical" ways. I love horror, and I love this movie. If you don't, you probably won't. But I think it is worth it to make most people go, it's not so crazy that it will ruin your weekend or anything. All in all, if she has unimaginable good fun, a little grim and an 80-year-old superstar in the mood, you're in the right place. it's a cracker !!!!
