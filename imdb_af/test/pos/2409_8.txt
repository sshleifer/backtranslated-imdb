I'm not sure how I can make ten lines out of this question, but I'll try. <br /> <br /> When Julie went to the dance, they dance to slow music. What was the name of the song that played and who played it? <br /> <br /> I love the song! And I watch the movie over and over just to hear that song. <br /> <br /> I did several searches online and even watched the soundtrack, but I can't find the song. <br /> <br /> It may be because the song they danced wasn't a complete song and only partially. <br /> <br /> I would appreciate it if someone out there knows who the name of the song and the group that sang it. <br /> <br /> Thank you. <br /> <br /> Frank
