The biggest effort plus the best role ever in a movie by director Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn on the front row combined. Someone said this movie was good because it was corrected and written by Tim Robbins, but I convinced you that Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon gave me a wonderful show that I called out to my heart. Their acting is so real! No doubt that this movie is 4 and 3/4 out of 5!
