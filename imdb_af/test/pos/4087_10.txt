Like some people here, I love Stingers! In Norway it was broadcast much later. It also means we're in the 176 episode. (yes, that's right) I have to say that I really like Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day when we reach 192 episode. Stingers may be the series (except Gray's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are incredible! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personally, I think she is one of the best access we have! I know he's not known as SUPER, but she's really a good actress! Stingers let me be a policeman! I love it! <br /> <br /> PS: Do you know if you can buy the episodes?
