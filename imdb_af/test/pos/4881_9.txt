I'm not in reality showing so much, but this one is exceptional because the viewer eventually gets something useful from it, except entertainment. I don't have kids, but SuperNanny's lessons will be a great help when (and if) I ever do! My only complaint is that the performance has been watered down since it was in the US. I prefer the British version, with the sterner nanny approach. Is it just me or does anyone else find the American version to be a little soft ... now it's the "kid, softer" nanny? I think we need a spoonful of sugar to help put the medicine down! Still, nothing wrong with a juicy happy ending, is there?
