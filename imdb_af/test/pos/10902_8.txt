After reading the comment on this movie and seeing it now, I can understand how the person feels about it. The decisions taken were in common sense. When the movie came out, I heard the information how it happened. The storyline is made from a real event. During an award show, an actor, who thanked the people, attributed the award to a former school teacher, who unexpectedly came out. <br /> <br /> Of course, many come from the closet every day. Each outing is different for each person. In real life the outcome of any individual will also be different. And the willingness to accept who they are is the most important thing in life to achieve personal happiness. For those around them, the joy and honesty can make life more full. For the movie, the outcome of how Howard is out is much more comical than real life. And the acceptance of the community showed others that Howard was himself and nothing else. <br /> <br /> Overall, the shows were crazy. The memorable quotes and use of music add to the stereotypes out there in the world, but are taken with tongue and cheekhuman. It's a movie. Sit, watch with an open mind and laugh at your head.
