A surprisingly nice movie. Beautifully thought out, beautifully directed, beautifully acted, beautifully acted and beautifully photographed ..... the cinematography is nothing short of beautiful. It is a war movie but is epic in its scope and combines romance, tragedy and comedy into a story so disturbing as it evokes.
