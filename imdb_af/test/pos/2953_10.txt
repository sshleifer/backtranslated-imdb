Amidst a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues to make the documentary and discover a story he didn't expect. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of the word, where a nice but unknowing narrator privately privileges the public. The story therefore has a double tissue, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary author. <br /> <br /> Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only to follow his story dogly, although it threatens his whole mind of his parents' relationship, but also to never give sensation or melodrama. Although the details of Hollywood are in the details, Doug Block treats the story as he would every day. For those of us who have always speculated about our parents' lives before we came to the scene (or after we arrived, but while we ourselves were absorbed to see that they have a life independent of ourselves), give 51 Birch Street Fair Warning: There are wonderful things in the country, but beware if you prefer to go there. <br /> <br /> But the warning is that the audience will slowly wander over the details of their parents' past. This is not a warning for those who have given a glimpse of Block's parents' lives. The film is a wonder to make the mother alive as a lively and passionate but introspective person who makes her own conscious decisions in the 50's. The filmmaker's particular success is actually seeing the viewers the young woman behind the older parent and grandparent. We all know that our parents were young and powerful once, but in 51 Birch Street the mother is. The father, who was far away while the filmmaker and his sister grew up, eventually stayed far in the film, but it was more to his own elusive nature than to his depiction. This biography autobiography is dramatic, intense and memorable, and it's sure viewers are screaming for closer look at their own family albums, but more reluctant to look at the back of the photos.
