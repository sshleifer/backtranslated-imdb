One thing that came to me when I watched this movie was that it was fun / exciting for the cast and the crew; I could feel that they were going against the budget constraint with enthusiasm and dedication, as they apparently liked the people involved. <br /> <br /> I tend to have original B-hearted movies, and I think it's one such work. The actors seem to be sitting there more than usual, perhaps because of good leadership from the main actress / director, and they were apparently clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent, viewable artwork. . <br /> <br /> The criticism of this movie, more or less saying, "why not just rent a hardcore porn movie," makes the point why they didn't like the movie. Go to this movie and hope for many T&A without patience for the material of the plot, why it is so unbeatable for them. One can say the movie is more of a romantic work than a soft porn movie, even if I take it, the star did her part of soft porn. I think she graduated. <br /> <br /> In terms of writing, the dialogue is not a big part of the movie, as in a Tarentino movie, but the plot is decent and the twist is original and sometimes fun. Especially the end is not a disappointment, but a pleasure, with the villianess / heroine and the "leading man" learning about their complex web of feelings. <br /> <br /> I understand that the producer got a 3 movie deal from it. Beware of the proof of a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensitivity and pride. <br /> <br /> Gabriella and the other girls with nudity plays were nice with warm, not just airhead bimbos, so as an erotic science fantasy piece with beautiful nude art, even with the boundaries of B-movie. country, not disappointing.
