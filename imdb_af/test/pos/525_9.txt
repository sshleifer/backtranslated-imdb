I didn't know what to expect from this very popular (and hilarious) Swedish comedy and satire team, as they released their first feature film. More broad satire? Well, we get four contemporary, extraordinarily memorable stories of family pains, especially generational gaps and paternity. But it's drama, grateful, and what a drama! Epic in its scope, as every episode is from carefully picked, geographically different parts of Sweden. But every story can carry a whole movie seriously, if it is extended separately. <br /> <br /> It is dark, twisted, harrowing, yet largely entertaining and breathtaking. Script, acting and cinematography are absolute world class, like three hours in a blink of an eye. These are four shades of mastery, and easily one of the best films in the nations theater history. This is Sweden's answer to "Shortcuts" or "Magnolia", if you like, and immediately on the same scale! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 of Ozjeppe
