I served as a corps on Parris Island in the late 60's, a little over 10 years after "The D. I." was shot. I was in some of the barracks where they filmed some of the indoor scenes. I knew many drill instructors and many recruits. I think the movie is as close as any movie to show the life of a site and that of a Drill Instructor. Certainly, I think this is the best thing Jack Webb ever did. If you were in the army, you should see this movie. It was like it was. It shows how important it is to take a lot of raw recruits and make them into men ready to defend our country. One feature I found is fascinating that most characters are played by real Marines, not actors.
