This film deals with the topics of loss, personal struggle and transformation in such a smart, friendly, sensitive and visually amazing way that I am completely transported. It is a rare gem of a movie in the way it honors beauty and women. You should see for yourself. Dreya Weber (Jane) portrays the subtlety of a remarkable, if not somewhat broken, personality in a way that every woman will have. I found the honesty of the emotional interactions between characters to be very refreshing and profound. There was nothing in this movie that told me "low budget" in terms of quality. Nothing. The fact that it is a low-budget movie is a tribute to the film's creators. The final order during the credits will also turn off your socks. It's a brilliant celebration of Jane's choice. Unexpected and inspiring.
