Sweet, rich valley girl unfolds on a punk from the alley and when her sneaky friends disapprove of him, she is forced to choose between her heart and her popularity. Very funny romantic comedy mixes in elements of black comedy and 80's cheese making it so much more fun to watch. The movie does not just follow the life of the valley girl and her punk; But also her friends as their shop, party, hang out and go to the mall. If the dialogue didn't laugh for you for a week, the music will. Songs like "Johnny, Are You Queer?" is found throughout. Also, Elizabeth Daily is a funny, existential character and the Prom King & Queen speech is hilarious!
