My architect is a good film about Nathaniel Kahn's quest for himself via the legacy of his famous architect father, Louis Kahn, who has died since 1974. The film slowly but perfectly builds and begins as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds in a beautiful story with much deeper meaning in the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work. <br /> <br /> I've never heard of Louis Kahn before this movie, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work. Through the words (both good and bad) of Louis Kahn's colleagues, you get a very good sense of what Nathaniel should feel when recalling memories and recalling stories. Sometimes it seemed that these people told Nathaniel how to feel about his father. As I listened to every memory, my own opinion of this man would be beautiful to awful, sometimes in a moment, so you would get a good feel for the rollercoaster that Nathaniel's emotions had to ride. <br /> <br /> The final sequence in Bangladesh made the movie completely for me. The respect with which the people of Bangladesh spoke of Louis Kahn's work hit all the loose points together, and hopefully for Nathaniel. <br /> <br /> I think Nathaniel Kahn finally found what he was looking for.
