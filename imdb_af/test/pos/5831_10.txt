OZ is an old TV series released by HBO. It shows life in a security prison called Oswald, but the main plot is focused on Emerald City, which is one of the prison levels. <br /> <br /> Oz has a wonderful plot and a great role! There are many characters and almost everyone is very interesting. Basically they are divided into groups (gangs), the Sicilian, the Black people, the Aryans, the Gays, the Latinos and many others who do not have a specific group, but deal with many others such as Ryan O'Reily (The Irish) . <br /> <br /> The plot is very well built, there is a lot of conspiracy inside, lots of fighting for the power. But it is not only exposed in the form of violence, everything is very intelligent and clever, nothing happens without a reason, everything is connected and very interesting to guess! I really love this series, and who wants to see something intelligent, produced very well with a very good role and performances, MUST OZ!
