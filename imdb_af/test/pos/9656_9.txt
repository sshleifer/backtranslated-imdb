It's a beautiful and beautiful epic fantasy with lots of heart. I lost in this lovely movie, watch it at the Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. It is truly romantic with a touch message. The artwork and the effects are visually striking and the fact that the director is a wonderful artist is so clear. The frames are like watching moving art. It also has strong and talented role players. What a wonderful surprise to see Joss Ackland is just a fairy tale perfect king. Sarah Douglas is great because the villain and Christine Taylor and Tom Schultz make a lovely romantic couple. The fact that the movie was made on a ridiculous little indie movie budget just blew me away. It may not be the nice Hollywood stuff we were flooded with, but it is a very nice movie to rent and curl up on a rainy Saturday. Don't forget the microwave popcorn. That's my advice. Just enjoy it.
