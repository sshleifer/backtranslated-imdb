All-Monster congregation in the final movie in Universal's famous cycle of classic horror stories. Count Dracula (an intense, brave John Carradine), who calls himself Baron Latos, comes to Dr. Edelmann (Onslow Stevens) and asks to be healed of his misery. Of course, it's just a ruse. Then, by chance, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney), aka "The Wolf Man" appears, and of course he * really wants to be healed. <br /> <br /> Like others have noticed, the samples do not get equal screen time. The Frankenstein Monster (Glenn Strange) is thrown at the end just for the purpose of including all the Universal Monsters. Stock material and library music are also used here. The film may spend a little too much time with the Dracula part of the story, although Carradine gives an impressive, non-hammy performance in the role of the count. The movie is mainly a showcase for Stevens, which goes through a tragic character bow of its own and does an excellent job. The women are beautiful, and I must say I loved Jane Adams as the enlightened nurse - what happens to a hunchback. <br /> <br /> Of course, it wouldn't be complete without the inclusion of angry villagers. <br /> <br /> Apparently, professionally-made chiller is just for my taste, not scary, but whatever. This is a respected series entry overall. <br /> <br /> 7/10
