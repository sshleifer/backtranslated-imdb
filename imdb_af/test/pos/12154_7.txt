I would be interested to hear from the director, Barbet Schroeder, why he decided to make his first film, and more specifically what he is interested in hippies - or rather this form of the Euro-hippie paradise - and about their demise. The film is at least true enough to keep one interested, but in its own kind of truth it is strange, biased. It is a given heroin (aka, "Horse") is terrible stuff, rotten, the conclusion for many drug users who regard it as the all-end all because it is basic: then everything else stops, it becomes life, And it's either a continuous run for more of the same or death. More start than something about a romance between a New York girl and a German man, but it gets something different, better or worse (sometimes both in the same scene). It's basically about two "young" people, Estelle and Stefan, meeting each other in a city where Stefan came as a kind of wanderer away from his own country. She is also walking, and may be too friendly with a big time magazine called Wolf. They end up on a remote island somewhere in the area and after a somewhat daring grab for some "horses" by Estelle, they also find a road in the form of a seemingly distant house along the sea. Schroeder's comments on youth and sex and drugs are not too simplistic, which actually makes the film clear and intelligent, so many years later. It is both direct and subtle, more about the characters and then about the fact that what he portrays in other hands can only be a propagandist hippie exploitation picture. Perhaps it is very enjoyable, and it is just a guess, Schroeder uses as inspiration the kind of long-standing order of Bergman's summer with Monika: two children in a relentless relationship, a good one that certainly isn't that good. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I must mention that there are problems, some are indeed indeed. The performances are not entirely convincing; Some plays have some strength or the actors have a good relationship with each other, but Klaus Grumberg presents himself, even though he is naturally German. (In that case, I would have preferred Klaus Kinski to make it more slick, but deep enough for the subject), just like Boer to his own degree. And there are gaps of naive in the script that seem to be as deep as it really thinks. On the other hand, there are two big things: Nestor Almendros, the big filmographer (ie Days of Heaven), is DP and is a big boost for a first time director like Schroeder. Almost every image is seen with a wonderful purpose or artwork, whether it be a shot of the cliffs at sea or sun or something as simple as the apparent natural light of a room. <br /> <br /> The other thing is Pink Floyd, probably the main reason I and many others have heard of the film in the first place (years before I really knew who Schroeder was, I got the "More" - soundtrack when I saw Pink Floyd albums). It is very good music throughout, sometimes the sensible variety that gives them the reputation they deserve. Some of it is also a bit boring, even if it is a movie that has free love and lots of drugs and sometimes both at the same time. I won't arrange it anywhere as high as a Meddle of Animals, certainly Dark Side, but it also helps raise the subject even more, especially if one is least expecting or in low tones or swinging inside and outside buildings like Stefan or others walk on the streets. It's almost better atmosphere than the movie itself deserves, but overall Lake is still worth watching as a time-out but powerful, like a less ambitious but more substantive Zabriskie point.
