The subspecies are always the best vampire movies. there is something about them that makes them special. I think it's the feeling you get when you see it. <br /> <br /> They were set in modern times and yet they felt as if they were in the 1700s. s or 1800`s think it has a bit to do with the set used when it works like that, keep it on the old man :). <br /> <br /> In a quick round of what happened in the first part - Radu was thought to have been burned by his father from his home, and he decided to come back and take what he thought his birthright is. the bloodstone and all his father had killed him, his father was played by Angus Scrimm (the long man of the Phantasm movies). and take the bloodstone that has power for whoever it has, because whoever needs it, never offend anyone, because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the Radu falls out of it. he goes slowly insane. (That's all we need to have an insane vampire, as if a normal vampire isn't bad enough). Well, Radu's brother, Stephan, tries to put an end to his evil ways while trying to stop himself with a tourist staying at a house / fort belonging to a friend of his. <br /> <br /> Well, one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well, you'll have to see the movie to see what from here onwards. <br /> <br /> I will soon see the comments on other persecutors <br /> <br /> The difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and it is not that it will not appeal to everyone but it has an atmosphere much better than that of buffy, although Radu doesn't look as good as the wonder full of Sarah Michelle Gellar :). <br /> <br /> rating for this movie 10/10 a good example of how a vampire movie should be done :). <br /> <br />
