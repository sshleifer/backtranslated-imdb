I am a 55-year-old, pretty dressed gay white man. Since I don't watch TV, I watch at least 250 movies a year, most on DVD. I keep notes on all the movies I see and rate. Since December 2003 I have only seen five movies as much as eight times. So, I chose eighteen better than at least 700 other recent movies. Mr. Bell is too modest in his film commentary. EIGHTEEN is a great movie. And it also led me to two "firsts". <br /> <br /> I watched the movie, the first time, and I was constantly sounding and weighing in the last half hour, something that just happened to me three times before. (Five minutes in the movie I knew it would be very good.) When Jason Whitman started reciting, I lost it, and then ... The Kiss. Well, this is one of Film's big kisses, and that scene under Filmdom's most striking and memorable. When Pip blew out the candle at the end and rolled the credits, I clapped. I'm glad. I like happy ends. I cried. <br /> <br /> Then I looked at the trailer and the TLA previews and thought, "Okay, is this $ 800,000 or so, India, so good?" I immediately looked back at eight, something that only occurred three times. And EIGHTS blow my socks off again, even more. Then I looked at the "Making of EIGHTEEN" documentary and was completely charmed by the cast and mr. Bell. <br /> <br /> So, I thought I'd look at the Director's comments again. I've never watched a movie three times in one night. After the third time at 3:00 I knew I had just had a big movie; EIGHTEEN is now # 10 on my Top Twenty Movies of all time. And in the very small universe of big gay or gay subtext, there is Brokeback Mountain, AUGTEEN, Mulholland Drive and Maurice. <br /> <br /> Thank you Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully aware, with a wonderful role-playing, a wonderful moving, understated score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, touch, utterly fitting and hummable song. I can go on, but I won't worry much more. <br /> <br /> This movie had received Oscar nominations, probably one for Best Photo. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful. Mrs. Gill's beautiful, sultry voice was a surprising epiphany. And Mr. Ian McKellen? "Nuf said. Awesome. <br /> <br /> EIGHTEEN is why I hit more than 200 mediocre to totally horrific movies (some in the $ 150 million plus range) for a year to treasure that one treasure. find, that one beautiful, magical, unique and Finally (I promise), my second "first" - I have never commented on any movie I have seen. </ a> </ p> <p > br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr. Richard Bell! Breathtaking genius. Give this guy $ 100m for his next film! He made $ 700,000 in one of the top 50 movies of all time. If I had the cash , I would give him $ 75,000 a year's cost of living and match any funds raised for his next film. Mr. Bell is already 31 years old. Can you imagine him at the age of 45? > <br /> Wise and witty, tender and brutal, pleasant, gripping, understated, but edgy, cold and exciting, fascinating, haunting, memorable: REAL, THE MAS TERPIECE.
