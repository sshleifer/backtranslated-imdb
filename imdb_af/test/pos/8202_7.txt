It was a movie that made you think. Some parts are a bit cheesy, some parts are pretty good. Plot temporarily thickened and just when you thought Angella (Sandra) had found a friend, the friend was fraud or death. All I have to say is that DENNIS MILLER should have been in the whole movie. His character was the best, very refreshing after all the crap that Angella went through. He would have lifted me and Angella through the spills.
