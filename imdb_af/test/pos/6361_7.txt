Dan Ackroyd in his first stars as Johgn Burns, a spiritual asylum escape that shrinks as his own to travel to La La Land and offer a popular radio talk while the regular host (Charle Grodin in his string priest) has a holiday take. Along the way, Ackroyd comes along with Walter Matthau, a fellow utility, and the rest is pure tribute. Ackroyd and Matthau play very well apart. Ackroyd's amazing real wife, Donna Dixon, is together for the ride as another shrink. The end feels a bit rushed and confronted, which is the only thing that loves me best for this movie, an 8th 80 year old jewel.
