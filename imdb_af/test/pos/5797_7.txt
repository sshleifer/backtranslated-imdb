In Russia, ordinary teenager Vera (Natalya Negoda) lives a quiet life with her drunkard father and her simpleton mother, without waiting for the call for a technical course of telephone operator. Her brother Victor (Aleksandr Negreba) lives in Moscow with his own family and sometimes visits his dysfunctional family and Vera, who always motivates to argue. When Vera meets university student Sergei (Andrei Sokolov), they fall in love with each other and decide to marry. Sergei moves to Vera's house, but lives in conflict with her father. This relationship leads the family to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> I just saw "Malenkaya Vera" and I loved many of these deep family drama. I'm not familiar with the lifestyle of the former URSS, but there are some unusual behaviors that I found very interesting. The first one, when Victor told Vera she was pregnant, not because her parents wanted her, but because they wanted to go to a bigger apartment. Another, when the family goes to a truck to the beach. Many problems of Vera's family and their friends, the oppression in the park and other situations portrayed in the movie are common in Third World countries. This low budget movie is very well targeted, and the story is very deep and real. The film has good performances and actress Natalya Negoda is very beautiful. In the front page of the Brazilian VHS, issued by Sagres distributor, there is information that Natalya Negoda was the centerpiece of Playboy magazine. I'm not sure how exactly the captions in Portuguese are, as very long sentences in Russian are limited to short translation in few words. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Pequena Vera" ("The Little Vera")
