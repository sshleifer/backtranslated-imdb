I'm proud to say I'm a student at UW-Milwaukee, where parts of the movie have been shot. Yes, I recognize Mitchell Hall, where I took a film class, possibly the same course as fellow student Smith. <br /> <br /> That's where I learned about American Movie. Our professor told us about it shortly before his release. To be sure, I was intrigued, but for some reason I postponed it for a few months (it should have done well if it is still playing in Milwaukee). <br /> <br /> When I finally died to see it, I thought it was an entertaining documentary. It's not a masterpiece - it's a bit too long, but I find Mark's passion and dedication inspiring. I hope this movie shows the beginning of bigger and better things. Perhaps his forthcoming "Northwestern" will lead him to prosperity. Who knows? <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (from ****) <br /> <br /> 108 min / released by Sony Pictures Classics
