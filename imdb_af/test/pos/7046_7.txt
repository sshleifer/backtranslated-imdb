I even struggle to watch comedic movies or television. They are uncomfortable, vulgar and, above all, not funny. This one can be seen as a refreshing blast from the past. It is worth looking at, and I do not believe it will be dated in any meaningful way. Classical humor is classic humor, and good writing is good writing, regardless of the era in which it was created. <br /> <br /> I'd love to see this movie again; This had in mind after watching the somewhat similar "Summer School" on television recently. Like that slightly newer movie, "Meatballs" are funny without being cruel, too sexual or in bathroom humor. The key is, of course, how the adult character makes such a difference in the life of the teenage character - perhaps even a virtually lifesaving change - and how they both grow up in summer space.
