"Porgy & Bess" was the very first movie my parents ever took me to see. Even at the nice age of 5, I was so surprised by the drama I called out loud on the screen. "Crown, please don't Bess!" I was fortunate enough to see the one TV show of "Porgy & Bess" so many years ago and now I have all the great memories (and the album) to remember this wonderful, wonderful movie. I wait and hope and one day I hope to have a copy of "Porgy & Bess" - but it doesn't seem like it will. What is the hold? Clearly, there is enough public interest in this movie to justify a release. After all these years I remembered it and I didn't seem to be alone. This movie is full of human emotion - jealousy, lust, anger, bravery, determination. "Porgy & Bess" is a buried gem that is earned to be brought to light for a new audience to admire and enjoy an old audience.
