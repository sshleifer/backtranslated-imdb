I saw it at The Tribeca Film Festival, in the family section. I'm not sure, or one of my kids really got the movie, but I must say it was a wonderful short film. <br /> <br /> 'Nostradamus and Me' is an interesting short film about hope and fears. that we all grew up in the 1980s, which is expanding to how my children feel today. Then we had Regan, today we have Bush. Instead of the nuclear war, we have terrorism. <br /> <br /> I really identified the main character, and I myself dated a Curehead in high school. We all felt like "no matter" when we were 16, but it's great to see a movie where they discover everything is important !!! <br /> <br /> Again, I probably wouldn't have put it in the family department ... there were a few too many swear words for younger kids, but it was a wonderful and enjoyable movie to watch.
