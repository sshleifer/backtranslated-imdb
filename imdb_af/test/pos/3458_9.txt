A spectacular film that has so much about the disability in the open, which usually scares people. It showed how thoughts can be captured by fewer than willing bodies and how difficult it must be to see what is happening to others who are required for the disabled person. <br /> <br /> Love, friendship, fear, frustration, joy, humor and so many other things were so well captured. The 2 main characters played very well by the 2 skilled actors and invited your laughter, tears, worries, joys, and apprehensions. <br /> <br /> I approached this movie with a mix of interest and excitement worrying that it might be too much a game of sympathy or just live on negatives. However, it was a beautifully crafted story of 2 friends. <br /> <br /> I loved it.
