Based on Mika Waltari's Book, this second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color, beautiful music and panoramic spectacle. The plot is sometimes stunned by indifferent words, but it has a strong social content. Man is controlled by his emotions, and every action has an equal effect. But to really enjoy the movie, first see the movie, then read the book. Though different, it sheds light on a lot of things not seen on the screen and gives breath to even more of the depth of Sinuhe.
