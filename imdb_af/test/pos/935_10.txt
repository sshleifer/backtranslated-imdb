See three colors: blue and three colors: white. They are both great movies and give an extra dimension to the final Three Colors: Red. Red is a fantastic movie. It can be enjoyed in a single look, and indeed, the climax of the movie is very powerful at first sight. But look again. Once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie, you will see new things every time. With the first performance, you understand that the movie is the work of a brilliant mind. With each additional look, you find yourself discovering that it's actually a work of genius. Red is meant to symbolize brotherhood in the French flag. The story changes the theme of brotherhood to be seen in corners, which one would never suspect. The facets of fraternity shared by the different characters are as deep as you care. If you get used to the blatant "symbolism" in most mass films, you can find Red a little slower. You may look at a screen full of intensity that doesn't satisfy you ... and, wonderfully, wonder what all the excitement is about. This is not an indifferent experience. Everything is not explained to you. You must think as you look. You should see ... not just look. Wonderful movie ... one meant to enjoy a wonderful movie actor.
