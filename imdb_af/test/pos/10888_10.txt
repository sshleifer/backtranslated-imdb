You only wear the best Italian suits from Armani, hand-sewn and fitted to your exact dimensions. Your car is the best that German engineering offers and is equipped with as many gadgets as horses under the hood. You are a member of the best polo clubs, which regularly eat at restaurants like Spago, and are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world. Your pocket watch doubles as a nuclear explosive, while your reliable pen can also be used as a semi-automatic 22 caliber gun. You ski in the Alps, dive deep into the Caribbean, dive over the Andes, and all your hair is never out of place. You are Bond, James Bond, the world's best-known spy, favorite son of the good queen, bad boy of the British SS, and perhaps the most wanted man in the world. James Bond's character was created by Ian Fleming and is the longest lasting icon of the film industry. It is the subject of more than fifteen films spanning four decades. The youngest man to play the role is Pierce Brosnan, who took over the role of James Bond from Timothy Dalton in 1996 and made his 007 debut in Goldeneye. <br /> <br /> This is the first major title creation developed by a third party on the Nintendo 64. Goldeneye, developed by Rare for Nintendo, has been on the market for some time. The continued dominance in the sales charts is just one proof of how good this game is, and no review library will be without it. <br /> <br /> Let's see it - most of the time, movie-licensed games are flops. Although the two look like a good mix, the results are for the most part awful. Games like Cliffhanger, True Lies, Deadly Weapon, and not all Star Trek flops, are enough ammunition against this mix. And for the record I'm not a fan of movie-licensed games, especially if I've seen the movie. At least that's how I thought. In the case of Goldeneye, I reserved more than normal. While it wasn't a bad movie, Goldeneye didn't make the film so much appeal, and I didn't rank it in the top ten under Bond movies. As a game, let's just say it's a completely different story. <br /> <br /> The game is a first person shooter, and in order to be successful you will need at least as much brain as brawn. . For those who have seen the movie, which I think most of you read it, the story is very consistent and follows the path of the movie with little variation. A Plot to control the world's most dangerous satellite, Goldeneye, began in the USSR, and in the process a beautiful woman was captured. Your missions will be many, the danger is extreme. You will have to rely on your mind and experience to get you through the most disturbing missions the world ever knows. M will instruct you as soon as you are ready. Good day, James.
