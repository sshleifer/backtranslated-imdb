This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is an incessant abundance of emotional and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, People's bodily abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Early religion approach in real life, and everything linked to very raw and powerful blues music. <br /> <br /> I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes, you'll find the tie and improve on all the characters. And the end will be more enjoyable than you can expect. Music is excellent, writing is powerful and acting from everyone was brilliant. <br /> <br /> And the DVD has some great features, including Samuel Jackson's background to learn guitar playing and the blues. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for children and I also warn parents of teenagers.
