Tumbling Doll of Flesh (aka Niku Daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) It was a while on my wish list, and then I got a copy on Ebay a while back. It has never been on DVD, and what I got from Ebay was a very good quality DVD-R, of which I am very pleased. The movie I believe is the most extreme example of torture pornography, with the emphasis on pornography. A woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed. The porn is really real, with the annoying Japanese pixelation trying to hide the hardcore shots, without much success most of the time. After the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave, she is slapped with a baseball bat over the head and taken back to the room and furiously smothered in long shots and screwed into one of the most disgusting scenes, the male porn man in an open wound in her chest. This is after both legs are cut, her arm, and some other love. This film leaves the Guinea series by a long shot, they are not even close to realism, although cheap gore effects are shown in this movie. It is indeed one of the best fake sneakers I have ever seen, if not the best. Now I have to warn you, if you are not in these things, you must stay far away. This movie is very strong, and with the right sex it is very ill, erotic to some extent. And I mean, in a very sick way. But wherever you go on this topic, this movie brings the goods home, and I would definitely recommend looking for them. After reading the movie, I expected something very strong, but it exceeded it.
