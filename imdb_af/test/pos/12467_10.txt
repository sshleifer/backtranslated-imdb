Beautifully-filmed, award-winning director Hugh Hudson (Chariots of Fire) creates a story that brings the whole legend of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke and Tarzan to life from apes to reverence and dignity, and with a scale not yet in Tarzan. films have been seen. Christopher Lambert makes his premier debut as the young Lord, who was raised in nature by a female gorilla after his parents died in Africa. Later returning to what is an alien world to him, that of class and privilege, he feels completely out of place. As soon as he learns what happened to the monkeys who raised him and his world, he realized he had to go back. A sad but triumphant story told a backdrop of fantastic views. This is one of the movies that is required for every Cinemaphile collection.
