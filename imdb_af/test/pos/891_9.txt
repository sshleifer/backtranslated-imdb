Created by Dennis Spooner, 'Department S' was a glamorous show on a discount from Interpol, based in Geneva, created to solve the devastating puzzles that police couldn't handle. If a plane landed at Heathrow with no one on board, if a man in London is flying around in a spacecraft, if a passenger of a Rolls Royce is skipped in a skeleton, a train in A subway station, seems to contain dead commuters, called in "Department S" to sort things out. <br /> <br /> Peter Wyngarde plays 'Jason King', a flamboyant dressed crime story expert whose fertile imagination helped to crack many of the bizarre cases. King caught the public's fancy and later received a spin-off award. He was barely assisted by American Stuart Sullivan (Joel Fabiani) and the lovely Annabelle Hurst (Rosemary Nicols). Exceptionally for a 60-year-old show, the department was led by a black man, 'Sir Curtis Seretse' (Dennis Alaba Peters). If the show looks very much like 'The Avengers', it was almost surprising. It shared many of the same authors and directors! Designed by Chambers & Partners, the colorful titles are worth agreeing. As with so many I.T.C. series, the music was composed by Edwin Astley. His theme for 'Department S' should be considered one of the best television shows of all time. <br /> <br /> Predictably, the display now looks a bit sexist and dated, but don't distract it. Introduce a hybrid of 'Jonathan Creek' and the 'Austin Powers' movies and you have 'Department S'! <br /> <br /> Trivia Note: The episode "A Little War of Kidneys" a young Sir Anthony Hopkins in a big role!
