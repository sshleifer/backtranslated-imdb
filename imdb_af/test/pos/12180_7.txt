In Queen of the Damned, Akasha (Aaliyah) was more sexy and had a bigger, demanding presence, she just caught your eye and attention. Now, the movie had errors, such as the lack of explanation of Akasha's past. What I didn't like was the movie that didn't really explain the movie or show what the relationship between Lestat and Akasha was or was. The role of Akasha (Aaliyah) was similar in the film and she did not appear until the 2nd half of the movie and then to lay it off, her (Akasha) death 2 came quickly. But I liked how Akasha fought back when the guys tried to kill her, because in the book the last fight between Akasha and The Parents was rather boring (they killed Akasha like 2 seconds.) Akasha's head turned off in 1 second and Lestat has changed into the biggest punk in the world. <br /> <br /> Aaliyah played Akasha very well and Stuart was perfect. like Lestat they couldn't have picked a better Akasha or Lestat. "REST IN PEACE AALIYAH"
