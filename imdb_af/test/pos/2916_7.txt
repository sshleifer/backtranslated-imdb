I start straight at the beginning by saying, "I like this movie." It's wiping, it's great, it's tempting and it's fun. Sinhue the doctor, sitting in front of his small stone hut writing his memoirs. And what a story it is! Taken from a river and raised by an elderly couple who pushed him, he became a physician for the poor. He is friends with Horemheb who sees glory while Sinhue sees healing. And both run in the future pharaoh Ankaten, which endures an epileptic fitness. <br /> <br /> And this pharaoh has another mistake: He believes in one god instead of a pantheon of gods. Then it was completely revolutionary. Sinhue and Horemheb grow up. One evening, Sinhue saw a woman who had lost his senses. He gives his practice, sells his parents' home and even their graves just to spend a night with her. Does he? I won't tell you. Meanwhile, Merit, a tavern girl with sweet simplicity, has the power of Jean Simmons, who fell in love with Sinhue. She falls under his spell and under the spell of faith in one god. <br /> <br /> Victor Mature works perfectly as Horemheb. Edmond Purdom is sinhue as the lost doctor (does he find salvation? Stay set). Even Bela Darvi, the woman who steals Sinhue's heart, is not as bad as everyone has said. The fact that she was Daryl F. Zanuck's mistress has nothing to do with the decisive - right? Yeah, right ... still, she wasn't that bad - I saw worse. I think she did better in "The Egyptian" if many of today's young actresses did anything. I said it before and I'll say it again. I like this movie. I recommend it. It makes you think despite some hammers. Enjoy it with this movie; It is worth the effort.
