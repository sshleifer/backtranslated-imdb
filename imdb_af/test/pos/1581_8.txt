I know that Guts of a Beauty and Guts of a Virgin is screaming and hated by many, but I'm going to sit under the bus and say I love them, especially Guts of a Beauty (aka Entrails of a Beautiful Woman) . It looked the other night with a few people down the road and I was amazed at how well it actually went. <br /> <br /> Entrails are the kind of madcap cheapo horror softcore sleaze epic that you really haven't found much from outside Asia (specifically Japan in this case). It's basically a rape / revenge fly with a reincarnated monster instead of a dull shotgun or a powerboat-powered nose or even a stripped dad with a chain saw ... Those things are just stupid. Wouldn't you rather see a hermaphroditic monster with a hilarious snake sample for a wink? <br /> <br /> PERVERSION FACTOR: This movie is high in graphic, sometimes wacky rape series, fake pop shots, and satisfying masturbation and monster sequences that you would like if you like Corman nuggets like Humanoids From The Deep. I don't know, maybe it's a piece, but I personally didn't think that Entrails of a Beautiful Woman dropped me as an avid fan of Asian sleaze and bizarro B photos. <br /> <br /> Yes, I sometimes know My recommendations aren't always everyone's cuppa tea (even for those of you who like the same kind of garbage), but I'm behind this one. 8/10.
