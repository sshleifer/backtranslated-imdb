It's one of the best horror / thrill movies that Hollywood has made in years or even decades. Although, in my opinion, this movie was predictable in parts, it had everything a good movie had in this genre, CHILL, THRILLS, AND YES, many GORE !! HOUSE OF WAX SURE LIVES !!! In parts it was kind of far-fetched, the acting wasn't that good, but my renovation rating for HOUSE OF WAX is eight out of ten ...... if you like being on the edge of your seats, it's just the right movie for you, I have to admit, it was neat to see how the whole town was made out. I enjoy these museums, but after watching this movie, I am now in a completely new way!
