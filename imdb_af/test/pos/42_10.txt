It's one of those movies you don't want to end. The characters are rich like a well-woven tapestry. Colorful costumes, music and characters draw you in and tell a story of the people who lived in the residence over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam war. A young man is taken in by a dynamic, generous woman who runs the house and it's stories based on his experiences. <br /> <br /> I couldn't believe it was a television movie. It was done so well. S. Epatha Merkerson is wonderful as Nanny and she brings so much life to this role. You want to be right among her boarders. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie so much I bought the DVD.
