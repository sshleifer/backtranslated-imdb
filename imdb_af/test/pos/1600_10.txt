<br /> <br /> Beware of Philistines, especially Americans! It has all the elements you will hate. A slow approach to movie language, a picturesque composition, an intense homoerotic focus on its elegant narrative, a wonderful and unusual use of music and, worse, it is based on a story you probably hate. However, if you feel movies should not have derivative plot lines, be full of action and crappy dialogue, don't need the visual grammar of MTV / TV ads, then watch this. This is one of my favorite movies, and may be Visconti's most perfect work piece. It's sublime, like Mahler's movement, he urgently uses in the movie.
