Over the years, I missed this picture of Ronald Reagan, and because of his recent passing to the big screen in heaven, it was recently shown on TV. This is a big low budget B & W movie of the late 1930s, but it is very interesting to see how criminals used their talents to steal money from counterfeit insurance companies during this particular time frame. I was amazed at the role Ronald Reagan (Eric Gregg), The Killer's, '64, played in this photo, along with a great veteran movie star Sheila Bromley (Nona Gregg), Nightmare Circus 73, who was a major supporting actor . It was a good movie that Ronald Reagan showed as a very young man when he was in Hollywood during his career.
