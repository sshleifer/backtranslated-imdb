A movie I may have seen and enjoyed more than any other movie. I first saw it as a child and fought the drama and the great climate. When I got older, I enjoyed it so much or more than before, but now because of all the components that work together to make a true classic. The acting is great (especially Keith as T. Roosevelt), the spectacular spectacular spectacle, the script is full of gems, and the directing it all marvelously. It is loosely based on a real event, and it shows a speed of Europe and a newly emerging America to carve out the 'Sick Old Man' (the Ottoman Empire), as it collapses in fashion, unlike any other 'historical' movie I've seen. Humor, drama, action, love ... it has everything and deserves more praise (much like "The Great Waldo Pepper").
