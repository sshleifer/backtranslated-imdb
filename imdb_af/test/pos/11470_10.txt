I thought this movie was good, I loved the plot, I loved the shooting artists, except for a few, they were not needed and I also enjoyed Mom's character, she was a rider I loved . I have to say that the actors in this gangster movie are well picked because some players sometimes don't fit. Although I hate to say, but I hated the end, I felt like it was going in a different direction. Also, it would have been better with a little more detail, it was based on a real story, but there were so many facts left out, but unlike that, it was good. If you enjoy movies on previous gangsters, you'll enjoy this movie.
