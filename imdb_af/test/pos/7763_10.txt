A Look! <br /> <br /> Excellent positive African American love story. This movie reminded me to watch the old black and white movies with my dad. More truth to life characters seek love, fall in love, and lose it. Old story fresh view. Larenz Tate was so Cary Grant in style, as the character might have been in a clumsey situation, but the actor made him look foolish and cut like a cardboard. Nia Long has always been a favorite of mine. She's nice, even though she's tough, almost like a Kathrine Hepburn. This is one of his best works and shows that he is better than always playing an evil black man. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic, wonderful play, well written, a true love story set in Chicago. can you ask? <br /> <br /> SuperB Black Love Story <br /> <br /> Amsterdam, Holland
