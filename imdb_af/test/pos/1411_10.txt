The theme song often goes through my head all these years. I was never much of a TV viewer, probably because I soon got my busy teenage years when my family bought our first set in 1948 and never became part of my life. But from Lawman's first episode, I was addicted, and that's the only TV show I've ever scheduled my week. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, credible, well-written and well-intentioned, and John Russell is the most beautiful man I've ever seen. (Peter Brown wasn't a dog, either: o) <br /> <br /> I agree it's one of the most underrated TV series of all time. I hope I can find a few episodes for my grandchildren to watch.
