The creative team we brought the police team - and the naked rifle derived from it - said in their interview that they were told by their network contact that the show would be canceled after the first episode was delivered. Actually, the show was never given a chance. Typical Hollywood. The contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that the viewer would actually need to watch it, because the show was funny. Most shows are presented on TV, provided that the viewer had to stand up and miss a few minutes while getting food, or to the toilet, etc. <br /> <br /> The humor of the show is extremely dry (it does not use a track) and the universe in which the characters live is one in which anything can happen, regardless of the logic, as long as it is absolutely incredible; So, for example, in one episode, a surgeon has to bribe an informant on the street to get a hint of heart surgery. <br /> <br /> Those familiar with the Naked Gun movies should be warned that there is a number of interesting deviations between the show and the movies. In the movies, Nielsen has developed a specific "task" approach - it is widening eyes when faced with the unexpected. It does not happen in the show, where Nielsen's Drebin is at the center of the rest of the universe - nothing is unexpected for him. There are also no novels in the show, and no parodies of MTV. Finally, the show takes some risks that avoid the movies; In the first episode, Drebin, to re-establish the crime, a group of murderers are shooting a number of different angles - ballistic the difficult way. This is actually a risky bit of humor, because we must assume that it is absolutely normal for police officers to kill each other while investigating a crime, for no other reason than experiment. This kind of thing seldom happens in the movies. <br /> <br /> Individually, each of the episodes is actually cleaner than any of the Naked Gun movies, as they are both compact (more in a shorter time frame), but more quiet (there is no rush for a punch line that sometimes happens in the movies). There are some discrepancies that occur in the movies (mainly "2" and "3") that never appear in the shorter time frame of the show. <br /> <br /> Of course there is no doubt that Naked Gun (the first film) is one of the great comedy of theater theater. And if you watch the episode of the TV show after one episode, the dry quality of humor can take away your tolerance. <br /> <br /> However, it would be helpful to have a DVD of this, and watch an episode a day for a few weeks - As laughter, as some claim, medicinal value, look at this performance is good for your health.
