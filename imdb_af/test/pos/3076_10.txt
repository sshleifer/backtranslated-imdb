"Robin Hood: Men in Tights" received no respect. It was hilarious! Cary Elwes was excellent as the "Prince of thieves," and David Chappelle, Amy Yasbeck, Patrick Stewart, Richard Lewis and Mark Blankfield, as Blinkin did everything well. I will never understand the hostility towards "Robin Hood: Men in Tights", but I know a great comedy when I see one. <br /> <br /> "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" receive *** from ****.
