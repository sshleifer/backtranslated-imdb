I saw it on Zone Horror and fully expected it to compete like most movies they play, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie turns to 2 friends and a maniac in a monster truck they are chasing (I know it sounds but it's really good), the movie is creepy when it comes to being and is very funny in parts. In an unintentional way, it is well played and is fun, but also stingy, there are some very funny black humor that is also thrown in. It's not the most original movie, but so. If you go to Shakespeare then this is not it, if you go to a fun movie then it will be good
