Greystoke is without a doubt the best tarzan movie I've ever seen. Christopher Lambert portrays a very credible man to return to the world of humanity with the fantastic Ian Holm. The struggle of John to leave the jungle and the monkeys that raised him is quite agitated. Some very unforgettable scenes, including where Lambert makes the ancient sounds of romantic interest, and the scene where he testifies to his father's death. Tarzans' feelings for both worlds are well developed and really make you. <br /> <br /> An excellent and understated movie.
