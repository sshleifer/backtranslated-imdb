A lot of other Jerry Lewis movie, not like all the more famous movies everyone knows. Lewis deals with the difficult task of World War II and National Socialism in Germany in an unconventional manner. But even more interesting and important, he does it in a very un-American way. And as with so many things in the world and especially in the film industry, un-American means more sophisticated, subtler, intelligent or simply better. This is why the film in the US was not successful, but a great success in Europe. <br /> <br /> All in all, Jerry Lewis proved by this movie that he can do much more than simple slapstick comedy.
