Another Asian horror movie packed with intense, and creepy moments. Another Asian horror brand is the complexity of the plot, which is also here. GREAT SPOIL WARNING! <br /> <br /> The movie starts pretty easily - two sisters will live with their father and stepmother after putting themselves into a spiritual setting. The sisters seem very hostile to their mother - especially the oldest - and they seem to ignore their father. Everything goes smoothly until the mother closes the young sister in the wardrobe and the older sister tells her father. Then it gets you, "your sister has been dead for years." It seems that the older sister has not recovered from the death of her mother and what we did not know is that the wardrobe where the mother was hung on the younger sister and murdered her too. As for the stepmother, she is the alter ego of the older sister - revealed when the stepmother (actually the sister's alter ego) sits on a couch when the right stepmother enters! I hope it's made clear to confused Asian horror fans out there. <br /> <br /> Finally - my favorite scene is the scene where the dad invites friends for dinner and starts choking one of the friends out in a panic attack. Very creepy! 7 out of 10
