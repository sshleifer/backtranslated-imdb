Since I first played in 1998, GoldenEye is one of my favorite video games. In fact, I recently bought a N64 purely so that I could own it and play it more often! The game is almost near-perfect: the single player makes a fantastic job of immersing yourself in Bond's shoes, with different goals, convincing weapons and great level design. Although the artificial intelligence of the enemies is fairly basic according to today's standards, it only adds to GoldenEye's appeal. The method of obtaining cheats (completing levels within a strict time limit) was also innovative when the title was released, and even now I still haven't cracked! <br /> <br /> The game comes with a great multiplayer mode for up to four players, and while it's not as advanced as the Combat Simulator in the future "Perfect Dark", it's still incredibly satisfying to you. blow up opponents against smithereens with a barrage of the RC-P90 fire! ;-)
