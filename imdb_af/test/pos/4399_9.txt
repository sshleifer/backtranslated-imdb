It was the best movie I saw in the year 2000. The Cohen brothers never let me go before, and they certainly didn't. <br /> <br /> It's one of those rare movies these days - it's crisp, intelligent and extremely entertaining. I left the theater with a warmth in my heart. Of course, there are many Cohen stuff there - strange characters and peculiar gadgets, well-developed plot and magical camera work. But no Cohen movie looks like any other Cohen movie, of course, if you ignore the overall quality. <br /> <br /> The big surprise to me was that Clooney is so good. But the real master performance in this movie comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But the rest of the role play is also wonderful. <br /> <br /> A movie that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that evolves is the story of Rednecks and the old-time country music - dripping with white and intelligence. It's a very unlikely combination. But this is exactly what this picture is.
