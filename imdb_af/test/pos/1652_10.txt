Fantastic movie! One of the best movie noir movies ever made. Bad guys, bad girls, a jewel cage, a twisted morality, a kidnapping, everything is here. Jean Servais has a face that makes Bogart proud and the rest of the role-play is full of characters who seem to know they're good. Get some popcorn and enjoy it.
