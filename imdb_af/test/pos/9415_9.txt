One hilarious thing I will say from the top is not the biggest Seisun Suzuki fan. I actually saw a fair number of his works (thanks to a retrospective of the film festival) and I found his films just a tip for Yakuza-powered for me. So, I went to Princess Raccoon and warned of what I was going to see. Boy! Was I eliminated! "Raccoon" is Suzuki's attempt at a musical, using the elements of Japanese opera mixed with many modern elements (both Audial and Visual), Raccoon is a surprise from start to finish. Chief actor Joe Ogdari proves that he is one of the hottest actors in Japan in this role. I must admit that the younger Japanese actors are still taking roles in Feudal times Japan, which is being used to full effect in Samurai gear. The story itself gets a little confusing if you don't follow it very carefully, but even if you don't, prepare yourself for the treasures that Princess Raccoon has.
