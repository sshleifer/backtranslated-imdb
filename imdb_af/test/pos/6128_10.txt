Of course, my 10/10 rating applies only if you are willing to completely and completely issue *. Because you know that only John Waters can do it. In "Pink Flamingos" (his director's debut), he depicts two families locked in battle to see who can be the dirtiest person. What divinely reveals at the end answers the question pretty much. But even of that, the movie is basically an excuse to shock people than anyone would normally suggest. You had better have a very strong stomach to watch this movie. Even some of the lines are quite wise. <br /> <br /> * Otherwise, avoid this movie as you would like the Ebola virus!
