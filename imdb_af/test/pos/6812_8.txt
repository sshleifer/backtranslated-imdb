It was so much better than I expected, the film has proffesionalism compared to other B moives of this kind of budget. The screenplay was good as a small formula, but the acting was surprisingly good of all, including Lorenzo, and you always expect good standards from Scheider and Busey. As well as the good plot and acting action is good, especially the car chase and the crashes are A-class. All in all, it's a rise above other B movies and doesn't have to rely on constant nudity or a flow of cheesy points to make the budget and the shortcomings. It's definitely worth a rent.
