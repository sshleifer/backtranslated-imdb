That's exactly what Australian television and Australian politics need, people with a sense of humor !!! Good on ABC to support these guys. The show is based on a few Aussie blocks that know how to spot the microphone from politicians or other people. The boys use Sydney as their main base to make a splash in the public. Keep an eye out for the Crazy Wharehouse Guy or Mr Ten Questions. The guys who perform these acts are the same guys that CNNN offered. If you enjoy CNNNN and the Glasshouse then you will love this show. I'm still interested to know what stunts are really and what are purely acting because there are some dubious actions made by the guys ...
