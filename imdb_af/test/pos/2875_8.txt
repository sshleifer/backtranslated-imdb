Well, I'm a few days late, but what the hell ....! Anyway, the word that best describes my response to "Sea No Evil" was .... SORPRISE. The movie is actually pretty good. There is definitely a lot of blood, gore and action in the film with a modest amount of tension. It listens back to the good ole slasher days of the late 70s and early 80s. Think 'Madman' meets Leatherface with a little Norman Bates and you will get a good feel for this movie. Although NNE is thin on plot (most horror movies), it makes it into the violence / methods of killing, the gore, the stress and the fact that Kane does a good job of playing the highly disturbed Jacob Goodnight. The title of the film comes from the fact that Jacob picks out the eyes of his victims, uses only his fingers and stores them in large pots. Why ?? You just have to see and see it (pun intended). There are some movie elements recorded from other horror films, especially Psycho, TCM, & Madman, but they are not blatant. Finally, SNE doesn't really go into the area that we haven't seen in the past. SNE is not a "Pyscho" or "TCM 74", but definitely deserves a look. <br /> <br /> BloodStone's recommendation: Take a Bloodstone matinee version of Bloodstone's Rating: 7.5 / 10
