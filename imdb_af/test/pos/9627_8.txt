It's really a kung fu classic. This movie has influenced martial arts films for many years. The Spanish guitar background music, the competing schools, the impossible high jumps on the eaves, the spear catches, tournaments, the secret training for an exotic karate technique, themes of patience and perseverance, and more were copied later. films such as The Karate Kid (1984), "Hero" (2002), "Kill Bill Volume 2" (2004) and "Kung Fu Hustle" (2004). <br /> <br /> I felt lucky to see this movie first in 1972, shortly after it was released, just before mainstream kung fu movies and before Bruce Lee became a household name. I saw it with two friends of mine in a San Diego center visited by sailors. And though the screens of the glowing red hands and golden eyeballs are a little laughing, the audience has become clear, just like our little group. It was a very memorable movie for me. Decades later I remembered a few specific scenes, even after I forgot the title of the movie. This movie is now extra special to me, because one of those two friends I first saw (sailor Kenneth Lee Hines of Kitty Hawk) has since died. This film therefore serves as a memorial of the day before we took Judo. and karate lessons in subsequent years. <br /> <br /> In relation to kung fu movies, I would rate this movie as 10/10. But since I have to keep in mind the bigger movie listener, I will judge it more than 8/10 objectively due to obvious technical flaws. I only recommend that neophyte viewers consider these technical errors as evidence of its ancient nature and of its authenticity, and then continue to enjoy its testosterone-charged chaos.
