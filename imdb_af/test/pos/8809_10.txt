If you were there and that you did, you will absolutely love this movie. I mean and through "there" I mean underground clubs and home parties where there is much less to find people who are just drunk than finding people on their ears for exuberance, speed or LSD. <br /> <br /> By "this" I mean to dance and sweat for eight hours or so in a row, with even a brake and being followed by a way to sleep the long morning without to sleep. To die, followed by a week of just waiting for the next weekend to do it all again. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is now one of my absolute favorites, I can certainly understand why some people, or most people, won't even like it.
