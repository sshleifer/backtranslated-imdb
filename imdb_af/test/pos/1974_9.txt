Yes, I noticed that there are 347 other comments, I think this is a good sign for a movie, even if some are negative. I saw this movie 2 and a half times. I adore it and will see it again. It's very clever, but I can understand why some people will hate it. they do not get the appeal. Yes, I have a strange taste in movies, but it's a good movie. Some of the lines are as fast as the whole scene in the Chinese restaurant. I started to laugh. and when he was in the meeting, he spoke with the contact. Jude Law was wonderful, though humorous, trying to cover his wonderful accent. Anyway, I don't consider myself the movie goddess as some critics of this movie, and if you have nothing better to do than write pseudo-intellectual film commentaries on movies you hate online, I feel sorry for you. why don't you write about movies you like, like me. I just love how everything is interconnected, it keeps you guessing, though you think wrong. The end was interesting, and not overdoing it. it was pure clever. I won't compare it to the matrix, because I think people get the wrong idea. I expected in this movie nothing except the Jude Law and a sci-fi. I was blown away. I have no idea of ​​any other of Cronenburg's films, but keep it on their own merits. Another clever thing was the shadow of the dog. Definitely look at this movie.
