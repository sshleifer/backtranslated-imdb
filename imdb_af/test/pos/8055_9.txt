"The Phenix City Story" is a brutal, stubborn docudrama about what was once called the "worst town in America". The film documented the events that led to the murder by the Phenix City crime syndicate of Albert Patterson, a lawyer in Alabama, who made a bid for the state attorney general's office as a means of damaging and corruption. challenged his hometown to clean. His son, John Patterson, picked up his father's mantle after his death and won the post. He made Phenix City a primary item on his agenda. <br /> <br /> Director Phil Karlson has created a film that has the ability to shock today. The fury is so relentless that the movie is actually hard to watch. We see the crime syndicate beat and kill to get what they want - the attacks and murders include women and children, and especially one scene, which revolves around the death of a small black girl, is particularly disturbing. It's not really a nice movie, because there are very low prize money in the end to reward the viewer for the bad events that come from, but it's a well-made movie, full of intense and fierce energy. <br /> <br /> A 15-minute prologue includes a series of interviews with the actual Phenix City residents, some of whom are portrayed by actress in the fictional part of the film. This gives the film an urgency that is conveyed in the story, so we feel that we are constantly watching a documentary, a feeling that is selected by Karlson's choice to be in real places. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this movie, but it's one of those movies that fills you with a sense of just indignation and then makes you feel helpless because you can't do anything about it. <br /> <br /> Degree: A
