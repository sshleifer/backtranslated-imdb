When I watched this movie at the age of 6, it was in the Children's section at Erols Video because it was animation. We watched it and it was a very different ball game! A very violent story and graphic deaths are VERY entertaining and compelling, but not for children. Avoid for family viewing, my mom almost had a heart attack and tore the video apart!
