"Four Daughters" starts as just a clone of "Little Women" type melodrama. A single father with four musically talented girls has his hands full to keep them in line and lead them to court. What turns the movie around is the sudden appearance of a new Hollywood star. Some critics say the first anti-hero long before James Dean won the big screen. From the time the dark, preliminary figure of Mickey Borden (John Garfield) appears in the gate of Ann Lemp (Priscilla Lane), his self-pity and doomed philosophy on the rest of the film, "Four Daughters" is much more than just a chick flick. <br /> <br /> Although Garfield is the main reason for watching "Four Daughters", there are other flashes of brilliance to enjoy. Michael Curtiz, the Hungarian-born director, later responsible for such jewels as Casablanca and Mildred Pierce, identifies certain images with his camera (supported by Rebel Without a Cause movie Ernest Haller). Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), so fiercely swinging, becomes symbolic of the shifts in mood and passion by those who use it. <br /> <br /> That makes Garfield the outstanding performance. This is obvious, but the rest of the role play most of him. Understated Jeffrey Lynn plays his part in perfection, such as the neglected attacker whose love for his cherished Ann never falls, even when she is with another man. Claude Rains, a little miscarriage as the father of the four early young women, gives a fine representation of a set on the doting family head who is lost in the shuffle. The three Lane Sisters, already known for their musical abilities, are in perfect actresses, playing their parts well. A fleet of supporting actors, including Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, May Robson and Eddie Acuff, make it all credible. <br /> <br /> How to attract opposites is part of the plunge to quickly get to grips with the imagination. Ann is the eternal optimist, even when she and Mickey are occasional. She always looked at the shiny side and liked so much trapped in the pliers of the Great Depression in those days. She just saw prosperity around the corner. Mickey mentions a whole list of bad things that happened to him, in his misery of Ann, who refuses Ann. Mickey expects to go out with a bulb that kills him while turning the corner of life. Mickey has rare talent as a composer; Ann has the talent to save as a singer and musician. Ann is great at beauty; Mickey is great at personality in a twisted sense of a way. And the differences go on and on. How it all is reconciled in the end is an important part of the movie. It should not be missed. <br /> <br /> See "Four Daughters" for John Garfield's doozy of a big-screen acting debut. The only time he was better off came seven years later when he ever captivated the filmmakers with one of the biggest screen acts, such as Frank Chambers in The Postman Always Rings Twice, against the equally charismatic Lana Turner. But also look at "Four Daughters" to capture important elements that can be missed if too much concentration is placed on the star of the show.
