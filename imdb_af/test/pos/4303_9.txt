What a film by actors and actresses in this Columbo episode, next to Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle mysteriously dies and it looks like a heart attack on the bike that his fiance, Julie Newmar, discovered, playing the role so well. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman's home, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides Columbo's messy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Everyone who accuses the other of killing their uncle for money. Well, you just have to look and see the outcome, but I can assure you that it is always worth looking at this one for the cast and the crew.
