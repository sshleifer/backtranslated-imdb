Beautiful, emotional and subtle. I watch this movie at an art center with a smaller screen in a movie room with 95% of senior citizens. I wish bigger cinema like Lowes would be here, would it show. Great cinematography by Wong and Christopher Doyle. Since I understand Cantonese, it is much easier for me to understand the movie. As simple as the story goes, many English-speaking viewers didn't get the whole story. Three old ladies next to me are japping and have no clues about the movie. <br /> <br /> Spoiler; They were surprised when I mentioned that Mr. Chow with Mrs. Chen slept and they have a son. She tried to tell him Singapore but didn't. <br /> <br /> Spoiler <br /> <br /> The Mandarin translation of the movie title actually means flowery as moment or memory. The phrase usually described a beautiful and wonderful memory that was short and short. The whole movie fits almost the title. Not to mention the flowers "Cheung Sam". <br /> <br /> My favorite scene was definitely the street corner in the alley. It looks so beautiful, the sun shines on the old and faded wall, at night in the dark, in the rain, truly a poetic moment. I had a strong sense of intimacy about their relationship, as they were standing on the wall and talking quietly. I felt a terrible sadness when Mr. Chow has his departure moment, and Mrs. Chen called on his shoulder ... Bravo Wong Kar-Wai! <br /> <br /> As much as I like this one, Chungking Express is still above my favorite. But I will also give this one a 10. As a reference point, CTHD only got 7. <br /> <br /> If you like art, you'll love this movie. Don't miss it.
