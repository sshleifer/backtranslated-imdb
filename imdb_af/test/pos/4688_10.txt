Hello, I have to say you have some wrong information about the series here. The lead author was Richard Carpenter, he created the series. Later, there were a few other writers, but they did just a few episodes. <br /> <br /> The first director to do most of the series (I think full range 1) was Ian Sharp, who saw Robin of Sherwood's clear appearance. <br /> <br /> Clannad did see the material and they read the scripts. I definitely know this because Richard Carpenter told it at a Con last year in England. <br /> <br /> I think this is a masterpiece of Television Entertainment because it has good characters and throws, good costumes and a good story. lines. For me, it's still one of the best TV shows ever!
