When commenting on this film, you need to realize that it is based on a true story and therefore needs to be reviewed for the quality and accuracy of the depiction of the events as well as its entertainment value. It may be undeniable that Jack Shepherd has to surrender Jack Wild twice because Wild Edgeworth has captured Bess. However, this has happened. It should also be noted that the director was young and inexperienced, explaining why he relied on proven techniques. There were opportunities when Clavell did not have the confidence to follow the writing as it was written. The movie would be better if it had. And yes, I had a copy of the script (Stanley Baker's copy - one in five), which I recently returned to my father, Rafe Newhouse, the author.
