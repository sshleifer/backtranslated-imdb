Not only was this movie exciting, but it brought me back with the real soundtrack. These were the things we said and did ... these were the songs we listened to ... all in the same period, in the same era, to the south of Alabama. I wasn't one of the skateboard sets, but I was definitely one of the observers sitting on the edge of the old transistor radio, listening to Neil Young and watching those who were more brave than I ever hoped. turn on their surfboards on the wheels and apply the tricks of Alva and Adams. They hope they might just take the Zephyr style for a short time. It's just about showing how much we all were in those wonderful days. ~ KLJ
