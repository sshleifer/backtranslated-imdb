This is the third Three Stooges that the team has ever made, and like many of them early, it's absolutely and completely hysterical! Own it now on DVD as part of the Three Stooges Collection Vol. 1, when I feel it, I see it! <br /> <br /> In this short film, Moe, Larry and Curly play these three doctors in a hospital that everyone tries to help, but boy, they finally make a mess! <br /> <br /> This short is one of my favorite Three Stooges shorts, I'm also a huge fan of slapstick comedy, and the Three Stooges are the slapstick kings! <br /> <br /> When I heard it was nominated for the Best Short Film Academy Award, I was really curious about this, when I heard that it was lost, I was very disappointed! <br /> <br /> The shortest is by far one of the three Stooges, and I encourage you to see this hysterical riot! <br /> <br /> 10/10
