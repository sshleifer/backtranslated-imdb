Screamers is an Italian fantasy film (L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce), purchased by Roger Corman and released by his New World Pictures. Of course, Corman must upgrade his initials by late registering one of his girls (Dan T. Miller) before releasing it in the states. <br /> <br /> L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce is a very entertaining tale of Dr Moreau Island. It was 1891 and Claudio Cassinelli was destroyed on a mysterious island with some newly fled prisoners. Claudio is about star Barbara Bach and Richard Johnson. Johnson plays the turbulent Edmund Rackham: a man who enables scientist Joseph Cotton to change the local indigenous population into amphibious deep sea dives (they look like a cross between the Black Lagoon being and one from The Humanoids From the Deep), by convincing Cotton that the mutations are being created for the highest scientific and humanitarian motives. <br /> <br /> After discovering the lost city of Atlantis, Rackham uses the amphibious creatures to plunder his treasures. Sexy Barbara Bach plays Cotton's daughter who has a psychic link with these mutations. In an unforgettable scene, Bach takes a midnight swim with these mutants wearing only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little imagination. Claudio discovers one of the prisoners he has befriended has been changed into a fairground and then hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> At the same time and in the same place as Zombi 2, Richard Johnson does not have "You don't even have to change suits. The house where the experiments take place is the same home that Johnson used to perform experiments in Zombi 2. Discuss about economic films! <br /> <br /> The additional footage contains some bloody decapitations, (way to go Roger!), and a laughingly bad Cameron Mitchell does his best pirate imitation. All that is missing is the parrot. <br /> <br /> Spanish title: Le Continent Des Hommes Poissons
