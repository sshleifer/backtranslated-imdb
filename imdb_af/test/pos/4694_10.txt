By accident, I ordered a series from the BBC, their new version of Robin Hood. Very disappointing compared to RoS. Terrible costumes and backgrounds. While enjoying the Sheriff, who saw the Nick Grace character, the rest of the cast left a lot to be desired. As an "example", Marion's costume looked suspiciously as it came from Walmart. And Mr Guy, well, he looked a bit like a character from an outer space movie! RoS stole the spotlight, probably forever, in telling this story. Cast, costuming, story lines, scenery, filming and soundtrack by Clannad are all wonderful, as evidenced by all the ongoing feedback over 26 years. RoS is a timeless classic. Thank you to everyone who made the series.
