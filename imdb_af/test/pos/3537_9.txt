Clearly inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more horrible; more bloodshed and lots of graphic details (a little too much for my taste). Great writing and play (I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no bad points to throw). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although scheduled in three parts on the BBC, I watched Messiah on one video. One point of critic; The villain's motivation was not very convincing.
