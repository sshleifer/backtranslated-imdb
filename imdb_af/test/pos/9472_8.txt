I saw this movie today (opened here yesterday) and was simply delighted. <br /> <br /> I saw a review that said something the reviewer thought it would be just another teenage movie, but then found it based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night ... and then started trying to justify this movie on Shakespeare grounds. I really think it's going to be a little overboard: the only connections I could see with twelfth night were (a) the basic understanding of a girl being murdered as a man; (b) the extensive male female humor arising from those basic concepts; and (c) some of the names (including Viola & Duke). <br /> <br /> Apart from the names, the thematic community fields (a & b) are really good themes for any script, and this movie's script is no exception. In addition, it really is a pleasant and very contemporary / traditional teen movie. And this is a completely legitimate genre, even if it is an attempt to apologize to satisfy it. Like referring to Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The movie is bright, fast, emotional, stylized, funny ... full of teenage hormones and teenage humor and male / female humor suitable for all ages. And this is really the best part IMHO: Really about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is portrayed in a round, attractive top fun. Those stereotypes are merciless but loving, with such a complexity of invention that I am a little confused ... but really do not feel disappointed at all. It's not such a movie: things come to you quickly and fun, and you get a laugh and a groan and then move to the next second time. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is really just like Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful Duke; David Cross does a great top gold. All the acting and characterization was fine and on the target. Combatography was excellent. <br /> <br /> Wonderful entertainment from start to finish ... check it out!
