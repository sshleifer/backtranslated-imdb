I didn't expect to enjoy it. In truth, I watched it because a friend knew that a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but was not credited. Knowing Dylan Thomas and really appreciating his poetry, but aware and rather upset about the man, I did not feel that I needed to see a twofold adaptation of his lame-Bohemian life. and it wasn't. it was critical and yet appreciative. it made me cry. Kiera Knightley was excellent, even with the slightly strained Welsh accent, and it's a sad story telling them. Dylan Thomas is not the hero, because unfortunately he was not throughout his life and also not the so-called feisty woman of the game. it is cillian the william of the movie. A man who leaves the woman likes a war they ignore. His challenge to rejoin with the indifference is what is of real interest to this movie and what a beautiful show by the actor. I think this movie is underestimated because it's so badly marketed. Dylan Thomas fans will expect something more from their so many deficient hero and get less, and that's how it's marketed. It's not a movie about Dylan Thomas and it's much more interesting for that.
