The opening scene of this movie is pretty incredible. I saw a number of sci-fi movies with great special effects, but my roommate and I looked at the opening sequence and he clearly said, "sensory overload." The plot of the movie is pretty simple, but the nice thing about this sci-fi movie is that it can find the audience most of the technology for themselves rather than waste time explaining it "subtly". The creatures in this movie are also very interesting. You don't get a very good look at them until about two thirds of the way through. Overall, a very entertaining movie.
