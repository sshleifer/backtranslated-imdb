This film is one that spends the short while, entertainment, but what could not be done in any country has nothing to identify the Colombian. Whoever looks at the topics of the supposed Colombian or social and politically correct theater and what it is called "puts it at risk" is better than it will not see. Some of the drug traffic, or the fight is no reference either farmer and worker or winged serrilla and the kidnapping political. <br /> <br /> The corrupt police is a person who can be Mexican, Russian, Italian or Chinese, and also the character protagonist, an Argentine photographer, can be Venezuelan, Peruvian or Philippine and the regular boludo . In its parliaments it can be replaced by another word of snake from any other country without changing the person or history. The most important thing is that it is a very well-counted history with images and real performances. The quality of it is almost of TV movies, but of the goods. That if a movie like this if it deserves or does not deserve the public's bottoms, is a bit of a classic discussion "mamerta".
