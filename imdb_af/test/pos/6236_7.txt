It's a weird strangeness, directed by the man who changed the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". Chuck Conners gives a hilariously top-up performance as the owner of a "wax" museum along the way that breaks down our doomed teenagers in the near future. The wash figures look so "so real", one of the teenagers points out. Heh, heh, heh ... Not so much a slasher movie as a strange mix of psychological horror and old-fashioned "House of Wax" style terror. I can think of many, much horror movies that are worse than this one.
