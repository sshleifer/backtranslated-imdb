WESTERN UNION melodramatically tells the string of telegraph lines between two points in the west. Brothers and sisters Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore work for Western Union, and Randolph Scott and Robert Young work for the Creightons. Indians and some bad white guys get in the way, but nothing can stop America's progress. This sense of clear destination is greatly enhanced by a premium musical score and vibrant color photography. Scott is a bank robber who is looking for his ways, and he and he are making young people aware of the gorgeous Gilmore. Many large character factors help keep the big production ahead.
