"Down Periscope" has been in our library since it first arrived in VHS. Since then we have acquired the DVD and a digital from Cinema Now. <br /> <br /> It's a strange movie that doesn't go overboard militarily as a pro or con. It's first and foremost a comedy and, as a vehicle for the main characters, I'm quite surprised that a successor has never been offered. <br /> <br /> The movie gained another that borders on a cult obsession, even among the very young. I became aware of this while visiting the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama in 2002. A group of Cub Scouts, my grandson among them, all took on the roles of the movie and plan to revive it during their night-boy on board. /> <br /> It's a fun skirt that makes you proud of our Navy and Hollywood ... which is scarce company. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unimaginable movie, such a great entertainment!
