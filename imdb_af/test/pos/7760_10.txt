Suzumiya Haruhi no y√ªutsu (a Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) can make you think at first glance that it's just another animated school comedy / drama. Well, it's not! The environment is just a school environment. It's a comedy good, but a very clever one with lots of sarcasm. And the characters do have a psychological sublimity that is almost in the same class that appears in Ingmar Bergman's works. The episodes are broadcast, as it seems, out of order, ie the pilot is actually episode 11. This makes it possible to present small clues to emerging episodes. The show is an adaptation of Nagaru Tanigawa's popular novel series on Haruhi Suzumiya. <br /> <br /> What about that story? As in all episodes, the story revolves around Haruhi Suzumiya, who tries to relieve her own boredom by starting in adventures. Haruhi herself has no interest in ordinary people, and actively seeks strangers, time travelers and people (people with supernatural powers). To find these people, she formed a club she calls the SOS Brigade (Save the world by redoing it with fun: Haruhi Suzumiya's Brigade). Apart from Haruhi, the other members of the SOS brigade are Kyon. He is the true protagonist of the show. It is through his position that we follow the story. He just sat in front of the class when Haruhi got the idea to form the SOS Brigade. He is quite skeptical of most club activities and cards together to ensure that Haruhi is not going to the extreme, and he is the only one in the class Haruhi wants to talk to. Another member is Yuki Nagato, who is the "indispensable quiet member" and also the only remaining member of the Literature Club, which room occupied the SOS Brigade in search of a free club room. She doesn't mind the SOS Brigade using her club room as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books. She also participates in the brigade activities. Mikuru Asahina was "voluntarily arrested" by Haruhi because the club needed a Lolita-like mascot for anything suspicious. She often acts as the girls of the clubs. The last member is the always smiling Itsuki Koizumi, who seems to be the "mysterious transfer student" (which means he transferred two months in the semester that Haruhi regards as mysterious). <br /> <br /> Haruhi thinks all members, but Kyon, are some random people at school, but they do have their own interest in her.
