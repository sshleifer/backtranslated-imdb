I like this movie. I saw it the day after the gala opener at the Toronto International Film Festival as a warehouse. It had to go well. The director, Gavin Hood, was supposed to be the investigator today, but unfortunately his twins were born just hours ago, so he had to fly back on a flight. "2 births in 24 hours" was how he joked about it. <br /> <br /> Delivery refers to 'extraordinary performance' - a term that presumably can be sent to terrorists in the US without the legal consent of their parents questioning and detaining nations in prisons abroad. <br /> <br /> It is pretty predictable - innocent Egyptian-American man wrongly accused of being a terrorist. He is sent abroad while the woman at home (Reese Witherspoon) fights to get him and free him. But what makes this movie special is a few good choices in story translation: 1) An overview of the human touch of what is going on in the room where a suicide bomb exploded; 2) the humanity of a CIA agent who is trying to understand and be honest with what is really going on; and 3) the storytelling chronology that makes it a solid, naughty story moving and moving in the right moments. Oh - relief! And a mix of emotions that rotate as the story fights for an end. <br /> <br /> All around strong acting with Meryl Streep as a stand-up vixen.
