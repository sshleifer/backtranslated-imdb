... a true geek girl's dream: high technology, high drama, smart guys, steaming sex and huge explosions. (Very large explosions.) Sam Waterston is so obviously in the role of Oppenheimer that the sound of the REAL Oppenheimer sound is strange: apparently he has a voice similar to Ronald Reagan! The triumph and tragedy of Oppenheimer is one of the 20th century's most dramatic dramas, and this movie is a model of what the documentary drama should be: the facts are allowed to speak for themselves while the fiction parts used to strengthen and fill in the record, not to pay attention to themselves. An interesting fact: some of the technical details used have only recently been downgraded, and this is also of particular importance. A must-see!
