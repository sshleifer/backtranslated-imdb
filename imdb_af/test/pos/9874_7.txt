For some reason I always enjoy movies that hate people, if I really don't think they're so bad - and that's one of those movies. In the case of this movie, I think it's too much criticism, I'm really not that bad of a movie. In fact, I think this is one of the better persecutors. "Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers" starts the night before Halloween, where Michael kills Jamie Lloyd (who was in prison the fifth time) after giving birth to his baby. We are then introduced to the Strode family, who now happen to live in the old Myers house (which changes in every film). Kara and her son Danny are the main characters, along with Tommy Doyle, the now adult boy who survived the original murders. They have to fight together to save Jamie's baby from an evil cult that cares for Michael, while Michael himself is killed by an old Celtic ritual where he has to sacrifice an entire family in Haddonfield. <br /> <br /> I think it's one of the best successors in the series anyway, and I don't understand all the hatred it got. It had a nice tension, an interesting plot (but sometimes confusing, I will admit), a few scary moments here and there, and lots of gore and knife slips to saturate all your ghore. Not all of the acting was very good, but it was convincing to me. Marianne Hagan is the leading lady and she is very nice. Paul Rudd plays a great Tommy Doyle, and is also very talented and plays his role beautifully. The rest of the supporting casting (except the brilliant Donald Pleasance) is not much to praise, but it was not bad either, everything was considered. I'm still not sure if an explanation is given as to why Michael was killed, absolutely needed, but it was finally good and I was not upset about the way they tied everything up. The open conclusion was also a bit angry, but could have been something more. <br /> <br /> I also saw the infamous "Producer's Cut" of this movie, its original cut, and I think it's in some ways better. It further explains the Thorn curse that Michael manages, and has some extra scenes that really support the movie, and the end was much better in my opinion. It feels more natural than the conclusion we've made in the studio of the movie. I wish Dimension would release this alternative version of the movie, because I personally think it's better. However, the chances are very slim. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers" is a very good successor and will please all fans of the series. This movie is not the best of all horror movies, but it is definitely worth the rent if you want to see Michael do his thing. Don't just expect brilliance and you'll enjoy it. 10/07.
