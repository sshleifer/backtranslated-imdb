I missed the full four-hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played one week. I had to see the shorter two and a half hour version a year or so later and was amazed at what I saw. I went to the theater and thought I saw a masterpiece and wondered what the full version was. <br /> <br /> The full version is mostly good, but it has rows so incredibly dull that the whole movie is drawn and almost sinking under the waves. <br /> <br /> The problem is entirely in editing which should be marked as the final word excess. There are times when things are going on and on and on and nothing happens. Shots of people in a city far too long with no purpose in the story. We get beautiful views and visions of such beauty that they bring tears to your eyes, but they are too often used as a placeholder rather than as punctuation or a place. Much of the longer version looks on the screen simply because it looks good. <br /> <br /> I actually tried to sit down and look at Heavens Gate without going to the Fast Forward button, but somewhere along the way I find I can't stand it anymore . <br /> <br /> I wish MGM would be sorry for us and leave the shorter version on DVD as well as the big dinosaur. Maybe as a two pack so we can see what the better version is, and whether Cimino was angry or not. <br /> <br /> And while they were there, why not join the once rumored Johnson County War edit running 90 minutes. Presumably, United Artists have slashed with the hope of getting their money back. Whether it ever did or still exists, is in the air, but it will be interesting to see.
