The Italian concept of "sprezzatura" was the grace and nonchalance in social ways that led to success in love, as described in the 16th century manual "The Courtier." The movie "Hitch" is worth watching for the embodiment of the sprezzzatura concept in Will Smith's dynamic display. <br /> <br /> Smith plays the character of Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, who is a professional dating consultant. to those who are short on happiness and trust. The best scene is when Hitch coaches the painful shy and maladroit Albert in his quest to win the heart of a New York socialite and in Hitch's own appeal to Sara and a surprise to her when visiting Ellis Island. In these scenes, Smith is supported with good work by Kevin James and Eva Mendes. But this film is driven by Smith's charming and overwhelming personality. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, Smith rises above the average cartoon to make "Hitch" a special and entertaining movie. I do not believe there is another actor working today, capable of delivering the charisma and the perfect timing with comic moments like Will Smith in this movie. And his secret is in the "sprezzatura"!
