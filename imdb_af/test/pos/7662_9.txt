Eliza (Elizabeth Moorman) is a farm girl from the country who comes looking for the city for love. She met a man who told her about an astrologer who would show her the stars. It is a journey of souls. Eliza is tested, can she realize her true love when she sees him or not? Tommy (Tommy Lee Jones) is a construction worker who tries to find him in his own heritage. They show each other different ways of looking at things. All the time Eliza is still looking for love and Tommy is trying to protect the discussion she is living with. It's a twisted story to look beyond the obvious and find beauty in simple everyday things. The style is artificial and beats with symbolism. The psychedelic camera styling can frighten the average movie gamer, but the deeper message and the interesting frames make this movie worth watching. It is a movie that explores the underworld of the strange, miserable and devastated individuals. This one is off the road, but well worth the look!
