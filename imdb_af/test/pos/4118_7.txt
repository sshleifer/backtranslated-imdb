This interesting film noir has three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick and Blackmer. The screens between Sanders and Patrick are outstanding. Demming, as a detective, is unfortunately not nearly as good. He misses the intelligence, power and cynical view of a Bogart. If Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic. <br /> <br /> Pace, place (a library) and atmosphere are all good. But there are some plot holes. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the relentless organization (Nazi) he represents. Yet, after he wrongly killed Blackmer, Sanders seems to have no fear or remorse. Sanders then grabs the library and its residents using the ruse that he and his men are detectives investigating the murder. Sanders' hit later tried to kill Demming by shooting him (without a damper), although many of the other prisoners could be expected to hear the noise. Finally, Sanders' man tries to kill Roberts, who has discovered the truth, but when she fakes, he makes it inexplicable. <br /> <br /> What bothered me most, however, was that the chance of a large and unexpected conclusion was wasted. During the film, Patrick is portrayed as a clever, stubborn sociopath who fears nothing. But in the end, she flees panicked from the last surviving Nazi, a brutal rogue. By the time police found him, he killed her. And she just ends another weak, stereotypical victim. What should have happened is that the police find the Nazi thief, but he is dead. She killed him cleverly, and then disappeared - to continue her evil ways.
