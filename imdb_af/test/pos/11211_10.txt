I am very grateful to the small college town of Abingdon, Va.- near Bristol, TN. and home to the famous Barter Theater where Gregory Peck once performed - managed to get an arts festival and show this movie there. Abingdon is two hours and an hour from where I live, but the journey was worthwhile in every sense of the word. UZAK / DISTANT is an amazing, brilliant, frightening, emotional, engaging movie. As a Turkish American, this movie was not just a testimony to what life in Turkey is; but on a larger scale it tells the world how it is Turkish, whether you live in Istanbul, Berlin, Montreal, New York or Omaha. It can be two hours as opposed to five minutes, but it is effectively our Bob Marley song. There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie. It is very difficult to just pick a random pair. But for me, one play is in a cinema Beyoglu (center of Istanbul). The title character, played by Mehmet Emin Toprak, died in a car accident shortly after completing the film, a very attractive young woman in a staircase to the main auditorium of the cinema. She goes into "Vanilla Sky." As Tom Cruise's image is reflected from a glass, we feel that Turkish men are competing with Tom Cruise for their own wives, although Tom Cruise is nowhere to be found in Beyoglu. The screens shot over the Bosphorus shores are also very revealing because they symbolize the beauty but desperate empty waves, which is a painful fact of life in Turkey. In this movie the divide separates lovers and families. A simple, empty packet of Samsun (Turkish brand) cigarettes and a dying mouse jumping off the screen like the gulls in the 1982 Serif Goren-Yilmaz Guney movie "Yol." Many of Guney's films, including "Yol," "Suru-Herd" (1978 - completed by Zeki Okten) and "Baba-The Father" (1971) were widely regarded as the best Turkish films ever made. Without Guney's sometimes exaggerated social-political rage (especially in his last film, the 1983 prison drama "Duvar-The Wall"), "Distance" captures the essence of Turkish life quite remarkably. This is a crowning achievement for a director who, in my opinion, can already be proclaimed the Turkish equivalent of directors such as Tarkovsky, Bresson and Ozu. I can't wait to see his other movies!
