My friends and I watched the majority of a Saturday afternoon with a variety of bad movies. Among the flickers we watched, the strongest contender (for the quality of a bad filmmaker) was easy Jack-O. It's ridiculous that movies like "Gigli", "Glitter" and "You Got Served" are listed in IMDBs under 100. Although it's definitely bad movies, they don't belong in the bottom 100. They rob Jack -O "and" Keeper of Time ", etc. From the Bad Movie Greatness they deserve so richly. <br /> <br /> So what makes Jack-O as good (in bad movie terms)? starters Steve Latshaw, the director, decided to throw his son Ryan Latshaw into the role of Sean Kelly, unfortunately for Ryan, Ryan Latshaw was dangerously close to being out of action by a block of wood. , has no ability to emulate.The end result: unintended comic gold.The kid can listen to a joke, or just moments from his head, and his expression is one of the rocky emotionlessness. <br /> <br /> The other aspect of the movie we found was fantastic the mere number of "double dreaming" rows.What is a double dream Well, that's when a character wakes up from a nightmare, and then something happens Nightmares are, and then the character wakes up again. Basically, they wake up after they have dreamed of waking up from a nightmare. ee? I believe Sean Kelly's character has experienced no less than 3 double-row sequences. <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what else? Oh yes! This movie has a real roll of thousands. It is truly amazing to see how many roles are introduced during the movie. Best of all, almost none of the characters have anything to do with the story. They are either killed by Jack-O or they serve no purpose. <br /> <br /> Jack-O himself was pretty sweet. Like most other B-movie monsters, Jack-O has the incredible ability to seem teleport over long distances. He always hangs, somewhere in the background, when you handle a great character. However, what is puzzling is that when he actually chases someone, he moves at speed and speed, yet he can keep up with people jumping. <br /> <br /> That's all for now. Closing remarks: If you are looking for an unintentional, hilarious, bad movie, you can't go wrong with renting this animal. <br /> <br /> Bad movie Rating: 7/10 Good movie score: 3.5 / 10
