I don't want Jackass number two. No one should. There was and was nothing that was especially about Jackass. And yet ... this is one of the funniest things I've ever seen - and I just can't explain why. <br /> <br /> This new movie makes the first one in the dust. It's so funny, so terrible and so wrong. The whole team gives their all - with Jacks in chief Knoxville the charge. He's nuts. I worship him, but he is insane. And more power to him. With his burgeoning film career he could have stood back and just let everyone do the dirty work, but the fact that he threw himself almost literally into the world of the "Ass" makes me so strange that I barely respect him. More kudos have to go to Bam Margera, who previously found content to sit back and just make sure everyone around him did everything he wanted. Here Bam is not the torturer, but the tormented and everything is better. <br /> <br /> I just can't say what my favorite part is, because I laughed all the way. Although I saw a lot of the movie between my fingers, there wasn't a "real" movie I've seen for a long time, which made me feel so much like it did. Love them or they probably hate them, the Jackass team delivered above and beyond my expectations. But I agree with Bam. There can never be a Jackass number three because someone will die and I want these guys to stay around.
