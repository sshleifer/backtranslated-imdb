For all of our American Deneuve fans, this jewel is a little hard to keep from. Luckily, I locked myself up in the short bits I saw on youtube.com, that I was prepared to go. I got it on ebay.com, ordered it directly from France, and changed my laptop so it would play 2 DVDs. Let me tell you that it was worth it. Be warned - there are no captions (Pathe shouldn't make it appear on DVD, Koch Lorber should have - they're good at captions). I'm not talking a word from French. I can express a syllable here and there, order a drink and what not. That said, this movie is a surprise anyway. I couldn't fully appreciate the alleged "bawdy" humor or the witty dialogue. Deneuve and her cohorts were enough for me. I understood what was going on without the need for dialogue. It really says something about a movie when those who can't speak the language enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is wonderful. London is wealthy than the beaten-track son. Love the lesbian mother. And of course, what can I say about our dear Mademoiselle Deneuve. She is one of a kind. Those eyes, that smile. I could watch her movies all day long. She really goes beyond beauty. People always say she's beautiful. Well, yes, she is. But she is also very talented. I believed her every second of the road. Her talk about chocolate and vanilla with London is too sweet. Her character is even arrested for smoking baptisms with about 15 years in the street. NOT AVAILABLE! Fly to France and buy it if you need to. Great. 10
