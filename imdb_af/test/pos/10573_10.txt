This movie was incredible !! I didn't know the back story about it, so I had to unfold it on DVD before me. It had a lot of turns and turns, but still kept the story fresh and exciting. The play by Elaine Cassidy was in a word Brilliant as well as Sally Hawkins. This storyline is rich in plausible events and fresh ideas from the present. <br /> <br /> There's really something about me. Cassidy's eyes that leave a point. This movie is a refreshing look at the way we look at 'Victorian times' and how we view that society. A very valuable look.
