I didn't know what to expect. I just watched it on pay-TV on a rainy Sunday afternoon. From the beginning it pulled me in. The music and settings and characters were excellent. I didn't hear from any of the actors, but they were all outstanding. A wonderful thriller. <br /> <br /> Now that I've read other comments on this movie, referring to previous versions and the book, I'll try to find out more about this wonderful movie
