My first "Columbo". Enjoyed it earlier. Big size, and Peter Falk's character very good ... wonderfully strange, he can place his place next to Poirot, Miss Marple, and also Marlowe and Rick Diamond. I can see why this series has such a next. <br /> <br /> As a professional musician, I have to say a few things. Firstly, a conductor who merely delivers these pedestrian achievements of the most basic examples of the repertoire (Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Strauss Waltzes, Beethoven ...) will never get such a home or such a fame or cars. , much less is called genius. And the actor's actions are so bad to laugh. No orchestra will take him seriously. <br /> <br /> There are also several small things, such as his rehearsal of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (why rehearse it if they just performed it for TV? Any orchestral musician would play it in his or her sleep anyway. ..). His instructions for the ensemble are actually stupid, and when Columbo asks Blythe Danner what "quasi fantasia" means, she says it's "Latin." It's Italian, just like the vast majority of musical instructions. <br /> <br /> And finally, no two good musicians will ever have the following changer: "Play something." "What should I play?" "Chopin". Music is their job and passion, they know it well. There will be something more specifically asked and offered! <br /> <br /> I know. I need to get more ...
