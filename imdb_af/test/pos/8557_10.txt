We don't know why this extraordinary movie was never officially released on DVD. Anthony Quinn's show alone makes it a must-see. There are relatively few films in which an actor identifies so deeply with his character, a phenomenon that is always unique to us, filmmakers. <br /> <br /> But Quinn's powerful portrayal of an innocent Romanian, literally dragged out of his home and every day. Life by forces he cannot understand is only part of what makes this movie good. The script is based on a book published in Paris by a Romanian priest who fled the Communist takeover of his country. The film manages to go deep into a well-known area of ​​Eastern European history. As a succession of Kafka-esquire, tell the distortion of fate, Johann Moritz's misadventures (which have been openly and honestly said, without any political realities currently so precious in Hollywood) are actually a reward for the lost innocence of the Romanian. It is jealously ironic that this promise was signed by a French director working with the American money from an Italian producer and overseeing a multinational cast run by an extraordinary Mexican-born Thespian. <br /> <br /> I saw VCD's of this movie in several Asian internet stores, and I was fortunate to be in possession of a digital recording of this movie, broadcast on the UK version of TCM. But it's a pity that "The 25th Hour" isn't anywhere on the future MGM studio DVD release card.
