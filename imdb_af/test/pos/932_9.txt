Not only is it difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski's trilogy, but it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite: watch them in sequence, Blue, White and Red, and regard them as one complete work. It is true that they have developed different stories with different themes: freedom, equality, brotherhood, and each with unique applications of plot and artwork. They are all worth seeing independently, but I believe they are best seen as one job. Together I would evaluate the trilogy as a 9; Separately, I put each one in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994. <br /> <br /> The red color is most memorable in the third movie as a backdrop in a billboard ad, whose profile model is the central of the three main characters of the movie. The other two characters do a double recording of a varying degree of recognition when they first come to the ad, which is placed larger than life next to a busy city crossing. This ad is not an important part of the plot of this movie, but its image is striking and is one of the reasons why I called Red a mind-bending movie. This is the third of Kieslowski's Three Color Trilogy, based on the Blue-White Red of the French flag and the three parts of the motto "Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood." The films are mainly focused on these themes, and adhere to the basic levels of one, two or three main characters, but with each film the complexity of plot escalates as the three principles move from fundamentally personal (Liberty, Blue) to Relational (Equality). , White) to social (brotherhood, red). Red is my favorite of these movies, and I give it a 9. It's in itself a good movie, but one has to see Blue and White first for the full effect.
