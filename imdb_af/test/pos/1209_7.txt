* SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> Big WrestleManias was still a few years away. But this one was definitely good, with very good games and one big game. <br /> <br /> WrestleMania's demolition was always at its best. I am glad their last WM hoorah (I refuse to include the other version) was a win over Colossal Connection. I liked Andr√©'s entry, which never came together. <br /> <br /> Few fans know this was the first time anyone had ever passed Mr Perfect. For some reason Brutus Beefcake's performance has never been recognized. Or the fact that he did it fairly easily. <br /> <br /> The Heart Foundation's victory over the Bolsheviks was the shortest in WM history, including the 24/9 second match between King Kong Bundy and S.D. Jones. <br /> <br /> I'm glad Jake and DiBiase have to fight at WrestleMania. This led to the feud being stuck for so long. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the Big Bossman Akeem feud to warm up, but the Bossman just cut it. As good as Bossman was like a heel, he was just as good as a face. He was always intense and obviously loved his work. <br /> <br /> If the Warrior only had a better work ethic and might try to wrestle, he would have been a great WWF champion. <br /> <br /> Appreciate a watch, especially as the boring games are too short to complain. And the team matches are all very exciting.
