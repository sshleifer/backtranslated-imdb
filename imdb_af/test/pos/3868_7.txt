Of course, the Simpsons started with the Christmas special "Simpson's Roasting On An Open Fire" which had basic drawings and didn't laugh aloud, but this episode probably has the first loud joke in it and from now on the show is just getting better and better. This episode centers around Bart, who in this episode exchanges a test of Martin and comes to a school for the highly gifted. As a result, Bart lost his friendship with his father and lost all his friends. The episode is very humorous and shows what would be the greatest show ever to come out. Overall fans of the show will like this episode as it is the character exactly as they turned 20 years later. So watch this episode in a package season 1 and enjoy early Simpson that meant it, make people laugh. I rate this episode 73%.
