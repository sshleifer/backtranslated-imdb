Authors and directors, by the nature of their craft, stand out from the action in their work to show insights on characters and situations. Here, Huston and Joyce have pulled out a bigger frame to give us the ultimate view of what it means to be human. Until it's a great end, the movie doesn't seem to be much like the kind of typical life-filling situation. It's not until the end of the final scene that we realize it's all about it. <br /> <br /> It is not possible to watch this final scene without feeling sorry, and also deep love for yourself and the rest of fellow human beings.
