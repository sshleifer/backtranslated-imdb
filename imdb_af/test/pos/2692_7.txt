I need help identifying an episode of King of Queens. It starts with a scene where Doug talks to Carrie on the phone, and he suggests that they decide to stop stopping every conversation with "I love you." However, it is hard to do and he calls back, just to close with "I love you." It's a very clever moment and one that I think says a lot about relationships that lasted a long time. <br /> <br /> I think (but I'm sure) it's the same episode where Doug gets local builders. flicker and comment on Carrie to pull up her spirits. <br /> <br /> I recently saw this episode, but it was probably a repeat. Don't know what network I saw it. Can anyone tell me the title and season of this episode?
