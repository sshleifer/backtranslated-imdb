I don't know much about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, but I can only see it as an entertaining view. I watched it late in the evening (earlier this year from BBC2) but once I started looking to the end. <br /> <br /> The downside is that it is effectively a courtroom drama. - never my favorite genre - but it is amazingly photographed (mainly in super-saturated ogres) and well done. Like a good novel, I couldn't lay it down. All the way through, I wanted me to watch it in a theater to do the music and photography justice. What happened to his release in theaters? I am a fan of Chiwetel Ejiofor since I saw him in Dirty Pretty Things, and Hilary Swank looks great in this - very feminine and sexy for a change (possibly out of place, but she adds to the visual appeal of the movie ). <br /> <br /> This photo deserves a wider audience than it seems.
