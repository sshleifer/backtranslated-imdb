Good where to start. Did you know that the part of the main robots was presented to the famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Well, you didn't. But they complained about robotics. Then they disappeared into darkness. Now, this movie has it all. A crazy killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Very cool robots. It's funny, it touches, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. This is the first robot-romantic comedy. Of course, there are very few movies perfect and there are some character issues. But there is very little and can be overlooked. I think couples will enjoy this movie and want to watch it over and over. 9 stars.
