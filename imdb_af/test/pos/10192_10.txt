THE DEATH OF DEATH definitely determines a ten on a scale of one to, to a lesser extent, John Woo's masterful direction, along with Kat's excellent cinematography. Some of the quiet explorers alone are worth the price of a rental; There are moments when this one border to become an art house film. Both James Ten and Sammo Hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate. Ten are exceptionally good as the bad ones. It is a role that does not stop the things I have seen before. (Ten usually played a hero and with his mustache I didn't even recognize him). Sammo's goofy "buck teeth" just make an already indifferent character look even more flawed; that he is also a skilled martial artist, makes him even less enjoyable - in a villain you like to hate similarly. His choreography of battle scenes throughout is fantastic. Jackie Chan appears short (early and late in the passage) as a blacksmith, and I believe I actually shone Yuen Biao somewhere along the way. Tan as the lead role is nothing short of beautiful.
