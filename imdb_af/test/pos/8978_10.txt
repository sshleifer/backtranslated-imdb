Charlie's Wilson's War shows with bold truth just how useless wars can be, especially for many who spend countless hours and finance to fund them. Virtuoso performances and remarkable memorable characters, teamed with a riotous sarcastic treasure cat, the film, wrapped up by the unpredictable Mike Nichols to the best of the year's best. Politics has never been so much fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a Texas congressman who is credited with winning the Cold War almost alone. He also relies heavily on drugs, women and chocolates, and he also takes an unexpected interest in the events in Afghanistan and the horrors of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. With the help of Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an apostate mission expert of the CIA, and Joanne (Julia Roberts), a wealthy socialist, he called in to help Afghanistan with the rocket attacks and anti-tank weapons they seriously damage to the Russian army. . Ultimately, by the end of the 80's, the Cold War would come to an end, and the funds would be eradicated immediately, rebuilding and recovering all aid for the emerging country. <br /> <br /> The acting is beautiful, although it can be expected from the more than completed role. However, a large part of it must be attributed to the writing, which makes every character possible to be undoubtedly well developed and memorable. And a cordial help from that credit goes to the novel of the same name, which is hilariously honest. Tom Hanks is delivering an unparalleled performance as Charlie Wilson, the man who has done so much for so much and remains relatively unknown. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Gust, a character who is lively in his physical and pious cynicism; The impeccable Hoffman once again shows an excellent range in the characters he portrays. Julia Roberts may be the only weak link of the film, with her generic snobbish character and non-subtle enough accent. And then there is Wilson's "jailbait" group of young secretaries who scamper to keep him happy. Under the guidance of Amy Adams, who always lives, every supportive role has its joyful moments. <br /> <br /> Victory of the Soviet Union was not an easy task, especially in view of the many conflicting objectives between the various political leaders. "Why does the congress say one thing and do nothing?" queries a disgruntled politician. "Tradition mostly," returns Wilson. Everyone seems to have to end the Cold War, but a blind eye turns to the atrocities that are taking place in Afghanistan. It takes a trip to war-torn refugee camps in Pakistan to motivate Wilson as well as his main financial source, Doc Long (Ned Beatty). Wilson uses strategic ties with committees to raise arms funding in Afghanistan from $ 5 million to $ 10 million with a simple mission, but the president of Pakistan scoffs at the idea of ​​winning a war for such a trivial amount . By the end of the Wilson campaign, $ 1 billion is being sent to the Mujahedin to shoot down Russian helicopters - the first step to victory, as Wilson predicted. Apart from the size of the film, unresolved unrest in Afghanistan has led to further, less ill-considered problems, which Wilson has suggested. <br /> <br /> In the course of Charlie Wilson's War, the main characters from the United States travel to Pakistan to Afghanistan to Jerusalem to Egypt, but wherever they go, sarcasm always follows. There is a surprising amount of comedy in the movie, as the political undertones are generally serious. Hoffman offers jokes with almost every exchange of dialogue, such as Hanks, with his naturally witty women-hunting ideals. An early-stage scene is constantly being launched by Wilson's office. He tries to straighten out a legal issue with his beautiful gals post ("you can teach them to type, but you can't learn to develop tits") reminds me of a slapstick routine of the Marx Brothers. <br /> <br /> With the press focusing on drug allegations against Wilson, instead of the major issues of the Cold War, and the contradictory desire of officials to budget their help, it is clear that politicians oppose the end of the film is still unaware of what is really needed. And since the script is so fast and clever, some audience members can't be able to keep up with all the dialogue-intensive events. But, as noted by the politicians who are ignorant of the difference between Pakistan and Afghanistan, it is essentially another argument to support Charlie Wilson's point. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie
