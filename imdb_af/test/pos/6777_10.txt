Many Americans are lazy, and it also revealed in our DVD watch. Many of us do not like to take the time to read an hour and a half (or more) of subtitles, so we choose not to see many foreign films. One movie worth TOTALY your time, no matter how ordinary a job you might think of the caption reading, is "The Green Butchers." It's by far the best foreign movie I've ever seen, and top many American movies I've seen lately. It's a complex situation that is told in a remarkable simple and funny dialogue. The character depth derived from this movie is incredible. The way Svend and Eigel (sorry if spelled wrongly) feed each other's contrasting people is straightforward! The actors were well-cast and I hope many a successor is taken into account. It needs very little of Bjorne and what is it? Just give me Svend and Eigel a kind of journey with supportive characters and more wonderful dialogue! To the author of this fine script, I say: Write more! The story itself is rather distorted, but you will wake up anyway to the bad guy ... with no regrets. Please check out this movie!
