When dirty dance was on television in the middle of last year, I was out so that I couldn't see it, my mother swore I saw it and that she was getting on tape somewhere. Anyway, to the point that she couldn't get her video for Christmas, I bought her the DVD. Well, she didn't look. It was a while and I decided to take it to look and I fell in love with it. It's a great movie with many beautiful scenes! I love the plot and enjoy every moment of it! It's certainly not for everyone, but if you love a love story, you'll want to see Dirty Dancing again! Dirty Dancing - The Way Love is meant to be!
