It's a great comedy card - one of Keaton's absolute best. Through a long series of turbulent mistakes, Buster is wrong for a wanted killer. And as a result, most of the film consists of him from the police and especially one detective. While generally not a fan of movies with a lot of chase, this one is the absolute best for types of athletic and acrobatic abilities. I saw some who had wilder stunts, but no one where the star was so nice and able to move with wonderful grace. In particular, there is a scene where he runs over a table, jumps on a man's shoulders and dives as softly as humanly through the transom. Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfect timing, such as how he really believes he actually killed someone. By the way, this film is very similar to COPS, also by Keaton, but originally enough and with enough energy to make them worthwhile. <br /> <br /> This movie is brilliant and the only Keaton card I can think of that I probably said even more was THE PLAYHOUSE - where Buster plays every role at the theater.
