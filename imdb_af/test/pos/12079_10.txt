"Who will love my kids" Saddest movie I've ever seen. Definitely 10/10. Released on television in 1983. Film released on VHS. DVD release is a must, rather than later. Cancer-dyed mother must get homes for all her children before she dies, for her thoughts are that her husband's and father's children are unable to care for them if they are dead. She manages homes for the children, except one, a young boy who did not want because he suffered from epilepsy. Very sad when you didn't want to. In for a really good tear-iron, get your hands on this movie. I'm a man, even I screamed when I watched this movie. Not to be missed.
