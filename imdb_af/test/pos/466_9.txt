It's really a movie you have to see twice. When I first saw this movie, I was really drawn into the story. While most of the story takes place inside a hotel room, the stories that Buddy (Nick Drake, Wonderful Speech) and Daphne share take you out of their room and into their world. Through their conversations you get a feel for the loneliness and pain that each one feels. The soundtrack accompanies the movie perfectly, dark, lo-fi and intriguing. When you watch the movie, you can pick up all the clues that you missed for the first time and led to one of the best endings I've ever seen. I hope to see this movie find a distributor for the DVD so it will be more accessible. Great movie, you won't be disappointed.
