Remember, before Sidney was, Dudley was. <br /> <br /> Dudley Digges is barely remembered today - because its boom time as a sound movie match was the late 1920s and 1930s. Except for one big show: the ship's good natural, as a good doctor in the 1935 MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, most of its films are barely revived. More is a pity because he was a wonderful actor. In 1931, he played Casper Gutman (the original actor to play that villain) against Ricardo Cortez's Sam Spade in the first MALTESE FALCON. Likewise, about the same time, he played the recording angel in Leslie Howard's version of OUTWARD BOUND - the same role Sidney Greenstreet addressed a decade later in TWO TWO WORLDS. <br /> <br /> Digges can be likeable and love (that ship's doctor again) or contemptuously (in CHINA SEAS, as the condemning First Mate to cut the poor Lewis Stone, but then prove he's so big a coward in a moment of crisis). He held his own against Paul Robeson in THE EMPEROR JONES. He is the Chinese freedom fighter who works with Gary Cooper in the GENERAL DED at DAWN. Digges can do anything. <br /> <br /> Here he is Mr. Thompson, the hypocritical and theft head of a reform school that Frankie Darro and his friends sent to commit a robbery and injure a Greek-American shop owner (this is the most recent incident for most of them). Digges are as bad here as in CHINA SEAS, but it's a good thing not to keep it completely. He may somehow exceed his roles ... later on. <br /> <br /> Darro has a gang of urban criminals (including a Jewish boy and "Farina" of "ONCE"). As indicated in another review, it is a prototype of the Bowery Boys. We see they shake off car owners to pay them to "see and protect their cars". When one man does not, they smell his car quietly. The snatch and greyhound at the Greek American shop is also graphically shown - his skull is broken when pushed. <br /> <br /> The boys are rounded up and put in strict but decent judge Arthur Byron, who realizes he can't leave the kids with their parents: the parents can't see or be incompetent. Unfortunately, there are three racist stereotypes in this order: A Jewish father who is more concerned with his business than with his son Farina's stereotype Yassum father and the Italian father whose willingness to work together, gets his son out for reform. . school. <br /> <br /> Once there, the boys find the regime repressive. Sometimes one of the guards or the nurse (Madge Evans) tries to talk to them. But Digges doesn't have time for coddling. She is a regime determined to break the boys so they behave themselves. Unfortunately, Digges and his bookkeeper partner are greedy. They serve inferior food to the boys and save the profits. <br /> <br /> One day a new state official came to look at the reform school. This is Jimmy Cagney, who is a hack ward whose gang has the voice for Edward Maxwell. As a reward (he couldn't get the park commissioner post), Cagney was made an assistant school inspector. He is supported by his hanger-on pel and factotum Allan Jenkins (in his first Warner Brother movie). <br /> <br /> The irony is that Cagney, if Digges, would be a little more careful, might have let him do things. But Cagney arrives to see that Darro is being brought to Digges to fight. The Warden and Darrow had earlier problems, and Digges now wants to punish Darro, who is fleeing, but is seriously injured by Digges' barbed wire fence and his free use of a whip. Cagney stops Digges and lets Evans Darro treat injuries. And she explains the reality of the situation to Cagney, and her own idea of ​​true reform reform of the boys by building trust in them with responsibility. <br /> <br /> The movie follows it to the end and shows that Cagney and Evans are on the right track, turning the Reformation into a "republic" for the boys to run properly. This leads to conflict with Digges, whose profitability is reduced because it no longer gets stock. But the scheme was derailed when Cagney found himself in trouble with the law. Digges see its opportunity and take it fully. But then he goes too far ... much more than he ever negotiated. <br /> <br /> The 1930s had many movies that showed children to take steps to fix and change things. Darro appears in WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD. Cecil B. De Mille did this day and age, where the children learned a lesson from a gunman played by Charles Bickford, who scared hell out of him. So it went in the 1930s. THE MAYOR OR HELL achieves a similar intensity of revenge and juvenile justice. But that's the one problem of the movie. Digges' character is a knave and hypocrite, so we never really encourage him, but if he wasn't a thief, we could go along with his view (even if it's counterproductive). The scenes at the beginning of Darro and his gang proclaiming people actually make the hardness. Digges will follow, look pretty understandable (even if they are deceptive ways). He also had one moment when he was really angry at Cagney - at that stage he hid from his own collision with the law - giving orders over a long distance telephone to a dirty Digges. When Digges learns what actually happened, he is really angry at Cagney to teach him proper behavior. This is the closest thing to Mr. Thompson sympathetic to this fine movie.
