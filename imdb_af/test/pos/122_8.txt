Overall, a well done movie. There were the parts that made me falter, and there were the parts with which I had thrown my hands, but I came with something more than I went into. <br /> <br /> I think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition. Without spoiling it, let me say that the obvious references to the trial by a fire in Ramayana are far beyond what this movie is about. The Ramayana is an epic. Not a 200-page book laying women in India. The movie is about two girls married to a very distinctive Indian family. While the basic principles of the "unwritten laws of the family tradition" appear to be conservative India, I assure my reader that I (for 12 years living in Delhi) have found complete parts that just didn't bring the bells. I mean things and some actions are very true, but a few other things are just far from the point. Especially today. <br /> <br /> Delhi is complicated. India is complicated. The director both tries to simplify. And it fails. <br /> <br /> Why in English? Can you introduce a movie about American Indians in English. Or the French language in English. Serious screams. Even the servant spoke fluently accented English (though with a hint of colloquialisms in the language of "credibility"). <br /> <br /> But the chemistry between the leads is tangible. If you keep it warm, it's a movie for you. I think it is the greatest saving grace - the development of a true true love story. <br /> <br /> If this movie were about Radha and Sita, it would have earned me full marks. And to be that, it could have made a subtle statement. But this movie is out there to say that is what India is, and that's how Indian society is. And in that respect, it succeeds as much as it fails. Just take everything you see with a pinch of salt. The dark secrets of India are not revealed. Only two girls fall in love. Just as it happens everywhere.
