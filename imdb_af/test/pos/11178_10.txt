Determine to be a classic before it is even conceptualized. This game deserves all the recognition it deserves. At a time when first-person shooters such as Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament collect all the attention of computer gamers, graphic adventures are a dying race. With a great pun and humor, Monkey Island's curse is a game that people of all ages will enjoy. Life can only improve after playing The Curse of Monkey Island. * prediction * the sequel Escape from Monkey Island is already destined to be a classic too. I guarantee it.
