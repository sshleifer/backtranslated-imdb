Alien Warrior (or King of the Streets) is one of those 80s jewels that you accidentally stumble upon, and then look furious, wondering how wonderful it is and over the top. <br /> <br /> A little hungry stranger arrives on Earth (LA to be exact) and stumbles into a world of drug dealers, gangs and corrupt policemen. He falls in love with the flaxen-haired, beautiful teacher who only wants to help children in the city center read more. He also manages a coke snorting drug kingpin that vows to destroy him. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this movie at first glance ... sure it's hokey, stupid and low budget. But you can say the filmmakers got their heart in the right place and damned if the thing didn't work! I just pray that it will be on DVD soon. <br /> <br /> It has a hot soundtrack, break dancing, violence, nudity .... all with a positive, healthy message! See it.
