Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, white and charm. At age 16, Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents' home and found a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that envy many mothers and daughters. They are best friends. The girls have extensive knowledge of movies and TV shows, and are constantly calling them. In the first season, Lorelai needed money to send Rory to Chilton (a highly rated high school), so she had to turn to her parents unwillingly. They are happy to give them the money, but in return Rory has to eat with them every Friday night. I recommend this show. I love it!
