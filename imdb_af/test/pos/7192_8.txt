The second live action outing for Asterix is ​​much better than the merged elements of ten different stories called the first movie, but rather close to the original comic. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, Queen Cleopatra With Cesar, a race to build a palace in Egypt to show that the Egyptians are a great people. Royal Architect Edifis is looking for help from Asterix, Obelix and druid Getafix to complete his task. There are several laughs aloud moments, some jokes that can only get the French (jibes at the 35 o'clock week), while others are more universal. The big special effects of the budget are spectacular, but overshadowed by the jokes of the original cartoon. <br /> <br /> Depardieu and Clavier are working brilliantly as a couple, while Monica Bellucci makes the perfect casting as Cleopatra. Also, for fans of the comics, hilarious pirates get a glimpse of their absence in film 1.
