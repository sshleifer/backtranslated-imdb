A good movie. Every moment masterfully executed by Toyoda and his crew. The actors give credible performances all around. The visual art is haunting, beautiful and sometimes spectacular shots of the Japanese country and city landscapes. The sounds, with the permission of the Japanese band 'Dig', were never overly edgy as one would expect from banded. soundtracks. It is oddly atmospheric and well suited to the screens on which they are running. <br /> <br /> All in all, they worked perfectly. Well, if they justified the story, perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted. <br /> <br /> The true greatness of 9 souls is the compelling story. The prison may break the movie from a lost genre these days, and a road trip movie loses its appeal because of the way the world gets smaller. But this story easily mixes something fresh with those two genres. <br /> <br /> 9 prisoners get freedom and possibly the opportunity to regain their places in society. will society accept them? Will they really be free from their dark past? and can they stay together long enough to live and find out? <br /> <br /> Every culprit has an interesting history. Their crimes are as varied as their apparent destiny. A brotherly feeling among them keeps the story high on drama and provides it with hilariously comedic situations. And because of the nature of their backgrounds, violence is always something to wait for. <br /> <br /> After all I can say is going to give a watch.
