This movie brought together some of the old Spinal crew for another movie, this time around the world of the Dog Show, how their owners are preparing and training for the show before going to the show themselves. <br /> <br /> We meet several teams as they hope to win the top prize - The Fleck's, Cookie that slept with every man ever, and Gerry trying to handle his wife's old escapes and the fact that he literally has two left feet. Harlan, whose dog speaks to him and enjoys ventriloquism. The Swan is taking too much coffee and shouting at each other. Donalan and Vanderhoof, the gay couple, and Cabot and Cummings who have won the past two years. Fred Willard commented on the show, and is very funny as always. Funny scenes include the "Look at me!" stage, and some with Levy. Unfortunately, some of the best scenes have been deleted or filmed. Willard questioned Leslie Cabot, and the alternative epilogue with Gerry is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. If it was included, I would give the movie an extra point. But ... <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
