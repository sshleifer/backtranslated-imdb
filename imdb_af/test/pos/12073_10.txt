I have nothing but praise for this movie and throw, especially Ann Margaret. But more importantly, I praise my in-laws who were Warren's and Frank's adoptive parents in real life. I met most of the "kids" at Warren's wedding in 1989. It's an amazing story and is even more incredible for me to know the family and what everyone has gone through. It's also nice to see how my in-laws are portrayed in the movie. It was pretty accurate. My wife even enjoys some small details such as a toaster that she remembered from her childhood. Yes, it's a hard movie to watch, but so wonderful and sincere. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this story to me is how many of the children slept through my in-laws and because of their daughter marrying and Warren as a brother-in-law, how much I met in mine. For the past 20 years this story has been part of my life because of what my mother-in-law shared with me. This and Warren knows. For what it's worth, Warren lives in California with his family. He married his high school sweetheart, with whom he joined his 20-year-old high school reunion. <br /> <br /> There was a show in the 1980s called "That's Incredible." They had a family reunion that also had to meet the show. <br /> <br /> For everyone's interest, the DVD is available in Great Britain and Australia. It's a tough video to come here in the United States and I haven't found a DVD here yet.
