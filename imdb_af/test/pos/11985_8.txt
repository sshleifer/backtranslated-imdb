It is not very well written. The songs are not memorable. However, the role-players are very much in favor of this Martin and Lewis in the naval situation. They both look good like young sailors. They are credible. The submarine screens show how tight it should have been on the underwater missions in the 1950s and beyond. <br /> <br /> Many sailors in many scenes. Hundreds, perhaps, in a large outdoor practice field, and again in a boxing area. <br /> <br /> You'll see James Dean in his scene. He stands out, though he is an extra here. In a scene where Jerry runs across a busy street, we see some of his almost accident comedy that he would play in The Patsy years later. <br /> <br /> Dean giving Jerry boxing instructions is a great comedy shooter to watch for. Jerry in the boxing ring shows his high energy that was his trademark in the late 40s and early 50s. Dean and Jerry dance are a bit of a treat. Not great, but better than most non-dance movies. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing if you're not black and white. Good end. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
