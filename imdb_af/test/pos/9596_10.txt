I caught this movie show about the most unlikely success? , from a lower league, soccer team. The plot is thick and rolls out some big, turbulent turns. Intercut with shots and comments from the 70's. I was amazed at his slick foot pleasure. <br /> <br /> A good throw includes the excellent Tim Healy as the crazy (drunk) driver, bumbling along hanging on anything that will win his team ...? I remember bits like the stolen secret file Don Revie (Super Leeds Unite and England driver-loved fans from everyone else) had at Bostock United (the under-men) in their detailed report of their opposition, Bostock United, in this FA Cup final, just say "Sh-te". <br /> <br /> Many other footy gags have long before the fantastic feature length "Mike Basset - Football Manager" with Ricky Tomlinson. /> <br /> Up there with the, Gung ho English, Germans, on soccer. Well moral. Although the score lines say differently from "Escape to Victory" (I still encourage England's score) <br /> <br /> And the ungrateful eternal grind of a very bad team in Micheal Palins "Golden Gordon" Of The " Ripping Yarns Series (with Terry Jones) is called Bostonworth United, if you are interested. <br /> <br /> I looked high and low for a copy of Bostock's Cup even Nick Hancock's biography do not list it (probably someone - no Mr. Hancocks error) <br /> <br /> Play it again or sell me a copy - PLEASE ....
