This movie is a perfect picture / drama / thriller, every scene you've sucked. I watched this movie and was amazed at how many talented actors in the film were. Damian Chapa was especially good, he played his part perfectly. Story is made for these actors. The characters make the movie so realistic. This movie simply gets an A plus from me. Definitely look at this movie, compare it to scarface, but have a more in-depth story. This movie not only gives you a good picture of the gangster life, but also gives you the characters' emotions, and in the end you really feel the main character. Watch this movie !!!!!!
