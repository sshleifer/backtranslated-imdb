"In the line of fire" is one of those Hollywood movies that appear a bit on TV, but although I've seen it a few times, I usually end up with the whole thing again. Why? - That's good! Clint Eastwood is great as usual, and the character he plays is interesting and more than usual. The character, secretary agent, Frank Horrigan, is haunted by the fact that he is not on pres. Kennedy in Dallas does not have. Now he is forced to deal with a professional killer, who openly declares that he will kill the president. . However, the film does not make him a depressing, breeding and obsessed character. He is beautiful and personal, and is realistic like a man who has experienced much in life and is comfortable in his own skin. He is even quite convincing when he flirts with the beautiful, younger agent played by Rene Russo. The murderer, played by John Malkovich at its best, is cerebral, deliberate and enjoys high games of life and death. He even goes by the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth. <br /> <br /> The film is consistently enjoyable and delivers all the goods - excitement, action, romance and drama - all in their right amount. It's a fun movie that is really helped by the great actors in it!
