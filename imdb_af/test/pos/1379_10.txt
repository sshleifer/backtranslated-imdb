I tried to find out why I enjoyed this movie? It's not because of money spent on it, that's for sure !! Did I see a painted pistol there? Maybe they don't have the same kind of visual effect homes in Scotland? Or maybe they just had no money? Making clear shows a gang of very capable guys making a movie at odds. Awesome! But what I liked was the cry of the performances. Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead parts like 2 regular guys. No Hollywood histrionics here. <br /> <br /> OK, so the effect work is not very good. The spaceships just don't look as good as they should be in today's FX world and I've seen much better free stuff on YouTube. But the movie coincides very well when they come to the planet. Was it filmed in Scotland or just by a Scottish crew? Or does it just work better? Did they work out the water? By the end, I loved this movie and was disappointed when they all died.
