The last person to die before New Years is cursed to ride the Phantom Carriage for a whole year and pick up the souls of the dead. <br /> <br /> I saw a scene of this old silent Swedish horror movie on Youtube, and decided to find the whole movie. It was worth finding the job because it was an absolutely wonderful movie for the time it was made. It has a wonderful mysterious atmosphere. The old-time horror filmmakers really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere. Unfortunately, many of today's filmmakers do not understand the importance of the environment and atmosphere, and go for the cheap jumping storm. The visual effects are excellent, given the date of production. If you can get a copy of this, I strongly recommend giving it a watch. 9/10
