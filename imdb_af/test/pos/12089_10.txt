I've been away from Istanbul for the past 10 years. During that time I lived in London constantly. When I saw the movie, I realized how much I am Istanbuler. I'm not just from Turkey, I'm part of Turkey. One of my parts is Istanbul, the sound of Istanbul, the people of Istanbul. Probably, Faith Akin thought he had done great musical documentary work, but I have to say it's more than that. It's about the fine combination of many different music, cultures, approaches, politics, ethnicity in a delicious pot. As we all know that Turkey is exactly, Istanbul is always and between eastern or western city. As one of the group members said, Istanbul is a bi-cultural city. But much more an eastern city, because we have always tried to be a Western city. It shows that we were never one. <br /> <br /> This movie will catch from the first second. Music is excellent, people are fascinating. Especially Aynur and Sezen Aksu. Singers, band members! It's great to see everyone at a small theater in Wood Green.
