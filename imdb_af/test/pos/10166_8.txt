"The man who knew too much" (1955) is Alfred Hitchcock's own remake of his 1934 excitement over a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) on vacation in Morocco where they are trapped in a nightmare murder. spying, murder and worst of all, kidnapping their 10-year-old son. The movie that Hitchcock himself considers better than the original is a great fun. Stewart and Day have a good chemistry together. The film is filled with the wonderful comic scenes and dialogues as well as the scenes of the cold tension. <br /> <br /> The inclusion of "Que Sera, Sera" was a genius stroke because the song seldom fits and plays such an important role in the movie "Que Sera, Sera" in "Die man who knew too much ". <br /> <br /> Hitchcock also treats us to the lively music of Arthur Benjamin "Storm Cloud Cantata" for nearly ten minutes while the scene in London's Royal Albert Hall where the murder of a very important politician has been attempted and both, the scene and the cantata are simply wonderful.
