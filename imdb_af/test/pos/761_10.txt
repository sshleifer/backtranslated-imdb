I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well done. It is a movie that exceeds many other movies in terms of originality and enjoyment. Rappert Grint played the part wonderfully and has a general character for the acting business. The almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot, and it was a character that could be released almost immediately. This reminded me of the divine mysteries of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Not through the actual content of the film, but the premises, and overall tone to the film itself. "Driving Lessons" is an upcoming life story, much of which can easily be related to the overwhelming mother, the lack of freedom and the discovery of yourself.
