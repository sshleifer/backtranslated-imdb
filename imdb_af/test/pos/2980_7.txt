I didn't see this movie as it came out on a ride in the theater and I searched for it. Then I was 12 and the story excited me; And now the end ends me. It was a young love that fascinated me most, not to mention John's choir and Taupin's lyrics. The story (then) went home for my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and it's still 35 years in my mind - it's so good. Put yourself on adolescent age and let your fantasies run. If this movie wasn't excited about your curiosity, you were just too old. I look forward to seeing it again (even at my age)! If nostalgia is in your place, I'm sure it's an interesting movie to watch. It's innocent, it's just amazing and it's easy to be so easy and enjoyable.
