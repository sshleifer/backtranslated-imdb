While the "date doctor" concept is the one thing that saves this movie from an otherwise average romantic comedy with a standard plot for the genre, I found it pleasantly enough to elevate my opinion on it, so I finally got it much more enjoy it. as if it had just a mediocre plot without many twists. Will Smith does a good job, as always, as Hitch, the man who spends his life advising men how and how not to win over women ... since his failed attempt to keep his college girlfriend. There is much laughter as he helps his latest patient, excessive, excessive, asthmatic Albert Brennman (Kevin James), successful courtesy Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta) co-worker. Also, if he decides to escape a woman, he meets in a bar of turkey who just doesn't want to, she doesn't want to round him, but he finds himself attracted to Sara (Eva Mendes). It turns out to be a great deal for him, so I think since he never actually exercised his own rules on himself. Unfortunately, Sara is a gossip columnist who is interested in the "date doctor" who had a seemingly brave man like Albert with Allegra. Especially after player / jerk Vance Munson (Jeffrey Donovan) breaks her best friend (Julie Ann Emery's) heart and shows the date doctor he saw, blaming him when she didn't realize he refused to see him. Yet, the trouble follows and Hitch is stuck and wondering how to do with his own relationship, while not being a big help to Albert if he is trying to figure out what is more about him. The acting is good, there is lots of humor and other fine points with meaning. Hitch's character is greasy and wise, sometimes managed to be both at the same time. True, the misunderstanding where the woman is opposed to something the man didn't really do (why do they always show it?) As general and annoying - think it would not have been if it was the 1st, 5th time I saw it - but the rest of them were completely new. I just wish this movie was longer - I remember seeing 3/5 of it while playing it once on the restaurant's TV - but I still accept it. It is definitely worth paying the money for its briefness.
