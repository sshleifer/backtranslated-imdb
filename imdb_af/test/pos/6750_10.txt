I think this movie was made as good as it could have been. With just 4 months and a budget of $ 52,000 - I'm surprised it wasn't worse. If you don't care about CG or special effects, this movie is great. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie isn't made that good (I'm sure it could have been, but you're trying to do better in just 4 months), but the story is good and the movie is quite exciting. <br /> <br /> Don't trust me when I say this movie is good because I also find the 1933 King Kong to be good. <br /> <br /> I have to confess that I didn't watch the full movie either ... I might have sent here and there a few minutes ...
