With Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a great room, pleasantly unexpected for Billy Crystal. This movie has various tear-dramatic, dramatic, serious underlying themes (especially with Steven Seagal's scene). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values ​​with a good dose of humor being thrown in the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy is not always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the right message and motivation for this movie remains solid. The discovery of Billy Crystal's talent scout / agent character in Romania from a giant man is revealing and the background of the scene's view of movie agent is fascinating. Yet the focus remains on sensitive ties of both love and learning about yourself. Eight out of ten stars.
