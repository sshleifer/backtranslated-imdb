It's not the best movie you can ever see, but it's still very refreshing. Of course these are mistakes, it has humiliating moments and yet it is different from what you are used to, and it is funny in a way that only the French can give you. You may recognize some of the masterpiece Amelie when you see the opening. I give it 7 out of 10, but still recommend it to you if you are tired of the usual drill you can rent in the video store.
