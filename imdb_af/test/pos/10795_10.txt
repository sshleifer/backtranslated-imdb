I saw it several times and glued it all the way. It is very exciting and intense. To describe, it seems boring, but it is incredible. This is the kind of movie you need, can't miss anything, but if you make it that week, bump it with you for a long time. Now I don't even think what Stone is trying to see us. Just the story of Alan Green? I do not think so. It was a look at ignorance, stupidity, self-absorption and a guy who just lost his grip. Perhaps he had more grip than the listeners. I didn't look Barry, but for some reason worried him. I was surprised why I couldn't get him out of my head when the movie ended. I wish I could see in Olive Stone's thoughts for this one.
