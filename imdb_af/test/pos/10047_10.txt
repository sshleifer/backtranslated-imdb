I watched this movie over Christmas, and what a good movie it was! It tells the story of Custer (played by Errol Flynn) during and after his graduation from Westpoint. Although I heard that the movie is not very historically accurate (Hollywood is never), I still enjoyed it because I knew little of the real events anyway. <br /> <br /> I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and since then my favorite actor has become! His performance alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the end was fantastic! It brought me close to tears when he and Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) drove on a small horn after their death. <br /> <br /> I've always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor, as he was my dad's favorite actor, and I grew up watching his movies as a kid. But it was only when I watched this movie that I realized how good he was. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie 10 out of 10 !!
