1931 also presented an American tragedy, the original story of "who will take him, poor girl or rich girl". it was a wonderfully entertaining movie. Babs Stanwyck was a beautiful as she could be, it sage blaneer. Monroe Owsley undoubtedly played Babs' husband. I have never heard of him, but I thought he had a good physical deal with Bing Crosby of the big broadcast ('32), even a fall of her and wings. Ricardo Cortes, the rich playboy with a heart of gold. A real movie player goes back. The dilemma is resolved in the end, after the tribes of the title and I believe Annette hanshaw had the hit record, although the off-screen voice did very well. I also enjoyed the dance hall scenes. I'm sure they were authentic; The band, a leading one of the time, was wonderful. good work, Lionel Barrymore !!!!
