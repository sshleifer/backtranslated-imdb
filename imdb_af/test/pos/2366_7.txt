This movie is great! To be a fan of The Strip Strip Presents. I just knew I would love this movie. And love what I do. I finally came around to buy a copy of this movie early this year. However, I was annoyed to find that it was cut! So I'm going to look at the car sales sales for the original version. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is about Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson), who is trying to impress his girlfriend (Dawn French) by claiming to be a drug dealer. However, Dennis is told that he phoned and cut one night in the bar! So Dennis gets supergrass, but the problem is he doesn't know anything and starts making lies and digging him into an even deeper hole! The irony of this is that drug trafficking in Devon ends. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't as funny as I expected, but it's still a very good movie with good laugh and good soundtrack. . It also has the best scene ever in a British movie. (Robbie Coltrane's walk across the pier was set to "Two Stems" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood. <br /> <br /> So if you're a fan of The Comic Strip Presents ... ", of any of those role players, or a fan of British comedy, see it so soon!
