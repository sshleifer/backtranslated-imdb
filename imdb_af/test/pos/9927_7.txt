No matter how much it hurts me to say it, the movie is not as good as it could have been. Maybe I was deceived by the many exaggerated reviews here on IMDb, but I expected so much more ... <br /> <Sure, the idea is good one, the violent scenes and the camera work is excellent. The imagination of genius Dario is breathtaking, but the film is "dirty" by some mistakes I find irreconcilable. First of all, I am one of the few people who feel that the Heavy Metal music is being played in the most intense scene, just shooting the atmosphere apart ??? With another kind of music (Goblin ????) during the "needle" scenes, it would have been SOOOO intense! ... Instead, the soundtrack destroys a chance for tension ... Secondly, the final murder scene and the Last few moments of the movie are simply silly and uninspired. I don't want to say "amateur" because I love Argento's movies. The end made me feel empty. Talk about a final impression! It's almost what happens in most of Dario's movies! Although, though, Suspiria also suffers from a rushed final (although most of it is brilliant). <br /> <br /> In short, look at this movie, try to make the best of its good points, but also be prepared for some bad people. It is NOT a perfect movie by any means.
