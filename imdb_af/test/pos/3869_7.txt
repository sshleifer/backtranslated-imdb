Bart The Genius While not the first Simpsons episode, Bart Genius is more or less the first typical episode. There's no gymnastics or theme, it's just your typical Simpsons episode in the setup. It always seems like it's an episode that is growing on you. There are some elements that I do not care about, mainly the vain animation that can be forgiven. But over time, I enjoy this story of its uniqueness. <br /> <br /> For example, it will be very difficult for a live-action sit-com to set a standard budget to do this episode because of the different sets in this episode, the computer circuits in me. Melon's class, the opera and so on. My point is, the Simpsons realize one of the greatest strengths in animation. The mere lack of visual limitations compared to live action. <br /> <br /> At a writing point, it is also highly intelligent and fresh. The concept is quite unique, and especially the problems with which it is confronted. Instead of failing to work, it was only Bart's social isolation of his classmates who failed him (although the exploratory science experiment might be different ... which I think is one of the best visual gags of the series.) The end looks a bit irrefutable, mainly because the Bart runs naked in his room to avoid Homer, is already done in shorts, but still funny to Marge and Lisa's brief back and forth if nothing else . /> <br /> Ultimately, it's a very good episode, with very interesting new points in the series, but not perfect. Oh, and the now iconic name Kwijybo is naturally released on the world.
