I am amazed how a filmmaker can make such a subtle, non-sacred image known for his political leftist fervor. If you're for the death penalty, you'll still be there after you've seen it. If you are against the death penalty, you will still be through it. But whatever your point of view, this movie will at least reflect on how you feel about how you do it. There is not one false note in the movie.
