John Carpenter's The Thing is the best horror movie ever made. Not only that, but it's also my personal favorite movies of all time. What makes the movie so good? It's hard to put my finger on it. Everything just seems to work in The Thing, this is one of the rare occasions where everything just comes in place. The movie is even better than Alien in creating a kind of moody atmospheric hell. The fact that it is not just about the gore (it's wonderful VAT), but it can create a paranoia that is unmatched in movies. A truly wonderful movie that is worshiped by all horror buffs, and everyone who tastes good movies.
