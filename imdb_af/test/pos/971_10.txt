I love this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character lies, but that's why it's called a big fat liar. Although this kid runs away to Hollywood, it doesn't give kids the idea that they can. In addition, he does not just make fun, or to get away from it, he does it to gain confidence again. <br /> <br /> I don't think it was just one big advertisement for Universal Studios, because I liked how it made an inside image of what it's like for kids who don't know how cool movies are. <br /> <br /> It has good music and fun characters. This family / comedy is fun for kids and parents alike. It has humor, excitement, and real problems like lying. <br /> <br /> In the end, "Big Fat Liar" sends out a moral: don't expect it to be easy.
