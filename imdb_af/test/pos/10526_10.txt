Unfortunately, this original blend of action and laughter of cinema fans is being held as it is forever in the Columbia vault. A scandal afterwards may be Jack Starrett's strongest film and features a funny script by a young Terrence Malick and has full performances by his two lead, Stacey Keach and Frederic Forrest, who go to a life of crime so can get the money to make a seafood. restaurant. Many outstanding screens include interrogation by bath and electric razor, and an intense shooting in an abandoned building, as it is broken down by a devastating ball!
