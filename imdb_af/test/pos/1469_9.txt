Go to South Park is a 1 hour documentary about South Park with interviews with Trey Parker and Matt STONE and all the other people working on the South Park. There really isn't much to say, it shows the history of South Park and what it takes to make one episode. It's basically a backdrop to the show. It shows the different goods that South Park has made (it was really comedy central that expressed it). It also shows the controversy caused by the South Park. It also shows lots of funny cuts from the show. It's a pretty funny documentary. Any fan of South Park should look out for it. You can find it on YouTube. <Br /> <br /> 9/10
