First, I absolutely loved this movie. As a fan of Billy Crystal, I have to say I expect more comic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly executed and unique to him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was excellent in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client in place, his world has turned upside down. He never expected him to accidentally get the one person who could change his life. Sammy and Max's journey is unique and moving, and sometimes even humorous. Plus, the place in the Czech Republic where parts of the movie were shot was absolutely beautiful. I must say, this dramatic comedy made me feel a variety of emotions. I thought it was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
