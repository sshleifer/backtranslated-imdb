Certainly, the Gershwin family realizes it's one of America's biggest opera. You have thousands of fans of this opera waiting for it to be released on DVD. Please do not be so stubborn, give us a break. Think of the joy and wonder that you can bring to a starving public for quality music, by releasing this great GEM. Don't wait until the movie is over. The movie is the first time, the music is just fantastic, we need beautiful music in today's world. It should never be filmed again with such a large roll. With today's home theater systems, wonderful sound systems and the need for good music, I plead with the Gershwin family to reconsider and release this wonderful movie. Thank you very much
