I was very impressed with this movie directed by Luigi Bazzoni. The story is about a young woman translator who has suddenly lost memory over the past three days and has suffered astronaut nightmares on the moon. She can't explain how it happened to anyone. One day, a postcard came to her from the island of Garma, where she went to visit. strange though people know her, although she has never been there. Also her dreams of astronauts on the moon come back to her. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very strange Italian movie that was temporarily very ghostly and there were also strange images in the movie that seemed to stay with you throughout the time you watched the movie. I would recommend this movie to people just to see how good it is. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
