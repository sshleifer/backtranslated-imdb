Well, this is the best comedy movie I've ever seen. Both of my favorite actors did good work. Salman Khan and Aamir Khan shook. Hope to see Andaz Apna Apna part 2 soon as I heard they will also return with part 2. I have a request to those who have not yet looked at it. please buy DVD and watch it, you will not feel bored. I watch this movie once a week. All the others were also good in this movie. Paresh Rawal, Shakti and others The music is also good, it also has nice songs. There is a little sense that will kill you from Salman Khan, who has played very well and also made Aamir. <br /> <br /> So should film look great work by actors and directors.
