It is there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It memorializes the NY City mind set of the era, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, tackling through his own petard, and ending back in the bed of his adoptive parents. Quite absurd, this is the life one sees through the magic glasses, sees things as they really are ... I don't think it's ever been shown anymore. If so, somebody will surely do Tivo and put it out there. A kidnapping goes wrong: in a rain storm crushes, in and out or shoppers, our hero throws a raincoat over his prey and throws her into his bike-driven fridge blowing her out to his basement apartment in town. He is surprised, surprised and incredibly disappointed when the wraps come off: instead of a nice woman, he has a middle-aged suburban housewife who speaks and speaks and speaks. The film is full of vignettes of commuter life, suburban life, city officials, and all the attitudes so held. It pushes the boundaries of comedy, as magical reality can push a drama, as Daffy Duck can draw on imaginative scenes to show his fate or desires, all at the forefront of plausibility. Though humorous, no one is mean.
