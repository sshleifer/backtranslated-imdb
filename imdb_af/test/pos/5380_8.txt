Each time, you stumble upon a movie that even exceeds your wildest expectations. Given the 4.0 IMDb score, I didn't expect much with The Brotherhood of Satan. I was hoping it might look like a minimum like The Devil's Rain or any of the other early 70's who called the same Satanic horror movies. I couldn't be wrong anymore. What I received earlier was an ambitious and intelligent film that I really enjoyed. Broadly speaking, to prevent something from giving away, the style and structure of the film is much more experimental than the simple storytelling in the early 70's. The Brotherhood of Satan does not strike you with headlines and explanations. There is much to the viewer to fill in the spaces. As a viewer you know something is wrong, but for the longest time you just aren't sure what it is. The unknown helps create a much more creepy atmosphere than most similar films. The end is effective with its surreal images. I was surprised when the final credits started rolling. Those who want a big slam-scared final will be disappointed with the simplicity of the end. A lower movie would have tried to stop everything and would probably have failed. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the movie where it's easy to forget that the director, Bernard McEveety, worked mostly in television before the brotherhood of satan. There are a few scenes that are so well set up, lit and shot that even the most persistent directors can learn a thing or two. For example, I've seen enough movies over the years to realize that directors may sometimes have trouble shooting widescreen shots indoors. Not here. The scene where the men discuss their plan of action in the sheriff's office is incredible. We see all five men at once? everyone does their own thing as in real life. In a smaller movie we can see all the men at once, but each one will be motionless, and wait quietly to deliver their dialogue. It's a small scene, but it looks so natural and so beautifully shot that it's one of my favorite moments of The Brotherhood of Satan. <br /> <br /> Finally, I mentioned the play in my opening, so without going into a lengthy speech, I would just say that the brotherhood of satan sword Martin and LQ contains Jones. Any movie with these two guys is almost an automatic winner with me.
