Great British director Christopher Nolan (Momento, Insomnia), leads this strange movie about a struggling writer obsessed with the following people. It only seems to be harmless, but soon becomes dangerous after taking the game a step further after meeting a similar man who has entered the inserts of the break and. The two men soon come across their heads in a strange world in which the mafia and prostitution are involved. Jeremy Theobald plays the author and Alex Haw is the like-minded friend. Both are good performances. This low budget movie is totally guerrilla-style shot with no permits for any locations and no big stars, but has very large budget movies that are not a clever writing and creative direction. An impressive debut by one of today's best directors. Good stuff!
