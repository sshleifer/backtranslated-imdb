pretty !! In simple words, it seems as if both Aparna Sen and Konkona Sen understand each other well or maybe they are both too good. It may just be her best performance as actor and Aparna's best director. yes maybe better than mr and mrs. Iyer. Konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic. Shabana Azmi plays the role of Anjali, Mithi (Konkona Sen )'s older sister. Shabana Azmi made the best of Anjali's character because she had to play a strong, responsible, arrogant role for an older sister who had the full responsibility of her family. Aparna Sen had beautiful Anjali's character, a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life, her love for her family. <br /> <br /> Mithi's behavior was not young at all, because you can do this for most of Indian directors. There seems to be a lot of research done to understand the role of Mithi, a schizophrenic role. If Mithi is sometimes a normal, lovely schoolgirl, she also scares you if she gets sick. But the sides are beautifully judged and played. Believe me, it sometimes reminds you of the girl in Exorcist. what scary though .. Overall. Marble workpiece by Aparna Sen, Konkona Sen and Shabana Azmi ...
