It's a story about a trip made by a man who once had a dream. Donald Crowhurst was an English businessman and amateur sailor who participated in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, a one-handed, worldwide yacht. <br /> <br /> I was very interested in the story after listening to a radio interview by John Smithson, who is also the producer of Touching the Void. One of the first documentaries to achieve commercial success in 2003. I went with great hope to the cinema and not much previous knowledge of the historical event, and I was relieved that it did not drop me. For 92 minutes I was led by a ghost story and came out a lot to think about. <br /> <br /> Without any reenactment, this film made much use of the limited audio and video archive material they found and it changed a compelling story that allowed the audience to personalize Crowhurst to understand. The story reveals itself as people who had direct links to the events, including his wife and his son, and the ultimate winner, also the only one backing the 9 rivals, gave Robin Knox-Johnston their own accounts of what happened. almost 40 years ago. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst's logs (magazines) he kept at sea for the 243 days are so haunting that it made me much easier to understand what total isolation might be to a man . While Crowhurst's body was never found, the other rival, Nigel Tetley's yacht, had just passed suicide only three weeks ago three years later, after unsuccessful voyage attempts had been completed. <br /> <br /> Everything could take its toll, especially the sea. <br /> <br /> The director Louise Osmond was also at the Q&A session after the show with producer John Smithson. I had no idea that it was a female director and it just came as a very good surprise. The film is limited in the UK (a few days in some theaters). Capture it into the theater while you can, unless you have a latest sound system that can recreate the sound of the basic Southern Ocean. Then it is certain that they will soon have it on DVDs as well.
