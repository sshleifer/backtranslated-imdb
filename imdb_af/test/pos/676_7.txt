We are in a small town, a domestic widow (Ida Lupino) hiring a handyman (Robert Ryan) to look at her home. She soon regrets, as Ryan gets upset in the hour, looks like she's a dangerous schizophrenic host, and now she can't escape her home. <br /> <br /> Beware, My Lovely is adapted from Mel Dinelli's {The Spiral Staircase} story and play "The Man". About one movie and a two-character-driven piece, the film has two major performances and offers an interesting approach to mental illness. However, one should not be deceived into thinking it is a violent and nerve-shattering, because it is not. Clearly, Ryan's Howard Wilton is a dangerous man, but it's another kind of "danger" movie. One who throws another slant on psychosis and it makes it hard to hate our dangerous protagonist. <br /> <br /> Ryan and Lupino are a great combination, they did the excellent, and much better, On Dangerous Ground. same year. So with both actors who are clearly comfortable together, it brings a fine-tuned character story that is all within the boundaries of one house, again: prison. Ryan is exceptionally strong as his character flashes in and out of madness, with some scenes powerful and sometimes invasive fear and others deeply compassionate. The direction of Harry Horner is safe (he should not do much differently if his actors run) and George E. Diskant's cinematography contains clever and impressive visual touches. With one of the Christmas tree bowls, it's unforgettable. To fall, where between the average and the big, Pasop, My Lovely has enough to make it a recommendation to followers of borderline and easy to follow Film-Noir. For fans of Robert Ryan, this is something of a vital sight, oh yes, and then party. 10/07
