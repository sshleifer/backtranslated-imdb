At school I learned how some shots were called and there were two directors who were constantly called: Orson Welles and Sergei M. Eisenstein. I don't care much about that (I was a kid!) But now I know why Eisenstein is a genius and it is a pity to see what was possible in 1938, where we were stuck with countless more than half a century. blind movies! Some say this movie is not worthy of Eisenstein's genius (then they have to watch it over and over until they can say something only) or even worse that it's just propaganda for the Russians. Let's say it is, it is pure propaganda for patriotism, but is not "Saving Private Ryan" or "The Longest Day"? I can sum up so many movies in America where America is raised up, so why not Russia, and besides every war it is fought for patriotism, why else would they raise flags? Alexander Nevsky is a must have for anyone who cares about cinematography, because almost every shot is a sublime picture. Maybe it's all under surveillance, but I'm wondering why it's not included in the Top 250 of IMDB, as there's so much exaggerated Oscar scrap in it too.
