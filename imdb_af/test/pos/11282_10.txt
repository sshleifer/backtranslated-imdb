This is not a story. It's a bunch of psychic needles that reach your subconscious mind. If you're waiting for a story, you'll be bored. But if you give yourself that, you will be in the dream world within 10 minutes. The vague but disturbing images of pain and torture in a deserted landscape leave room for your own fantasies. The strange soundtrack that gives you the feeling of isolation, the visual echoes of the crucifixion of Christ, the pulsating light and the deep dark shadows, all reach your subconscious mind to fill this thought space. I trembled and couldn't escape my television. It was like dreaming with eyes wide open. A strange nightmare, a bad journey, a religious experience ... it deeply touched me and marked me for life. It freed my mind and gave me one of those rare experiences of loss of personality, and merged with the world of archetypes. A little freedom for the soul. A great freedom though ... Not a nice movie, but a very strong and memorable one. Literally, my text has no spoilers. For me, the big surprise of this movie was its incredible intensity, and it can be considered a spoiler. The less you know about this movie, if you see it, the better.
