This is the only Christopher Guest movie that identifies Spinal Tap and Princess Bride, but has never been recognized. The plot surrounds the participants - dogs - and their owners as they venture into the world of competitive dogs ... OK, it's about a dog program. The owners are really characters, as it must be so to hold their dogs. It's really all there is to it, but it makes it funny enough. <br /> <br /> You will never convince me that a mockery about dogshows would be funny before you catch the hilarious scene where Levy and O'hara visit Larry Miller's home on TV ... but that's really all that is needed to convert any doubters. Spinal Tap was an incessant hilarity, joking at the joke, while Best in Show had some more lulls (and I mean 3 minutes at MOST where something ominous doesn't happen), but the big laugh is even bigger. <br /> <br /> The decisive thing in this one is great and even the typical out of place in your movies in general, Parker Posey does a great job. In fact, her tirade directed at Ed Begley Jr. and a pet shop owner about a lost dog toy is probably the funniest script of the movie. <br /> <br /> What is wonderful about this movie is how the authors somehow managed to weave a plot, simply as it was, to these great jokes so it actually felt that had direction. I think there is a freedom to have such a minimal plot. Everyone's role is fairly well-crafted here and the characters are rarely top-notch. The realism of how pathetic they look to the outsider is what makes it harder than Mighty Wind or the uneven Guffman. Actually, I meet true ones like this and then. If you want guests' stuff, you should definitely own this one.
