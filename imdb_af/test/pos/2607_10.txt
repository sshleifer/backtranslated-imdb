During the Southern Independence War, GENERAL STRENGTH mobilizes its troops to defend the local women and children against a Yankee raid. <br /> <br /> In 1936 Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular US GANG children to tackle. in occasional film length. With the great success of Shirley Temple in 1935 (the small colonel, the smallest rebel), it was only natural that Roach would look in the same direction for his GANG. Although a rather exaggerated production and distribution by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box office success. The small gangsters will henceforth keep on short subjects. <br /> <br /> Although George & Spanky McFarland got Thomas in the first half of the movie, Billie Buckwheat Here were two of the best young actors ever to appear in American movies. With all the experience of old, seasoned benefits, these two games can steal scenes and hearts with equal bravado. A constant joy, without a fake note between them, provides the essential reason to watch the film today. <br /> <br /> Phillips Holmes gives a quiet, honest performance as Spanky's adult protector. Almost forgotten, Holmes was a good actor who died too much in World War II. Genuine Ralph Morgan is especially good as a sympathetic union general - his plays with Spanky are quite amusing. <br /> <br /> Other OUR PEOPLE appear centerpiece in the film, especially Carl ?? Alfalfa 'Switzer; he gets warble? Just before the battle, mother. 'Even pretty Rosina Lawrence (the GANG schoolgirl) shows Holmes's beloved. <br /> <br /> Irving Pichel is particularly clever as a cowardly, sad, vengeful Yankee captain. Bumbling Willie Dear and Physical Louise Beavers play Miss Lawrence's slaves. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that there is racism in the movie, not uncommon for Hollywood of that era - but almost completely lacking in the original series of OUR GANG shorts. <br /> <br /> Fans of 19th-century music are attracted to the soundtrack, which is a long sequence of old music.
