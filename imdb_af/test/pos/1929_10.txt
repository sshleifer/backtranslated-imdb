I remember the events of this movie, the badly suspicious Donald Crowhurst cruise in 1968, in the Golden Globe, one-time racing around the world. I was a 13-year-old living in England. The previous year, Francis Chicichester (later Francis, he was excited about his exploitation) completed the first solo cruise of the world. I mostly remember it because we were school to see his return (on a black and white TV!) And then his knight through the queen. It caused a major outpouring of patriotic fury in the UK. It looks so beautiful now. Chichester became a national hero, but he stopped halfway through Australia to re-fit his yacht. The next logical step for hunters was to try the trip without stopping. <br /> <br /> It is important to remember that this was a pre-GPS, when communications on the land were still rather volatile, never in the middle of the sea. Now, with GPS receivers that fit on a key chain and calculate a position within a meter anywhere on earth, it's hard to remember when you can go to sea and literally disappear. As Donald Crowhurst did. <br /> <br /> A number of hunters were reported (all men), including the mysterious man, Crowhurst. In essence, a weekend sailor, Crowhurst was not a spectacular success in any previous venture, including careers in the British Army, the Air Force and as an electronic entrepreneur selling navigation tools. He wanted to do something great about his life, and he saw the first five thousand pounds prize (more than $ 100,000 in today's money) and the subsequent publicity as a means to start his business. He signed an agreement with a sponsor who was more waterproof than his boat, which meant that failure would bankrupt him and he soon found a popular figure at journalists preparing for the race. Now the Brits always love the idea of ​​the gutsy amateur who uses the benefits. (Think Eddie the Eagle loses endless Olympic ski jumps and amateur riders who regularly start the Grand National Horse Race.) The public turned up to see him rise, but his boat wasn't really ready and even as he started (the last competitor to leave the UK) Crowhurst had known he didn't have a great chance. But too much was on him to stop. <br /> <br /> In the wonderful archive material we see doubts about his poor wife's face. With their 4 children left behind, she is filmed by the movie, along with one of Crowhurst's boys. She was in a no-win situation. If she tried to stop him, she would be regarded as a spoiler, but afterwards she was doubtfully torn, or she could save his life by stopping him. Faced with the certain truth that his boat was leaking and never making it through the southern oceans, and unable to turn and face, bankruptcy and denial, Crowhurst had a plan to cheat. From foreign Argentina and Brazil, he waited outside the radio for the leaders to surround the Cape Horn and start looking back at the Atlantic Ocean. He thought he could run at the end of the line and pretend he was searching the whole world. . He falsely forged his logs and made 16mm movies and sound recordings to support his plan. But as one after another, the other rivals threw out, realizing that he would be in second place and his logs would be investigated. Cannot experience some tracing, but his magazine suggests losing his grip on reality and eventually committing suicide. His hunt was found. He was never. <br /> <br /> This beautifully crafted film also follows the journey of Bernard Moitessier, an experienced and enigmatic French sailor who was second and the fastest travel price, when he suddenly left the race With the crisis and He knew publicity he would face, and sailed in the wide blue and eventually went to Tahiti for 10 months. I've worked on the work myself for about seven years, but I understand the power of the sea, though it is in many different ships. Stand on the deck, see water in all directions to the horizon, knowing that there are a few miles of water beneath you, nothing between you and oblivion, but a thin metal hull, without easy access to TV or radio ( Even today on most working ships, you feel nicely isolated, it is possible to escape the responsibilities of everyday life for a while. There is a thorough analysis of what forces people to try this kind of long, lonely journey and its effects on human mind. Most people will think that the attempt to raise 4 children is adventure enough, but much is needed of the need for self-discovery in the sea, the quest for self. <br /> <br /> I strongly suspect that Robin Knox Johnston, the former naval winning champion (and many since then) knew quite well who he was before he left. That's why he managed not only to win. the race, but also keep his common sense on the way. Those who were looking for something deep in themselves might not have liked it completely. <br /> <br /> The wonderful archive footage of Britain in the late 60's is almost reasonable enough to see it (it really looks that bad? I remember it not being so dim, but maybe we're just the worst aspects of the past?) But overall, it is a very well-made and surprising film. Highly recommended.
