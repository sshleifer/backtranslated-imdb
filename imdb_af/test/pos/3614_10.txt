A beautiful, sensitive film that brings the futility and cruelty of wars no matter what the so-called reasons are. The performance of Cage and Cruz was quite impressive, but it is for the older Greek characters who have the highest praise. Irene Papas is as beautiful as ever! Although some scenes sometimes look a bit long, this movie will be a heavy Oscar contender.
