By the end of the Universal Monsters horror movies, and before the Golden Age of sci-fi movies, House of Dracula is more science fiction than horror and includes the more chaotic (reading: enjoyable) elements that would come typing the sci-fi movies of the coming era. Lon Chaney Jr. play the Wolf Man, and John Carradine, Dracula and Glenn Strange, the Frankenstein monster. <br /> <br /> A sharp scientist suggests the two samples of their "diseases" through modern (read: crazy) science. When the scientist's beautiful nurse assistant seems to be a hunchback early in the film, the viewer is warned that this movie will not be typical Universal fare; This film obscures the kind of thin exploitation that we would take for granted in the 1950 author. <br /> <br /> If you don't tackle the slower pacing of older movies, black and white won't throw you. down, this movie is recommended to watch. Afaik, this one is currently not available on DVD, but AMC occasionally air it, so keep an eye out if you can always keep it on your TiVo wishlist!
