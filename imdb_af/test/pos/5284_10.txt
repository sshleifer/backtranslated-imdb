Ponyo, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is a small story that speaks of respect for the sea, respect for people young and old, and respect for cultural differences. It's a new story of a little goldfish that a girl wants to be, rather than a resale of Disney's Little Mermaid. Miyazaki animated by hand, a whimsical, magical movie for the young and the young. The film starts with a slow, wavy blue-green palette of sea anemones, jellyfish, and scores of small, fanciful goldfish with childish faces. No narrative is needed, the movement of the beings and the music of Jo Hisaiahi tell from the beginning. Ponyo, who was released in Japan last year, won the Japanese Academy's Best Animation Film and Best Score (Jezebel.com) award. The shiny goldfish, Brunhild, leaves her ocean home on a jellyfish. Upon reaching the surface she is trapped in a fishing net full of other fish, rubbish and sludge. She is powered by a pot that is rolled to the shore, where the five-year-old Sosuke (by Frankie Jonas) retrieves it. He cut his hand when he opened the pot to free the little goldfish. Brunhild tastes his blood, which heals Sosuke's cut, and brings her transformation into one's person, and at the same time nature throws out balance. Sosuke puts the little goldfish in a green bucket and calls her Ponyo (Noah Cyrus), who wants soft and jelly. Sosuke's mother, Lisa (Tina Fey), lets him take Ponyo to school, which is right next to the nursing home where she works. Lisa loves to hide the picturesque winding path, past a dry dock, through the bustling fishing village, and on a tree-lined road to the nursing home, representing Miyazaki's wonderful performance. It perfectly illustrates a parent's excessive morning. Miyazaki has created another strong, independent, female character in Lisa. Make her a loving, sensible, modern mother, both for Sosuke and Ponyo. Lisa's phone call with the Kiochi (Matt Damon), who is not returning, is because the ship he captains has to race another is a typical woman's response. Later in the evening Sosuke pleads with the use of a signal lamp to talk to his father, as the ship leaves the cliff to which their house sits. Lisa refuses to admit Kiochi's apology and jumps up and says, "Bug-off, Bug-off, Bug-off," it's a hilarious scene. But when Sosuke takes the signal lamp and tells his father, "Good Luck, Love You," Lisa hugs him and tells him he has a good heart. This is a very interesting scene. <br /> <br /> My personal favorites are Miyazaki's elderly, grandmother-type wheelchairs at the nursing home, Yochi (Betty White), Noriko (Cloris Leachman) and Toki (Lily Tomlin). Their switch over Sosuke's golden goldfish is wonderful and reminiscent of the bitter between the Witch of Waste (Lauren Bacall) and Sophie (Jean Simmons) as they trample a long staircase on Howl's Moving Castle. Ponyo's magical seafarer, Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), looks like wizard Howl is coming to return Ponyo to her ocean home. Fujimoto uses one of his elixirs to balance nature, but the magical little Ponyo escapes again to upset more elixir in the process and cause a tsunami. On the back of giant dolphins to come to Sosuke, these girl girls remind the audience of the stubborn, adventurous May in My Neighborhood Totoro. Ponyo is just as adventurous and curious as May. When Fujimoto realizes what Ponyo has done, he asks Gran Mamare (Kate Blanchett), the Goddess of the Sea, to help with the situation. This wise, calming Goddess comes in a blue flowing garment that never ends. She has a private conversation with Lisa about the future of young children, who help understand the audience. Sosuke and Ponyo's relationship is not that of lovers, but of brother and sister. The life-quiet silence is typical of Miyazaki films that leave the audience full of hope.
