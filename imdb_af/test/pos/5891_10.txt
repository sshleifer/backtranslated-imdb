Best years of our life absorb the era of my youth and the feelings of that time. The cast was uniformly wonderful. It was possibly Dana Andrews' best role in his career and he also had to be nominated for an Oscar. There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie, it's almost impossible to list them all. The cinematography is one of the best movies. This movie is a time capsule of what was in the 1940s. A must see movie for any real movie fan. Some critics said this movie was outdated. I do not agree. The theme of human desires is timeless. And the obstacles that veterans return from the war will always be with us. It's just a good movie - one that can be watched over and over.
