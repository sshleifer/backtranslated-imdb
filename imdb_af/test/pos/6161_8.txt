It's such a beautiful movie! It doesn't just make war, it also has friendship and love. The life of Slama is full of sadness, every aspect of his life has fallen apart. I can only imagine how he would feel if his friend made the ultimate sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I see an equal deal with Pearl Harbor, which also deals with two pilots who fall in love with the same woman. However, this film is made much better because it does not portray the woman as being uncomfortable and easy. The friendship between the two men is also much more convincing and well built. I recommend this movie to all people.
