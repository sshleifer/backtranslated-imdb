I want to read all the negative reviews for "Anna Christie". You know, the grip on the static camera, out-dated acting and pretense of the script. But when I saw it yesterday, I had a remarkable influence on it. Yes, Clarence Brown's camera stays quiet for the most part, and I'm pretty sure one of the microphones in the ship's light is hidden. Yes, there is a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action. It's an early talkie with primitive technical aspects. But ... there is Garbo, Marie Dressler, George F. Marion and Charles Bickford, all who prove that the great acting is timeless. <br /> <br /> I believe "Anna Christie" is still one of Garbo's most iconic representations. And this is a wonderful performance of the Divine One, in a role that is actually very atypical for her. Yes, we saw Garbo tired and almost beaten, but never with bags under her eyes or knocking back from whiskey. Garbo has played so many (beautiful) costume roles, to see her playing a contemporary woman, is fascinating. She is not weighed by heavy dresses or makeup. This show looks rather raw from Garbo. <br /> <br /> The plot, from the O'Neill play, follows the tired Swedish ex-prostitute Anna, and her reunion with her boozy, sailor-father. Anna's had enough trouble for any twenty-year-old girl, like telling her drunk, messy Marthy (Dressler) in a bar. She finds comfort in a sea life, and romance with a rough cut, but kind, fisherman (Charles Bickford). But her past threatens to destroy it all. <br /> <br /> Charles Bickford is overlooked in Garbo's long line of (mostly inferior) men. He is one actor who can actually share the screen with her and not be devoured by her magical presence. The couple have great chemistry together and seemed to work together. Dressler can never be accused of underplaying, and again the big lady is on her old tricks, but she is wonderful and convincing in her role, never annoying as in the awful Dinner at Eight. I've never really heard of George F. Marion, but he was wonderful like Garbo's dad. <br /> <br /> It's Pre-Code, and rather eager and dark by MGM's standards. I really enjoyed it, and while it may crack in some places, it's still great.
