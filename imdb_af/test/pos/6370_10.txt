Michael Ritchie's "The Couch Trip" is a wonderful anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. It's so subtle and angry that you begin to realize what a stinging satire it really is. It is also Dan Akyroyd's best movie, made for him in a special film year (1988). First, "The Great Outdoors" and now this. <br /> <br /> Akyroyd stars like John Burns, a career carer who defends the madness to escape prison. Now, a stupid comedy will be just about this. But "The Couch Trip" uses it as a springboard for everything else. Beverly Hills psychiatrist George Maitlin (Charles Grodin, subtly hilarious here) has a nervous breakdown and a replacement has been chosen: Lawrence Baird, who is Akyroid's psychiatrist! You can pretty much guess what is going to happen, but the good thing about "The Couch Trip" is not what happens but how it is done. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" gives Dan Akyroyd the best role he ever had. His John Burns is one of the truly original comic creations in film history. Wicked one liners and physical humor are a part of it, but what makes it special is that Akyroyd Burns is a lovely character. We root for him and grow for him a lot during the 98 minute run. <br /> <br /> But Akyroid is not alone here. He is strongly supported by other great comedian actors. Walter Matthau joins the hilarity as an artist preacher who captures Burns's secret and commits himself with speedy extortion. Charles Grodin "slow burns" his way to another great comic role than the burnt out psychiatrist. Grodin was one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. It's criminal that they didn't use him regularly. Richard Romanus plays Grodin's slimball attorney to perfection. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" is one of the many films made by the newly created Orion Pictures Corporation that is currently unseen. MGM has spent a fortune buying the Orion library, but has not really received cash at their acquisition. "The Couch Trip" joins "Dressed to Kill", "Blow Out" and many others in the collection of dust rotting in the safe. Shame on MGM for their reluctance. Hopefully, with the new management, "The Couch Trip" will find and respect what it deserves. <br /> <br /> **** out of 4 stars
