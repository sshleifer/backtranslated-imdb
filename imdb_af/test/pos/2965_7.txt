To summarize this story in a few sentences: A teenage girl (Amy) uses her warm body and "suspected" virginity to attract a young, troubled guy (Matt) with a potential soccer study to give her a full ride from the village. . Come find out she has quite the reputation and slept with many soccer players in the past hoping they will offer her the same offer. Both of these children came from troubled and dysfunctional homes. Matt's moms, an alcoholic who has repeatedly embarrassed him before his friends and Amy's mother had a bad reputation and became pregnant at a young age. Matt falls in love with Amy and tries to straighten his life for her. Very predictable end. The actress playing "Amy" is actually 33 years old and is trying to play a teenager!
