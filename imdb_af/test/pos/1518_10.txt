Simply beautiful. One of the best thoughts - umm ... screws --- exists. Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles in this story of a children's book writer - maybe? - wrote a subversive channel. Moscow could learn a few things from the torture techniques in this movie. They can also do worse than rent Alan Rickman. Five out of five stars, and currently (1-20-2000) # 2 on my top 100 movies of all time lists.
