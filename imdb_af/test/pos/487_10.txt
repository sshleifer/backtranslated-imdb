I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of natives almost every day. There is good and bad in every race, why do they all out to be bad? This applies to all races today. John Harper was an educated man, he graduated from high school, even had a university year under his belt before returning to the reserve. How do I know this? John Harper went with my family for the 3 years he was in high school, and he stayed in contact with us the year after graduation. He was a friendly and gentle soul, he could be fun and could be serious when the times were right. I was not very old when he left our home, but I can still remember all the times he helped me with my homework when my own brother can't be bothered. He even learned the grade 3 of the year before coming to Winnipeg. Not one of them is mentioned in the film, and the suicide of constable cross is to my fault. What happened to John is unforgivable, not only in the mother tongue community, but also in the white community. Not everyone in Winnipeg thinks like the police are, I knew the person inside and what he was like a PERSON, not an Indian!
