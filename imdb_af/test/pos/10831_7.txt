It's war-time drama - World War II, with French and Jews and Germans, but this one is somehow fun, serious. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau wrote the script for his well-received film "Bon Voyage" (2003). Unlike director Bertrand Tavernier's "Safe Behavior", "Laissez-passer" (2002), WD Rolf Schubel's Gloomy Sunday (1999), or Claude Berri's "Lucie Aubrac" (1997), "Bon Voyage" title sounds - c'est la vie (whatever) - and we have the lovely talented Isabelle Adjani to thank for. It is her beautiful display throughout as the center of attraction (and attention), its cause and effect, which made the film as enjoyable as it is. Hell, which is another derailment of her plan and expectations - will worry about it. The backbone of the story revolves around a few young enthusiasts: Grégori Derangère as Frederic and Virginie Ledoyen (from Francois Ozon's "8 Women") as Camille. The incomparable Gerard Depardieu, the spiritual Yvan Attal (of "My wife is an actress") and versatile Peter Coyote (juggling, French, English and German here) are involved in the star story. <br /> <br /> There are many characters who come and go in this plot of a movie, and how it is learned is a skill-less skill that requires no analysis. Rappeneau is simply a genius. The story just builds on itself, one episode after another, or even overlapping events, but never confusing - it is the enjoyment of everything, somehow every detail is shown on the screen and we just kick it like a nice french dessert, literally so. There are excitement, tremors, tender moments and strenuous ominous escape, all playing before our eyes. <br /> <br /> From the Director's Note on the official Sony Pictures Classics website, Bon Voyage has indicated that Rappeneau is his most personal and successful work ever. The portrayal of Bordeaux in 1940 from memories of his childhood is very close to his heart and he worked and processed the writing for almost 3 years. "This film is a love work all around, the film and the crew that complement the directors' passion and a formidable writer with the writers along with the director and his son Julien - adaptation efforts by Gilles Marchand, Patrick Modiano and Jerome Tonnerre. Br /> <br /> Music by Gabriel Yared (varying in tone from his previous movie shows such as "The English Patient" or "Talented Mr. Ripley"), which provided a suitable theme that kept the pace and rhythm of the plot - almost like a quiet train, and reflecting on Adjani's Viviane's vibrant energy (even if she's tired), keep her going while she's in the look, always keeping high and attractive clothing, without looking back, let alone regret. <br /> <br /> Oh, don't forget the wonderfully translated, skilled captions by Ian Burley, who also did subtitles for movies in Italian: "Bread and Tulips" (2000) aka Pane e tulipani, "The Last K iss "(2001) aka L'ultimo bacio, and Tom Tykwer's" Heaven "(2002). <br /> <br /> If you find this dramatic battlefield too much, try Mrs Mäx Fäberböck's Aimée and Jaguar (1999, in German, based on a true story) with brilliant performances by Juliane Köhler as Aimée and Maria Schrader as Jaguar.
