If you've been waiting for years to see a movie you've heard on the grapevine, is it, of course, your expectations high? f ** k yes! But when this baby dropped me through a boy, I knew what f *** ed up visuals would grab my TV and twist my fragile mind. First, Karim Hussein is a film lover like us all on a diet of Argento / Fulci / lynch etc. Emergent. And it shows in this movie, but in a good way. Although I didn't really know what the hell was going on on my first watch of this gem, I was just amazed at the footage. The relief and, of course, the performances of everyone involved, Karim really had to believe he was going to push the boundaries in film production (which I trust he does) and that he would convince a hard work to convince the actors to do the same. ....... <br /> <br /> So what can I tell you about "subconscious cruelty"? Well, without spoiling it .... it's a deep insight into the human psyche with images of violent and sexual madness that lead to madness ... an unforgettable experience ..... <br /> <br /> Keep your eye on Karim Hussein. He can only do better things. <br /> <br /> I watch the full uncut print of subconscious cruelty on a dual disc DVD. of Infliction movies loaded with extras ..... Please note there is a censored Hong Kong release out there, avoid this version.
