This film is full of charming situations and healthy young people are easy to see, whether they wear clothes or not. The strong build up of his plot is maintained by Shakespeare's art. As Joseph Papp recovered in Central Park in the 1950s, Shakespeare's plots can be adapted to the ways and customs of the present. And so are the classic stories of cross-decoration and other mishaps that are used in such light-hearted comedies like Twelfth Night and a Midsummer Night and as you like it in the film. All the young actors and actresses do a good job of promoting the plot with their blocking and dialogue and costumes. And the idea of ​​a soccer match to bring things to a hint reminds me of Bend It Like Beckham, another charming upcoming movie.
