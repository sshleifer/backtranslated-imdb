Um .... a serious movie about troubled teenagers in Singapore, a country I don't know much about, but have the previous wrong impression that all the children are highly disciplined and controlled by their family and government. Well, I think I'm wrong, just like other cities / countries, they also have their upset teenagers who also lead the not so surprisingly rebellious way of life of drugs, battles, bad language and .... Many other clear signs of being a bad boy. The surprising part of this movie is not really about how these kids run to cause themselves and other problems, but rather the subtle gayness hidden behind their so loyalty between them. The connection between these "brothers" can very well arise from an unconscious gay trend within these boys. Although it is not uncommon for str8 guys to have very good friendships with each other, but to watch this movie carefully, it has to enter all sorts of gay film festivals and I will not be surprised that it can win many more awards this way !
