The one thing that can be said about RUNNING OUT OF TIME is that it is a very clever movie. It is interesting to note that the authors of the film are French, who can explain the film's "out of the norm" image, as it doesn't really fit in with what is commonly known as "Hong Kong Cinema" . <br /> <br /> The movie relates to a thief who plans revenge on certain criminal types with the help of an equally clever policeman. But first he has to convince the police to get together at his personal crusade, and so a series of games begins where the thief directs the policeman in his plan. <br /> <br /> Quite a clever movie. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed overview of this movie or full overview of other foreign films)
