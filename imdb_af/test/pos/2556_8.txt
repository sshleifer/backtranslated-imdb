A friend brought me this movie and initially I cried, the pass in the movie was so slow that it was initially boring. But the live shows were attractive, like watching. <br /> <br /> It just seems to be beautiful in the movie. The way the director dealt with the philosophy of life to reflect on reality was ashamed, but somehow overwhelming. It is like understanding the real life of a living person rather than watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Mr. Alejandro Polanco and Miss. Isamar Gonzales has done their roles so well that it tells us more about their own stories. Indeed, they used their real names in the movie.
