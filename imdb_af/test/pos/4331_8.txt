"Death Wish 3" retires Charles Bronson as retired Vigilante Paul Kersey, now retired. Right, for a long time Kersey is back in his old ways. But this time it's not just a few muggers at a time, it's a gang that has overthrown part of the city (New York, by the way.) This time its war, so Christmas hauls the big guns (literally) for this. The body counts its one rival anything Stallone or Schwarzenegger This movie is actually a bit of fun to watch, especially for some one liners and of course bad guys die, or are seriously injured in creative ways. It's always a good thing. The violence is not as personal in this. One, of course, is on a much larger scale, such as bombarding your victims from afar, rather than one on one fight. This movie is lighter in tone than the 1st 2, making it easier to watch. There is not much in it. movie, its more escape than anything. It's also sometimes cashy and pseudo-inspiring, but the screens fall flat. they had to leave the original "Death Wish" on their own without successors, but as it did not, they had to stop here. 8/10
