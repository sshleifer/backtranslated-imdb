This movie was pioneering in the former Soviet Union, as it was the first film to be released that contains a real sex scene. The movie can, however, be considered great for many reasons, and the least is the true, sharp depiction of disillusionment and pain in the family of a workers-Soviet family. I would definitely recommend it.
