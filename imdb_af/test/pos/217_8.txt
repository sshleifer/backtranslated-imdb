When I was young, I was a big fan of the Naked Gun movies, but recently I watched the show Police Sqaud! and I think it's good! Leslie Nielson's awesome, Alan North is cool, and who is the Reck Hamilton? But anyway, this is a goofy show. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame during the final credits. I think my favorite is when Norberg (not O.J.) enters the scene and he tries to fit in with the freezer. Classic! <br /> <br /> The only problem for me is that the cigarette tip gets very old (when Drebin shows a cigarette and asks someone, "Cigarette?" and the person answers, "Yes, I know.") think they used it too often. <br /> <br /> Good acting, good gags, good performance! <br /> <br /> 7/10
