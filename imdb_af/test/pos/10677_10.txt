I saw this movie in the early 70's when I was about 10 years old. old on TV. It was at school, and as I watched, I was so attracted to the whole idea of ​​the two astronauts going to do a mission to another undiscovered planet. I asked my mom if I could get the cassette record. She let me go. I wrapped the cord of the microphone around the channel button so that the microphone hung in front of the speaker. This movie is the first one I've ever given enough attention - and caring enough to record. (Just the sound - there were no video recorders at the time yet.) The plot will keep you on every word. Every minute of this movie. The end will hang your mind. After watching the journey to the Far Side of the Sun. You will have a long time about it in your mind. I repeated the sound recording for many years ... and I have seen it over and over in my mind. Then - maybe 15 years later .. when video recorder was common, and they sold tapes in stores. I always watched it ... but it never found. But when the internet came one day, I searched for it and bought it in a second. So. After about 30 years after I first saw it, I saw it again. WOW! ~ ~ It was spectacular! Just for reference. I had to watch it 50 times.
