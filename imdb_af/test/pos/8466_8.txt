There are several books that called it the earliest gay theater. I don't really see it as gay in homosexual sense, but then two men dancing in what must be the world's first film music see its appeal. <br /> <br /> There were several earlier comments on this film that rejected any homosexual overtones. What those who can quickly release this movie than just silly and an experiment done late at night after too many drinks. Well, I've heard that story before. <br /> <br /> This movie is of interest as a strange and if people want to consider it, it's the first gay movie. Better than the depressed 1919 Unlike the other.
