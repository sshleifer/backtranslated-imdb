I read every adventure of Asterix and Obelix at least 5 times and I am also a fan of Les Nuls and Les Robins des Bois and Jamel. So I expected a lot from this movie. And I finally got satisfied. Unlike the first adaptation of Asterix on the big screen (Astérix et Obélix contre Cesar), which was not a real success, besides the appearance of Laetitia Casta, this one really takes the spirit of the cartoon (and we get it beautiful Monica Bellucci). In the first movie, the director became too realistic about the time the story was set, killing the whole spirit that Asterix made. In this one, all the clothes, the way of talking and everything is identical to Goscinny's and Uderzo's work ... more, it actually goes to the original story with the disadvantage that we know just about everything is going to happen, but Alain Chabat has us given some surprises at the end. I really enjoyed that movie, and every time the first sign of boredom began to appear, Jamel came in and let's be crazy. This movie is a great mix of all the kind of humor I really like, and even if it is too much, I can't help but keep it. So, if you like Asterix and the humor of all those young talents who started out in "Nulle part Ailleurs" (a French mix of evening show and SNL), watch this movie.
