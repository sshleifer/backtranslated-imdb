Haggard is in Bam Margera's home town of Westchester PA, a semi-true story about the life of Ryan Dunn and his friends Falcone and Vallo. <br /> <br /> Dunn was dumped by his 2-year-old girlfriend, Glauren, who now sees a beer, long-haired metal head named "Hellboy" and that is Dunn insane with jealousy. <br /> <br /> In a desperate effort to find out the truth about what is going on between Glauren and Hellboy, Dunn pays his friends Vallo and Falcone to break into her home and deliver evidence of the matter, with some disastrous results for all concerned! I found this movie very funny, maybe partly because I'm a total Jackass and CKY fan. And it should be said that much of the humor is likely to be lost on those who have no prior knowledge of Margera's crazy brand of comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie features a lot of interest for skaters, especially the skateboarding como appearance, Tony Hawk as police officer. There are also cameos from Bucky Lasek, Brandon Novak, Jason Ellis and Bam's long-suffering parents, April and Phil. <br /> <br /> The DVD extras include music videos from CKY (with Bam's brother Jess on drums), and Bam's favorite band, HIM (Bam's character in the movie has HIM foreman Ville Called Vallo). There is also a documentary and a "too hot for jackass" shooting. In short, as I said earlier, this movie will be of great importance to skaters and Jackass / CKY fans, but I feel that Margera and fellow have made a great effort with 'Haggard' and I for one, thoroughly enjoyed it .
