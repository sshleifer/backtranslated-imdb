It's a wonderful new movie that still appears in my country's bioscope. His director, Calabrian Gianni Amelio, is, in my humble performance, perhaps the only contemporary Italian director, along with Nanni Moretti, who is deserved to be named great (apart from the old masters who are still around and sometimes flashing). It is one of my biggest regrets that today's Italian theater has been bad since the mid-1970s, mainly due to a serious lack of funding and care for new talent, something that can be transferred to most countries and what Italy is one of the most static industrialized countries of our time production mode (both in an industrial and cultural sense) ... unlike, say, China. And this is exactly the subject of Amelio's latest film. Few directors can talk to me about the real, current state of my country and the world like Amelio can, but its pictures also have precious timelessness and universality. And for those who are already worried that they may be slow, discreet and worthy - be assured: Of those I have seen, they are definitely not, at least if you are accustomed to the European cinema. <br /> The basic overview: Vincenzo Buonavolontà is a technician at an out-of-date steel mill somewhere in Italy, probably the North. He is played by Sergio Castellitto, one of Italy's most versatile and talented actors today. When a large Chinese steel company bought from the Italian steel mill's industrial machinery, Vincenzo, who is struggling to understand himself with the non-Italian speaking Chinese director, tried to tell him that the machine was defective and that the switch it must replace, an element it works to build itself. He warns them that it cannot have very dangerous consequences. Meanwhile, a young Chinese woman named Liu Hua interprets the two men, but seems struggling to find enough translations for some of Vincenzo's technical jargon. The Italian eventually loses his patience with her, who virtually pushes her and asks her to give him the Chinese-Italian dictionary so that he can do the translation. <br /> <br /> Despite Vincenzo's warnings, he found the next morning that the Chinese factory director and his employees had returned to their own country while not obeying his advice on the adequate use of the industrial machine. Vincenzo, which is equipped with its great integrity, suggests China. And here begins an endless fascinating road movie by China, a very current 21st century Odyssey by the Asian Giant. The latter Marco Polo's quest for the secrets of the mysterious nation? Not quite. As in all Amelio's movies, the journey itself becomes much more important than whether its ultimate "mission" is performed or not. In fact, the way the point is literally brought home, not without a hint of humor, is a beautiful, gripping paradox and irony that made my eyes smile while simultaneously smiling. The spectator is secretly admitted that Vincenzo's journey was ultimately useless, but he himself did not know it and went home as a happy man, an innocent man. At least, you figure, he's happy. Similar. <br /> <br /> The voyages that Amelio's characters begin to uproot and strip them into their bare human necessities. They are temporarily without name, status or someone to submit a word to them. These Theo Angelopoulos-like themes are also explored in Lamerica, actually my favorite Amelio movie, followed by La Stella che non c'è in order of personal preference. In the 1994 movie Lamerica, two Italian racketeers travel to Albania to do business. Just like Vincenzo they want to go there, do what they have to do and then go back home. Instead, one of these two Italians accidentally ends up on an almost Homeric journey through this devastated land just after the fall of Communism. <br /> <br /> But let's go back to La Stella che non c'è: once Vincenzo is in China, he predictably discovered that the seemingly "simple" task to transfer the conversion to his new owner, nothing but straight ahead. The piece of machinery's new place is apparently almost impossible to determine, unless it starts on a difficult journey through China. When he comes to Liu Hua, the young interpreter has now abused as a librarian. He tried to talk to her, but she reacted in a hostile way and informed him that she had lost her as an interpreter. in Italy. Played by relative newcomer Ling Tai, Liu Hua soon becomes a Virgil for Vincenzo's Dante when she unwillingly figures out that she can do worse than serve as a guide and interpreter for Italian on his journey (of course for a consistent amount of cash) . This young Chinese actress may not have the beauty of Ziyi Zhang, or the movie star glamor of Gong Li, but her beautiful, expressive and beautiful face boasts a combination of challenging power, intelligence, dignity and cruel humor that makes her traits difficult. will make. to forget when you saw the movie. In addition, she and Castellitto have wonderful emotional chemistry as co-stars. <br /> <br /> Amelio weaves dramas that are serious, poetic, mythical, post-neo-realistic and humorous all at once, while maintaining a heartwarming. ability to investigate the brief essence of humanity in everyday, everyday circumstances. Hiding a documentary natural nature that actually captures a thoughtful tapestry of faces and places, a view that also manages to capture cinematography of breathtaking beauty. Photography here is functional but beautiful, such as a movie on the move in an industrial and emotional desert. <br /> <br /> Amelio's eye-catching eye is an adult, disillusioned one, but never a cynical or misanthropic one. . The masterly camera angles also often give a sense of Vincenzo's alienation in the eyes of the Chinese, bringing a sense of objectivity and cultural impartiality that is scarce in movies about a 'famous' Westerner who is an unknown' Explore Western country. I can't recommend this movie enough.
