A bit 'the movie in the movie' case, or if the theme is a virtual game here, what is the reality or even more frightening what reality is "real". Like any Cronenberg there are organic things like the pod wonderful idea: the organic gun, a weapon made of bones and tissues that shoot the teeth. If there are a few slower moments, the sets, designs and ideas are there with a few thoughts of revolution. Can't be kept, because the way the movie happens is quite unusual and sometimes disturbing, but it's definitely worth it.
