This is one of my favorite movies, dating back to my childhood. In the remote wilderness of Siberia at the beginning of the century, a small community is agitated when an extremely cold winter forces two tens of mountains to seek food and to go out on the outskirts. In this atmosphere, we are introduced to Avakum, a recluse who comes to the wild, while coming to town to sell his annual fishing to Boris, she's near and rather just a friend in town who's a shop. At Boris's request, Avakum accompanies his friend's arrogant son, Ivan, on the hunt for the threatening tigers. Personal accident and storms flash because the older, more experienced Avakum criticizes Ivan's amateur methods, a meeting also noticed by the other members of the hunt. On the second day, the hunters see their prey and chase. In a thick wood, Ivan wound one of the tigers, who then attacked the unfortunate man. Avakum, as Ivan touches the furious beast, but unfortunately hits Ivan. He'll kill the tiger if it flies. The other hunters arrive at the scene, suspicious. <br /> <br /> Back in town, the doctor works to rescue the wounded Ivan. Avakum tries to leave town, but is confronted by Ivan's friends. However, the staircase brushes them off and speeds up with his dog-bred sled. The young villagers swore to him that he would come to him when Ivan died, which he did later, but before he died, it explained to his father that it was an accident. Old Boris, after learning from his good friend, walked out of town, set up the "lynch mob" event and went to Avakum to find him and fix things. And so the main story begins. <br /> <br /> A simple movie, leading to the conflict of man and civilization towards nature, mainly Avakum's struggle to survive alone in the desert. The winter landscape is very well filmed. Perhaps the strongest element in the movie is the soundtrack by Jimmie Haskell. Very sentimental and enticing, the main theme that reminds Albinoni's Adagio. Other movements reflect Russian styles, as well as some folk-type songs. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not available to buy, which is rather shy. The copy I own, signed off TV about twenty years ago, slowly deteriorating. This movie is a must see for those who appreciate it, if they can find it. 8/10
