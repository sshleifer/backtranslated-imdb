Sometimes it is difficult to define what separates a successful, wonderful comedy from one falling flat. In this case, the promised plot is about a spoiled rich girl who is shy to take away her cousins ​​from the Greenwich Village 'Bohemian' they are raising, just to fall for him, not promising. And nothing in the director Leigh Jason's filmography suggests he was a great talent. And yet he had to be responsible for creating a relaxed, happy atmosphere on the set that was faithfully recorded on film. <br /> <br /> He also had the good sense to throw this movie well. One small mistake is Miriam Hopkins in a part that Ginger Rogers would have been perfect. Hopkins is effective, but brittle, without the warmth and sexuality Rogers would have had. She is further obstructed by some bizarre, long and sooty false eyelashes that are sometimes distracted. But a very young and very attractive Ray Milland couldn't be better in an exciting, unobtrusive comic show of great charm. <br /> <br /> And better than that, especially for New York residents, the Hollywood portrayal of Greenwich Village was in 1937. Although totally synthetic and idealized, it remains recognizable by a contemporary viewer. Art Director Van Nest Polglase has created a lovely bunch of mews apartments and put a shared backyard. This is the perfect backdrop for the photos of artists, aspirations, smart-alecks and wannabes. The best part of the supporting role-play is Guinn Williams, who brings sweet and light to his role as a priest-sculptor dressmaker, representing the self-invention and fluidity (sexual and otherwise) of life in the village. Even more refreshing are Betty Philson and Marianna Strelby who play the little girls. Plain, intelligent and full of humor, these girls look like real people and are nothing like the professional children's actors of the time. <br /> <br /> Of special interest are some memorable comic set pieces: Ray Milland's vacuum cleaner demonstration to a woman with a crying baby is played with more spontaneity than one expects (the baby and she distortion is wonderful found moments and a fake domestic play in a shopping mall that turns into a free It is also fun. The movie slows down with a straightforward conservation test and never gets on the right track when the action moves to Long Island, but this movie is still worth a look.
