Closet land is not in happy movie. It is also not linked to any social realism. Maybe it's his strength. The distance of specific time and nations strengthens the message, makes it more powerful and rejects the burden of nationalism and propaganda that you often feel in movies made to criticize nations as opposed to their own (of course, I am mainly speaking of the US propaganda in some commercial film). <br /> <br /> Little caste land is so much more than a message. It is a film of pure, surreal beauty, filled with the same clean, clinical form you find in 1984 and it is equal. <br /> <br /> I've been a big fan of Alan Rickman, the man. With the golden sarcasm (and I might add, the irreconcilable sex appeal ;-)). The exhibition between him and Madeleine Stowe is brilliant. Every time I see him, it looks like he's a character, even nastier than the last one. <br /> <br /> But, enough delicacy. The movie is not in action. I don't want to crash any cars, but I want something to happen, except pure talk. After an hour I became very tired of the interrogation room, the predictable actions and more than anything I wanted, a more complex view of everything, the world, the early lives of the characters and the rest of the missing framework . For some people a good contact is. For me, something less positive. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Closet Land is a movie worth it, it's time to be ready to make a trip into the abyss of human nature. <br /> <br /> And of course for us who really love the Always Evil Alan Rickman.
