Episode No. thirteen of the imaginative (excuse for the incredible gay terminology) "Supernatural" TV series moves Sam and Dean Winchester to Missouri where they are called in by an old dean flame to investigate a series of mysterious killings in their small town. . As it turns out, a large bakkie with an invisible driver is remote African Americans on a deserted road. While the Dean is trying to restore his past love affair, more villages become people like a roadblock. The cause appears to be due to a previous racial incidence in the 60s, leaving a frustrated redhead in ghostly limbo, killing black motorists. "Route 666" is another good installment (which is not uncommon, I noticed) that contains some notable aspects that relate to the main characters such as the Dean being laid. Sam admitted leaving college. killer truck does not appear to be the most scary thing in the world, but for an hour-long show it's good. Not a fantastic episode, but a solid concept with more horror movie references.
