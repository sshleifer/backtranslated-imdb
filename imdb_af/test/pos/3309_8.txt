Enjoyable movie that offers romance, women's psychodrama, workplace sexual harassment, adultery and fashion. That's all there. Typical characters in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the regular long-time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be so, because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the entry-level ambitious employee who is determined to come to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives are the subplot. <br /> <br /> The movie wardrobe is great, but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hair stylist that a little bit of you will do! "The amount of Brylcream in Stephen Boyd's hair is sometimes distracting. His character's relationship with Lange's character was never fully developed, which I found disappointing. Overall, the movie is enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
