I think this movie is just summarized. See it and you'll find out why. The actions of the main character, John Keem, are really bad and he has no screen charisma whatsoever. It is very funny because of this thought, and it is the end where Keem controls the bad man, despite being unarmed and surrendered. Brilliant!
