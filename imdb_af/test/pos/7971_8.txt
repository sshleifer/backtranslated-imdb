A great action movie I've ever seen. This was the first expression I expressed after watching it twice on local TV in my country, Indonesia. A combination of a constant shooting and a good fighting choreography played well by David Bradley. He was also above "American Samurai". His martial arts skill was above average. He managed to make the fight shots beautiful. Not just punching and kicking like most martial artists in their movies. David Bradley can use all the martial arts techniques, such as throwing, breaking and kicking. Many Recommended for Action Fans. I tried to search for the DVD, but I still can't find it in my town. Anyone can help me?
