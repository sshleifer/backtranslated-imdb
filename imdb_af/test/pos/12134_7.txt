Has anyone ever read or heard the comments of Scorsese or David Chase (Soprano's Exec. Producer) about "Death Collector / Family Enforcer"? I bought the DVD after I didn't see it on the cable for a while (like 20 years), but so far I've seen Goodfellas and the whole of Sopranos. In retrospect, both guys must have seen the death collector / family persecutor and have absorbed the fragrance. Perhaps they inspired the tone for their masterpieces, both the polar opposite of the romantic Godfather trilogy. To be a Jerseyman, it is interesting to see how the Jersey pasture has evolved since the mid-70's. It is not the marshy dump it used to be, although a body appears in a local waterway. It's also a bitter sweat to see a newly established World Trade Center across the river in the opening and closing scene. Who could think?
