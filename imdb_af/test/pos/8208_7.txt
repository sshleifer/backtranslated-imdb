Following the advice of a friend, I found myself this movie. I love computers in general - so why a 1995 movie about identity theft on the internet could not be left unseen. I had bad echoes about it, but in the end I wasn't so disappointed: the story, although classic, was a bit interesting and had to be back in the days when it was released in the theaters. I was surprised when I figured out that, unlike what we usually see, computer-driven actions are somehow realistic, using Windows 3.x and regular computers. The storytelling is median and does not save the viewer. The ending is typically American. The actors' performance is ok worldwide. Sandra Bullock usually makes me "oh my god why me" a way to act, but this time she seems to have controlled herself. I would recommend the movie.
