This is quite an entertaining B-movie in the Universal Horror series featuring Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's Monster. The plot revolves around Dracula (John Carradine) and wolfman Talry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr), who visit a revolutionary doctor separately. They ask him if they can be healed, and the doctor tries to devise a way for everyone. Underneath the doctor's castle they found Frankenstein's monster buried in mud (this is apparently a reference to the previous movie in the Frankenstein series). <br /> <br /> Of course, if things went as planned, the movie would have been incredibly bored. Instead, Dracula cannot suppress his appetite, and the doctor eventually becomes infected with vampirism by a blood transfusion. As a semi-vampire, the doctor goes crazy and awakens Frankenstein's Monster. As with all the Universal Horror series, the end is completely unsatisfactory. A beautiful woman with a hunchback, one of the doctors two assistants, has a particularly gruesome end. Plus, you just have to be sorry for Frankenstein's Monster in this movie. He is awake for about two minutes, kills one police officer, and then another building (what is the fifth?) Falls on top of him and is consumed by flames. It is also a pity that the great character created in The Wolf Man (1941), Larry Talbot, is really being reduced here. People underestimate the film and Chaney's performance in it. Here he will be rightly criticized as wood. All in all, it's just a fun movie on just 68 minutes. A good waste of time. 10/07.
