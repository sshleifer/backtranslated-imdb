These bittersweet cuts of magical realism have replaced a checkered production history (director / writer) and thought of the box, but it is a helluva film. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are pre-teens brothers whose shaky mom (Lorraine Bracco) comes up with a moderate alcoholic (Adam Baldwin). Baldwin physically abuses Mazzello during his drinking disorders and manipulates him to remain silent about his situation. But when Wood Cotton is on what happens, the boys put their heads together and make a fantastic solution to Mazzello's devastating dilemma. <br /> <br /> I love movies that mix fantasy and dark reality. They are seldom successful financially ("Lawn Dogs" is a similar example), but they are usually original and intriguing. <br /> <br /> The drunk Baldwin is shot from a low child's perspective and his head is deliberately walked. under the top of the frame. This device allows us to judge it purely by its actions and as a complete physical animal. Both Wood and Mazzello are excellent, and they effortlessly pull them into their dark, frightening world. <br /> <br /> The title "radio kite" is a small red wagon child carrying their belongings. Here it transports a dream. <br /> <br /> Very interesting stuff.
