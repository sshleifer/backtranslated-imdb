For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films, he is still in the best shape and has a valuable experience. Okay, you don't have to read any further. <br /> <br /> I think most readers are older than the two main players of this photo, so I must say Ponyo is not so much a family movie as a chance to remember the feelings of a small child : Discovering the world the way you wanted it, setting up your own rules and exhilarating enthusiasm for the first time doing things on your own. Ponyo goes away from many of the issues that age movies are facing. It never condemns, all the characters have good true hearts and credible problems. <br /> <br /> The two main characters can be two of the most credible children I've ever seen on the screen. They are not simply, arrogant or naive, just curious, enthusiastic and learning the world's ways. They are so easy to love, but even easier to identify. Many films consider children from outside, as the adult looks at a world that can only enter a child. Ponyo brings everyone back to the world. In Ponyo, there is the first time to learn and choose what you care for most, observing the film with high appreciation. It is worth remembering to feel it again.
