Luis Bunuel has always been a filmmaker whose work was unclear to me. My first experience with him was The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeosie, often regarded as his greatest work, with which I became so frustrated and bored that I eventually ended the band. Likewise, Belle de Jour, who is almost certainly his best-known film and is also widely regarded as one of his many masterpieces, doesn't interest me much. I didn't hate it as I did Discreet, but I didn't like it. Third, I saw L'Age d'Or. Eventually I got somewhere. Fourth, Los Olvidados, also good. Nevertheless, L'Age d'Or and Los Olvidados did not break away from me either. Great movies but not masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Nazarin is my fifth Bunuel, and I just love it a little more than the other two. It's about a priest from Spain who is now in Mexico, who refuses to live in the luxury of most priests. He wants to be more like Jesus, making the softest life possible. He is also willing to forgive everyone for anything, and to suffer without protest. I'm pretty sure Bunuel doesn't sympathize with the character, and sees him as rather self-righteous. However, I just accept that because of my knowledge of the director, whose most famous quote is "thank you, I am still an atheist," he allegedly said in an interview on this great film (I get this information from John Baxter book about Bunuel, if you are interested). The interviewer who dragged the words of Bunuel's mouth had to confuse him with Nazarine. One who was more inclined to believe in religious beliefs, who also knew nothing of Bunuel, could see the priest as a heroic figure. This is especially true if the viewer has his / her own criticism of organized religion. The priest may be a little fair, but he seems to be basically a good man. When he has a violent prostitute in his room to protect her (and presumably to save her soul), people are beginning to find out and accept that their relationship is sexual. His superiors accept the same and punish him for that. Later he suffered even worse punishment from clergymen.
