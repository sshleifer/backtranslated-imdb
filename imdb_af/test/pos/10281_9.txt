Beautiful, original, beautiful film. The acting is wonderful, the settings and decades are excellent (Paris at its best - but then the real Paris, not the well-known institutions) and the music will do too. A brilliant story, very detailed, I just love. <br /> <br /> The best French movie I've seen (and the French film is very good)!
