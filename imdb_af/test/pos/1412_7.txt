Johnny Crawford is wonderful in this movie of a troubled teenager who comes into a generation who was in the midst of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. Billy Graham does a great job of portraying life in this sweet, sometimes weird, but totally sincere. He gives us a glimpse of not only the social scene, but gives good, firm advice that is today stunned by morality, decisions, generation gap, teen dating (some of the statistics given in this movie. statistics). Just to see Billy in his younger days is worth seeing. It's a fantastic movie. It made me realize that human nature does not change, although hair, fashion and language can change, people still struggle with the same problems they have been struggling for thousands of years.
