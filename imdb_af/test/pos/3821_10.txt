"Think like a Dinosaur" was a well-produced and performed show of the -Outerlimits series. The actor (Enrico Colantoni and Michael Burr) plays impressive stuff and convincing lead actor. You can actually identify with him and his "introspective" feelings about what to do with the girl he fell for (because he is alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels hopeless until Kamala with a scam to his life fears carrying out the task of being transported, consolidating her and letting her know it will be all right, which is ultimately a deception to them. More such a thing is bad and she (prototype) comes back ... And her ( clone) is sent to the other resident planet, although the -Dino and Micheal should not yet find it, it is up to Michael to kill her or make her live, but what happened to him before he met her (kamala), was very related to what happened to his wife, his wife died, this show confessed irregularity and grief by most of it ... about what had to be done and you stuck with the 50/50 of what is right about wr g. So, the "balance" equation is solely there and. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Recommend to watch this show.
