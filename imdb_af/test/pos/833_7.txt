After seeing Unsaved 2, I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine. <br /> <br /> The Shepherd: Border patrol is a decent movie (not Van Damme's best, but certainly not his worst.) There are some bad performances by VD's supporting role, but it makes sense . <br /> <br /> The storyline and plot have been done before, so it's nothing new. I mean this is Van Damme. We don't really expect much from a wonderful plot? So we can talk about what we all want anyway: the fight. <br /> <br /> Without giving away anything, I thought how the battles were shot and shot, well done, better than some of VD's recent movies like Second in Command, in which the entire end fails is. With the Florentines behind the camera, and if you saw Unseen 2, it seems he is fighting how to fight and enjoy it. Some of the battles in The Shepherd have reminded me of VD's older things we all want to see. The battles were good, and I said a few times aloud. But I was hoping for just a little more consideration of how well I thought unchallenged 2 was. <br /> <br /> Something I found was VD's daughter in the movie, I thought "wow she's kinda hot" is coming out to find out, his Bianca Van Varenberg, JC's real daughter. I've never seen her before, so it was a nice treat. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is not bad. Yes, the story has been done before, but at least JC tried to make a good movie. Next time, add more hand combat! I think he still has what it takes to do another big budget movie ... his acting has improved since he did DTVs and he's really in good shape at 47. I don't know about you, but I is one of those who think most of its DTVs are actually good, with the exception of Derailed. All he has to do is get back into the blood-form and make a martial arts movie ... and I think people will respond well, even if he is not jet Li. This movie is definitely worth it. =)
