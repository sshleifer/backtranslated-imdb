Human traffic is an average weekend view for a group of friends. It's a view of their lives (and thoughts) that will show you how this group of friends are related. There are many moments that everyone can link to, such as being out of your skull at parties, and talking dirty to strangers. The characters are all you can relate to and they are credible in the roles they play in the movie. The situations in which they are involved are all situations we have all found ourselves in, and this is where this film succeeds. The topics of sex and drugs are handled excellently, as they do not interfere with the characters' relationships with one another. The story to the movie is not everything, but it is not a criticism. It's a movie about people. It's a well-written film, with a soundtrack to die. D.J's Pete Tong compiled an excellent selection of tracks for this file. It's all about making this one of the best movies I've seen in 1999. After watching this movie, I felt like I was the festival this weekend. Fantastic Movie!
