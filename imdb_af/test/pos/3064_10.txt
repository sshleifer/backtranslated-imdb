Mel Brooks really surprised him with this hilarious uprising of the Robin Hood story. The role play is perfect, and Cary Elwes does a good job for his role. In my personal opinion (apart from being a Cary Elwes fan), this movie is the best and funniest thing I've ever seen! It will make you laugh every time you see it!
