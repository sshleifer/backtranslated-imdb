Everything about "Choose Connor" was loaded, especially the script and the very skilled work done by the 21-year-old director, writer, manufacturer Luke Eberl. . . a talented young man from whom great things can be expected. All the plays were credible, the dialogue smart, the theme important. Loved this! <br /> <br /> Watched it at the 2007 Woodstock Film Festival, where it was screened twice and completely exceeded audiences. It's more than a forthcoming movie. This child learns a hard, heartbreaking lesson on trust, politics and the system. How it really works to customize the personal agendas of those in powerful positions. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone with a working brain.
