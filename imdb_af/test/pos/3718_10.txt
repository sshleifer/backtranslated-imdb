This is an example of what movie school lecturers will call a good debut film. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, inexpensive to shoot, guerrilla film-making, no sets (just buildings not usable) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Also, even the black and white film stock was a genius stroke, probably chosen for its low cost rather than film effect, but it worked. <br /> <br /> Reno was wonderful like the Brute. Everyone's actions were brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and there were no broken pieces to distract you. A sharp, well-crafted, cost-effective budget film. <br /> <br /> Released in 1983, it would be made just before the art of big-budget action shows were refined by the Hollywood movie car. , and making movies was more exclusive and therefore more difficult and needed for the right people in the right places than today's internet-enabled world. That's why Luc Besson had to do a lot of negotiations and promises to achieve this result, which makes the end product increasingly remarkable. <br /> <br /> But then the French film industry has always maintained an excellent reputation (yes, I know Luc Besson is Belgian, but the film is a French production) and is the source of many Hollywood remakes. <br /> <br /> If I have one criticism, it is that the cover photo on the DVD (and possibly the original sales poster) bears no resemblance to the movie whatsoever and appears to be a bit ashamed rather than representative of any of to be the movi. e themes - at first glance it seems to be a man in post-apocalyptic armor on a swing, but at second inspection a man in armor with a lance on an office chair with his legs on a desk in 'confident posture. It never happens in the movie once. <br /> <br /> It's black-and-white movie inventory, zero dialogue, physical plays, tight scenes and brilliant actors. This movie is worth adding to your private movie collection. A wonderful movie.
