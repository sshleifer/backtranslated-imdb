You know, this movie reminds me so much of so many people I know. I think that's why I loved this movie so much. I just laughed on the floor because it felt such a serious and documentation, but the dialogue is so hilarious that you can't help but have a good time. Actually, the movie about these crazy dog ​​owners competing in a big dog program is to see who is the best of the best. Where it seems to be the dogs that take this competition seriously, it seems that the owners are just as crazy. Megan, one of the dog owners, goes to the hotel manager almost serial psycho killer because she can't find the special little toy for her dog. <br /> <br /> There's another couple just fantastic, Gerry and Cookie. , this full nerd and attractive woman who loves as much. In the beginning of the movie, Gerry described how many cookies boyfriends had. Throughout the film, her "lovers" see her and even beat her before Gerry! It was just fun and fun to see Gerry's body. This whole movie is just a hoot, and you can't stop the recognizable faces that continue to blow up. It's a good movie, it's just fun to watch, I highly recommend it! Now I have to find a good way to show it to my friends who are like these couples to see the mirror image of themselves. : D <br /> <br /> 8/10
