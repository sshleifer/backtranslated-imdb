I've seen a different version than the first person in the user comment section. <br /> <br /> It's really good ... Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are good together. Val Kilmer's character is much like he was in the novel, but the emphasis is on Gus and Call and the Comanches. We also see what happened to Call and Newt's mother. I won't spoil it, but it gives a lot of insight into the character of Call. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a really convincing job. Steve Zahn had the biggest challenge, I thought, to follow Robert Duvall! There is a lot of action, humor, tragedy. It has something for everyone. I can't wait until it comes out, my family is jealous. I have to see it early!
