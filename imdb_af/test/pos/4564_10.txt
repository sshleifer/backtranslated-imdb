See it, people - "DK3" is more challenging, innovative and clever than its predecessor. Challenging - its levels are ridiculously difficult for a considerable amount of time. One particularly difficult level is called 'Lightning Lookout', in which you can touch at any given time. Innovative - it opened many doors. Sorry, the SNES didn't die out long after this title. And smart - the shallow names range from brand-to-words ("Lake Orangatanga") to greasy references that the game's target audience won't come for many years. <br /> <br /> What irritates me about most people's criticism of this game comes down to two words: Kiddy Kong. He is a worthy "small" successor to Diddy Kong, and definitely doesn't deserve "that delayed monkey." "DK3" will remain a classic until the end of the day.
