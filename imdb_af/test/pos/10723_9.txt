Life went well for the New York City advertising artist, Ted Kramer. He had a good job and a loving wife. No, actually, his wife wasn't so fond of it, because when Ted came home late that night, his wife, Joanna, packed a pack and came out. He tried to stop her, but she just got into the lift and out of Ted's life. Well, now he has to keep in mind, besides his work, the house as well as their 6-year-old son, Billy. Ted assured his boss that his wife's departure would not affect his performance in any way. However, this affected his performance as a father. He blew up when Billy hit his client's art! Well, some time later, Ted and Billy receive a letter from Joanna, and it was clear from her letter that she didn't return. Ted was upset. Well, he was late at work on Billy's birthday, which hurt Billy. <br /> <br /> One day, Ted was working and his boss shouted because he missed a very important client meeting. When he got home, he yelled at Billy for the potato at dinner. Then he really told Billy Billy that the breakup between him and Joanna might be his fault, not Billy's; Ted invited a good friend that night, Phyllis Bernard, and Billy got his first look at a naked woman. When Ted took Billy to the park the next day, he fell off the jungle and faced his toy plane. Ted literally ran to the hospital where they had to administer stitches. Then, life for Ted began to take a downward spiral. Then one day he got a call from someone other than Joanna from the blue! They met in a corner cafe. First they had a pleasant conversation, but then Joanna told him that she had come back to fetch her son and take her with her. Ted had nothing of it and stormed out. Well, life got worse for Ted when his boss, Jim O'Connor, pulled him out for lunch and fired him suddenly. Not only that, but Joanna decided to arrest Billy, and without a job, Ted didn't have a chance in hell to win. He hired himself a lawyer, John Shaunessy, who paid a nice penny: $ 15,000 exact change. And that's when they win. <br /> <br /> Ted also found a new job. This was actually a step away from what he had to do with a substantial cut in salary, but he accepted with great determination. Eventually, the court date, January 9, 1980, arrived. Judge Atkins chaired. Joanna stood and Shaunessy asked her why she had left Ted and about her other relationships and how they were failures. The next day Ted went out and Joanna's lawyer really grilled him like a cheeseburger. Ted's good friend, Margaret also held the booth and she didn't really matter. Well, the judge took time to think it over and sure enough, Shaunessy told Ted one day that he had lost. Joanna had exclusive supervision of Billy. How typical! Always regulate in favor of the mother. Well, Ted and Billy were just devastated by the farewell of manners. They had a tearful goodbye when suddenly suddenly stopped. She and Ted talked a bit and well, rather than just ending, let me assure everyone everything is fine for everyone! <br /> <br /> It was a very good movie. Dustin Hoffman was very good. He earned that academy award. I also saw him in Hook, Meet the Fockers and Rain Man, for which he also won an Oscar. Meryl Streep was good. She also received an Oscar. Justin Henry was also good, so where was his appointment? I think the Academy had a rule to give Oscars to children, but the rule was lifted when Haley Joel Osment met. This movie has great drama, light comedy and is very subtle. It's a good job to keep your attention. The other night I watched Rain Rain Man on TCM, and it came after that and I just couldn't help but watch. And that's what you have to do. If you like Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep or movies of this genre, I recommend Kramer vs. Kramer on! A gripping film about the pangs of two divorced parents fighting over their child. I like Ted's little speech about the rule in favor of mothers. What was sex with good parents? Actually, that's how they have the child. But seriously, he's right. Why always rule in favor of the mother because she is a woman? Also in the movie, George Coe, Howard Duff, who died in 1990, and Howland Chamberlain who died in 1984. Watch an upcoming JoBeth Williams in the nudity in the gangway. Anyway, see Kramer vs Kramer today! Good movie !! <br /> <br /> -
