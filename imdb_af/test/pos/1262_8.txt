It was a good movie for just 67 minutes. There was an aspect of film noir contained in this movie and I am pleased that Nolan has chosen to film it in black and white. The plot is simple but entertaining that keeps you engaged. Even the dialogue was good with the acting. It reminded me of what would happen in Memento by not being in chronological order. I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb taught him, for example, saying "everyone has a box" that he brings in his personal stuff. Also on the author's door was the batman logo that was ironic because Christopher Nolan would later target Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, two other big movies. There is finally a big twist that I won't spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, though I have similar what would happen if Cobb gave the young man D Lloyd's credit card. I also liked how the author had one of my favorite philosophical books a copy of The Republic at Plato. It's definitely a movie that you have to watch more than once to get the fullest aspect, plus it's just an hour long. There is also a round aspect to it by ending where it started, what I thought was pretty brilliant.
