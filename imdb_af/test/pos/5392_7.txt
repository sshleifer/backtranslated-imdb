Gary Cooper and an officer change identities as they both agree Cooper would be more effective against the criminals. What is noteworthy in this movie is the costumes, both the marshal's and Steve Cochran's, which is the bad guy. Cochran wears his guns back, probably to cross. The movie is very exciting with a show featuring Wild Bill Hickok. Ruth Roman, very beautiful looks, is the fiance's fiancee. There is a lot of action, never a dull moment, but you have to concentrate, because the story is a bit complicated. Good entertainment.
