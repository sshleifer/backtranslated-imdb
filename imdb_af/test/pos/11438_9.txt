This movie has never been seen - the only reason I can enjoy it again is from a slightly exhausted VHS copy I made when the movie was shown here in England here in 1991. <br /> <br /> Obviously, an ensemble cast enjoys itself and is reflected in the viewer. A razor-sharp script helps things together, and once you've seen it, you'll want to see it over and over again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Rogers is the 'star' but everyone contributes to a great movie, with a great jazz soundtrack to start. There are emotional moments during the film, but never to sickly sweet sentimentalism - these are guys on the journey of a lifetime, and they bring the excitement to the fore. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if you can actually get to see it.
