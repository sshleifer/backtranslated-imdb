Who plays the role of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene, does a wonderful job. He apparently received no credits. Too bad. <br /> <br /> All the Dead End Kids are doing their job beautifully in this 1939 entry. It's strange to see them in a Western environment with their Brooklyn accents (I think it should be Bowery). They even have swimming capabilities. <br /> <br /> I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this box / love / crime story. My favorite is now in the battle scene near the end of the movie. Busby Berkeley shows his dance film expertise when John Garfield shifts his feet and as we watch the camera move to his face. I will not give away why or when, but the appearance of his face at that time probably brought the audience in 1939 to the theaters. <br /> <br /> Some will think John Garfield looks much like Frank Sinatra in many scenes. Just his face. Frank didn't actually make movies, so maybe Frank looks like John. The boxer named Smith in the movie looks like a clone of Ed Begley, Jr. <br /> <br /> Now I have to tell you something that is not a spoiler, but when you watch the movie, Grandma's hands look. May Robson do her part well. She has hands that wander a bit. In a scene where she and a crowd in the boxing room of the boxer (John Garfield) are watching, look at the illuminated John Garfield while wearing only his suitcases. <br /> <br /> A great end. Many wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> Best line can be at the petrol station, "... eight liters, that's a dollar twenty-eight ..." Tom Willett
