Another goes around with the monkey king going to the west .... kind of. <br /> <br /> Starting in the middle of an action, the movie just goes off the first frame. <br /> <br /> A monk and his three disciples go to a village to find the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world as soon as they translate and talk to the world. But an evil force intervened and kidnapped all the children of the village. The evil power wants the monk, because if you eat it you will live forever. The containers fight the forces of darkness before sending out the monk for safety. (The monk thinks he can only win by arguing with the bad guys). The monk ends with a bunch of lizards who are planning to eat at one stage ... but the bad guys come and he is an odyssey with the ugliest of fate. <br /> <br /> Can a movie starting From the rails go off the rails? Don't get me wrong, I really loved this movie, but it's so scattered all over the place that plot and logic just fall away, as some scenes just pick up the middle action without knowing how we are there (The last battle to save the disciples is completely out of the left field). It's one of the funniest movies I've seen for a while, but it made me laugh and smile like not coming out. The movie starts and you have no idea where things are and then what is on the screen is interesting or funny and you just go with it. How do we get things done, is often outside of me. It is full of strange and weird references as we go from heaven to the ocean, to the ribcage of a certain mythical animal, so that God knows where. This movie drives all over the place, which helps keep it fun as you don't know where it will end (and that's why you keep the information to a minimum). And it's funny. Very funny. <br /> And the action is very good, even if a good piece of it is unbridled CGI animation (which allows some cool images, the golden staff, the spin attack formation, the angel in flight ... ) And that's a lot It is actually a wonderful love story. This is the story of an ugly imp and a monk who eventually falls in love (and with other complications). It is an interesting look at the nature of love and what is love. You will be moved. <br /> <br /> But I enjoyed it quite a bit. I was still irritated by his scatter shot construction. The movie's inability to keep his ideas together and tell a complete story hurts the movie and takes away the pleasure every time we get a crash in the road. The bumps take you out of the movie itself and make you busy how much of other sources have been cut. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely worth seeing as it has many choices, just be prepared for a few bumps and you'll have a good time.
