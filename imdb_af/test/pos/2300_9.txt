This particular title is very interesting. The whole movie was like watching a ninja RPG, which is really cool. three magical swords, three clans, a terrible demon, a political power, yotodes have it all. The animation is decent, but a little gritty, the story is, and the battle scenes are really cool. One thing that really looks good in this movie is the monsters. they are pretty freaky. If you like to rule blood and browse ninja, the jotode is the one to see.
