It's a great comedy, with the emphasis on living next to the racist bigot. But also show that both main characters are actually as bad as each other. Based on the ITV comedy hit, it's very politically wrong. And it's all better, comedy is after all to entertain. The movie's only real drawback is there's not much of a plot. But the throw is as large as usual. Jack Smethurst and Rudolph Walker make one hell of a team and play each other in a sole proprietorship. It has been many years since I saw this movie and last week it could finally buy on DVD. The fact that the movie was still really laughing, contained the moment I could recommend this movie, just as I would have liked to be back in the 1970s.
