I have to say that Barbie Movies generally impressed me. I have a five-year-old Barbie fanatic cousin and she has seen them all the time so unnecessarily to say that I saw quite a few Barbie this holiday, but I'm not sick of them. <br /> <br /> Visually, this movie has a lot to offer, especially the backgrounds, and the animation of the characters improved with every new movie. One thing I particularly noticed was a big improvement in the animation of Barbie's hair in this movie. It has a beautiful set of classical music clips and I think it is wonderful, as it exposes a new generation to the classics. This movie is worth it, especially if you have young descendants. They will be entertained for hours!
