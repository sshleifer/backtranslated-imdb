I recently saw some meager films from the Far East. Some were excellent (Battle Royale, Infernal Affairs, the Eye), and some were not so good (Versus, The Triple Cross). Then there are people like Uzumaki and Returner, who were rather flawed, I still enjoy. <br /> <br /> The basic premise involves the mysterious and horrific consequences that a growing obsession with spirals has on a community. Sounds silly? Yes, that's what I thought. First, the good things. In addition, direction was certainly a bit on top, but never less interesting and stylish. Secondly, the story was original and, like other writers, many love-esq said. It was interesting. What most reminds me, however, was Cronenberg early on; movies like Shivers and Videodrome. <br /> <br /> The acting wasn't good, but not too terrible. To be honest, I was actually bored. I felt the pacing, especially initially, was a bit slow. My biggest problem was that it was too stupid and funny to be real horror, and yet not enough to be considered a comedy. * SPOILERS * below. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * Some good scenes (washing machine =) and I like the final shot / voiceover. Initially I thought it ended too suddenly, but about 20 seconds later I realized the meaning and ended. But due to the lack of seriousness in the story, combined with the top screens such as the news release at school, I didn't organize much on the characters. The final scene that might have been a little bit pointy, while I couldn't really care for the girl or her boyfriend. * SPOILERS END * <br /> <br /> In general, I looked like this movie, but it frustrated me and I think there was real potential for some good scenes. Some other points, the head girl is pretty nice and cute, and the song that plays at the end is also good. I rated it 7/10. <br /> <br />
