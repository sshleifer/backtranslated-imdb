I loved this movie since I saw it in theater in 1991. I was 12 and Wil Wheaton was my favorite actor and adolescent lover. I'm 23 now and I still love this movie. The best part is whoever I share, because it's a total macho-old movie! This is done with enough action and chaos to hold men with the shortest attention slips on the screen. I just wish it was available on DVD!
