stars: Danny Devito, Billy Crystal, Anne Ramsey, Kim Griest, Kate Mulgrew, Oprah Winfrey and Rob Reiner. <br /> <br /> After college class teacher Larry (Crystal) wants to kill his ex-wife and Owen (Devito) wants to kill his mum (Ramsey). If Larry points out he wants his wife dead, Owen knows what to do for him, to give him a favor, because Larry has to kill his mother. Devito is absolutely hilarious in this brain-like wannabe writer who has daydreams to poison his mother and scissors through her head. He has a child like a role that seems to be a confused man as a murderer. Ramesy was actually nominated for an academy award because of her wonderful performance as average old lady. Elevator. Along with a comedy, the film also has a heart. One scene between Devito and Crystal seems to be joking, but goes deeper and makes me slightly sad. Danny Devito directed the film and did a good job of getting the dark tone in his direction. For any fan of comedies I recommend it. <br /> <br /> My rating: B plus. 84 minutes. PG-13 for language, sexuality and violence.
