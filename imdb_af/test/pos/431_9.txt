I made a promise that if I ever picked up a comment that was less than complimentary, later felt different, I would return and make my heart change. So far this has been the first time this has happened. <br /> <br /> I'm really starting to enjoy Hack. Something has changed clearly. The story lines look much stronger. The plot can still be a bit surreal, but the characters have developed so much more depth that a surreal plot can be forgiven. I'm writing this to fine acting. <br /> <br /> Not every show can come from the starting gate. Some need time to pick up speed. I'm glad I kept this program and I really hope it lasts.
