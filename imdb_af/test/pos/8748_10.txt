I haven't seen the more recent 'Traffic' based on this, but I want to bet on this one as the better creation. I know of no other film depicting the intricate tragedies of drug trafficking and the "war on drugs". I watched this one at least four times and enjoyed it again as part of the 30th birthday presentations of the Masterpiece Theater.
