Flash Gordon is undoubtedly the best of all American series. In a date as early as 1936, Universal was able to make such an entertainment story, and twenty years later, when I first saw it as a child, it involved me in a great adventure and emotion. Buster Crabbe was the hero we always wanted in our childhood, and Jean Rogers, the beautiful girl we always dreamed of being in love with. Dragons, octopus, monsters, gorillas were also the attraction. Charles Middleton was a great presence as Ming, the Merciless. A true predecessor to George Lucas's Starwars.
