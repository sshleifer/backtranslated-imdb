I couldn't believe the eyecup from start to finish. To be a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I'm happy to report that photography in this movie is a beauty for the eye to see. There is so much rich, full of images that are placed before me, that every time I see this movie, I find something new that I haven't seen before. As with previous movies I saw, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture a person's attention is very well applied. Although the characters could be better developed, the action and cost was worth the admission price. I encourage you to buy this one for your DVD collection. Even if you haven't seen it on the big screen, you won't be disappointed. I know I wasn't.
