Good drama film about a childcare case with good performances by all the actors. A good example of what an excellent script can do to drive a simple story to a much higher quality. The script was just average and that's what the movie kept. from the list of best plays of the best time. Still, the big play makes this movie a good one to see if you are a fan of court drama or a huge fan of the lead actors. The movie really had to be a little longer for more excellence, but it would really be nitpicking ......
