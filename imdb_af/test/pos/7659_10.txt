Beautifully filmed, mind expanding exploration of the Gypsy culture in the context of their music. Traveling across a continent, experiencing the incredible music styles of different groups of gypsy people. It's kind of misleading to say this movie isn't being told. It is masterfully told by the music itself, the rising melodies and subtitle songs tell a story much better than a narrator would have. See this movie.
