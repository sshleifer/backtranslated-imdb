A mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. As I have said about this movie - if you don't get it, you're totally crazy. Classic lines like (parafarsed). "I have this erection and it does not matter how many times I do it. You are a nurse, what can you give me?" Nurses answers "everything I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ..." Great soundtrack. The classic "Hyde has nothing to hide." Stay surprisingly close to the original plot - not that the original stays in the way of a joke. No one meets with an IQ of more than 115 not hysterical. <br /> <br />
