I never ever remember Sarah, Plain and Tall at school, but when my son told me about it and said they were watching the movie in class, I wanted to see it too. I borrowed the video from the library and watched it as a family. It was a wonderful story. However, I only knew a few months ago that there was prosecution. I watched this week this week. I discovered one little boy: in the second movie, Skylark, Jacob remembers how he was a boy, and tells Sarah "my brothers and sisters and I will dream ...". In the winter's end, those "brothers and sisters" do not exist in conversations between Jacob and his father. But it is a very small oops, and I just caught watching the trilogy the second time. Great movie, a must for a good healthy performance for the family.
