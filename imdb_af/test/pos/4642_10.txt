For a movie that was PG, it's a fun movie. I grew up watching this movie over and over again. It's really fun, I don't know how the audience will respond today, but if you grew up or loved the 80's then it's a good movie. Stephen Furst is wonderful like Harold, who is one of the best characters in the movie. Paul Ruebens also appears for about 10 minutes. I love nostalgia.
