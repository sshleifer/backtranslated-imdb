I've been searching for this movie for years. I have good memories of the first-class acting and singing in this movie. I never knew the reason why the movie was unavailable was because of the Gershwin family's action - DEMAND ON THIS to try to suppress at American Classic !! I can only hope that they will remember and allow this movie to be released and enjoyed by the American public. <br /> <br /> Sammy Davis, Jr. is at his best in this movie. The only other show she's seen is "Anna Lucasta" - another great movie I want will be released on DVD. <br /> <br /> Porgy & Bess has a first-class, all-star throw. Hopefully you will see yourself one day.
