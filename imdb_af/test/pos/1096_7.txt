I really enjoyed the movie wood camera. I think this is a bit influenced by the Brazilian film "City of God", but perhaps this parallelism between the two tracks possible to follow (crime and art) in the social environment is a reality. <br /> <br /> I think the movies made by Madiba are really nice. I don't think it's unreal that he shoots such good movies, because there are many artists who don't have any kind of education and can really be genius. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the soundtrack. It is adapted to the photos. <br /> <br /> See the movie ... it's good to show how a life can be in a social environment.
