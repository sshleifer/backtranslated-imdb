I saw this cartoon as a child, a father, and now a grandfather. This is my favorite cartoon. I love the characters, the great colors, and the very good drawings. I love the song that appears in the cartoon. I think it's a beautiful little cartoon. Everyone I showed it just loved it. It's too bad, it's opened on such a bad day (Pearl Harbor bombing). If it wasn't for the bad timing, it would have been a great success. I hope I can find a DVD because all the VHS tapes don't do it right. <br /> <br /> I think if anyone shows it to their child, they will get the same result. They just love it. <br /> <br />
