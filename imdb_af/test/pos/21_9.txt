"The Dresser" is a small but absolutely wonderful movie, with brilliant performances by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. How in the world this little film got enough attention to get five nominations for the major academic awards in 1983, it is a mystery to me, but it is nice to know that the Academy is an indication of good taste every time can prove (of course, they awarded the award that year to "Terms of Endearment" - they do not want to be accused of showing too much flavor.) <br /> <br /> Albert Finney is a drunk Shakespeare actor in a production of "King Lear"; Tom Courtenay is the man who works behind the scenes twice to keep this actor in front of the footlights. It is hilarious and piteous to see Courtenay's character fights, Finney's, with attention and love, just to see his efforts completely unabated and dismissed, to the very bitter end. Finney and Courtenay work wonderfully together, and although Finney gets the premier moments (he definitely gets Shakespeare), Courtenay is the heart and soul of the movie. <br /> <br /> Degree: A
