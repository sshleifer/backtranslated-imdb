Yes !!!! Fassbinder and Ballhaus are at the top of their game, back in 1973! It's about the same subject, but in my opinion it's a much better movie than THE MATRIX (1999), it was at least 200 times cheaper! Very nice camera work by Michael Ballhaus and the wonderful "Albatross" by Fleetwood Mac at the end. Fassbinder creates a very moody tone for the entire film. It's a pity this movie was never released on DVD. But now after 37 years, they finally concluded that this TV movie is not just one of the best Fassbinder movies (although there are many Fassbinder movies, it is a brilliant example of a science fiction movie, done without much money Buy it !! Beware !!
