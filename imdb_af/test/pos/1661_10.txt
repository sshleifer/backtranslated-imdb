There aren't many movies I would describe as perfect, but Rififi definitely fits into the account. No other movie came close, before or after. The plot is simple but captivates you. It never stops me from wondering how absolutely the movie gets caught every time you see it. You care about all the characters, though they are bank robbers, because they are presented as people with all their problems and bugs. It is difficult to imagine any other actor, except Jean Servais, in the role of Tony le Stephanois. When the crew members talk about what they are going to do with their money and eventually come to Tony, she replies and the expression on his face says it all. While the 30-minute sequential series is the best-known part of the movie (and legally so), the movie is actually getting better. The director, Jules Dassin, knew what he did when he decided not to have music during the honeymoon or the final shootings, but placed a great climate point during Tony's final ride to his fate. Thinking that if Dassin, a US director, wasn't sorted in Hollywood and forced to work in France, this theater masterpiece would never have been the way. It would certainly not have been as good as it was made during a time as an American movie. It was absolutely terrible that Dassin had to go, but he did his greatest job for the benefit of all of us. I'm just thinking of the coming Al Pacino remake. Most movies since Rififi have already borrowed somehow. There is no reason to re-emphasize this masterpiece except for money. Leave the classic alone!
