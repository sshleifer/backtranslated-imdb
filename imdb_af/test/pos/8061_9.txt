I read "Anne Frank: The Young Girl's Diary" when I was in high school, and I caught up with her in the story and also in the Broadway game of her secret annex. <br /> <However, I'm a little surprised at how people saw her diary and her as a person and considered her a little saint or had a message of hope for the world. I don't think it was the original intent of her diary. She wrote it mainly for herself, although she did some rigorous revisions before the occupants of the secret attachment were betrayed, intending to publish it one day. <br /> <br /> But I never saw her as a saint or as a messenger of hope ... but as a very talented writer who can express her thoughts very well and very entertainingly in a diary. No doubt she was a very interesting writer, and she had an extraordinary talent to express herself fully with words. You got to know her really well through her diary. But the importance of her diary lies in the fact that it is a will and an important historical document of the evidence of the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> It also brought the Holocaust's tragedy closer to home, losing someone that we can place a familiar face and personality at such a young age ... literally her young life of her and of the other residents killed in the Holocaust. This is a bad indictment of the Nazis' systematic murder of over 6 million Jews, and it should not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> But it is sad for me that her diary is so misunderstood as anything more than that. When I look for hope, I have the Bible ... the first most read non-fiction book in the world. God's words in the Bible are eternal ... but Anne's diary is a diary of a young girl in exceptional circumstances, and that's it. She is not someone who worships or becomes an idol, because she was an ordinary girl with many errors, who possesses incredible talent as a writer, and died at age 15 of tipus in the concentration camp Bergen-Belsen. She was a victim of the Holocaust, and as this otherwise excellent documentary testified so clearly, she was Hitler's most famous victim. <br /> <br /> Besides the Anne Frank story ... the stories of her family and friends and survivors of the Holocaust were impressive, alive and powerful. I especially enjoyed Miep Gies's testimony and marvel that she is still strong and alive today. Hannah Goslar's testimony was also very interesting. And I also liked to hear from Otto Frank. But I also agree that the moving picture of the young girl with the dark hair and the famous big eyes at the end was particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> Another thing about the Holocaust that I do not disagree with the documentary is that I do not believe it is just discrimination ... but rather something deeper and deeper, and that was just an act of pure evil. Pure evil. Nothing but pure evil. <br /> <br /> Excellent documentary by Anne Frank and the Holocaust to be watched.
