For years, I had a sensible reminder to watch this movie, I just looked at the net to find it somewhere and couldn't find it anywhere, so I thought it had to disappear. <br /> <br /> TO ... My gran showed me a box she sent out in the Daily Mail, and I won't be there any more, but to my surprise there was under the other gemstones The Water Babies! I haven't been so excited long ago! It's a big light movie, the songs aren't unforgettable, certainly if I was a child during the time it came out, I would put more in my mind. Unfortunately, it was just a movie I watched at my borders ten years ago when I was a little spud. And look it back now the animation is terrible! And the re-voiced voices they do to gain a wealth of sound in movies are completely down! But what cares for you if you're a kid you never think of those things, even if they're a boy, is about 10 and sounds like a boy in the middle of puberty. Great classic children's movie!
