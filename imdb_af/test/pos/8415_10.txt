Hadnt heard much about this movie, except that it is the national award and the Oscar tournament. It's a Marathi movie, I can't make apple from orange in marathi. But when I played the movie on DD1 late on Sunday night, I just glued it. Now I'm not a judge of the techniques and acting skills. But I watched a good number of movies, of different genres, and for an average viewer, I would highly recommend this movie. The feeling is very nice and realistic, although there are melodramatic moments. Look at people. The latter did not see a movie touching the heart, especially in the Hindi theater. The crown performance of the movie is when the young child returns home. The camera moves to make the child appear, wear black glasses, has lost his eyes, the child hears the other children splashing in the water and starts slamming. I was surprised. And the two hours I spent watching the movie - it's worth it :-)
