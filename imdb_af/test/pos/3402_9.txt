I watched this series on television in 1990 and absolutely loved it (I was nine years old). I bought the first DVD box about six months ago and got the second one a few days ago (thanks to my best man). Gosh ... It was hard to get sleep with all the thoughts in my head ... what will happen to Madeline and George, etc. Slave issues and civil war have always fascinated me (a 25-year-old Finn). I advise family slaves by Edward Ball for those who want to see the past and understand what really happened. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure I want to see Heaven and Hell so many people have told me that it wasn't really that good.
