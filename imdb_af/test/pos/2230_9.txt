I can't understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently only available by an Australian video company, but this is the unfortunate obscurity of this Peter Sellers classic. (Leonard Maltin's film guide still gives it the same BOMB rating they gave in the 1970s). With so many stage performers on the screen, Sellers appears with what may be his most hilarious role. It all starts with his discovery of a patient who fell out at 11:15, but Vendors claim the body is still alive due to the fact that the new day does not start until noon! The last straw for the beleaguered hospital commissioner comes in that many room, the DOEN DISTURB still signs at the door; As soon as he leaves the room (handkerchief holding his nose), there is a brief conversation with the doctor with him. Doctor: "We can't save them all! The man was at least 85! Commissioner:" How old was he when he died, 63? "Harold Gould plays an unfamiliar surgeon who closes his eyes when the knife is dug in. Richard Lenz (whose" refugee ass "reporter in The Shootist is pushed up in John Wayne's back) plays the patient with the scam come in for a chest x-ray, until they discover that he owns a house. Also in the screen (and providing some excellent landscaped music) is Keith Allison, former guitarist for Paul Revere and the Raiders who also worked with Michael Nesmith on a few Monkees recordings (and together with Nesmith in 1968 wrote "Birds, the Bees, and the Monkees".) There are some missing footage of this image, including a topless ride with Uschi Digard near the end, also a scene with actress Kathleen Freeman (who wants to use green seals to fund her operation), which is locked up by his dealers in his office (never unhealthy) version he goes back to his office to vi nd that she wrote in large letters on the wall "UNFAIR PRICK"; his reaction? "you spelled the price wrong!").
