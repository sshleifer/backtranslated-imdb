The title suggests that this movie is a sequel to an American werewolf in London. None of the characters of the previous movie are back and are not even named in the movie. So, as a successor, AAwiP will fail, one would say. <br /> <br /> I dare say the opposite. <br /> <br /> An American werewolf in Paris is a beautiful, effective horror movie. This is one of the better werewolf movies I've seen long ago. And I saw my part, like an American werewolf in London, The Howling, Wolfen, The Wolfman and the Underworld trilogy. <br /> <br /> The story tells of three Americans visiting Paris on vacation. At the top of the Eifel Tower, one of them rescues a woman who commits suicide. What begins as a romantic relationship is slowly becoming a nightmare when the dark secrets that creep into the city are revealed. <br /> <br /> I really liked the play in this movie. Especially the two stars of the movie: the woman who commits suicide and the man who saves her. They have good chemistry together. But the other two Americans also play their roles beautifully. I really didn't find anything about the acting, so thumb for that! <br /> <br /> The effects on the werewolves are nice. It doesn't look too cheap or false to me. Of course, opinions on this topic are divided. But let's just say I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br /> There is also a good amount of humor in this movie. There are some very funny scenes that you will probably remember for a long time. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, an American werewolf in Paris may not be a direct successor to its predecessor, but it's still a pleasant movie. Ideal for fans of werewolves! 7 out of 10 stars!
