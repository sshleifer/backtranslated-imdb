As in the past ten years or even longer, the whole world has been flooded with so-called sitcoms (actually few people earn this title because they are so predictable). King of Queens is a very original, unique and amazingly funny alternative. It's about the daily life of a delivery man and his wife working as a lawyer assistant in Manhattan in Queens, NY. Carrie's father, Arthur, lives with them a picture book that is played apart, played by the fantastic Jerry Stiller, who steals the show every time. Other important people are their best friends, Diaken and Kelly, a married couple, and their other friend Spence, who is nearly 30 and still lives with his mother. What makes this show so unique and funny is that each character looks so real and Carrie's cynical sarcastic attitude is the total opposite of Doug's benign, slightly silly optimism. And Arthur is the one who makes it absolutely unpredictable with his strange ideas and habits. He often gets himself in trouble and Doug and Carrie have to drag him out of the mud. Even if the quality of the show has dropped a bit in recent years, it's still one of the best daily sitcoms ever made. It takes a bit of time to get into the characters and to relate to them, but once it's done, you get some unstoppable laughs. Although I think I couldn't one day survive with Arthur in a closed room without hitting the gut from him, I really worshiped him in this show. Look and enjoy it, I'll give it a 9 out of 10.
