When I was a kid, I loved "Tiny Toons". I especially loved "Tiny Toons: How did I spend my summer vacation". I thought it was laughing funny on the floor. A few years later my friend had the video. And I thought I'd look at it for the good old days. I was still laughing on the floor. My opinion, the Plucky and Hampton skit are the best. They decide to go to "Happy World Land". And they finally have a crazy adventure to get there. All the sketch is funny. I'm still looking for the video. So, if anyone has any tips. Please write me. <br /> <br /> This is one of the funniest cartoons I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
