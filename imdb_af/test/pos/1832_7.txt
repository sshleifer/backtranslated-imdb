I will start by saying that I've always been a Bonnie Hunt fan. She always adds life to any character she plays, and she has done a wonderful job in her directors' debut. <br /> <br /> I have to admit it is a chick spot ... But it keeps in mind, it's a wonderful story, it gets a lot of emotions and evokes all kinds of reactions. <br /> <br /> This movie portrays real life as people with real life. similar situations. (I have to exclude the coincidence that most of the film is) <br /> <br /> It's a love story. Not just a man and a woman, but the love of family, friends and loved ones. that's over. (Even pets). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. Well worth the rent or the purchase.
