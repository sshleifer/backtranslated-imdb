Wipe drama with big sets, costumes and performances? although some people channel Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent when two men try to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and place. Beautiful villains ?? you will have them all get a very bad end. Many strong female characters in this one? both good and bad. Secondary story lines are also well developed. Several cameos by big stars of the past. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics. <br /> <br /> Curl on a rainy day with your DVD or VHS player and drink the choice with this one. A lap red and a cat will be optional.
