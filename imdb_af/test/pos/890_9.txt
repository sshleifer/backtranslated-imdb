With all due respect to Joel Fabiani and Rosemary Nicolls and their characters, Section S will be forever associated with Peter Wyngarde's Jason King. <br /> <br /> Most people remember him as this camp, flamboyant and debonable Austin batsman, but it will make a disorder of character. He is much more nuanced than this. <br /> <br /> Jason King is lazy (he often lets Stewart fight all the bad guys and only slides in the end), he is selfish (his appreciation for people is based on whether or not he has read his novels) , many of his investigations are speculation without facts to repair them and he struggles when Annabelle is right ... and she is often. He is clearly a man with a half-life crisis and drinking drives, but ....... Jason King is brilliant. If Wyngarde had played purely, it would not have worked, but he often shows King as a paper tiger, led by his libido, love for delicacy and pride for generosity (and this gets in the way of his detective work at times) but he has some of the best lines and puts down in TV history. And by not playing it as whiter than white, the chemistry and interactions between the three main characters is better. <br /> <br /> If you watch it again recently on DVD, you will only see how much depth Wyngarde placed in Jason King.
