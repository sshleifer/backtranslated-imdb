It is definitely Nolan's most intimate, and thoughtful piece. Not to say that Memento or Sleeplessness is bad, but they were definitely more Hollywood standards ... while the next is more of an indie movie. The story is very brilliant, and very well developed. Overall ... see if you're a fan of any of Nolan's work, I'm sure you'll appreciate it more.
