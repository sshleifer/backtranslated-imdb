Sam Lion (Jean Paul Belmondo) discovers that he needs time, because everyone around him trusts him and leads his own death. When he still loves those he loves, he needs Albert Duvivier (Richard Anconina) to help them. Looking for his own past, of his own desires, this fantastic movie by Claude Lelouch is a man's quest for himself at a mature age. <br /> <br /> Built like all Lelouch movies, the movie's start with constant flashbacks can be mysterious, especially scenes where Paul Belmondo (much like his father looks) plays a young Sam Lion while Sam Lion in the same room stand - a flashback sequence that takes a moment to understand. <br /> <br /> One of Lelouch's most extensive works, the L'Itineraire d'un gate, is a must-see story of self-fulfillment.
