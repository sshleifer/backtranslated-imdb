I will always think of Mr. Firth as Dorian Gray, if I stay 100. <br /> <br /> Perfectly acted and directed, making Oscar Wilde's insight, humor and humor alive with an absolute and perfect perfection that is unusual in television. . <br /> <br /> More evidence that the BBC is making more than talent that doesn't always have money. <br /> <br /> Must have for all Wild fans - and indeed for everyone else. Inspired and perfect, every one of the actors looked exactly right and every shot was done well. <br /> <br /> By the end I found that I loved every character in a way that no other movie of the type ever inspired. Look at it and try to look at another version. It's just not the same, is it?
