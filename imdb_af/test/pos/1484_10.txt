This is one of my favorite T.V. shows of all time, Rowan Atkinson is just a genius! And it is only fitting that I have chosen to be my 1000 review! I can't start telling you how much I love Mr. Bean does not love, he is the man, and what amazes me is how he comes from these incredibly difficult situations and he is always so creative. Ruby Driscoll also deserves awards! He is also a genius! My favorite little thing he did is the wonderful adventures of Mr. Bean and while the rest of them are wonderful, it remains my true favorite, and I wish the show didn't stop so quickly! Every episode is brilliantly written, and they were all masterfully aimed, plus every episode is a classic in my eyes. This show is incredibly popular, and I can definitely see why, as it is probably the funniest show ever. The character players all played very well, especially Robyn Driscoll and Matilda Ziegler (as Irma). This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. Rowan Atkinso is simply a genius and an incredibly talented comedian (possibly the best!) And it is fitting that I chose to be my 1000 review. F you didn't see it show, drop what you're doing now and go see, you won't regret it, trust me this is one of the best TV shows ever! And I will continue to watch the show over and over again, I never touch it! , Mr. Bean Rules! ***** out of 5
