MPAA Rating PG-13 <br /> My rating: 10 and above <br /> <br /> My * Rating 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> William H. Macy delivers a great show as the role of Mr. neuman He makes you feel sympathetic and frightens him at the same time. The story starts out as a comedy and slowly but slowly becomes like a horror movie with a twist and turns that Macy effortlessly into masters. I couldn't take my eyes off this movie even after it ended, and I couldn't believe it ended when it did. A MUST SEE. <br /> <br /> THIS PARAGRAPH MUST BE REVIEWED ABOUT A SPOILER <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, look at the plot this way: The Neumans are the United States as " a whole and the Charactor Meat Loaf Aday play are the people in the United States who are anti-semitic. <br /> <br /> It was a very enjoyable movie and would recommend to someone I saw in the street.
