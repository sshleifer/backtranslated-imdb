I wish Hollywood would make more movies like The China Syndrome. Because this one counts at each level. <br /> <br /> It has an intelligent, credible writing. It shows you that it is not just nuclear power itself, but the money involved, which causes danger. And the movie also gives you a wonderful background of how television is made. <br /> <br /> It looks like a thriller: the first time I saw it, it got me on the edge of my seat. And it plays as a character movie: I really care about the main characters. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas, Wilford Brimley and most importantly Jack Lemmon are wonderful.
