totally brilliant film from the CKY team ...... (not the Jackass boys. Johnny Knoxville, Chris Pontius, Steve-o, etc. are not in this <br /> <br /> movie). Okay, maybe they're not the best actors, but that's not what you call a serious movie ... but hey there is lots of fun and it's quite funny to watch. who doesn't want to see Don Vito dressed as a Roman emperor! <br /> <br /> If you love viva la bam or CKY ............, you need a great soundtrack by the almighty HIM, CKY and others ... ... watch the extra features on the DVD especially Bran's freestyle <br /> <br /> Chinese rap number two ...... seriously hilarious ..... ..... look at this movie ........ you will not regret it ......... 10/10
