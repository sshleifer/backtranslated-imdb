When people smear about how they don't make themselves accustomed to, they just point to this wonderfully entertaining and spectacular, comedy horror of writer-director Glenn McQuaid. <br /> <br /> This is a story of graverobbers (played by Dominic Monaghan and Larry Fessenden) who eventually dig up more than just silent, dead bodies. After the initial shock, they soon realize that they can really change the situation to their advantage. And that's just what they are trying to do. Things don't seem to have worked out well as they planned, as poor young Arthur (Monaghan) actually links his story to a priest (Ron Perlman) before being taken to the gallows. <br /> <br /> Looking at the detail of his filmography, McQuaid seems to have the core of his first short film and has expanded it to this feature, which is not bad. Fessenden comes back and does well, Monaghan is one of those guys who can still get you to keep him while talking about the ominous business of stealing death and other genre favorites like Perlman and Angus Scrimm on the scene what this movie is great fun for genre fans. <br /> <br /> It also enjoys a unique and auspicious design and look, sometimes ranging from EC Comic-style panels to lively action (a la Creepshow) and always feels somehow authentic in the Hammer Horror feeling. Perhaps everything is just covered with so much dry ice, but it's next to the tip. Whatever was done to capture everything on film, it works. It works well. <br /> <br /> It may not have real horror stories, but this movie has a good bait of black humor and relaxes every minute of the time in macabre material that all those who have patience for horror a little are more sedate and feel that it could certainly be put back in the days of Hammer. <br /> <br /> See it if you want: The flesh and the enemies, the doctor and the demons, Creepshow.
