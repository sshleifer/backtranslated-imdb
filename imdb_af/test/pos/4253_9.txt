Referring to the independent theater field in the United States, it is often inferred that this means that the filmmaker or people behind the project had much more creative freedom and what they wanted. This is not really the case today, unless someone is a solid "author" and creative freedom still comes with the caveat that one has to find distribution with one of the independent sections of large studios or somehow picked up from a low level deal to a valuable movie festival. But Putney Swope, Robert Downey Sr's film about an African American nail, has inadvertently promoted advertising gurus at a production company. * * Independent cinema, the kind of work that has been done with the containers or Romero's Night or The living dead and Cassavetes are at the same time without getting a real typical studio distribution, but cause waves, kick asses and take names in the cinema world. For all its rough and rugged moments it is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It is also a movie that is funny, many and extremely funny. Sometimes the sense of humor is just as ridiculous as it is almost impossible to not laugh, from the mere appearance of President Mimeo with his wife to advertising dialogues. Swope's team sits together like "I can't eat an air conditioner" in a true "soul" voice. It's as clever as the audience it is aimed at. It is someone with two brain cells to put together who can see that this work is not offensive or too shocking because it is meant to rattle the cage and it does well in the first five minutes. As soon as it's over, Downey Sr goes on his flash of sorts like a movie maker with nothing to lose. His lead actor is part Fidel Castro, shares Isaac Hayes circa 1972 (and yes it is 1969 in the film) and shares hard-assed ad exec Spacely on the Jetsons look make kid. And don't forget the side characters, dear God. <br /> <br /> There are so many memorable lines and moments that it's hard to keep up. From perhaps the most hilarious assassinated assassination attempt in any movie to the one Face-Off Skin ad that contains lines that will give South Park a run for its dirty mouth money, just a little neat with one Jack's guy. Hill's movies played by the Muslims continue to give Swope and that one boy with the nun who swells a storm and impresses Swope in a quick stroke. This is a pretty direct message about media and advertising, but there are also very powerful moments where it just touches the nail about racism in America, sometimes without doing more than a gesture and sometimes doing something BIG like having black panther types this way and that around swope's advertising regime. And for a low-budget production (I mean super low, so compare to Night of the Living Dead and Faces). Downey has some very good actors, all non-union, and it's hard to think that some of them might be here on camera for the first time. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that Downey's style does not make it perfect: it is rough and sometimes crazy and dated for his own good and I'm sure I don't "I don't get the underlying humor of some of the ads, since I came from a full generation after these ads were broadcast (although the "Miss Redneck Jersey" definitely didn't get lost). Generally speaking, it is one of the best of its time, a satire that is ironing and a feature with a predominantly black role that is all about what comes from excess power, regardless of skin color. That is, as someone can say, "good ***."
