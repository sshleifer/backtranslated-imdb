I watched this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and director Aku Louhimies introduced his film and was then available for Q&A. For some reason, this movie is called Frozen Land in English, so I don't know how the distributors have frozen from Paha. It's a very good movie. It didn't matter to me that I would beat it in the excellent category, but I spoke to some viewers who felt it was an excellent movie. Louhimies said that people in Finland also loved or hated this film and said many people in the theaters went out of there. I'm sure some have objected to some of the violence, curse, drug and alcohol abuse and sexual explicit scenes. It's a very clever story of how these different lives are woven together because of a drop effect. This film has many interesting and powerful characters. I will rate it a 7.0 out of a possible 10 and will see it again and recommend it with caution.
