Black Rain is an excellent movie, but watch out for DVDs currently sold for as much as $ 300 each. I have the DVD, and it's terrible. Very small non-anamorphic image to be inflated to resolution-kill size. Acceptable sound. This is a primitive DVD that must absolutely be read *. <br /> <br /> VAT, I also own the BlackDisk laser disk and VHS. The VHS is a big step up the DVD! And the laser disc has by far the best picture of them all subtitles in the black, sharp, big picture, simple but very good soundtrack. Buy the VHS and avoid the deadly prizes that these scam artists claim!
