Recent years have seen a number of biopics of famous singers, and Ray, the story of Ray Charles, has much in common with Walk the Line the following year and tells the story of Johnny Cash. Cash and Charles were near-precise contemporaries, both born in the early thirties and dying in 2003/04. Both grew up in poverty in the American Deep South. Both lost a brother during an accident during an accident. Both were successful in the 1950s. Both experienced problems in their marriages, and both were addicted to drugs. All these issues are emphasized in both films. There are also similarities with Ron Howard's "A Beautiful Mind". Although the film was about a mathematician rather than a musician, like Ray and Walk the Line, it played the role of his subject's wife to help her husband overcome his problems. <br /> <br /> Ray Charles was born in 1930 to a single mother in a poor black community in Georgia. (His original name was Raymond Charles Robinson, but when he started his career as a musician, he dropped her to avoid confusion with the boxer Sugar Ray. Robinson). Somehow Charles had an even harder time than he had Cash, with two additional disadvantages in terms of his blindness and racism that all black Americans, especially in the South, had during his lifetime. Charles had a particularly traumatic childhood, who saw the death of his younger brother George in a drowning accident and became blind a year or two later. He seems to have been hunted by nightmares and guilty feelings about George's death throughout his life. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is moving fairly slowly and is a standard rag-to-wealth showbiz biopsy, which tells the story of how young Charles is taught to play the piano. a nightclub artist and then known as a great artist who falls in love with the beautiful Della Bea. The best scenes in this part of the movie are the look back on Charles's childhood. There is an effective repetitive image of colored glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of his house; Perhaps it was one of his little visual memories of his life before he became blind. There is also an unforgettable scene in which teenager Charles shines a prejudiced bus driver to run him on the bus by pretending to have lost his eyes on Omaha Beach. In fact, he was only thirteen in the Normandy country. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie becomes more interesting as it moves in a more controversial area, focusing on Charles's drug addiction, the problems in his marriage caused by his relationship with Margie Hendricks, one of his background singers, and his fight against racism. In the early sixties, Charles caused a sensation by refusing to play in front of a racially-minded audience in Georgia (although contrary to what is said in the film, he did not allow him to be banned in the state to run). He also fought against the racial issues in the music industry and not only traditionally "black" musical styles such as the gospel and rhythm and blues performed, but also traditionally "white" like country and west (by many black Americans as the music of choice the Redneck community). The Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw noted that Ray was a sunny film deviating diplomatically from the dark side. It does not mention such issues as the death of Charles's beloved mother Aretha during his teens, his short marriage to Eileen Williams in the early fifties and his eventual divorce from Della Bea in 1977. the number of his illegitimate children. There are similarities with "A Beautiful Mind" which also omitted some controversial details on the subject's personal life, including a divorce. <br /> <br /> Fans of Ray Charles will definitely enjoy the movie for the music, but it's also worth watching even for those who don't know much about him, mainly because of Jamie Foxx's Oscar - award winning performance in the title role, which reflects Charles's ways so precisely that we think we are actually looking at a blind man, though Foxx is himself. (Unlike Joaquin Phoenix in "Walk the Line," however, Foxx didn't do his own singing - no doubt Charles's distinctive singing voice is too difficult to reproduce). He received good support from some of the other artists, especially Sharon Warren as Aretha and Kerry Washington as Della Bea. The film is uneven and over long, yet rewarding. 10/07
