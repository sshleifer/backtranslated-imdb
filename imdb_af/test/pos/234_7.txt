Although I'm not fond of musical, COVER GIRL is a delight for classic movie buffs and especially for fans of Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. The film can be dated according to today's standards and the story and songs can be nothing special, but the musical numbers are marvelously performed and there is a tremendous role to play with the movie. Plus, the film is a worthy introduction for fans of Rita Hayworth. She is simply breathtaking in glorious Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Despite Jerome Kern's collaboration with the film, his music is nowhere as special or memorable as his songs in SWING TIME (1936), but the songs serve the film well. The dance is nothing but excellent, especially from Gene Kelly's solo song and my favorite musical number, "Alter-Ego Dance." The amusing Phil Silvers steals the movie as Kelly's mate. Otto Kruger, Eve Arden and Edward Brophy give good performances in their dramatic supporting roles. And Rita plays a lovely, charming girl here. a role that is far from her femme fatale babes in films such as BLOOD AND SAND (1941). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a great movie worth watching, even if you're not big on music. Still, the movie's music can be more memorable if only my favorite songwriters, Irving Berlin or Cole Porter, wrote the songs for this movie. However, it is the glorious Technicolor cinematography and the imaginative dance that is the real entertainment of the film's production. <br /> <br /> As I watch, Rita Hayworth does her good, I don't think I've ever had a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen, as I am Moira Shearer in Michael Powell's masterpiece, THE RED SHOES (1948 ), seen. Just look at Rita in GENDER and fall in love with her.
