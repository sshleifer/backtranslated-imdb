A very good movie. <br /> <br /> A great love story. Many sword fighting. Great battle scenes. Heros and villains. True history. <br /> <br /> Little in the West knows a lot of Chinese history. Chin Zchaundi founded China. The country is indeed named after him. Some are familiar with the recently unearthed terra cotta army. It is a historical epic of how he ended the Period of Opposing States and United China. He founded a dynasty that was only 14 years old, but it was immediately replaced by the Han dynasty which has since permanently defined Chinese civilization. <br /> <br /> Chin (or the King of Zheng as he was known before he founded the empire) was about the same time with Scipio, Hannibal, and Fabius in the West. The parallel Roman world domination (Western and Eastern worlds) was achieved without a single high personality like Chin. It will not be in the west of Caesar for another century - the closest comparable Western figure. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Chin is very sympathetic, but he develops a relentless despot during the film. History only records the reckless despot part, but the sympathetic begins to leave room for true character development over the course of this long film. The well-known story about meeting the killer is as true as any two thousand-year-old anecdotes can be. Gong Li is beautiful. She is the emotional core of the story. It makes everything a good movie.
