Linda Blair has been active for forty years and while she will never escape the part of Regan MacNeil in The Exorcist, few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status to such an extent as Witchery does. She plays Jane Brooks, a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to a deserted island hotel that her parents want to buy. They are accompanied by a few estate agents (Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth). On arrival on the island, they meet a photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his writer friend (Leslie Cumming) who illegally crack in the hotel while examining the legend of a local witch (Hildegard Knef). It turns out that a long-witch witch hunt caused her suicide and she was with the child at the time. Unaware of the danger, Jane recently dreamed of the witch's dramatic death, and Jane's little brother, Tommy (Michael Manchester), is more directly visited by her haunting black clothes spirit, which he calls "the black woman." The group's time at the island inn starts quiet enough; Unknown to them, but the Lady in Black has already sent the captain of their hired boat (George Stevens). The isolation and cold have long started to affect everyone, and it is during this period of mood and tension that the woman in black starts her reign of terror. She plans to avenge her own fate by owning Jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child. Each of her other victims fulfills an aspect of her vengeful curse - covetousness, lust, and the blood of a virgin. As the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild, they beat one by one in horrible, horrible ways. The island's location is frightening and the inn is very creepy and spooky. It's such a colorful movie that reminds me of Dario Argento's work. The lighting is excellent and the decoration is perfectly ghostly. The soundtrack is very effective and unique. The horror effects are extremely, terrifying and memorable. The cinematography is wonderful, and it brings us back to Linda Blair. The creative team behind this movie shoots her like a horror star. It has to be shot a lot: very dramatic inputs, dipping close-ups, which give Jane's increasing ownership and moments reminiscent of other great horror movies. There is hidden tribute to "Rosemary's Baby", "Jacob's Ladder", "The Shining", "Black Sunday" and of course "The Exorcist". She does a good job and absolutely steals the show with her mood and underestimated performance. It is not to say that the rest of the throw is disappointing; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good, and veteran exporter Annie Ross is unforgettable like Jane's bitch mother Rose. Hasselhoff gives his best, but he is not essentially a movie star, and his television person gets in the way of his performance. Blair and young Michael Manchester have a wonderful chemistry together. The movie is otherwise so violent and in a good way that it needs their warmth. (Blair also played a mother in "Monster Makers" in 2003, and her mother's screens in the movie have the same feel to them). Finally, Hildegard Knef (in one of her last roles) plays a big witch, and she has the amazing voice and accent. She was also thrown perfectly with Blair. But this is Blair's movie all the way. Jane Brooks also has some psychic abilities, and this aspect of the movie goes back to "Exorcist II: The Heretic". I think "Witchery" is there with "The Exorcist", "Exorcist II", "Hell Night" and "Summer of Fear" as Blair's best genre works to date.
