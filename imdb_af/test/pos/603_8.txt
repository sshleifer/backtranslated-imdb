Yes, it is very interesting to look at it. Half of the people involved are now dead. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's been a long time since I watched anything Muppet, but it is pure gold. I'm a big fan of puns, and this movie put them pretty well, but one of its wonderful aspects is its pacing: it's not really high-speed children's pacing where the filmmakers just decide to move the story together no. The character's depth, it's just a kind of move along with the characters they want to go to. <br /> <br /> Kermit the frog is just a wonderful character. His voice and the expressions on his puppet show are fantastic. But especially, he shows why he is popular - "he can also sing and make jokes!" - but more appropriate why he is so engaging - he inspires everyone to look for their dreams without any effort. Meanwhile, he also has to deal with himself, which is an unusual theme in family flies. <br /> <br /> It also contains quite a few ensembles of comedians that perform here and there, some to great effect, others to a little less (I think Mel Brook's part was just a little overplay, or how ?). Some parts of the movie are just kind of strange. But it is highly imaginative and takes itself to the same destination of a completely different direction. <br /> <br /> Right along ... <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
