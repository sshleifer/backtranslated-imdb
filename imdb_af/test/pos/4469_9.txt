Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films such as The Beyond and Zombie, was a master of Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) years ago with films like a lizard in a woman's skin and his masterpiece, Don't Torture a Duckling. This movie has all the elements of the Italian puzzle / thriller genre known as the giallo, but really captures the viewers by having each key character with a skeleton in its own closet. It keeps you so much investigated as the detectives in the movie itself. Who kills the young boys in town? The young rich woman who is so bored that she sexually disregards the ultimate victims, the reporter who likes to tamper with a crime scene to get a better photo shoot, the townwoman with a mentally retarded daughter, the local witch, village idiot. .. the list goes on, and you need to keep spiritual notes as a real game to play and solve. The themes in this film are very daring and done with the perfect Italian style in the early 1970s. It is certain that no American studio has even considered making a movie of such a strong content, and that is exactly why it is such a satisfying film (despite some unusual accent choices for dubbing) and will definitely have people discuss its meaning long afterwards. As it is said, they no longer do so, so get a copy and cherish an important movie like this!
