"In the mood for love", a plague of allegory of loneliness and longing. Here is a movie without sex, or even kissing - and this is undoubtedly one of the sexiest and certainly the most thoughtful and psychological novels I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Tell the story of two people who happen to be living in the same apartment and a door apart. The movie, like and other than "Random Hearts," is about how two people come together through the relationship between their two lovers. Only when they receive this news do they take the time to think about the consequences of a relationship and each other's feelings of being just broken - and whether the two people are willing to fall back in love. /> <br /> As far as the movie is concerned, the way director Wong Kar-Wai presents the character of each character's loneliness. With Maggie Cheung's character, he will show her in a repeated montage: leave work, go home, watch her neighbors gamble, head to the noodle shop, leave the noodle shop and bump into her handsome age-matched games. by Tony Leung. It's a clever, if not subtle, and knowing technique to present loneliness. Because this is when you are alone, if you fall into a loop. This movie worked for me because I can identify with that feeling.
