With long-awaiting network television programming, I remember the first time I had an episode of "Police Group!" Captured. It was completely by accident. It was during the show's initial network, early in 1982 on ABC. I'm a chronic channel surfer and got a night out when suddenly "Police Squad!" His credit line appeared on my TV screen. I immediately recognized it as a record of the opening credits of "M-Squad" with Lee Marvin, one of my all-time favorite police shows. I stopped navigating. Then, of course, the headquarters followed, followed by the immortal Rex Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln. By this time I told myself, "What is the gate, is it?". Then came the "special guest star" Georg Stanford Brown through a plummeting safe. I was from that moment on. The episode was "Ring of Fear / A Dangerous Assignment", with its comic references to "On The Waterfront" and "Muhammed Ali", but most memorable were, of course, all the gags and non-successors. Leslie Nielsen and Alan North in their loose parody of Lee Marvin and Paul Newlan of "M Squad" was an absolute riot. "Finally," I told myself, "A network television program is really worth watching !!!". Don't want it to be canceled just a few weeks later. Leave it to the networks - I had to know. Anyway, I just bought the DVD collection of all six episodes and they are just as funny today as they were 27 years ago. The "Naked Gun" movies were also fantastic, but I really missed Alan North (he was as good as Ed Hocken), Peter Lupus and Nordberg (what did they think to throw in that part?), And especially William Duell said Johnny "the shoeshine man. Good.
