This movie is full of surprises, many of them funny. The fact that it is written and directed by a 24-year-old blows my mind. Some of the screens where high school children use ecstasy made me very uncomfortable because I had a child who was old and I could use her photo using it. As a parent of a teenager, I found that the images of parent-child interactions were dead, accurate. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie's very little jokes, and I enjoyed the fact that everything didn't make it perfectly healthy. And not all the problems have been resolved by the end. To paraphrase Mark Twain, the truth is strange as fiction, because fiction is required to stick to what is possible, while the truth is not. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that plays with the viewer so we can believe people are what other people think they are, just to let us realize later that the people we accepted were right , was totally ignorant of the real situation. One of the strongest scenes of the film, a scene that we feel very relieved and sympathetic about what the character does, seems to be quite wrong and the character, while admirable, is completely wrong. It's done very subtly, I think. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> I liked the score a lot - I thought it really helped the movie, really helped set the mood. The movie has some screwball moments, and the background music helps determine that. <br /> <br /> The valedictive speech is a little and a half - has a great laugh! The movie is really in my head now - saw it this morning. Will try to see it again, time. Ten are hard to come by, but a fixed nine in my book.
