I like this movie. I'm not a big horror movie buff, so I couldn't comment on similarities between these and other movies of this genre, but I have been captivating this movie. The story line, though a little obvious, has a few scary moments and the play (especially the lead role of the female role) was not bad anyway. Overall, I'm a little surprised at the low rating this movie received. I watch a lot of movies (working in a video store is likely to help) and it's really not as bad as people think. I do have some criticism. The last call from the policeman was terrible, almost obsolete, the dead girl in the bathroom seemed to have had a little sleep (probably from the amount of tequila she mentioned that she was drinking) and the children's response to what happened, hoping they were eventually killed <br /> <br /> hoping it helps some people
