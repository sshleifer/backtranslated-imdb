Less than zero could be the 80's movie showing teenage apathy in its extreme form, they actually held onto the damn book. But where they haven't been, these movie presents work and let you feel the creepiest when it's all in ways not done until late nineties with Larry Clark's 'Kids' and 'Bully' movies. <br /> <br /> Social extinct teens are faced with a rather strange dilemma (they don't treat it much like one) when their estranged friend (Daniel Roebuck) boasts with them a teenage girl near the edge of the river killed in their suburban town. Keanu Reeves may be the only civilized character under the bush, the only one willing to show any kind of conscience, while the other also does nothing about the girl's death or wants to help hide their friend's body. <br /> <br /> I don't know who is more ill in this movie - Crispin Glover - who becomes almost obsessive and paternal to protecting the friend and hiding the crime by smuggling him out of the state. . Dennis Hopper, a former drug dealer (who is clinging to a female blowup doll) who gets in touch with the teenagers (like a dealer) and suddenly becomes involved in the events. Or, Josh Miller, who is Reeve's little brother, Tim. He seems to be the most apathetic of them all, at least until his emotional collapse at the end. It's certainly not peppy 80s teenage rate, of course. And certainly, the point is remarkably clear about the serious debauchery that these children deal with (despite a bizarre series of events) thanks to many good performances everywhere (even Reeves has some stage ability). Help yourself recover a comedy if it sounds too loud to you.
