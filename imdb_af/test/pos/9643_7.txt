As I type this comment, I watch a DVD of this movie I just got from a mail order dealer, and I find it very good, with strong characterizations, credible situations, and well-directed action scenes. . <br /> <br /> It has been a good 45 years, maybe 50, since I saw HELL BELOW, but the one scene that made a deep impression on me was Sterling Holloway's death scene, which several others commentators mentioned here. . I haven't found this scene yet, but I can make sure what other comments have said. When you see Sterling Holloway's death scene in this movie, you'll never forget it. Judging by the strength of the film so far, I fully expect the scene to remind you - as one of the greatest deaths in film history. The movie is worth seeing for that moment alone, but even without it, it will be a first class early submarine drama.
