Waco: Rules of Commitment do a very good job not to draw conclusions for his viewers. It simply provides interviews, footage from the standoff, footage of congressional hearings, telephone conversations, expert evidence, etc. And enable you to draw your own conclusion. <br /> <br /> I'm hardly going to suggest that the data presented here is done with 100% objectivity, but it's very convincing. You will no longer like Koresh if you have seen it as you did earlier, but I tend to think you will believe. As I do now, there are many that we have not told about what happened before and during the downhill. .
