PLACE IN A HELL: Dave Seville, father figure and manager of Chipmunk brothers Alvin, Simon & Theodore, went on a business trip to Europe and left the boys at home with me. Miller as their viewer, to the Alvin chagrin, who wanted to go to Europe. While playing against his female counterpart, Brittany, the leader of the Chipettes, consisted of her younger sisters Jeanette (Simon's female counterpart) and Eleanor (theodore's female counterpart) in a fierce arcade game from Around the World in 30 days, they get the attention of two evil strangers who need brothers and sisters to smuggle money and diamonds around the world, but have a way to do it that will not pay attention to their arch-enemy Jamal do not pull. The two evil brothers and sisters, Claudia & Klaus, dominate the rogue between Alvin and Brittany and decide to use it as the delivery boys and girls for their booty. (More Claudia's idea as Klaus's, the latter initially feels that it is too dangerous for children). The 2 brothers and sisters make an offer to the boys and girls - travel through air balloons to 12 points to leave dolls (which look like kids) containing diamonds and / or money to indicate their arrival, with the promise that each one winning the race will get an obscene amount of money. But since the two different kinds of talking brothers and sisters make their rounds, they are stolen by Jamal's henchmen - but who is Jamal? Is he a friend or an enemy? <br /> <br /> GENERAL: Enjoyable, light-hearted farce based on the 1980s TV series version of Alvin & the Chipmunks. Beautiful animation is a highlight, lacking the rude humor in the family movies today, and songs (Boys & Girls of Rock & Roll are a vantage point). Eagle Eyed fans will probably notice that Brittany's character design has been cut off from the animated series, giving her a less rounded face as she adds a seemingly lasting blush to cheeks (which also shows Jeanette & Eleanor). <br /> <br /> Keep an ear for Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson.
