A wonderful role cast in the modern mystical romance for the intellectuals. Yes, they also need a love story to stir the hidden urges without the Hollywood fluff. All this under the masterful direction of Antonioni and Wenders, who both love to hold his characters in exotic places and break them with long-range shots through the environment. It is wonderful to see that there is a desire in the mid-crisis sector.
