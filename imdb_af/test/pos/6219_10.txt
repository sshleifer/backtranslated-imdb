This captivating film is based on a novel by Arto Paasilinna. The bestseller is one of the best books I've read. Here's the story: <br /> <br /> One day journalist and photographer Kaarlo Vatanen decides to leave his past and start a new life across Finnish forests and countryside. With him he has a companion, a young rabbit hit by a car.
