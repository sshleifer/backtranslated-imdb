Can it really be a Troma movie? Some scenes almost watched an "A" movie. The acting is generally competent (the two lead and the nurse surrogate was especially good, and I liked the confrontations between the young Capulets and Ques); The screens were edited smoothly; the plot is coherent. It's funny. It has a hip, original soundtrack. <br /> <br /> It has the usual Troma rash and low humor, but I don't think Shakespeare would have thought so much. In fact, I think he got some good laughs from this. <br /> <br /> It's a good DVD. There is an alternative soundtrack with a very informative commentary by the director, several scanty scenes, and the usual collection of Troma self-decaying listlessness. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to tell you, it was Citizen Kane, but these are some nicely inspired low-budget movies.
