Nothing is sacred. Just ask Ernie Fosselius. Nowadays everyone has a video camera, and a movie is barely before the spoofs start flying, writing and shooting fast, and is often posted directly on the internet. Spoils are hot nowadays and we go out of our way to make sure that filmmakers do not come to their own interests. 25 years ago, when the first Star Wars was made, it was another world. Filmmaking was the playing field of some selection and spoofs were very rare. Then God gave us hardware wars. It's shot to look cheap (or was it just cheap?) And the sound is obviously recorded after the fact. Away from the experience? HECK NO! It makes it so nice! It was raw and unpolished, and relentlessly hit some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie. From Fluke Starbucker who blows a flashlight instead of a lightbreaker (I did it when I was young!) To Chewchilla the Wookie Monster, after Auggie Ben Doggie's "nah, but a little headache", this movie is Much as much of the phenomenon as any of the real Star Wars movies. Hire it. Buy it. Borrow it from a friend. And may the Farise be with you. Always.
