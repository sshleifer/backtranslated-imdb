Big Fat Liar is a good look for kids of all ages, even adults. I had a good time watching this movie and recommending it to children 10 years and older. The laugh never ends and the adventurous plot is also pretty good! Frankie Muniz is funny and Marty Wolfe is hilarious! Overall, a nicely made movie for kids to enjoy and just have a good time.
