This HTV series is beautiful. I strongly recommend watching the movie. It has everything it belongs to: remarkable writing, strong characters, beautiful scenery and exceptional atmosphere. Add an ambiguous score of Clannad and you'll have an unforgettable picture. I love every HTV adventure movie. I saw: Back to Treasure Island, Smuggler, Adventurer, but Robin from Sherwood knocks them all. I would like to thank the whole HTV production team and Richard Carpenter for giving me lots of adventures and excitement. I released the DVD in my little movie collection. I regret many movies as it is no longer made.
