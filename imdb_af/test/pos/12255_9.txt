If you haven't seen this late 80's movie over the Washington desk of a network news station, if I highly recommend it. This is a sad commentary on the news release in this country, but it tells the story wisely. The characters are well developed and Albert Brooks' performance is fantastic. He delivers all his lines with entertaining, understated comedy. I'm not an Albert Brooks fan at all, so it was a welcome surprise. I have a friend who works as a producer for a local news station and he has suggested that it is close to reality, so kudos to the film writer and director to do their research. <br /> <br /> Fun movie with a lot of insight into the world of network news. It's not as dark as another movie I also recommend in the same genre "Network".
