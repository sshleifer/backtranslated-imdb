I own this video as well as the concert version of the musical with Patti Lupone and George Hearn with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. George Hearn is fantastic in my book, such as Angela Lansbury and the composer Stephen Sondheim. These musicals are operational in scope and show a lot of ingenuity in composition. I definitely hope that this VHS will be available on DVD !! Hearn's performance is hauntingly sympathetic. The one annoying performance is the young woman who sings Joanna's role. I believe this show was at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, rather than on a Broadway stage and I'm not sure the minimalist set in New York was used in this production. But I found the scaffolding towed over the stage to be fairly effective at "portraying" the streets of London. I recommend this movie.
