Whoever other than Troma can take the classic tragedy and change it to today's standards ???? Nobody .... in my opinion the Leonardo DiCaprio sucked. Tromeon & Juliet is a definite stretch of the original Shakesperan tragedy, but it does. She is sick, demented, twisted, yet insane and satisfying. For the most part, it follows the true Romeo and Juliet story, but many Troma elements are added. Will Keenan gives a good performance as Tromeo. The play is solid and the story is wonderful. Many people look beyond these movies, not just the Kaufman Troma movies, but all that they distribute. Certainly Troma movies are an acquired taste, but you should see it. This is an apostate movie entertainment.
