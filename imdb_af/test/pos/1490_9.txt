Rowan Atkinson presents an unforgettable performance as the clueless Mr. Bean who never goes far without his Teddy Bear. The appeal of Mr. Bean is largely his childish behavior and innocence. We don't know if he came from the air or another planet. He's the kind of weird character you can't easily make. He is often alone and used to it. He has a difficult time communicating through speech, and that is why we sometimes hear his grunts. There are other characters talking to him and he is responding. The character of Mr. Bean is a mystery and still is. He stays alone and does the unthinkable when he can do the sensible thing. Mr. Bean is rather a strange man who doesn't care much about it. He rather lives a simple life with his yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to work on time.
