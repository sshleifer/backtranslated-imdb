This film is a wonderful example of the quality plays made by Channel 4 and the BBC over the years. Ted Danson delivers a powerful performance of a man who is tormented by memories that no one will accept and a society that believes he is insane. It's a remarkable show by a man known for his role in Cheers, a TV comedy sitcom. The supporting role was all very well chosen, not particularly Mary Steenbergen, Danson's wife, who is the part of Gulliver's wife in the film. But above all, it's the seamless and very delicate shifts between our world and Gulliver's world that makes this movie. The difference in perspective between giants and midgets, all of which are performed by active actors, is beautifully captured. A rare treat of cinematography and direction.
