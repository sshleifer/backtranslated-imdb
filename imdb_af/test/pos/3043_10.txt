I saw the movie for the first time a little more than a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times. I have never heard of it and I consider myself an expert in classical theater. A real, polished diamond in the rough. <br /> <br /> This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character "Conrack") as a young teacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the children of the islands, all in one school. Initially, the students reveal that they know very little about the world beyond their island home. The heart of the movie is Conrack to find inspiration to awaken their young minds to the world around them. The students quickly rewarded their teacher with an eagerness to learn and a remarkable ability to understand concepts that were just a short while before they were strange. Conrack uses unconventional and smart teaching techniques that happen, oh a little fun! The Lord preserves. Learn and Fun? Together? Can't be or say those in charge. To avoid a spoiler, I will just say that Conrack finds resistance to the boss ... and the end is really bitter sweat. <br /> <br /> I am a 35 year old white man with a teaching experience, so I have to identify with the main character, Pat Conroy (aka, Conrack, Petroy). But I don't know, I identify with the black children. As a child, from the 4th to the 6th grade, about 1979, I was hired to school on the other side of town. These kids in the movie then remind me of my classmates. Fortunately, in 4th grade as an 8 or 9 year old, you don't understand racism. I just remember we were all kids, playing 4-square, kickball, hide and seek and running relays. <br /> <br /> This movie is moving a lot. There are wonderful and gripping moments from start to finish, non-stop. I often found myself tearing in my eyes and suddenly laughing out loud. It's a funny movie. <br /> <br /> "Get away from that wind !!" .... Sir, if you are willing to accept crap, I must tell you that it has just done so in your lap "....." So, you, the white schoolmaster, Mr Conrack. My grande loves Mr. Conrack. You're a nice teacher, you're a pretty white man. "....." wind 15 mph of Great Oceans, don't worry "nothing." .... "Not a broiler, but Eleanor Roosevelt, not a crockery, but (something Latin) ... it's Latin. She's waiting!" .... "Conrack sings like a frog." .. I sing well, what are you talking about?! ". <br /> <br /> I still find myself hearing nothing about this movie or that it has very little reputation or consequence. I plan to search for more reviews, comments, backgrounds, and "make" dots if they're out there. What surprised me is the actions of the untrained children. One of the kids, Mary, I understood was an actress, and you can tell. The other children, however, have many lines and real reactions. I wonder how they did it! I guess Conrack and Mary had precise dialogue to work with while some of the screens unfolded naturally or ad-libbed. <br /> <br /> Conrack is a special movie. In my opinion, this is one of the very few movies that are so good and so unknown. Others in this category are King Rat ('65), Dark Passage ('47 with Bogie and Bacall), God's Must Be Crazy ('80) and Bad Day at Black Rock ('55). I recommend them all. But first you sit in the class of Mr. Conrack.
