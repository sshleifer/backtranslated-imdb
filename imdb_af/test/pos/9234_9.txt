It's a very funny movie. There is a self-deprecating, iconoclastic tone to the film that is very attractive. The characters are interesting. The movie flows very well and keeps your interest throughout the 1 hour, 50 minute duration of the movie. The film quality is not of the highest Hollywood standards; but the original movie is supposed to be made in the genre of an avid punk rock style. The documentary about the attempt to make the movie and the subsequent treachery of the filmmakers is very detailed and easy to follow. The original filmmakers themselves become the main characters in the documentary version of the movie. The interviewers of the filmmakers and the actors are composed of a highly entertaining story that sets out the struggle involved in making the original film, the ultimate failure of the original project and the pheno-like emergence of the ashes in this documentary film. have, illustrate. . In my mind, the documentary (a Texas Tale or Treason) is a much more interesting and entertaining movie than the original movie (Waldo's Hawiian Vacation) ever. Two thumbs for a good job.
