It was really a tense and dark episode. Excellently executed, wonderful acting and atmospheric direction, 'Ice' is one of my favorite episodes. Along with 'Pusher' 'Grotesque' 'Wetwired' and 'Home' (it's pretty good in the dark atmosphere in my case). It seems to me quite realistic, their paranoia, their suspicions and their ever-growing anger are perfectly executed by the great actors. But 'Ice' had a problem I got after a few watches: it was too short! I wanted more! <br /> <br /> Overall, 'ice' had 98% of all X Files episodes: Excellent acting, Intense story writing, eagerly directed. All the works. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
