I generally love SRK as a villain (how can you not?) And I believe that SRK and Juhi are a perfect match on the screen as they are both nicer than beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie is great to watch, although it has some big mistakes: <br /> <br /> 1) The good guy (Sunny) - he's not just as attractive as Shahrukh (which, in my opinion, is so important in Bolly films), but his role is lacking - it would be much better if there was a conflict between two strong personalities. Instead, we have a conflict between a personality and an average soldier. <br /> <br /> 2) Kiran and Sunil's response to Rahul's actions is incredibly stupid and naive even for a Bollywood production <br /> <br /> But that's not so important compared to the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere, good songs (really great) and (let's say it again) Shahrukh as a villain, I just love him when he's so pagal. <br /> <br /> a must-see (along with Anjaam, Baazigar and Duplicate)
