Victor Sjostrom, who is the grandfather of Swedish theater, runs this sharp, existential film on reconciliation, betrayal, death, forgiveness, guilt, salvation and the darkest moments of human condition. He died as David Holm, a no-good name who responded at a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways, only to later negotiate for his soul with the ghost transport manager: death. <br /> <br /> Unlike many silent movies during the period, the film is almost absent-minded with overworking. The pacing, however, becomes boring with his exaggerated Dickensian story. Investigating the film in retrospect and compared to others of his time, it is a very daring and unique movie. Audiences of the time were not exposed to such topics, and cinematography is great, symbolic and accompanied by dual exposure effects and multi-layered flashbacks. It's a really creepy and scary movie for young people. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, it's easy to see the later influences this movie had on Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Most Bergman themes are here on full screen. Sjostrom, of course, later came in Bergman's masterpiece on alienation and loneliness: Wild Strawberries. This will be Sjostrom's final performance as an actor. Sjostrom wrote the novel on a novel by Swedish author Selma Lagerlof. *** of 4 stars.
