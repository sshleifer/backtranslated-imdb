What can I say? You just expect the best in the drama of the BBC and MESSIAH is no exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> MESSIAH is a great excitement, a very shocking and scary story about a serial killer who cuts victims of victims and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of solving the mystery of the seemingly random events before more lives are lost. <br /> <br /> But be warned - in spite of that, it's "15" rating. (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a horrible movie. Some of the murder tones are similar to those in SE7EN, and one or two can be really tummy. But if you can resist it, sit back in your chair and enjoy ... although you will probably be on the edge or hiding. <br /> <br /> Valued '15' by the BBFC for moderate violence and strong terror.
