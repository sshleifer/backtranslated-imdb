The Egyptian was instituted during the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of the ancient world, the Pharaoh Akhnaton, who tried thirteen centuries before Christ to set a monotheistic religion, Athens, to ancient Egypt. However, the main character is not Akhnaton, but rather the fictional Sinuhe. As a baby, Sinuhe is mysteriously found in a basket on the Nile River and adopted by Doctor Senmut and his wife. When he grows to masculinity, he follows his adopted father in the medical profession, who initially (like his father) worked among the poor of the city, but he comes prominently to him and his friend, the ambitious young soldier Horemheb the Pharaoh his life while on a hunting expedition in the desert. Sinuhe is appointed as a court doctor, but is obsessed with the Babylonian officer Nefer. Sinuhe not only ruins himself in a vain attempt to win her love, but is also ashamed when she neglects his duties to save Akhnaton's daughter's life. <br /> <br /> Sinuhe flees into exile, succeeding as a healer in neighboring countries, but back to Egypt when he learns of a Hittite plot to invade. Although Akhnaton easily forgives him for his previous offenses, Sinuhe finds the country uneasy. The Pharaoh's efforts to introduce a new religion led to a civil dispute between his followers and those of the priests of the old polytheistic faith. He is too pacific to take any steps to confront the Hittite threat. Sinuhe is plotted in a plot by Horemheb, now General of the Egyptian Army, and Akhnaton's sister Princess Baketamon, to overthrow Pharaoh and replace him with a more effective monarch. <br /> <br /> The film's weaknesses mostly come from its two romantic subplots. In the course of the film Sinuhe is revealed as the lost son of the previous Pharaoh and half-brother to Akhnaton and Baketamon. So it can surprise a modern audience that she should fall in love with him; The marriage between brothers and sisters was not necessarily considered unstable by the standards of Egyptian royalty, but the standards of 1950s theater groups were generally less liberal. In any case, the Horemheb-Baketamon-Sinuhe love triangle is an unnecessary complication and detracts from Baketamon's role in the movie, that of the voice of the cold, cynical Realpolitik. <br /> <br /> The Nefer subplot, which records most of the first hour of the film, is overwritten and excessively melodramatic. Nefer is morally worthless but fascinating and the role needs an actress of great beauty and also a great dramatic skill to make her credible, especially because Nefer has the difficult task of winning Sinuhe of a woman as nice as Jean Simmons (earning merit, Sinuhe's competitor for her feelings). It is therefore a pity that the role of an actress as comedies was inactive as Bella Darvi, the only qualification being that she was the mistress of the producer, Darryl F. Zanuck. Not only was Darvi a wooden actress, but also spoke with a thick foreign accent, which was made even more incomprehensible by a lash. She was not even particularly attractive when compared to the two legendary Hollywood beauty in the movie, Simmons and Gene Tierney playing Baketamon. <br /> <br /> The movie is better if it focuses on its main political and religious themes. The other actors are better than Darvi, although Peter Ustinov as Sinuhe's servant Kaptah is making the same mistake as in "Spartacus", trying to bring a movie into a movie that doesn't need it. Edmund Purdom, a well-known British actor, starred as Marlon Brando pulled out at the last minute. but more than adequate fills the big man's shoes, although his acting style was quite different. He tackled the challenge of showing the changes in Sinuhe's character, from the worldly idealism to the loving fool, to embittered zeal to the enlightened visionary of the final scenes. Victor Adult was never the most expressive of actors, but he is well-suited to the role of Horemheb, a practical potato man of action. He's better here than in 1954, 'Demetrius and the Gladiators'. Simmons are lightly beautiful as earnings. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding (so far known as second Elizabeth Taylor) plays Akhnaton as a popular philosopher-king who ends up as a kind of holy fool. His inability to make difficult decisions makes him an unsuitable ruler, but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice that gives him an air of moral grandeur, far beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne. Although Athens has more in common with the Supreme Being of the Deity than with the Old Testament Jehovah or the Trinitarian Christian God, there is a deliberate attempt to draw parallels between atheism and Christianity. In the film, the Athenian symbol is the "ankh", undoubtedly chosen because of its similarity to a cross, but in reality it was a general Egyptian hieroglyph for life, not unique to Athens. Akhnaton's language often has a biblical ring; his comparison of himself to "wind whistling in the desert" reminds John the Baptist's "voice crying in the wilderness" (hence the title of this review). Sinuhe's finding in the river corresponds to the Old Testament story of Moses. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Sinuhe, who has become the spirit of the dead Akhnaton, reaches a moral greatness of his own. The message of the film is that, while we need practical workers like Horemheb, we also need visionaries and thinkers who are willing to ask the question why? For all its mistakes, "The Egyptian" is a film that is idealistic and humane in its approach to both religion and politics. 10/07
