It's a great show with total freshness and innovation. That regular seat (bank for a woman) hosts, the mandatory band to play monotonous songs, the same old jokes, the same pattern copied from the days of Nebuchadnezzer .... probably the pattern of Johnny Carson, copied by one and all, Latterman, Leno, Conan ... Daly, this show doesn't look like it. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and I'm going to love it. Although it's too early to say this, it seems that this show is no intellectual pretense that most talk shows are so difficult to project, and I hope it will make the difference to the rest. I hope this show will last a long time! <br /> <br /> Back to months back, I still love this show, and I love his self-muting humor (For example, his confirmation that only pothead loners would be at home watching his performance on midnight Saturday and so the jokes are just funny for the stoned guys, who do not include Conan O'Brien's usual monkey (I know this is a cardinal sin caused by O'Brien's antics, but I really don't like his style and repetition). <br /> <br /> I watched it the other night with Tom Arnold. Ferensen's spoof of Trading Gades (and Nanny 911 in a previous episode) is hilarious. Idiot paparazzi is nice, especially if a security guard warns them to take people's photos, and if I don't make the mistakes, they start shouting his photos "Gary Coleman". <br /> <br /> Added on April 16, 2007: I'm coming back, I'm confused by the neighbor and her dog. I can't decide if it's a joke or a real thing. Anyway, it was funny like hell. <br /> <br /> I don't expect Spike Feresten to read these pages, but maybe. He's more cuddly than a lot of monkeys, and so I'll write my suggestion for him better. I would like him to do a full 30-minute show with Crazy Gideon, the star of the late night TV commercial. I want Crazy Gideon to have an interview in Spike's talk show, sing a song (and play guitar), make a line in SNL's line, and also answer questions from the audience about his potential mayor of Los Angeles (I know, Crazy Gideon may not be aware of that, but there are sites indicating why he will be the perfect candidate for the post of mayor of LA.) <br /> <br /> God Wants! <br /> <br /> Return on July 14, 2007: Someone wrote here that the people who praised Spike's talk prize should be bribed by Spike. I confess that Spike really bribed me, but I must also confess that Rockefeller mentioned me in his will and tonight I had sex with Cindy Crowford.
