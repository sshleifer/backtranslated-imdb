People criticize NSNA because it is a low point in Bond-god Sean Connery's career and because it is not official. *** MAY SPOIL CONTENTS * First of all, this movie is better than any other movie with any actor other than Connery, all the subpar wannabes in my book. Sean Connery is the only true Bond, no one even comes close to his toughness, good looks and sexual appeal. Yes, this movie is a low point in Connery's Bond career, but it is still the best band movie of the 80's. Sean Connery is the only Bond actor who is good at an older age. He did not become a bag like Moore, but kept his good appearance and toughness, but got gray hair. Approximately? hes still the only true 007, and he's so cool, and tough as ever. Sean Connery is the only 007. And this movie is definitely worth seeing, no matter what someone says. No gun opening, but you can't have everything, can you? great theme song, though.
