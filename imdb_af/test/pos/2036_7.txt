ROCK STAR / (2001) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> "Rock Star" is the story of no one known Just to realize that he is living his dream is not the way he proposed it. We've seen it before (in better movies), but this human story makes the world of rock and roll fast with a brutally honest and informative edge. It gives a recommendation because of the visualization of the atmosphere. The script, by "Crazy / Beautiful" director John Stockwell, portrays the hard core universe with memorable images. This does not explain what it is about, it shows us. <br /> <br /> "Rock Star" Originally titled "Metal God," star Mark Wahlberg as Chris "Izzy" Cole, an office chair of Pittsburgh who dreams of Bobby Beers, the fiery lead singer of the heavy metal rock group, Steel Dragon, to become. Although Chris is singing for his own sake, instead of writing his own songs, rock group Blood Pollution has insisted on just performing that of Steel Dragon, and just the way they do it. His group gets annoyed with Chris's obsessions and gives him the boat. <br /> <br /> It destroys Chris, as well as his supportive parents and faithful girl, Emily (Jennifer Aniston's TV friends). He then receives a call. This is the Steel Dragon band. They saw Chris's ties and wanted him to replace the recently celebrated lead singer. At one moment Chris dressed in the most daring world of sudden stars-of the biggest rock fan after the biggest rock star. Unfortunately, it's not as rewarding as he expected. <br /> <br /> A true story inspired the Rock Star concept. An Ohio Solution Salesman, Tim "Ripper" Owens, has replaced Rob Halford, the lead singer in Judas Priest, after initially singing for a tribute. The rest of the movie is probably fiction, but most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands. The film describes the different trials to be a rock star. It explores the aspects of tour, personality differences, the danger of drug abuse and violence, struggling relationships, sexual freedom, dishonesty, and the utmost measures of producers to please the fans and keep the popularity high. <br /> <br /> I've seen Mark Wahlberg's movies, and that's the first thing that made me love. Wahlberg, a former singer / model, made films like "Fear," "Boogie Nights", "Three Kings" and recently Tim Burton's lack of remake "Planet of the Apes". I start to admire the young actor more and more. Although he did not perform in many successful films, he took many chances and did a variety of roles. "Rock Star" is his best movie to date. I can't think of many actors that convincingly portrayed Chris Cole's struggle and aspirations. Wahlberg really makes rock-style rock. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston also lights the screen. She creates a chemistry-rich relationship with Chris that causes audience participation. It's tragic about what happens to their relationship. We care a lot for these characters. <br /> <br /> During the film concerts, director Stephen Herek (who also directed the Holy Man and the vibrant action version of 101 Dalmatians) creates a pleasant atmosphere. He takes the scenes with intense urgency, and a raw, unmistakable energy. The music numbers give the movie the best, most acting scenes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Herek can't stand the energy and grind. At the three-quarter point he loses the spark because the movie becomes dull and unpleasant. I understand where the story goes to portray the negative side of fame, but this movie loses everything that has gone before. In 'Nearly Famous', a much better movie about rock and roll, there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most sad scenes. Here, the filmmakers feel they are losing their passion. <br /> <br /> The message comes a little too late and suddenly in the story. The film is told in a morality that we want to give a juicy destination. The filmmakers can just stop everything, appear on the screen and say, "Now heard the story's morale?" We understand the theme, but it is too instant. The personal discovery for Chris must be gradual. <br /> <br /> Luckily, all this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the movie, barely enough for a full eighty-five minutes of a reasonably good feature. "Rock Star" is not a great movie, see "Almost Famous" if you want a remarkable movie about rock and roll, but for Marky Mark it is a turning point in his career. <br /> <br />
