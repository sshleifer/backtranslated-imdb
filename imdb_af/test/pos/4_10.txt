Unfortunately, this film was under-promoted, but proved to be truly exceptional. When I entered the theater, I didn't know anything about the movie, except that a friend wanted to see it. <br /> <br /> I was taken away with the high quality of the movie. I couldn't play Ashton Kutcher in a serious role, but his performance really portrayed his character. This movie is exceptional and deserves monetary support as opposed to so many other movies. It doesn't get light for me to recommend a movie, but in this case, I strongly advise everyone to see it. <br /> <br /> These movies are truly exceptional!
