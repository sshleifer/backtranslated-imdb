The Kite Runner was beautiful, attractive and very mobile. I especially loved the two child actors in the film, as well as the actor portraying the father. It really made me go back and read the book again. <br /> <br /> The music was a wonderful part of the material of the movie. If there is a soundtrack for the movie, I will buy it to accompany my second reading of the book. It's also a visually beautiful movie. The cinematography was wonderful and really added. <br /> <br /> The Brazilian word "saudades" is very descriptive of how I felt at the end of the movie ... "it's a deep sense of desire for someone or something that is very sweet, but also with an inevitable sadness "(definition provided by Antonio Carlos Jobim years ago). <br /> <br /> See it at a small theater for a preview. I'd love to see it again on a very large screen with a sound sound system. <br /> <br /> Can't wait for the formal release. I would definitely recommend the movie to friends.
