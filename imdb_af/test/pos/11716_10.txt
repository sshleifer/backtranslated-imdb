Master Sharky, you look so ... normal. You will never find a table in this fancy cocktail restaurant / bistro. On the other hand, I eat grapes and pies every day. You like my fur coat with all the fine pruning? My huge gold rings of gold? Or maybe you like this blonde, what do you say? Bomber screens, which are all qualified in aerobics and naked petanques, which decorate my long, maroon velvety sofa like so many soft-boiled farmers on a plate of frying grass and figs. You like? You can't! Zey is mine. <br /> <br /> You will never have "there as I own". Domino was the best, apart from Maman. You do not understand the art of loving ability. Just look at your inferior mustache. It's almost funny to me, not to think of that ridiculous protrusion on your mad face, sniffing over Domino's love hill like the piggy that looks for the truffle in the bush, the bush blowing in the hot winds of desire and swing! You lose Sharky again. <br /> <br /> When I make love to the women they know, Sharky knows they know. They learn, teach them until they become the teacher. Not nano-mathematics, the art of love. Domino was the seedling I watered. I watered her so often. Oral Sharky. Her fragrant petals, her proud stem, everywhere. She will wither under your ridiculous snake, as the souffle removes five minutes from the oven soon. <br /> <br /> Now I have to go to Sharky, you carry me with your shameful behavior. It is you who will be swam, like the smelly thing. <br /> <br /> Bon chance!
