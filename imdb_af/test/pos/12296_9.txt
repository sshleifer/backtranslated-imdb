No one will ever ask the director Leos Carax to be a genius, but what we are wondering about is: is he a bad genius? So many people hated this movie! I am usually the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film L'Enfant and the useless and offensive Feux Rouges). But strangely, I actually think that 'Pola X' is a wonderful movie, made with a great skill and passion by a master of his craft and with striking performances. The movie carries melodrama to more extreme lengths than I have ever seen on the screen. But then Carax is extreme, what we know. The film also features what I consider to be the top Trotskyite or Anarchist fantasies and wet dreams, which set fire to a bunch of young men on the bourgeoisie to play Scott Walker's gun in a band that has his recording sessions. in an abandoned warehouse full of stickers and fires burning in old steel barrels. Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a castle (whose stepmother is Catherine Deneuve, and he walks in her bathroom while she is naked in the bath). But suddenly he suddenly "snaps" when he discovers that his late father, a well-known diplomat, had an illegitimate daughter who was done away with by Deneuve. This is because the sister suddenly emerges as a kind of Romanian refugee with a wild, fearless hair, expressionless face, and little ability to speak French coherently. Depardieu then transforms himself into a 'hero' of half and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and live in hardship and extreme poverty while shooting a great heritage. He then starts a bloody sexual relationship with his half-sister, who is shown in an explicit sex scene that offends many people, although I have no objection, since I think people are too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently this never happens. The intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario an experience of powerful, as well as depressive, hypermelodrama. The differences between Carax making an extreme movie like this and the many extreme French movies I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker and (2) he is seriously trying to make a sensible, extreme emotional state through which one disintegrates and turns against his background. Many will say the extreme elements of this movie were free, but I disagree. I believe Carax was real, and didn't make an exploitation sign at all. It is very difficult to defend a man who goes so far and for everything I know may be a complete man, but I believe he is defending for this remarkable film performance.
