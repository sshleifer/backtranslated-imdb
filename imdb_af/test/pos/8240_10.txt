This well-known comedy from Rut Gordon's hit is a delight. The script, based on the play, is spicy, rich and completely undated. This is the cast, but I must underline the work of the leading lady, Irene Dunne. Irene is just excellent - as usual - and lights up the screen with every frame she's in (and she's very much in it, thanks to the sky). In addition, director Vidor gave her some unusual close-ups that are captivating. What a gal! I know of no other Hollywood actress from any era who has her versatility and is so convincing in every movie. Why she is so little known is a mystery. I saw most of her movies and this one was a surprise, even for a fixed ID fan like me. See it all!
