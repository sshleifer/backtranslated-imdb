good work. This is how I will describe this animated Scooby-Doo adventure. It's so far the best of the animated Scooby movies I've seen. I saw the story. I thought it had some depth. The movie is also good. paced.it is not boring for a minute. It also has an interesting group of characters (except Scooby and Shaggy and the gang of course) plus the movie was a real blast.I have lots of fun watching it. I also liked the great Scottish music. It was very catchy and contagious. Of course, we know that Scooby and the Gamg will solve the puzzle, but it's still fun to come at that point. The animation is also pretty good for this movie. love it if they did a 3d animation Scooby adventure, but we just have to wait and see. For me, Scooby-Doo and the Loch Ness monster are a 7/10
