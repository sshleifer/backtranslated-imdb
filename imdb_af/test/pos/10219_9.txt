This film is primarily managed by Clive Barker. He really knows how to draw a report between the audience and the characters. I think there's a successor missing for this one, Barker had to be dedicated to pursuing this movie instead of the boring Lord of Illusions, which is one I think was a real rubbish. But I also think that NBreed has become a dark cult class of horror movies because of the lack of successor.
