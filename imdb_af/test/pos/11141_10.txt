I loved this movie because Bobbie Phillips can really fight! I always hate when actors are not credible in action parts. It was great to watch, no offense, but a WOMAN who can do and fight versatile art. If you compare it with most action movies with women, you will DEFINITELY see what I mean. They don't have to cut the shots with someone who can fight and it flows better. I was very impressed. I hope there is more!
