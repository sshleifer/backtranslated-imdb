It seems that M.Hazanavicius is back! The man behind the "la classe américaine" comes back with a very nice and smart successor to the old-fashioned OSS-117 ... WHEREAS directors tend to remember "old-classical" successors of ancient classics the avengers, urk), Hazanavicius chose to work on a very cheap hero, OSS-117, a kind of low-budget French 007, and decided to do it at an old school ... The photography, body postures, the fighting choreography and the FX , everything is a tribute to the way films were made in the 50s. And it works, because the tone and jokes of the movie are really good! Jean Dujardin perfectly defends this stupid arrogant-macho-egotistical French spy, lost in a country he just understands in terms of folklore and inferiority. Yes it is, just as the creature used to consider his colonies (then, oh no, I won't say it has nothing to do with what is happening in the same area today ... ah ah) ... He looks just like an uninvolved Lino Ventura, with something like 40 pounds less, perfect for the role. The other cast members also fit perfectly, with everything you could dream of Russian spies, Egyptian independents and former Nazis. And of course the women, like in good spying "femmes" movies ... The plot is good (maybe not brilliant, but really good enough ...), takes place between real-world facts and reminds us of " a funny way France (and the others) treated his colonies in those days. It all started in 1955 with a British spy disappearing while a Russian load of weapons was found in Suez. Then France sent his best friend, agent OSS-117, to discover what happened to both the consignment and the agent ... The fact is that this agent is really as stupid as he can be and he slips through the story without first understanding it and resolving it in a very clouseau-esquire way. I have to say I had a bad feeling about the movie, because the publicity about it was rather scary, and like French humor tends to be populist and flat (forget lessons bronzés 3 or camping ...), but I was really surprised, and in the good way! I highly recommend whether you want a good parody of Bond esquire movies (much more fun than in DEBS, for example, but fewer skirts) or you are a fan of the right and true way of filming what they in the 5's. . Yeah, it's smart and (really!) Funny, you got the point again Mr Hazanavicius!
