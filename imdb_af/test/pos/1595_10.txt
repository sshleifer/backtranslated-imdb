If all the movies had to be destroyed and only one could be saved, the Death in Venice would be. This is a monument in film history. Many criticized that it is slow, boring and obvious (an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed, first spiritually, then physically), we must appreciate this movie for what it is. 'Morte a Venezia' was shot more than 30 years ago, and it began another period in the early twentieth century. <br /> <br /> Life was slow, compared to now. People had to behave in a certain way and hide their true emotions, even from themselves. Director Visconti and Dirk Bogarde, the leading actor, succeed in showing how the aging composer, von Aschenbach, discovers his romantic interest in a young boy. For a man like Von Aschenbach, in his time, it had to be a shock too powerful to talk to. We see his inner struggle, mostly on the face of Bogarde, against the beautiful backdrop of Venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music compiled by Gustav Mahler. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, it doesn't deny it. No special effects, car hunters or fights to hold the audience. No twisted sex scenes; the interaction between man and son is limited to stolen tins from far and on occasional smiles. <br /> <br /> So, basically, nothing happens in this movie? Not if you want your senses to be hit as a base drum. If you want them to be played like a violin in a romantic concert, it's the movie to do it.
