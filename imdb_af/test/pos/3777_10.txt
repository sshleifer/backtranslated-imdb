Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde. <br /> <br /> Michael McGuire was the father. <br /> <br /> Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon. <br /> <br /> Have you even seen this movie? ? I doubt it! <br /> <br /> Blankfield was pretty popular at this time to play the piling doctor on Fridays. Thomerson is funny in everything he does, from movies to series to uprising comedy. If I ever get this movie on DVD, I'll definitely buy it. I recorded this HBO movie back in '82 and pretty much exhausted the band. One of the funniest ones ever takes the Jekyll & Hyde theme. <br /> <br /> Of course. With all the cocaine references in this movie, today it will be too politically wrong, such as Cheech and Chong. Too bad because it is FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY!
