This movie was one of the movies on the floor I've ever seen. Danny De Vito plays perfect Owen. Momma was excellently portrayed and was one of the highlights of the movie. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, it starts differently than you'd expect. Larry tries to write a book and has problems. Larry learns a writing school and Owen marks after Larry tried to read his story. Owen eventually asks Larry to kill his mother, and Owen will kill Larry's ex-wife's adultery. The whole movie was really hilaries. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end Owen writes "Throw Momma from the Train". Larry was furious because he just wrote a book of similar plot. It seems that Owen wrote a children's picture book. <br /> <br /> I really recommend this movie. I gave it a 10.
