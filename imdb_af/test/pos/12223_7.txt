I like the show, but come-writers get some action in it! Stop dragging it on and off. You have a good concept and it can be a lot more. Miles (Jenkins) is wonderful and performs as a child who has to act in the situation in which he finds himself. Hey, get creative with the creatures, they can have telepathic abilities or other extraterrestrial powers. The children's activities in the series are very good and convincing. The parents of Miles seem to be a little too out-of-mind about what's going on, but develop it, come on! you have a good seed here and there can be a whole new season with many new characters and creatures and all sorts of neat sci-fi stuff. If they could make a series on a witch, you should be able to make one on these creatures and children.
