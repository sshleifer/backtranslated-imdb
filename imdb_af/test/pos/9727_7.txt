Apparently a B-movie ... B has to stand for Better acting and a better message than we get in big budget "A" today. Contemporary films aimed at young women are certainly not designed to encourage depth of character over level self-control ... or increase the self-esteem of young girls who do not meet "female" standards. (The criticism of the fake and flashy, like this movie, will not help sell more girls-dependent products. * Not satisfied with their natural features or inner beauty.) <br /> <br /> Day is like a mechanically inclined tomboy that borders "in the rooms" and confesses an inability to flirt. His ties with Robert Cummings due to similar interests, a shared sense of humor, and her honesty, loyalty and good friendship he appreciated over the superficial "charm" of her selfish glamor girl sister. own selfish, reckless playboy tendencies). Although Laraine is also beautifully beautiful, it is refreshing to appreciate inner beauty more, and depicting true friendship that leads to the most fulfilling romantic relationship. I wish young girls (and guys) got this message from the ground today. <br /> <br /> Perhaps as Hollywood returns to make "B" movies, with modest budgets, and trying to be content with modest profits ... what do I say? The sacrifice of the spiritual mentality to create something sincere on a smaller scale would be like a man expects to give up the shit for a sweet girl who really cares for him. It's crazy talking. <br /> <br /> If someone already invents a time machine! I belonged in 1940. <br /> <br /> I will see this movie higher, but the end is a bit too sudden, and maybe it didn't have enough indication of Robert Cummings's heart change. (I like the fact that B-movies are short and funny, not bloated and self-sufficient, but this one may need more than 70 minutes.) Also found that it is somewhat unrealistic that a widow and young children are so unaffected. will be through a sudden death in their family ... or be so forgiving of the one who caused it. I mean, I think it's * nice *, but a little more raw or bitterness would have been natural. Perhaps a deliberate choice to act on this family to relieve their loss, to reduce the impact of the tragedy and to make sure we forgive those involved in death - since this is just a plot device anyway. is not the right point of the movie. Still strange already.
