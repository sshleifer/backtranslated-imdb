I only saw this movie for a short while. If you ask me, it won't get the credit it deserves. It's a bit like American Pie meets Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but with more depth. It deals with the same issues as both movies, but in a way that contains some truth. The end is sad, but that's how life is. I think everyone should see it. I did it on DVD, and it took so long to find it too. It has to say something, heh and another thing I add is that it's hard to find the soundtrack. I believe they stopped it, but the soundtrack to this movie is wonderful. It has songs by artists such as The Commodores, U2, Devo, REO Speedwagon, The Cars, KC and the Sunshine Band, and many more.
