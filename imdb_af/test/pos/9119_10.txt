I saw this movie on a fly. I went on the 42nd street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started free tickets for a preview of this movie. I gave it a chance not to expect much. The walls did not arrange the film. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a young rocker traveling to learn the heavy metal craft and art. Leave it there. The movie is a heavy comedy and a lot of fun. If you're old enough to remember when Heavy Metal dominated the music scene in the eighties, you're going to love this movie. Jack Black is an incredibly talented comedian and actor and as if he really wrote and performed the songs in this movie, he is also a talented musician. <br /> <br /> Tenacious D is definitely worth it!
