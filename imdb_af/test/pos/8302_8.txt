It's a real gem of corny sci-fi! Peter Cushing adds a great personality to this midnite movie classic. <br /> <br /> I especially like the sound design. The strange, bumpy voices of the creatures and the rhinos all create a bizarre background. (Of course, the skinny baby does not hurt either!) <br /> <br />
