After 10 years it's finally reasonable to say that our Belgian Action Star is back. I personally found that this one is even better than Wake Of Death, which makes it his best movie in ... 10 years !! Well, it's not like his highs like Timecop, Universal Soldier, Sudden Death or even his best effort to date. Hard Target (one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors John Woo.) The action is OK, the story is exciting, the dialogue is pretty funny, this one is better than expected. The bad guys are great as in Hard Target, and the battle scenes are "old school". Real fans know what to expect. I must say, I handed him over, but Van Damme is finally back. More please ....
