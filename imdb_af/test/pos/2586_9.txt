Just came back from seeing Black Snake Moan. I read time to read reviews ... most have focused on the obvious ... "skinny white girl linked to a black man's radiator" ... I hate when "critics" point to a movie is missing. Now I think it helps to stay in Memphis ... and I also lived in Mississippi a few times. It can also help me to be the former director of the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale ... but I get this movie. Brewer's simple "salvation story" is easy to follow and could have had several themes to tell the story ... but I believe it is very effective as a "blues". It will be my hope that people will not read all the hype ... and / or several reviews ... and miss a very good movie. Get past the different things like skinny girls in white panties. Get past Justin Timberlake, accept his character Ronnis (which he plays very well) ... Past Snakes on a Plane and see how mercuricul Samuel L. Jackson is ... as he transformed himself into a very credible Mid-South blues man. If you know little of the Mid-South culture, it is possible to make a bit like cartoon ... but accept the fact that Craig Brewer KNOWS how to paint the canvas and tell the actors the story and you will enjoy this movie. No one to tell ends ... so look at this movie ... and yes, I will agree with one thing the critics have done ... the music is great!
