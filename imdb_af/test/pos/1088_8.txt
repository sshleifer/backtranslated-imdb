No music. No dumb masala. A fairly realistic depiction of the police system in India and based on a real "meeting" specialist in India, Daya Nayak. This is Ab Branch 56 (56 symbolizes how many criminals killed "Sadhu Agashe" the lead - well, you both know). Brilliance gives Nan Patekar the role of a relaxed and calculating Indian policeman. The plot, although slightly predictable for review, is intriguing, just one of Ram Gopal's Vermas The Factory's movies, which is decent or really good, Ab Tak CHappan meanders near very well. India released, including commercial and artworks. <br /> <br /> What is great is the storytelling that is relaxed and ultimately (in an Indian movie) showing how the police network works, but seriously the one linen is funny like hell (although I don't know if the caption version will look so funny). The producers are trying a Cannes edition, which is interesting. Made by debut director Shamit Aman (I think it's his name). /> <br /> Again 55 yo Nana Patekar is brilliant from his foolish screaming roles of the past just show what a good director can do with a good actor. Really good stuff. If you are interested in Indian movies and are confused by the nonsense, this is definitely a relief. We are Patekar, the man wearing the film on his shoulders, and the style of the movie - relaxed, funny, intelligent and calculating. Good dialogues, good acting, beautiful direction in everything. Good things. Recommendations: Gangaajal, Ram Gopal Verma's Company (both Indian flashlights)
