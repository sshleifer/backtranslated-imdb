As soon as I knew that Donald Sutherland (Jack Shaw / Henry Fields) had appeared in this movie, it immediately told me it would be a good picture to see. Most of Sutherland's photos are full of action and excitement and he can play a rather cruel character and can also be very charming and good. In this photo, Jack Shaw did his best to be a good guy and a bad guy while erecting a Naval Office to become a spy that had to change his entire identity and become another person at night . There are many car hunt scenes and many stuntman situations I don't want to perform. This naval officer lived with his wife in a quiet community and was a father, but you will never admit that fact until the film reveals his horrible background secrets that he had to keep from his family and friends. Good spying movie and great acting by all the actors.
