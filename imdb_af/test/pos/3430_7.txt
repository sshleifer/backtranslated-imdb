This solid black and white slapstick comedy with a dark (but hopelessly confronted) plot is a real crowd that will make you cry with laughter (as well as your eyes with disbelief). This is the old psychopath on a train story, but it is of no importance, as the brand new part of the film is almost a counterweight to the antiques of the great comedian, Robert Gustafsson. His unfortunate, almost incurable, optimistic soldier calls both compassion and shame in a way that is almost against Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> However, the thing about the movie that has addressed me the most is that it is between the unlikely and The hilarious is the accurate portrayal of everyday joys and obstacles of train travel. They add a welcome feeling of realism and recognition. <br /> <br /> This thriller comedy borrowed most of his "Hitchcock's suspense" and, in my opinion, should only look at the comedy value (which is highly indeed). Besides Gustafsson, Lars Amble's solid performance as a wonderful cynical misogynist is the price of admission alone. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
