You know sometimes, you just have to get it? So this movie is with me. I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I like it, it's so goofy in some parts, but I find myself in it when I'm down and just need a good laugh ... and trust me, I'm just not a "goofy movie" kinda guy. <br /> <br /> You can read the synopsis, so you do not have to endure, but rest assured. If you like Kelsey Grammer, you'll probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> One more thing, be sure to look at the end credits. You don't have to read it, just look at them and take the presentation of "In the Navy" by the Village People ... and friends.
