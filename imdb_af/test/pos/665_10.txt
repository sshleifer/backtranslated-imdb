It's the 1980s and the teens are ready to clean it up in a scary old house rumored to haunt the ghost of Murder McGee. After the dead were wrongly plucked by an unfinished conversation at a Ouija board, the children were forced to fight to death that fought a fiery spirit, which owned and killed one of their friends. Sounds familiar? This is supposed to. It's clearly marketed to pay tribute to the classic 80's slashers with the tagline: "Excessive violence. Free-of-charge nudity. Zero budget." <br /> <br /> Can't get enough; It's pure entertainment! I enjoyed the humor and the way it played in all the horror cliches, but at the same time embracing the fun of movies from this time. There is something you get with this movie you never got with the old 80's treasure movies: good acting. The whole movie was very talented and you didn't see much in any low budget cookies, recently or otherwise. There was a lot of chemistry between the characters. I was very entertained by the whole movie, and I am quite convinced that the writer / director and role player will go a long way in their separate careers. The script was very well written and the dialogue flowed naturally. <br /> <br /> The effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not well lit, but the fact that this movie acknowledges its cover was virtually NO BUDGET, I already know. This movie makes it easy to politely ignore and just sit back and enjoy. Although not an Oscar-winning opus, it never claims, and props for it. It's great fun. If you like slashers, you will appreciate this movie very much. If you like blood and boobies, you'll appreciate it too.
