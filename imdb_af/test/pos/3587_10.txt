The Blue Planet series is undoubtedly one of the biggest documentaries ever made on the ocean. For five years, filmmakers have tirelessly worked on the series, the material never seen by anyone (that is, titled The Deep.) <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this series . To see the fisherman outside the little pictures in textbooks is a real surprise, but just a needle in the big haystack of the sea that covers Blue Planet. From the open sea to tidal pools, coral sea to the deepest darkest part of the sea itself, the BBC takes the viewer on an almost magical journey through the sea. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that one of my earliest dreams in life was a marine biologist, and after seeing this series, the dream was revived. I have been studying the oceans of this world for years and have seen numerous documentary programs on coral reefs and dolphins, whales and crustaceans. But in everything, no one has managed to capture life under the waves, as well as this group of people. <br /> <br /> Watching the 'Blue Planet' in its entirety, I promise you won't regret it.
