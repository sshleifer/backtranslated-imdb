Chucky is back, but this time he's not scary - but he's funny! <br /> <br /> When Chucky is brought back (in the doll, of course) by his old truck's trailer, Tiffany, he immediately kills her and also turns her into a doll. Tiffany and Chucky are now up to date with 2 high school graduates - okay !! <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie - it's great fun. It's scary, funny, strange, wacky and stupid in everything! <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10.
