While the 5 stars are noticeable, this one makes a must see. <br /> <br /> Based on a stage play, the SILVERORDE is about the "mother love" at its worst. The film was very controversial for his implied homosexuality of the younger boy and the mother's unnatural "romantic" feelings for both boys. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne stars as the new bride (and biologist) traveling with a man (Joel McCrea) to visit the family before going to New York City for their new job. But something looks wrong. <br /> <br /> The mother, Laura Hope Crews, seems rude to the younger son (Eric Linden) fianc√© (Frances Dee). But Dunne sets aside such thoughts and ignores some of the strange things the mother says. Then she finds out that her room is in McCrea's hall, and his room is adjacent to the mother's room. <br /> <br /> Later, she'll fall in as "mummy" in McCrea and kiss him (on the lips). good night. Mommy also works on Linden and makes him doubt his feelings for Dee. Everything blows up and with Dee running in the snow night to the frozen pond. As the boys run to her, mummy shouts out of the window for boys to come back and get their dresses! Dee falls through the ice and is saved. <br /> <br /> As the girls leave home the next morning, Dunne knows what she thinks of her and her attachment to the boys. But mummy has a stiff grip, sickness is pale and forever boasts her offerings. The girls go but the boys stay behind ....... <br /> Teams are great like the cheerful mother (repeat her stage role); it is a role that some actresses will dare to play. The sexual overtones are incredible for a 1933 movie and Crews takes advantage of her best film role. Dunne is also excellent because she tries to maneuver the course without losing McCrea. Dee has some excellent scenes after she has evaporated through hidden Linden. All 5 stars are fantastic in this drama which is understated and unknown. <br /> <br /> A neglected gem for anyone who likes good acting ......
