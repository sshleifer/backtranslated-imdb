If you've ever seen a Bollywood movie, you know it is longer than most movies because of the multiple songs and dance routines (each is more than five minutes long). Fortunately, this one has less song and dance routines and fits it into the "standard" movie length. Don't get me wrong, I like Bollywood movies, but tend to progress through the song and dance events. I bought this DVD because I'm a Ian Bohen fan. Although his role was not as big as I had hoped for, he still had a good amount of screen time. And his character was very different from his other roles. <br /> Overall, this was a good movie. Like most Bollywood movies, there is at least one element of controversy / conflict of traditional Indian culture. But true love triumphs over adversity and a happy end is by all.
