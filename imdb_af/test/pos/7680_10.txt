When I was a kid, my grandmother took me to see this movie. And I fell in love with that. I wondered Dorothy Dandridge so much and wanted to be like her. I fell in love with Sidney Poitier. Pearl Bailey made me laugh. And Sammy Davis Jr. was as good as Sportin Life. The music was just breathtaking. When I had my first son and the movie came on TV, I showed him, and to this day he never forgot this movie. He loved it. I will always remember Porgy and Bess. It now has a special place in my heart. I really wish they would recover this movie, as it was one of the best movies ever with an all-star "Black Cast".
