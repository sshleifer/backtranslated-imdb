First of all, I watched this show as I was a small toddler, and I always loved it. Sure, maybe I didn't understand it when I was so young, but I really enjoyed it! And now that I could understand it for a few years, I love it even more. The score of this music is the most wonderful detailed score I've ever heard! Every note is perfect, I don't even have to hear the song to enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Move to this particular production - It's great! Of course, no one can have Mrs. Lovett does not play except Angela Lansbury, and she does it perfectly. And she's been playing it for a few years. George Hearn is absolutely brilliant. The best Sweeney Todd I've ever heard. He has a wonderful voice, but he can throw his voice so well! His "epiphany" is incredible, as you can tell by the audience's reaction to it. Judge, Toby, Antony and Pirelli are also so wonderful in their roles. Everyone is perfect! Well, I still have to move forward by Johanna's Groenvink and Linnet bird. She didn't sing that song at all. <br /> <br /> This show can be appreciated at all ages, but it is not always accepted. I'm not your typical middle-aged theater lover, I'm only 15, but Sweeney Todd gave me a greater appreciation for music than I had from any other musical.
