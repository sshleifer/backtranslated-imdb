Well, this is a good job by Aparnaji and some where people like this make us believe that there are many more concepts to be expressed so far and the movie is a good media to do it. Well, all the big actors have nothing to say about acting or directing, but the film gave us a good message. This predicted the conditioning of human mind well with the patient. We all believe that we believe this is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem. From the professor to the maid, everyone tried to solve their own ways. So when JOYDEEP was discussing with her wife, he said, "She's looking for a thing she'll never get," and the woman answers, "aren't we all?" So it was a good comment that left me with a wonderful question after the movie, are we all sick?
