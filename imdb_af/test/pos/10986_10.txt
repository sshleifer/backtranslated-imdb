Two things can happen when an ensemble is thrown together. Or you go away from the theater to ask, "Why?" or you will receive MANNA FROM HEAVEN, a wonderful comedy from the Burton sisters, whose mom not only provided inspiration but the script itself. Ursula Burton, plays Theresa, a nun whose friend and family always believed she was touched by Gd. From the air, the clan uses the young Theresa's belief that the money was a gift from heaven, so that all their dreams came true. Years past and we find Theresa has returned to her native Buffalo. She came to the realization that the gift should be repaid and summoned her friends and family, (Oscar winners Shirley Jones, Louise Fletcher and Cloris Leachman) to repay the debt before Easter Monday. The money has long been spent and all the characters find themselves in financial trouble. Shirley Jones and Frank Gorshin, a husband and wife, are a team that teaches the important lesson in life, how to dress in Buffalo for winter and my personal favorite, "they expect you to take silver away , "when you visit a restaurant. The audience can only hope if Theresa reaches her goal that that person will not run out of money. The film teaches us that it is not money, but ourselves that makes us and others' dreams come true. Every action has an outcome, not just for you, but the community around you. When we look at the mirror, we see ourselves, as we like, MANNA FROM HEAVEN, answer the question how others see the picture we want to reflect. The Burtons did a beautiful job of directing the throw to break out their shells and create new and inventive characters. In the day of multi-million dollar budgets, this low budget Indy proves that it is not the cash, but true talent that will make the biggest laugh. Wendie Malick (the American president, Just Shoot Me) adds a special flavor to this talented role.
