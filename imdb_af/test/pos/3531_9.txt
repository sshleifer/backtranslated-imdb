It might be inevitable that with the attack of "slasher" movies in the early 1980s, some good people might slip through the cracks. This is a very rare movie by Jeff Lieberman, who assured his cult status with his unforgettable 1970s films "Squirm" and "Blue Sunshine". <br /> <br /> Five young people enter the Oregon Mountains. was actually shot in the spot) to camp and check the deed to some country that one of them acquired. For a long time, they will be predictably affected by a massive killer with an incredibly dreadful terrorist attack. <br /> <br /> "Just before Dawn" is noticeably ambitious, "arty" and intelligent as some slasher movies. Lieberman flits the characters - well, two of them, anyway - as much as a 90-minute movie will allow him. The movie has real moments of tension and tension, and actually refuses to use graphics, except for one murder at the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is an above average cast here, including Oscar winner George Kennedy, as an understandable forester, has become a bit flabby of being too long in the desert alone was. Jack Lemmon's son Chris, former Brian De Palma regular Gregg Henry, blonde leads Deborah Benson (it's too bad that she hasn't become a more famous artist, judging her work here), Ralph Seymour ("Ghoulies ", Mike Kellin (" Sleepaway Camp "), and Jamie Rose (" Chopper Chicks in Zombietown ") make the cast. <br /> <br /> Some of the shots are interesting, and the early music score by Brad Feidel (now best known for his "Terminator" theme) is haunting and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> It is worth catching the important plot turn at about the one hour point, though for a moment about 75 minutes to engage the heroine and a tree and the killer is almost comical ; it may actually be a viewer of a cartoon! One of the smartest touches is the final dispatch of the killer, which I have never seen in a horror movie and will probably not see again. <br /> <br /> I'm not 10 out of 10 because I can't be honest I was scared. Still, it's an interesting pound that has been rediscovered. <br /> <br /> "The deed doesn't mean anything, son. The mountains can't read." <br /> <br /> 9/10
