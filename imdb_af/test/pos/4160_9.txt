It's Christmas time! A birth in terms of regeneration, or at least that is what can be expected over the Italian theater. It was about 30-40 years that Italian theater did not make a piece of art of this size. It is an absolute contemporary film that can also be viewed on the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, without mentioning any name. And lastly, it's also a great production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all understandable and pleasing at different levels of fruit. Real poetry, real humor, true tenderness, real drama, true beauty. No rhetoric, no easy surrealistic shortcuts, no typical tourist-like picture, no overworking, no director authorialism. There is also a cool use of two heartbreaking Nina Simone's songs, whose music I've never used properly for a score. So if it's not a real revival for Italian theater, it's an extraordinary evolution for Emanuele Crialese after his 'Respiro' another definite beautiful film. "Nuovomondo" should not be missed, it's the kind of medicine film that is useful to make film, watch movie, enjoy life and understand. Francesco Cabras
