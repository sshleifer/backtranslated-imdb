I'm not a gholffan at all. On May 26 at 22:30, the movie began with a scene in the late 1800's. Old movies that I like, but not golf, in the first scene, a young boy (Harry Vardon) wakes up by men's voices. He went outside to inquire about what they were doing and was told they were going to make a wave ... Then I turned the television off, but something stirred me and it was back on. The movie is excellent. We see this young boy now a man; professional golfer who boasts visions from his childhood. Then we meet the real focus of the movie Francis and the decisions he makes for golf. You meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class that is so clear in the time. Then there is little Eddie Lowery his caddy with encouraging words and small bumps that instrumental in Francis wins. Don't want to throw away too much. I was up to 2 A.M. It's great, please see the movie.
