It's a pleasant project, it's not a movie as the title suggests. Good performance by Nadia Dajani who takes up Grace's role again. I'm following the re-enactment of what happened to Mike and Grace in New York City. She left, but he wanted to get in touch with her. This project is his way of getting in touch with her. <br /> <br /> I saw it on IFC. I heard that it will also be released on DVD. I like this trend of more independent projects. This is an example of a good project. <br /> <br /> I hope he finds her. <br /> <br /> See and be entertained. <br /> <br /> KirbyEF
