Amateur camera works aside, I thought this movie was very different, and unlike all the blogs and posts I read, I got something completely different from the others. The premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and their links with their church. How they should comply with all the rigid rules and regulations, but the daughter seems to have problems on the right track, which with nasty thoughts of others and her use of bad language. Yet she prayed a lot, just like her family. Then one day they went to a church picnic and in an accident. From there the parents and her brother change; who broke through and "saved" Jesus. WARNING: LARGE Spoiler ALERT. Or so we are led to believe. I think if you just watch this movie from the daughter's point of view, then really notice the end you will see that what we think the audience is a real look at parents and son is actually a dream, and of the daughter's POV. It will set out many of the actions portrayed by the parents and the boy, which were completely opposite of how they previously lived, especially the gender, and also explained why Peggy had murdered. Look at how perfect that tart is, but go back and look at the cake that Betty makes. This is unless Caroline has removed all evidence that the tart has been cut. And also the fact that the scene where she sees her dead parents is lying in each other's arms, and her brother, all of whom looked very peaceful, even if it is poisoned, fits in with a dream sequence.
