It is so sad that an important movie like this is virtually unknown. <br /> <br /> I don't think Alan Bates did a better movie than that. <br /> <br /> It is never shown on television. The only time I remember being shown on British TV was in the summer of 1998. I'm on tape, but unfortunately the quality isn't good because of a dodgy antenna at the moment ... < br /> <br /> I remember seeing this movie for some time before appearing on TV. It was shown on Channel 4 in the early hours of the morning, leaving it unseen, except for a very small audience. <br /> <br /> At the time I was in Bristol and it was ironic that, when I finally watched the movie, I realized that I had filmed a few times before, past the many homes. The movie stairs a fine line; a married couple who are trying to shed their tragic trouble handling their poorly mentally handicapped daughter by laughing and even involving the child in their jokes. <br /> <br /> The direction and the acting are so wonderful that the film is always compassionate and moving and is never in danger of falling into bad taste. <br /> <br /> A few years ago I saw a clip of the filmed theater production with Eddie Izzard in the role of Bri and Victoria Hamilton. play Sheila. <br /> <br /> It improvised and survived Izzard and Hamilton played the audience to ignore him when he was. <br /> <br /> I might take it out of context like me I just saw a short track, but I read the play and watched the movie. It is clearly such a delicate subject that such an approach is both insensitive and irreverent. <br /> <br /> Izzard was praised for his performance, but I felt uncomfortable with what I saw. <br /> <br /> It may be surprising that such a successful play failed to find an audience when it was finally filmed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best British movies of the 70's and hopefully it will be released one day on DVD.
