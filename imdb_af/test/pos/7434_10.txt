I still can't believe that computer graphics can create 3D images. The moment I heard this from my friends on a forum, I swore to myself that I was going to look myself. <br /> <br /> I managed to see parts of it at a co-shopping mall where they had many Advent Children DVDs and offered it on a few laptops. It was clear that I was happy, but it wasn't enough. Then I watched YouTube looking for the movie. All I got was music video assignments. Until that fateful day ... I found it. I looked at it in spite of all the distractions, because I knew I had to see if I would be called a loser. <br /> <br /> Enough about me more on the movie. As if Final Fantasy VII wasn't enough, they made a movie about it! My favorite part was the end of Sephiroth's life. Cloud's OmniSlash couldn't be better. But I won't completely spoil the show for you. You must see it for yourself !!! Get the DVD now!
