In one of the better movies of the year, Tom Hanks stars as congressman Charlie Wilson in this sardonic funny and highly relevant (given fairly recent events) historical comedy drama around the 1980s Afghan / Soviet fiasco. The Soviet Union attacked Afghanistan and killed hundreds of people. Why should someone care? People die, right? No, the reason why the United States got involved with Charlie Wilson was because the Afghans, in fear of being blamed, arrived illegally in Pakistan, which in turn pulled Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. Charlie Wilson, in an effort to solve this situation, teamed up with the sixth richest woman and religious fanatic in Texas, Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) and an amusing and robust American spy for the CIA, Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman). with high-tech weapons to destroy Soviet fighter planes that will attack their country. <br /> <br /> Although certainly not a serious Oscar contender for the best picture, Charlie Wilson's War is probably one of the best of many political films of the year. Oscar winner Mike Nichols gives solid direction as expected while Emmy award winner Aaron Sorkin (Sport's Night, The West Wing) delivers a remarkable script that balances comedy and drama almost flawlessly. The acting is also good for the most part. Tom Hanks has been delivering his best and most enjoyable performance since his 2000 Oscar nominated innings as a FedEx worker stranded on a tropical island in Cast Away. Hanks takes a slender character like Wilson and with his trademark charm he becomes a nice man. Amy Adams and Ned Beatty are reliable as always, but the real performance of the film is from Philip Seymour Hoffman. Probably the best actor who works in the film industry today, Hoffman takes a small supportive role, and everyone is around him. From his first scene screaming to his boss before breaking his window violently, Hoffman sucks you in. The only disappointing member is the Hollywood starlet Julia Roberts, an incredible overstate. Hamming her way through another movie, Roberts's exaggerated and exaggerated portrayal of a rich Olympic woman in Texas, beats all the wrong notes and is mostly annoyingly annoying. At 97 minutes, the movie is short and sweet, and it can't say it isn't dragging on some points, but when it's wearing it is for a very short time. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Charlie Wilson's War" is not a perfect movie, but it's definitely worth it.
