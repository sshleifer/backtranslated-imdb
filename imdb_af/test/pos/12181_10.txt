I made this Anne Rice book adaptation. While most of the film is filmed here in Australia, it offers a great deal of scenery and a fantastic shooting range. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) recently woke up to sleep and decided to betray his vampire oath by revealing himself to a band. When he becomes a popular movie icon, she becomes fellow vampires, upside down, angry and planning his death. Meanwhile, Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) became an orphan member of the supernatural studies, which has an old vampire pedigree, deeply occupied with Lestat. Her boss David (Paul McGann) understands her obsession and revives his obsession with the vampire Marius, (Vincent Perez) who is an old vampire and the man who also made Lestat a vampire. Jesse gets Lestat's diary and reads about his first murder and a meeting with the Queen of the Hidden Akasha (Aaliyah). When Lestat holds a concert in Death Valley, he receives news that not only vampires will be angry, but Akasha can come too. Meanwhile, Akasha has other plans. She goes to a vampire gorge, a bar, and kills everyone in her path. With Lestat being tempted by royality and loving care by Akasha, the old vampires consisting of Marius and Jesses become Tant Maharet (Lena Olin) against them. Join her or die? <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was great, it had good fights, good music and good places. Aaliyah unfortunately died shortly before the plane crash in a plane crash, but she had a beautiful view on the set and sets. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10/10 because it was a fantastic movie and I urge you to watch it!
