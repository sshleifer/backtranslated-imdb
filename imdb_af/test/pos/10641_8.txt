This is one of the best movies I've seen of the silent era (sad to say, I've seen too much except Chaplin / Keaton stuff). Very visually brilliant, with critical influential style in editing and compilation. Actually unique (especially for his time) camera angles and extremely hectic editing. Definitely a must for the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The downside is that it's also a bit in your face about his politics (I have no problem with politics in film, as long as they are subtle or at least somewhat careless as a backdrop to the story). It's also not an entertainment film, it's good, but it's not something I will look at a billion times. It's art, simple and simple, like that or not. <br /> <br /> Appreciate an A + for influence alone, but based on personal enjoyment, I give it an A-.
