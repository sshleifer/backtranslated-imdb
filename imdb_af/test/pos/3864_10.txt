In Paris in the year 1910, a retired, old, rich opera singer decided to give away her fortune to her beautiful cathedral (pronounced Eva Gabor) and her kittens, but the jealous butler Edgar came up with a plan while he cats kidnap and leave them in the countryside. Fortunately for them, using a street and independent tomato called Thomas O'Malley (pronounced by Phil Harris), help them get home, especially to meet some of his good friends like the waving Scat Cat (by Scatman Crothers) and try to feel Edgar's plans. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining and edgy after Walt Disney's animated movie with some nice jazzy songs like the unforgettable 'Everybody wants to be a Cat', a good voice and some great animations. time even in these computer animation times. Not one of the greatest Disney animated movies, but highly recommended by a Disney-animated fave and one of the few good works of the day.
