Everywhere I hear people call this show bad, because the point of departure is too far out. Well, a good taxi driver in Philly puts it a bit (at least the drivers I met), but it makes the show great. <br /> <br /> The fact that this show is a bit of reality is a problem, but it's still fun and fun. She is very vigilant and even if you know that Mike finally wins, he never wins in life. David Morse is a good actor and does a good job in the title role. His supporting role is wonderful and I have to say the location of the show is especially good! <br /> <br /> All in all, I'm not watching this show because I'm looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action, I'm looking at this show because it's a good play every week, " a good starting point and a good story line. It's also a plus if I can choose or know the landmarks on which he is driving. I love this show and I love Philly !! Give this show a shot!
