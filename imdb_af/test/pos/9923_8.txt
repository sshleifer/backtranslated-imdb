'Opera' (1987) <br /> <br /> Director: Dario Argento (Deep Red, Suspiria) Manuscript: Dario Argento and Franco Ferrini (The Church, Sleepless, Demons) Photography: Ronnie Taylor (a Choreline, Sleepless) Music: Claudio Simonetti (Phenomena, 'Goblin') <br /> <br /> Story: Betty (Cristina Marsillach) is the Lady Macbeth impressed by a quiet figure of Verdi's Macbeth opera. Betty's time to shine comes when the diva star breaks her leg before she opens the night when she runs through a car in a tantrum. The famous curse of Macbeth takes a more sinister and computational turn when the body setting immediately rises. Betty seems to get her first fan through a stalker who connects her and tapes needles to her eyes to force her to witness the grievous murders of the people around her. Story: 3 of 5 <br /> <br /> Acting: In many of these Italian films it can sometimes be difficult to judge. English, Italian, French, German, Spanish can sometimes all be in the same movie as they normally speak their mother tongue, making double rule and difficult to judge. I usually cut them a little slack in the area. Acting: 4 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Direction: Giallo maestro Argento returns to the genre that pioneered. 'Opera' shows him at the top of his game with a beautiful mix of gore, tension and beauty. Direction: 4 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Visual: It must be one of Argento's most beautiful films. Remarkably filmed by Taylor, 'Opera' features a beautiful and inventive camera work that lets the movie run hard and hard to keep the eyecup. The camera always seems to be a wonderful shot of the camera that goes a spiral staircase or a drive to the end of a bird's eye view of the bird around the crowd at the opera house. Visual: 5 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Audio: Regular Argento colleague Simonetti (by his various bands Goblin, Demonian and solo effort) compliment the screen action with zeal as his score of classic (Verdi) hits metal music . (with some help from Brian and Roger Eno and Bill Wyman) and borrow music muscles on the screen's bloody gristle. The sound design gives you everything you need to shoot, shoot, scream and masterly on the Anchor Bay slide in glorious 6.1 for every crunch and caw. Sound: 5 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Technical: The editing keeps the movie flowing and moves wonderfully. Combined with the camera work, the editing help helps the surreal dreamy images that flow. The beautiful opera house is one of a place and perfect for installing the horror version of Macbeth. One cannot end an Argento movie review without responding to the manslaughter. This time Argento sends characters around with a brilliant stitch sequence, crow's eye wash and the movie highlight of a gun bloom through a keyhole in the eye and from the back of the head shot that again sends Argento's ex-wife, Daria Nicolodi. to the movie mortuary. Priceless! Technical: 5 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Wrap-up: An almost flawless giallo suffering from a slightly unnecessary epilogue in Switzerland that delivers all the visual excitement Argento fans desire. <br /> <br /> Overall: 4 out of 5
