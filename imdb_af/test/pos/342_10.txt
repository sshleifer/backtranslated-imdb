I am a great follower of Indian movies, especially Malayalam and Tamil. <br /> <br /> Shame on India because they won't send this movie as their official Oscar entry. I saw this movie and it clearly showed me that the Tamil theater in its performance and narrative scene catches up with the bollywood. On the way to all our Westerners, Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood everything is. About the good looks shine and promotion. <br /> <br /> Come to the point that India thought when sending a movie like "Devdas" to the Oscars? It was a Masochistic movement. I think they are trying to punish Oscar judges with boredom by sending Devdas since the judges struck last year. <br /> <br /> 'Devdas' is just a brightly colored but birthday and predictable melodrama of love, destiny and fate. I would stay there. Anyway, not to send a movie like Kanathil Muthital, shows how much of a new Indian administration needs them to save them from poor drivers who lack intelligence. Now I know why this country has so many problems. They are very talented but not properly displayed.
