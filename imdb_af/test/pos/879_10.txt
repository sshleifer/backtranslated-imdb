An excellent game of all time. Vijay Anand performs as director and editor. Performances by Dev Anand, Vyjayantimala, Tanuja and Ashok Kumar seem to be an asset to the film, which worked out its screenwork to the smallest detail. Cinematography adds to the secret, glamor and other requirements of the story as it develops. And above all, music by Sachin Dev Burman is unforgettable. "Jah dil to hota bechara" by Kishore Kumar, "Raat akeli hai" by Asha Bhosle, "Rula ke gaya sapna mera" by Lata, "Aasman ke niche" by Lata and Rafi and "Hothon pe aisi benefits main" by Lata, reaffirms Burman Dada's unique stature as a top composer of his own style.
