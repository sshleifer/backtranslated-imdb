Halloween 666 (1995) The producer's cut review! <br /> <br /> Halloween 666 begins with a summary of the terrible end of Part Five. If you thought the last chapter was dark, this one would really put your mind out. A mysterious "Man in Black" entered the Haddonfield Police Department which released Micheal Myers. In the process, poor Jamie Lloyd was kidnapped by foreign cultures. What do they want with her? Who knows, but let's just say her long suffering will end soon. Dr. Loomis is back to spend the rest of his dusk trying to stop Michael Myers from killing innocents. A friend of Loomis, Doctor Wynn, comes back to a four-pursued hiatus to help the good doctor. Another old face of part one guest stars. <br /> <br /> This dark and brave sequel was broken down during post-production editing. For some reason, the distributors felt that the final product was not worth the average horror movie keeper's time. So they decide to immerse it. Then the film sat on the shelf for a few months and laid an egg at the box office. No matter what they did to the movie, they made it worse. They had to leave well enough alone. Hey, the movie company now knows better than the movie makers now .... don't they? <br /> <br /> Manufacturer's cut: Highly recommended <br /> <br /> Release version: Not recommended
