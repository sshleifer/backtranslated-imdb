River's edge is not a PLEASANT movie to watch, but it's incredible. Having seen it many years ago, I really think it would still have the ability to shock if it was released or made again or something. Perhaps no film ever made caught the essence of the young suburban inertia like this devastatingly scary movie. Being based on a true story, it is even more disturbing. Very well maintained and just uncomfortable to watch, but also a little-known masterpiece and a very important movie. Must be compulsory to see nationwide in all high schools. Fantastic.
