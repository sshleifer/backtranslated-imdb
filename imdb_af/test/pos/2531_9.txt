It was really a "nightmare" of a movie; I saw it on cable television about nine years ago and didn't forget it. Pixote is a 10-year-old boy who lives in the streets of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends Lilica, Dito and Chico; they steal, pimp, sell drugs and murder to survive every day. In the first half of the film, Pixote is caught by the police and sent to a sadistic foster home where he testifies every kind of abuse of the older prisoners and guards to the rest of the children; one night, Lilica's boyfriend is killed after a knock, so Pixote and his friends decide to escape during a riot. The rest of the film shows Pixote's descent into a criminal life; he does not show any feelings or remorse after killing someone, perhaps because he knows that good feelings in the world he lives in did not use ... But there is a soft scene in the middle of the film; Pixote and his friends are on the beach, missing (and wish) one of his reformer friends was there. I thought it was a poetic and melancholic scene in the midst of all these terrible events ... the boys, of course, don't just want their friend, but for a better life. Director Hector Babenco's "Pixote" is a brave and imposing film that is not shy to show the hardest reality, many people - including myself - tend to ignore or misunderstand. This movie will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person.
