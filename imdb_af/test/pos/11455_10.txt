This movie surprised me. The opening credit line has a nice animation. Then we are immersed in a semi-cheese production, which betrays its low budget. The characters, typically American teenagers, are slowly presented, with more personal details than are usually found in such movies. By the time the Shlitz hits the fan, we know each of the characters, and they like or hate them according to their respective personalities. It's a slow uphill setup, like the ride on a slope of a very long toboggan run. Fortunately, if the action comes in soon, it is full of schooling. HORROR! Steve Johnson's make-up effects are wonderful. Equal to quality for much larger budgeted movies. And the starters frightened. Kevin Tenney delivers his best movie ever, with heartbreaking surprises and terribly exciting action. The tongue-in-the-cheek, sometimes cheesy, humor shows this movie as a pure 80-year-old horror, unlike the silly tone of earlier genre like "Night of the Living Dead" or "Hills Have Eyes." But for true horror fans, this one is worth checking out. Play it as the first entry on a dual account with the 1999 remake of "House on the Haunted Hill." The setup and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what movie they actually rearranged?
