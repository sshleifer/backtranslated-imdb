John Barrymore plays a gentleman who is also the thief, Arsene Lupine. While no one knows, this is the case, the inspector (Lionel Barrymore) is sure of it, but cannot prove it. So, Lionel spends a lot of the movie John follows, hoping to catch this brilliant and smooth thief. <br /> <br /> Although I like the movie, I really think I have higher expectations for it and thought it could be better. as just a very good time saver. This is because it mates John and Lionel Barrymore in the movie and since these brothers were such dynamic actors, I think I expected sparks and magic, but instead they had a smile here and there. Now it's not to say it's a bad movie - it's definitely not. It just didn't rise to the level of memorable or a movie I highly recommend to see you. Thanks to an adequate writing, the movie is pretty good, but I was surprised to hear no French accent whatsoever in the movie, although it was allegedly French people! Also, there wasn't much life in the movie until it was almost completed. The end was indeed excellent and entertaining - so good it raised the film from a 6 to a 7. It's nice to see that it ended up on a high note.
