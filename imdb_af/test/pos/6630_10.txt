It's a disturbing movie, and it's moving relentlessly. Yet, it is completely unique among war films because it focuses solely on civil experience, the loss of humanity undergoes ordinary people during war. The two young, married musicians are undergoing a slow, devastating process of deterioration on both sides of a civil war. The film offers a dark vision of the modern world, and I believe it is very recognizable to many Europeans. With bold, intense performances by Liv Ullmann (never better) and Max von Sydow (just like that). For my money, the most indelible movie Bergman has ever created.
