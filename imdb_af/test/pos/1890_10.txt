The man with the screaming brain is completely in place in Bulgaria. It is a hilarious love story between two rich ugly-American species and a murderous girl-gypsy. <br /> <br /> William Cole and his wife, Jackie, arrive in Bulgaria on a business trip and get a taxi run by hustler Yegor. Things start to miss if Tatoya, the girl, murder of Yegor and William and a crazy scientific implantation of a piece of Yegor's brain in William's head. Robots are eventually involved, such as broken-finger gypsies, head injuries, Bruce Campbell riding a pink Vespa with fine little streamers and a physical All-Of-Me-style comedy by a war-torn character his brain half controlled his body. <br /> <br /> The man with the screaming brain is an incredibly funny movie. It has the most hilarious tracking shot I've ever seen (when Bruce Campbell's character is fresh from the lab and runs with giant forehead-cloth-and-blue hospital pajamas, walks in a square and a crowd scares people ) and a fall-down Stage murder scene that had heard the entire screen screeched. The whole thing is a damn riot from start to finish and I would recommend it to any fan of physical comedy, Bruce Campbell, or B movies in general.
