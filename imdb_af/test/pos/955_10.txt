Is a fiery Vijay fan. I have never seen another movie of her that is as good as it is. <br /> <br /> It has all the regular cliches you can expect from a commercial entertainer. A hero who is poor in studies, but a star in his forte, that is, Kabbadi. His friends fill in the comedy quota. A heroine in a life-and-death situation. A villain, I say, is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist. High octane pursued and action sequences. Music that lets one dance. And above all, it's a perfect story to keep all of the above factors in a pleasant circle. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The director doesn't give a chance to the audience to release. He just goes from one nail to the head to the next. And one can see the lighter side of Vijay in this movie he rarely performs. <br /> <br /> Already said ..... This movie was and will be perfect for many years to come ....
