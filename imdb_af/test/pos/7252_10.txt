This movie is great. Stylish, fun, good acting. I saw it as 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Muskets' and 'Reservoir Fops', which are both excellent descriptions. The plot is simple, but it does not detract from the enjoyment. Carlyle is a brilliant ruffian and Miller is an excellent drunk man. The sets and costumes are beautiful, and the music and camera work is extremely rare for a costume drama. Sense and Sensibility it's definitely NOT !!!!! My recommendation? Go see it, sit back with a big bakkie of popcorn and enjoy a good time.
