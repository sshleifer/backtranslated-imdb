When I read the synopsis for "Messiah" in the television guide, I wasn't ready for what was in the store. The story follows DCI Metcalfe, who is trying to resolve a grievous murder case in London. He soon realized a pattern, there was a serial killer going on, killing people with similar names and work to those of the 12 Apostles, and their murder was identical to their corresponding Apostle. The two sub-ranges kept me right on the edge of my seat. Metcalfe has now pursued the killer, but always lacks him within seconds and discovers the horrific mess he has left behind his bad victim. "Messiah" is probably a great deal of controversy, but it is the biggest piece of drama the BBC has shown in a long time.
