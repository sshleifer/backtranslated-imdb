Hitchcock once gave an interview in which he said he wanted to display screens that an ordinary person had doing their own business. They are accidentally caught up in a terrible chain of events that they can't find until the deadly plot behind their problems is solved. That way, the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero. We definitely do this fine movie. Barry Kane is just trying to help his fellow man by doing acts of kindness and consideration, such as helping Fry get the letters he dropped from the factory. Barry even gives back a lost $ 100 bill to roast later ... it was big money in 1943 !! This is Barry's act of Christian friendliness that puts him in trouble and soon he is accused of sabotage and murder and is likely to hang out if he can't get rid of himself. Similar to the 39 steps in plot, the hero travels land where he discovers plans for further acts of terrorism by fascisist cells, an arch cure that no one can believe to be a cabinet Nazi, and a beautiful blonde, Patricia Martin , who is initially suspicious and hate, eventually falls in love with Barry Kane. Hitch's trademark becomes humorous, here too. Patricia is a billboard model that features a variety of road ads, assistance and comfort to Barry, as he travels with the bad guys, from Las Vegas to NYC. We meet a trucker who is a one-man comedic act. "Someone convinced my wife it was stylish to eat three meals a day." Fieldworkers of the Fascist Spy Ring boast that they are forgotten or ignored by the "packs", just as if they are working for a legitimate business. During a theatrical scene in a theater, the audience are laughing at the action of a shocking comedy / gangster movie, as the saboteur sold it out for real guys and accidentally protected a guffaw movie. Terrible for the dead old man, but funny! Hitch wanted to use well-known monuments in his movies, which is the best example, with the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop and ironic icon! It works even better than the Mt Rushmore scene in NBNW.
