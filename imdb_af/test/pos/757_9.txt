If you like entries from the early seventies, you'll just love this one. How can you go wrong with a low budget film about bloodshed in a lean asylum? You can't! Crazy people and sharp objects are always an entertaining combination. <br /> <br /> The movie looks like it's shot in someone's home for about $ 320.65. For me just watching the fun of this kind of thing. The gore is a little light compared to others of this ilk, but there is plenty to keep our bloodthirsty sickos (like me) happy. Some horror movies drag in parts and let you wait for something to happen. This is not the case here. The characters are enough to make each frame quite enjoyable. There is never a dull moment from beginning to end. The mind melts at the end that is just incredible. I loved it so much that I just watched credits for a second time afterwards. It's an absolute must see for any self-respect-in-the-gear nut. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 on the Drive-in-Freak-O-Meter ... viewing required <br /> <br /> Yes, I love you. I love you. Now take your Thorazine and put on your clothes again. Please. )
