The director Otto Preminger, the moon is blue, has tackled even more taboo topics in his controversial 1955 edition "The Man with the Golden Arm". As he sparked the Motion Picture Association of America using the words "virgin" and "mistress" in his soft 1953 comedy "The Moon Is Blue," Preminger went far beyond what a movie with the "Man with the Golden Arm "since Dick Powell made his law and order epic" Till the End of the Earth "(1946) to weaken international traffic in drugs. Based on Nelson Algren's novel, which won the 1950 National Book Prize, these avid, uncompromising 119-minute black-and-white melodrama deal with heroin addiction. Initially, when Preminger's film came out, the Motion Picture Association of America would not issue its seal of approval because filmmakers portrayed drug addiction. This groundbreaking film qualified as the first major film to deal with drugs from the dope enemy's perspective and actually showed the fittings that junkies had to shoot heroin. The Production Code stipulates that filmmakers should refrain from showing characters using illegal drugs. However, United Artists released this unique Frank Sinatra photo and it cost more than $ 4 million. <br /> <br /> The critical and commercial success of "The Man with the Golden Arm" singled out the Production Code. As a result, the MPAA amended the Code so that filmmakers could enter other taboo subjects, such as drug abuse, abduction, abortion and prostitution. The film received three Oscar nominations. Oscar nominations went to Sinatra for best operations, Joseph C. Wright and Darrell Silvera for the best Art Direction Set decoration, Black-and-White and Elmer Bernstein for best music, dramatic or comedy. In fact, Elmer Bernstein made a name for himself with his jazzy score. The producers thought Marlon Brando was tossed in the title role, but Sinatra hit Brando on the punch. Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang, Darren McGavin, and Robert Strauss co-stars with Ole Blue Eyes. McGavin was extremely memorable as a messy heroin dealer, while Eleanor Parker played the chief's wife with a dark, deep secret of her own that came as a shock. <br /> <br /> "The Man with the Golden Arm" refers to the starring Frankie Machine's ability to manipulate a deck of cards. Frankie deals with tickets for Zero Schwiefka (Robert Strauss of Stalag 17), but he has been out of Chicago for the past six months, in a federal narcotic drug recovery hospital. Not only did Frankie lick the habit, but he also learned how to play the drums and plan to start a music career. Optimistic when Frank is about his future, he finds himself again in the past when he returns to his old stumps. Schwiefka wants him to deal with him again, and Nifty Louie Fomorowski (Darren McGavin of "Counter-Attack") is trying to encourage him to resume his heroin use. Meanwhile, Frankie arrives at his disabled, wheelchair-bound wife, Zosh (Eleanor Parker of "Escape from Fort Bravo"), who manipulates him with debt. Frankie was drunk when he had a car accident and Zosh got into a wheelchair. Frankie appears with high expectations and a dream set, but Zosh sees no future for him as a musician and insists on returning to Schwiefka again. Frankie plans to visit a music promotion and one of his own friends, Sparrow (Arnold Stang of "My Sister Eileen"), shoplifter a business store from a Frankie retail store. After Frankie refuses to work for Schwiefka, because he will see musician Harry Lane (Will Wright from The Wild One), Schwiefka changes both Frank and Sparrow in the police. Meanwhile, Schwiefka Brach's Department Store is getting the shoplift down. That suit was worth $ 37.00. Frankie agrees to resume Schweifka and the hustler binds him out. Not long after, despite his decision to avoid heroin use, Frankie broke down and paid Louie the $ 2.00 for a solution. <br /> <br /> Eventually Frankie meets Harry Lane and Lane warns him that he catches up with Frankie that he won't do anything with him. What poor Frankie doesn't know is that Zosh has recovered her ability to walk, but she uses his guilt over the accident to hold him. Zosh is also jealous of her closest neighbor, Molly Novotny (Kim Novak of "Picnic"), Frankie's former sweetheart who drinks at a nearby strip, called the Safari Club. When Zosh complains about headaches that Frankie gives her to exercise on his drum set, Frankie moves into Molly's apartment. Schwiefka and Louie are planning a big poker game with Sam Markette (George E. Stone of "Guys and Dolls") and Williams (George Mathews of "Gunfight at the OK Corral"), two great time players who heard from Frank and Frank. his legendary 'golden arm'. Schwiefka and Louie persuaded a hesitant Frankie to pay $ 250. After an early finish line, Frankie loses and he can't stop his accident. In fact, Frankie spent over two days trading. Exhaustion, his nerves shot and desperate for a solution, he fell apart on the second day and Markette and Williams got him false. Louie refuses to give Frankie a solution, so Frankie knocks him out and leaves his apartment for heroin. <br /> <br /> Preminger doesn't push in "The Man with the Golden Arm", and the movie is pretty sobering. None of the characters here are distractingly sympathetic. In essence, they are either hustlers or hustled. Sinatra gives another dynamite performance, like McGavin and Parker. To be sure, the man with the golden arm has lost much of his impact in the intervening 50 or more years, but it still stands as a landmark film.
