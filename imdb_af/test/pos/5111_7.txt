It was easily one of the best of Ernest movies, especially with regard to the production design. What was there with the pink waiting uniforms? Unfortunately, this movie probably destroyed the Ernest series and changed the series into a straight-to-video series. But Jim Varney gave one of his better performances by playing Nash, his criminal alter ego. A failure in the series, but in most cases it wasn't bad. (The Electro Man routine was classic)
