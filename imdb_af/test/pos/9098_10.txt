Jack Black and Kyle Gass join forces to promote their band Tenacious D in this Rock Classic, called Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny. Jack Black and Kyle Gass find out their own Rock Opera. It was like an Opera of Rock 'N' Roll. Some of the most twisted events took place in that movie .... the big pedestal .... the mushroom party .... and in the end when they pulled the rock down the devil. A classic formed in Tenacious D ... is one of the best movies I've seen in the past. The last few things I've seen in the theater were stupid .. but these movie rocks. It really made me laugh. The whole base is Jack Black runs to find his rock mate in Los Angeles. His friend is Kyle Gass and the man who has always been naked. They work together to find this magical pick that the most terrible musician can play. They eventually make it to the Rock 'N' Roll Museum and steal the pick. Along the way they meet the alien played by Tim Robbins. They make it to the club to win their prize money when the owner picks it and all the demons he was and he fights the D in a Rock Off. The D does not win, but the devil's horn falls off to send him back to hell. LONG LIVE THAT D !!!!!!!!!!
