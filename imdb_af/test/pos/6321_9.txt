The mystery and its solution was a great noir conceit. I have questions, maybe I didn't get enough attention. <br /> <br /> Who killed the neighbor and why? Who killed the replacement girl and why? <br /> <br /> And a few minor concerns, they had to show the stopoff at the hotel for the switch. Not that they had to show the switch, but they had to show Jim and the girl in the hotel, Jim goes to the bathroom, comes out and is told by the barman that his girlfriend is gone without him. <Br /> <br /> Then Jim comes back into the car and sees the sleeping woman and girl in his back seat. <br /> <br /> This would have given the viewer a sporting opportunity to find the solution. <br /> <br /> I wish I had already shown it, I want to see it again.
