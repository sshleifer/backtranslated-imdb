When opened in London during the 1969 Christmas season, this critically acclaimed version of James Hilton's famous story was printed. The same greeting greeted it when it was opened in the US. MGM has withdrawn its "Roadshow" status and almost cut all its songs. What a mistake !!! <br /> <br /> See years later, when the trendy world of the 60s and 70s turned on itself, this version of GOODBYE, MR.CHIPS, is a total delight. First, as 'Chipping', Peter O'Toole gives one of his greatest performances. To see him turn from the hated, cold, emotional Latin teacher at a boy's boarding school to a man who can finally see the colors in the world (after having married to musical star Catherine Briskit) a genius at work see. (If you can, watch LAWRENCE OR ARABIA, THE LION IN WINTER, MY FAVORITE YEAR and CHIPS in a few days or weeks, then you'll see what a really good actor O'Toole is and how beautiful he is in CHIPS . <br /> <br /> Catherine, as played by the glowing Petula Clark at the height of her popularity, is ever man's dream; beautiful, loving, understanding, with a good voice to start. Most of the songs are beautiful and fit the story perfectly, while the direction of the late Herbert Ross brings the performance to life. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie may be a bit too romantic for some people, but for those looking for a beautifully acted, sung and directed love story, look no further. (If you can get your hands on the laser disc's wide-screen version, better yet. I'm anxiously waiting for CHIPS's debut on DVD.)
