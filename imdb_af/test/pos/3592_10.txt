The BBC's blue planet is simply jawbone. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say it contains some of the most beautiful sequences ever captured on film. From familiar creatures on and near the ocean's surface to a few unrecognizable and just bizarre people in the dark depths, nothing is left out. With a sturdy 8 hours, some might weigh the highlights you brought in the movie "Deep Blue", but I strongly encourage you to give it a go. I don't think it will disappoint and if your kids have enjoyed the aquatic world, they brought Pixar's Finding Nemo. I'm sure they'll love it too. I just wish the television was entertaining.
