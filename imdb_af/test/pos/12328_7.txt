Flash of lightning; a vast cemetery; the name of Adam 'Batman' West: everybody appears on the screen before the opening credits are over, and yet, despite these rather naff elements, One Dark Night is not as cheesy as it may seem. <br /> <br /> Meg Tilly (Jennifer's sister) plays beautiful student Julie, who is reluctant to spend the night alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiative in exclusive high school click The Sisters. What Julie doesn't realize is that the other 'sisters' plan to stick her out with some ghoulish pranks ?? or that the latest body in the mausoleum is condemned is that of 'psychic vampire' Raymar who comes from life force of scared young women. <br /> <br /> Although not the most original of the set-up, fortunately there are enough inventive touches to tune this movie of the competition, my favorites are the macabre's see the everyday objects in the walls of Raymar's apartment is embedded, and the creepy way in which nasty bodies float through the mausoleum's cold marble corridors during the excellent final. Hal Trussell's impressive steadicam cinematography and Tom Burman's wonderful-macabre special effects also add tremendously to the cool atmosphere.
