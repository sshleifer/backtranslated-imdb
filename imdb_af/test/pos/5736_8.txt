Six teenagers go to an old remote school where a terrible massacre took place 27 years ago for an evening of fun and pranks. Instead, the children of the evil raging security guard (played extremely well with an extremely turbulent threat by Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy) ran the nasty murders. Director Carlos Gil tells the intriguing story at a fast pace and does a skilled job creating a compelling, ghostly and mysterious atmosphere. The spectacular writing by Tino Blanco and Mercedes Holgueras offers a clever and inspired blend of slasher and supernatural elements that keep the viewer at the end of the guess. The smooth cinematography by Fernando Arribas makes expert use of light and shade. David San Jose's moody count also does the trick. The handsome and handsome young actors all contribute lively and engaging performances, with especially laudable innings by Carlos Fuentes as lead characters Ramon, Olivia Molina as panic Maria, Zoe Berriatua as zealous joker Jordi, and Carmen Morales as a haunting goth chick Sandra. The pieces of the murder are just as bloody and brutal as they should be. Also a surprise from a surprising dark end. A solid and satisfying shock worker.
