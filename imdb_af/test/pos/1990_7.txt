A summary exploration of the virtual reality, although it is not yet clear how much the director himself planned. This film deliberately takes you through several low artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues as to which layer of virtual reality you are, causing an ontological confusion for the viewer to think. <br /> <br /> It can also be seen as a satire of video games. However, the whole movie can fall into the error of imitative form here. It doesn't seem possible to escape from the video game genre that mimics it; so the satire becomes problematic. <br /> <br /> A number of interesting ideas run throughout: the biological mutant is one; the interface of technology and biology, the cyborg's urge to outdo reality - and philosophical relationships like the title of Heidegger, together with existential questions: ie the game characters are partially written or determined and yet partially free to change their fate and their wonder how strange it feels in the game. One character notes that this existential confusion is just like real life, erasing the distinction between virtual and true. Similarly with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble across a world where you do not know what will happen next and you do not know how to play since you just have to bump around the goal and the unknown rules to find. A virtual game in the game is titled "TranscendenZ". Also a criticism of how virtual violence does not enable us to feel the effects of real violence. Even the heroes at every level of ontological existence are confused by violence. They do not like it, but it is exciting and part of the "game", which they fear, is really. <br /> <br /> The playmaker, the god of the system, is eventually killed; Yet this scenario is in direct comparison with a video game we've just seen - and viewers believe it's still just part of the virtual reality. In the end, the film does not doubt whether it's actually, but the point is clear (to me anyway). Existenz means Da-signal: You're there. You are thrown into a set of rules and puzzles at each level. Ontologically, virtual reality reveals reality. And his general game motifs speak like a royal road to the unconscious, our own fascination with violence. <br /> <br /> However, while Cronenberg confirms these philosophical references in an interview about the film, he claims he is very much opposed to the "Reality ... (underground name of terrorist group) depicted in the film, both in the game and in the "real" level. " Cronenberg does not seem to have put much thought into the film, although she has received impressive education. The interview in Cineaste gives the impression of a mid-brain intellectual who tries to be avant-garde. Cronenberg is on the side of the free imagination - the clich√©d bourgeois modernist creed - despite the recognized ambivalence there. (My impression here may be due to a limited interview.) Cronenburg still seems the point that his film imagines the error of imitative form (then mimics computer games while doing a satirical criticism of them, but a criticism not in is able to "surpass" the same form) probably because he actually thinks it is "imaginative" and radical. Yet, the imaginative world of the film is less bearable, and more jejune, than our own all-true world. It stays trapped in the computer game world view.
