What a shame this movie is never released. (It is now playing on the cable.) I agreed with my high respect for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie better than I recently paid in theaters. I like to be surprised. So often, movies are marketed as "offbeat", but are actually more of the same old recycled drive. This movie is really different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel. Although he is wanted by the plot to sing some of the most mawkishly sentimental songs ever written, he does so well, it doesn't care. Cathy Bates and Rupert Everett are well-cast and wonderful, but a newcomer to the role of Cathy Bates's daughter-in-law steals every scene she's in. Give this movie a chance.
