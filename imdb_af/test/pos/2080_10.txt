I saw several Hamlets, and I learned the scene. Looking at Jacobi, I'm tempted to think he's as intelligent as Hamlet himself. So lively is he on every nuance of the character of this character. Rather, he deepened every puzzle about Hamlet's character. He illuminates line, word by word, shines light in this sparkling thought. At the same time, however, Hamlet breaks the horror. Hamlet feels at his betrayal - much more than any other actor - because Jacobi feels the pain more than anyone else. And we shake Hamlet's own betrayal, because Jacobi isn't afraid of Hamlet's downfall. In short, Jacobi fully gives us Hamlet, and Hamlet is the greatest character in literature. That's why I'm happy that Jacobi's Hamlet is the best thing I've seen by an actor.
