The director, Ramin Niami, delivers the goods somewhere in the city. This hilarious farce, I believe, is in the tradition of a Mel Brooks comedy. Niami picks fun in New York society by creating the credible, eccentric and tragic characters of one apartment building that brings them to life from the very first shots they launch. Peter Stormare's performance as a gay Shakespeare actor is absolutely commendable and the film in general does a good job of showing the hopelessness and the ability of self-centered ambition. Sandra Bernhard is perfectly cast as the straight, self-obsessed therapist. I really enjoyed Sandra's performance, especially since I have not been a huge fan so far. Bai Ling, Ornella Muti, and Bulls Ogier make an international ensemble excellence. I loved the scene with Robert John Burke and his gang of idiotic criminals who could not plan a robbery if their lives depended on it. With a cameo appearance by Mayor Ed Koch and a solid performance by Paul Anthony Stewart, the revolutionary mom's son is entertained somewhere in the city without missing a rhythm.
