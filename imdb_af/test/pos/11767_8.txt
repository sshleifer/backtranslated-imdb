A fun skirt ... very good twists! (and we were not even baked!) <br /> <br /> Didn't know that this movie even existed until the extra trailers on a Monty Python DVD were watched ... (weird it was with The City of Lost Children, and the adventures of Baron Munchauhsen) <br /> <br /> The plot keeps you wondering all the time. <br /> <br /> The acting was wonderful ... Hank Azaria shows his talent again, Bill Bob is Billy Bob ... (wecis?) <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching.
