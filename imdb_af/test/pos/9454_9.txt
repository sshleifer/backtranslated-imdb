I thought this movie would be totally paralyzed because of the ads I saw in theaters. When my sister borrowed from a friend, I decided to see it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. . .Null to say ten minutes in the movie and I loved it. Amanda was a good actor in the film, her comedic timing was perfect. The man who played Duke was warm, simple and simple. My favorite scene was definitely when Amanda walks through the gardener and a fellow student who is suspicious of her and she talks to her mother about dresses - as she pretends to be a man! I watched this section over and over again ... to make a long story short, the movie I thought would be paralyzed. I own it now.
