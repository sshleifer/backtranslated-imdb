This one of those social dramas that WB knew about joining together and being guaranteed in the 1930s guaranteed in the thirty years. These early "dead children" are sent to a reform school where they are abused. Cagney, a gangster as part of a deal, is appointed as the school's commissioner. He doesn't even take it seriously, but he changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the boys' lives. The idea is to let the boys rule and administer their community. Whether it's healthy social reform is beyond my belief, but it's a movie. It's much like Boys Town with a slightly darker tone. An unrelenting happy ending reflects the impact of the scene before, but is still good. WB would later make the same films with Bogart in the Cagney / fatherly role.
