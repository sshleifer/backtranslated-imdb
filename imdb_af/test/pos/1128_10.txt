When I first sat down to watch Greek, I didn't expect a show with complex characters, intriguing plot lines and impeccable writing ... but that's exactly what I got. <br /> <br /> Greek follows several college students in the Greek system at the Cyprus Rhodes University. Rusty Cartwright enters Cyprus Rhodes as a polymer science head striving for a fraternity. His older sister, Casey (the center of the show and the golden president of Zeta Beta Zeta, the most sought-after girl on campus), doesn't support his plans. In fact, none of her friends knew she had a brother until he sat on the college ground! In addition to the fact that her brave younger brother was forced back into her life, Casey's boyfriend, Evan Chambers (short-of-campus brother on campus, Omega Chi) is with her a new ZBZ pledge fraud. (Rebecca Logan), the deadly ZBZ president, Frannie, insists on staying with him, and she still has feelings for her sleeping ex-boyfriend Cappie (president of the Holiday House on campus, Kappa Tau). These characters are named by Calvin Owens (an athletic, intelligent friend of Rusty's gay), Dale Kettlewell (Rusty's dying Christian and a possible racist roommate and best friend) and Ashleigh (Casey's oddly best friend and confidant). <br /> <br /> During the Greek seasons (or four chapters) viewers are reminded that the college life is not black and white, but "in the shades of gray from here." Each character makes their fair share of the mistakes, but each one has redeemable features. Casey and Cappie have a complicated but beautiful relationship in the series. Rusty, Dale and Calvin's friendship are not always perfect, but they manage to survive every obstacle thrown to them. Even Frannie, Rebecca and Evan (the shoulders of the shoulders) are seen every time a person. <br /> <br /> Greek shows students at best, worst and intervals. It is a show that college reveals as it really is: a four-year adventure where human morale, beliefs and willpower are tested, compromised and sometimes even changed. Greek has at least one season. left, if not more, before it ends. I can't wait to see where the characters end up. Greek is not your typical ABC family sitcom. If you want to join a show that shows the truth behind human motivation, Greek is the show for you.
