I was blown away by this movie. I'm one of those people who just run a risk with movies that don't rarely touch me, and I have to say this one has paid off. I mean, Wow! Even my young boys enjoyed the movie (5 and 6 at the time), although I am very sure it was not aimed at their age groups. <br /> <br /> This movie was also clean, which is a great plus. It is so nice to sit down on a movie you thoroughly enjoy without profanity, violence (except one very short scene) or something you probably find morally offensive. <br /> <br /> This movie has you on a journey you're so ready to believe because of the great acting. You feel the great variety of emotions portrayed with the characters. <br /> <br /> I never thought a golf club would have me on the edge of my seat, but I couldn't help much about how this one would turn out. I have nothing to compare it to, since I didn't watch golf in reality or on film, but everyone did a good job keeping the pace and emotions captivating. The score also did wonders; excellent, excellent score. <br /> <br /> Even if you don't think it will be your kind of movie, watch it. You may be pleasantly surprised. I was definitely.
