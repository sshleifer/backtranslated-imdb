Debbie Vickers (Nell Schofield) and Sue Knight (Jad Capelja) want to become one of the cool girls in their high school. Uncool and ugly girls had two options, be a mole or a prude! Debbie and Sue imitate them using their fraud practices in an exam. Two of the cool boys, Garry (Goeff Rhoe) and Danny (Tony Hughes) are asking for their answers and they are all snapped up. After a baby from the principal (Bud Tingwell), the cool girls meet them outside in the playground and confront them whether they are "batting" on them all. As Debbie and Sue did not have the cool girls, they invited the "dunnies" for a smoke. They then start with them on weekends on the beach and watch all the boys on the beach. Sue ends up with Danny and Debbie with Garry. Many ordinary teen action takes place, including sex, drugs and rock and roll. Garry has a possible overdose of heroin that faces Debbie over the inequalities of life and she decides to learn to surf instead of just watching the boys. They are not happy, but watch her, name names, and finally debbie masters the board. A cool early 80's Aussie movie.
