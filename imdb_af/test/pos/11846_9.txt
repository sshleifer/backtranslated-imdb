I loved this movie. It's a lot of laughter. The acting is good and the writing is really sharp. I'd rather watch a hundred movies than THREE LORD OF THE RINGS that repeat and repeat themselves. <br /> <br /> It's a low budget issue and apparently shot at DV, but looks good and Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson are good together. Why do you have a ten-line minimum? I'm not a critic, just a patron. <br /> <br /> I doubt many that Quentin Tarantino could write a photo, funny without filling it with masturbator-generous violence. This movie should be seen on more screens than just one. I laughed from start to finish. >
