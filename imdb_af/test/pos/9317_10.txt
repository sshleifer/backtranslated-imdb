Before I continue with the new millennium, I'll be back in time, because I was completely forgotten about this jewelery !!!!! <br /> <br /> In 1987 Disney, while still a "low" company in the 80's, was able to launch a series of television films called "Not Quite Human" about a geeky teenager, like in Inspector Gadget, looks like a man, but it's really a robot !!!!! Now this SCREAMS 80S, along with other movies like "Tron" and "Honey, I Shrunk The Kids", because it combines all of the older years with the technology of tomorrow !!!!! <br /> <br /> My parents remember to watch it back on the TV when I was just born or something. My first encounter with this movie, however, was on the Old Disney Channel (once I saw it, and the other parts, on my 12th B'day in May of99 !!!!!) <br /> <br /> " Not Quite Human "is a great series of movies to watch, if you can find these movies ever again. <br /> <br /> Has it been shown recently? If so, give me an email or personal message. <br /> <br /> 10/10
