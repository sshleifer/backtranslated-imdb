.. especially by lambert This is the essential Burrough's Tarzan that I grew up when I was a child. I read some negative reviews on this movie and can't help but wonder what their problem was. Of course, they didn't see the movie I did or they expected something that was more on the Saturday afternoon series. <br /> <br /> That was the Tarzan who was of the novel and the filmmakers should be applauded for tackling the source material and taking it seriously. Lambert was excellent. I still think he's one of Hollywood's most underrated actors. It was a movie in which he shone. <br /> <br /> Photography and monkeys, done by Rick Baker, were both great. You definitely felt the background of the jungle. The 2nd half, Tarzan's attempt to be civilized, really pulls you into the emotional conflict he had, and had to be forced. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie
