Many have fallen. Never say again because it's not an official Bond movie. Nevertheless, it is clear that the producers comply with the fertile Bond formula. Although the film does not have a pre-credit range, it is clear that the exercise at the start of the film is the introductory scene. It would have been impossible for EON to stop the producers from including a pre-credit and title series, though without the gunpowder introduction. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is in fine shape as the immortal secret agent and this movie is definitely better than dr no, thunderball, you just live twice and diamonds are forever. Though, NSNA is meant to be a remake of Thunderball, it's a big improvement. 007 spends more time on terra firma and a more diverse range of exotic sites is included in the film. <br /> <br /> There are some glittering performances in this movie. Barbara Carrera is impeccable as the bizarre Fatima Blush. One of the best scenes in the film is the coup between Bond and Fatima in Nice, preceded by a dynamic motorcycle race through the city. Klaus Maria Brandauer plays the psychotic Largo and Max Von Sydow is free of the melodrama depicted by other role players Blofeld. <br /> <br /> NSNA tends to focus on Connery rather than Bond's character. At the outset, Bond is declared obsolete and is out of order. It seems to refer to the 12-year-old hiatus in Connery's depiction of Bond. Bond promises "never again" to work in the Secret Service; a reference to Connery's portrayal of Bond. It appears that the producers were trying to injure the official Bond franchise. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is definitely worth watching. This is the last time Sean Connery played James Bond, but his performance convinced me that he might never have said "never again".
