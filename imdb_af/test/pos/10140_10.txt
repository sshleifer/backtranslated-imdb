This movie reminds me of the vibrant dramas of the 1950s - not like the recent "Failsafe", which looks more than a stunt than anything else, but a TRUE moral drama that is both tempting and enticing. Anne Heche is more than credible as the army officer has a relationship with her superiors, played by Sam Shepard, and Eric Stoltz is wonderful as her lawyer defends her against the military service. I waited for their case to start, even if it was just because they looked so good together. This movie is apparently based on a true story, and it is a relief to be asked about real-life change problems. <br /> <br /> Targeted by Christopher Menaul, who also did The Passion of Ayn Rand (with Stolz) and the Prime Suspect series, it's a panache and style movie and is absolutely worth it to see.
