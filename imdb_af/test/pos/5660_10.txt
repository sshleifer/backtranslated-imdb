I finally managed to see this movie ... after so many years of expectation ... <br /> <br /> I was so curious to see if this movie is as bad as some people say. <br /> <br /> And my opinion is that this movie wasn't bad at all, on the contrary, it was AMAZING ... <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it every second ... from the beginning down to the end ... <br /> <br /> The actors were great, they gave me the feeling that I lived the story at the same time the movie was playing. <br /> <br /> The landscapes were so beautiful the movie was shot ... and it charmed me. Also the music was extraordinary and I have nothing <br /> <br /> to reproach. <br /> <br /> I think the plot was very original, I don't think I've seen such a movie. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it is not recognized all over the world. Too bad for those who don't 'get the chance to see it. I give this movie 10/10
