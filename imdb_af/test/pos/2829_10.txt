And it says a lot. Rent it if you want to be disturbed by strangers, blown away by one of the most bizarre scripts, directions, and decisions in the history of movies. I'm disturbed. I can't believe I watched it. I'm a big Bernadette Peters fan, usually, but it tested my solution. Don't read more reviews here, it's better if you know nothing about the plot. Just rent. You won't believe what you see .......
