It is not a life-changing movie; It's not an epic or something. But it's entertaining, and it's fun. It's a movie that the whole family can watch together, and at the moment there are precious few child-friendly movies that don't have a love story in them! It tells a good story in a sad way without surprised the audience with over-the-top special effects, like many movies these days. It has a fairly good role to play, and all the music used fits well with the movie content. The acting is also pretty good, the actors seem comfortable and credible in their environment and the jokes are actually funny. I would recommend it to people of all ages - it definitely made me laugh. :)
