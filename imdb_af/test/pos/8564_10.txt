I gave it a 10 because it's the best movie of its kind ... a good old-fashioned T&A movie in the shadow and spirit of "Animal House." I saw it with a similar movie called "Swap Meet" and both were good of their kind ... a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Let's be honest ... there are more breasts in this movie than you might think for an R-rated movie. From start to finish, it appears that they appear only on the screen (sunset context, bedroom screens and of course the climax sport). Also, an unforgettable kiss house (kiss me, Clutz!) Everybody seems to have a good time in their roles (several Playboy Playmates, Danny Bonaduce, several well-known TV and movie actors, etc.). The only complaint I have to register is that Lisa is called London's character by her name O'Hara and not a good 1970's name like "Olivia" (or even Ora or Ona or O ... ?? !!). I saw it again in the late 1980s with my now ex-wife (very well equipped with herself) and she couldn't believe I really enjoyed the movie !! She was probably jealous !! Again, this movie is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon ... just don't think too hard!
