This is one of my favorite books and I remember remembering to watch this series and love it tremendously. Unfortunately, I have never seen it repeat or come on DVD, but it has made such an impact that I never forgot it. <br /> <br /> The main characters were perfect for the roles, especially the lovely Bryan Brown and although the scenes in Australia were not entirely in line with the book, they were at least there, unlike the movie version with Virginia McKenna missed that part. <br /> <br /> I agree that Gordon Jackson's character from Strachan is completely different from the book, but he is still excellent. For your information "MOLEY75" "Strawn" is the Gaelic pronunciation of "Strachan".
