This small, quiet, harmonious movie grows in a masterpiece on human dignity. It is intelligently structured, filled with meaningful little details and important margins. It tells a story of one man with a great humanity without positioning him politically, but promoting life as a precious right (not an obligation) and underlining the individual's right to choose. It enjoys the richness of different landscapes (spiritual and physical) and languages ​​(important detail). Outstanding performance by each of the actors, especially amazing Javier Bardem. His screen presence has such a power that you forget it's fiction. The movie has a wonderful rhythm, it is beautifully shot and excellently directed. It takes real talent to make a movie on such a difficult theme with understanding, humor and heart. Six stars out of five.
