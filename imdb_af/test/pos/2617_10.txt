Piper, Prue and Phoebe bring dr. Griffiths to the Manor trying to save him from The Source's personal killer, Shax. While Phoebe appears in the Book of Shadows to overtake Shax, Prue and Piper are attacked by Shax and chased him into the street. Unknown to Prue and Piper, they were filmed by a news reporter and her cameraman using their powers and broadcast live on national television. With Phoebe in the underworld, Prue, Piper and Leo must find a way to reverse the damage done. Leo goes down to Phoebe and tells her that the Charmed Ones are exposed as witches. On the surface, Piper is shot by a manic witch-wannabe, and Prue has to take her to the hospital. The problem here is that the crowd blocks the driveway. So Prue must use her magic on the crowd, and they go to the hospital. Piper is declared dead, and a SWAT team moves in. Leo learns about Piper's death and goes down to tell Phoebe. Cole is asked to ask The Source to recover time, and The Source agrees; just as Phoebe turns to the dark side. Phoebe agrees, but the deal will break them. On the surface, Prue and Piper Shax struggle. Prue calls out to Phoebe, who is not familiar with them in the Underworld. Shax throws Piper and Prue through a wall, and Dr Griffiths out of a window. Prue is not declared dead until the Season 4 Premiere episode, "Charmed Again, Part One". <br /> <br /> "All Hell Breaks Loose" is a gripping episode, and it has put me on the edge of my seat. . Sad that Prue is dead, but glad that there will be another five seasons of Charmed. My voice; 10 out of 10. EXCELLENT
