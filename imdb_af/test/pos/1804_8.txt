Valley Girl is an exceptionally well-made film with an all-encompassing role. Even though the dialogue is a bit dated, when the movie was released, it was very hip. To date, I know many people (including teenagers) who cannot form a sentence without using the word "like". This is without a doubt the legacy that this movie will leave. A score of 8 is given for this, like the best movie.
