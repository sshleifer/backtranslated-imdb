I took my younger cousin to an early show and she loved it (I enjoyed it too). I don't have to explain the plot, because the movie is absolutely true to the award-winning top-selling book by renowned author Carl Hiaasen. The movie takes the popular book and low it with beautiful cinematography (I want to go to Florida now!), Humor (thanks to funny man, Luke Wilson and some new comers), and fantastic music! I need a Jimmy Buffet CD now! I know a movie is good when I finally get goose bombs. Overall, it was a great family movie I feel comfortable taking my younger cousin. I would recommend it to everyone and everyone.
