Excellent and moving story of the end of a unique, intimate affair. Then again, the point of the film, to paraphrase another comment, is that each relationship can be unique and intimate. A true quality short film that caught me on my busiest, but I have the power to pull myself on the sofa and hold on for the duration and quiet. Bobby and Tessa are vigorously moving characters and anyone who has endured a love affair will find this movie a cat-like exercise. In addition, the "film within a film" idea plays very well with this role and it sounds rather albeit in a somewhat melancholic way.
