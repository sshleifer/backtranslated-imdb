This is the best television series for kids (and adults) ever. John Hurt is a good actor, with many excellent performances over many years, but he was born to play the storyteller. The scripts for almost every episode are great craftsmanship, and the productions range from the emotions, alternately funny, sad, happy, exciting and always haunting. It's hard to pick the best episode of so many excellent contenders, but "The Soldier and Death", with its timeless pathos, is unbeatable. It's a series to watch over and over with your kids.
