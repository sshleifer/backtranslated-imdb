The weakness of this comes from the confusing storytelling, plots often come out of nowhere. But it really didn't matter, because I've always enjoyed it. When you actually assume that these movies aren't being taken too seriously, you'll enjoy it even more. It's basically a love story, a confusing at first, but as it develops, it's really something worthwhile. Certainly, this has been done so many times before, but the complicated version of this is very inspiring and touching. <br /> <br /> The overall fantasy and CGI were initially overwhelming, but I still enjoyed it. And people stopped looking at how it borrowed from other movies !! Guess what we know !! And it doesn't matter, because his purpose was to be humorous and entertaining. Sometimes people have to stop being so critical and think for a while before they start overworking. Comparing it to Hollywood standards is completely stupid and ignorant. It's a totally different style and target audience. As far as I am concerned, the best films I watched are from eastern producers and directors. There is your police story 4, Shaolin sock, kung fu rabbit, dragon tiger gate, legend figure, hero, tiger etc. ... I for one like this movie and hauling from the Philippines, USA, England, Libya and now Australia, I will always be interested in these types of movies. Now try to judge my perception, but I warn you that I see things from the point of view of the 5 countries I lived in. So you should be better than experienced and open-minded.
