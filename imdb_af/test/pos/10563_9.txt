The story was well set up and interesting in itself. However, it is difficult for me to write the review of this movie without spoiling you. To avoid this, I'm not going to speak the story here. <br /> <br /> I see this movie as a good adaptation of Sarah Water's book, compared to the previous one that offends the velvet. I first read the book and then watched the DVD. The film retained the most spirits of the main characters in the book. Of course, due to the time constraints, the movie was in a hurry to cover the part III of the book in the last 30 minutes. That's why it couldn't illustrate the scene well when they all met in the kitchen of Mr Ibbs's place and the stuff after that (even the book was a rush to that kitchen scene). Despite this, the film actually did a good job of representing the story. It's really worth watching. It is not yet clear when BBC America can broadcast this film. That is a shame. <br /> <br /> PS: noted that the ages of Maud and Sue were 20-21 instead of 17-18 in the book; The latter is more reasonable, while the former is near the age of actresses.
