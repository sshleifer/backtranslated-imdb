Warning, contains spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Italian sleaze movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The plot has a teenage girl who is interested in occultism and has supernatural powers. . Her mother is a member of the Satanic group and is afraid of what influences it will have on the girl. No need to worry, the girl only knows what to do and there is no return, she belongs to Satan. <br /> <br /> During the movie, strange things go in typical Italian fashion. There isn't too much logic, but it's just good thing. It's wonderful how entertainment these movies are. At last battle we see her and her mother fighting each other naturally) and with some mysterious rituals, you can guess who wins ... The final photos open your mouth and wander why there can't be more movies like this ? <br /> <br /> There is great music throughout the film and the actors are pretty good, better than usual in these types of movies. Anne Heywood in particular looks and acts well. It also has some unusual cameras and glasses and stuff like that, so it's not boring at all. My rating is 10. <br /> <br /> Hopefully someone will download it on DVD.
