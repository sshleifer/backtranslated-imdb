It was said that Batman is starting in the first Batman movie to get it right, but I think it's a terrible over-statement because I think the new Batman movie, though bigger than Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, compared to Tim Burton's classic, with this one the best of the five. The darkness is beautiful, like the music and scenery, creating a mysterious Gotham city as opposed to Batman Begins, where Gotham City is an ordinary city. The villains are great in this movie. You can't literally get rid of your penguin's and cat's eyes. I welcome Tim Burton to be original with his use of the penguin as a freak, rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old Batman TV show. In Batman, we started the scarecrow, who is not as demanding on the screen as the penguin or cat woman. The movie does not just have to focus on Batman, because we already know his story, and these are the villains we are exploring and trying to find out, and they are the ones who create the plot, with the penguin running for mayor. and seek revenge for the abandonment of his parents by killing the first born sons of Gotham, a task he failed. Danny Devito gives the best performance ever by a superhero villain in any movie that even surpasses Nicholson's joker. The lockstone where the penguins drag the dead body of the penguin into the water is touching and powerful. It's a tragedy that Tim Burton couldn't complete his trilogy, as Warner Bros., who was interesting in the marketing appeal, wanted to ease the Batman movies. And they had their wish ... unhappy. Tim Burton plans to direct the third movie by using the Riddler as the villain, without Two-Face and Robin to renovate it, and I'm sure Michael Keaton would have signed up. So this is the last big Batman movie. Batman Begins is dark but boring, annoying, ordinary, filled with foolish villains, and a playboy Bruce Wayne. A decent Batman movie, but the best Batman movie ever? Never. Batman Returns holds that crown.
