It's a good movie, all three. The last one was not as good as the first 2, but it was made by the time and it went against straws. But you want to see it because it tells the end of the story. Just not how we think it should end. <br /> <br /> In all the hardships, love, tears, and laughter that people are throwing into this movie, these movies have made me feel. This is one of the few movies that is good every time you see it, no matter how many times it is. <br /> <br /> There are a few parts in the movie that the little ones do not understand and the parent may not be. old enough to watch. but it's a good movie stretching over 20+ years.
