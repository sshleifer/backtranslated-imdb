Dee Snider was inspired to make a two-part song through a horror movie. This film he wrote / arranged / produced and died in detail about the subjects from the songs (Horror-terria, from TwistedSister / Stay Hungry). People commented that he should have a sick mind to postpone such a thing. I don't hear anyone like Stephen King, Wes Craven, Dean Koontz, or in his own time, Alfred Hitchcock. The film profiles a modern psychotic created by current trends in society. Personally, I thought it was done pretty well by pure imagination and inspiration, even without the benefit of a huge budget and interviews with real victims / criminals. This movie is perfect if you want something to give your nightmares and let you know about the possible and probable. This can happen!
