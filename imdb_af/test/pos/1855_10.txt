Back to Me is a movie you want to own. It is a story of inspiration and family love that appeal to all ages. The story, though seemingly impossible, strives for divine intervention when a man loses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman receiving his wife's heart. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give warm sad performances to the designated to-lovers who accidentally meet. But the true story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial. Carol O'Connor as Minnie Driver's grandfather is authentic in every scene. Bonnie Hunt as the friend whose encouragement Minnie as a "sister" underlines is still funny in the scenes, especially with James Belushi as her husband. Classic scenes and writing make this story so nice and touchy to look over and over. Thanks for making a movie that shows families and friends as a meticulous caring that keeps people together from difficult times.
