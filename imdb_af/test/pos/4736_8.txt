The movie someone had to make. <br /> <br /> Waco: The Rules of Involvement analyze the evidence behind the standstill in Waco, Texas, which led to the destruction of the Davidian House Branch and the alleged government site. <br /> <br /> The first thing you should know about this movie: you will see short but disturbing photos of the victims' bodies. This was not done for shock value, but to illustrate points about how they died, as if you were against the investigator's investigation. <br /> <br /> The second thing you need to know about this movie: at two and a half hours, it's pretty puzzling - especially if you've already followed the events right now. If you are not aware of any of the events other than those reported in the mass media, or if the only side of the story you are known to be the official government report, it may be necessary. However, if you want a more consistent (though unapologetically one-sided) version of events, you should see "Waco: The Big Lie". <br /> <br /> In summary, it's almost the definitive documentary on this tragic event, and is very disillusioned, but as a movie maker, you can test your patience, especially if you have a short attention span. And it's sometimes superfluous for those who watched the CSPAN hearings and the 60 minute reports. <br /> <br /> Perhaps someone will one day make a documentary that covers some of the strange aspects of this story, such as the bizarre chain of events that led to the ATF attacks or psychological warfare tactics, the FBI shoots music using the sect and their charismatic leaders (all rock musicians themselves) pick up their instruments and turn their massive amps to blow their own music straight back. with them.
