The antiwar musical "Hair" is my number one cult movie. I don't know how long I watched this movie in the movie theaters and on VHS, or how many times did I listen to the CD with the incredible soundtrack and now this masterpiece was finally released on DVD in Brazil. <br /> The pacifist and touch of the story is still wonderful, a song of freedom, friendship and freedom of choice, and portraying the resistance of a generation against the stupidity of war. I do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the anti-culture of the 70's and their dreams, as the present world is probably worse than in the 70's. I don't remember who won the Oscar in 1979, but Treat Williams and John Savage deserve at least a nomination for their incredible performances. Beverly D'Angelo is extraordinarily beautiful in the role of a hypocrite-removed top-class teenager. I've probably seen more than twelve times "Hare", and my eyes always get wet while Berger walks to the plane. "I am, it's me, it's me" and I start crying with his grave in the cemetery. I believe that this is one of the most beautiful, heartfelt and gripping conclusions of theater history. My wife, my daughter and my son also love this movie; Therefore, I can guarantee that "Hair" is timeless and recommended for any audience. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Hair"
