by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who dies as Reggie, fights with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold recently released from prison, helps Reggie kill his father. A week after his father died, a preacher, Reverend Packer, died. Reggie was the one who killed him, but did he? Did Reggie Reverend Packer kill or was it a kind of setup? Back in the day there are some romantic scenes. Look, Reggie falls in love with the minister's daughter and J-Bone doesn't accept his love flight. As J-Bone tries to destroy what they have, Reggie learns that love is about forgiveness. But what does J-leg do, does it work? Does Reggie and his girlfriend stop or bring them closer? I like this movie because it makes you wonder what will happen next and has it or it happens. I like movies with excitement! This kind of makes you want to be in the movie so you can find things. I also like this movie because everything is in its place, if you really notice it!
