My family really enjoyed this movie. What this movie will do for the rugby in the US ... well, I'm sure it will be debatable. But for me and others, I know we were more curious about the sport after we saw the movie and I got more respect for the game. You may wonder how this is possible, especially since the movie does not dive and explain rugby. But the simple fact is it has drawn you into the players and emotions of the game and life. The film was inspiring and entertaining. It made us laugh and cry. The chemistry between Sean Astin, Big Budah and Sean Faris did well. Some may think the movie is a bit cliché, but I seriously wish that Hollywood made more movies like this. I couldn't help drawing analogies from the game and life's struggle. At the end, I investigated myself to investigate my own life to see what I needed to do better, to be the best person I could be. Honestly, I was grateful that this film taught moral values ​​and teamwork. There is so much opposite. After watching it, I really hope my kids are coached by someone who has a philosophy like Coach Gelwix.
