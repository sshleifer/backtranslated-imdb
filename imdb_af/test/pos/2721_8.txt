After Mrs. And Mr. Iyer is another very good film by Aparna sen (mostly in English). In the previous film, she treated a contemporary political environment and its impact on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally handicapped family member and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she deals with a philosophical understanding of "reality". Mithee, the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen), suffers from schizophrenia cared for by the predominantly older sister Anjali. It's a movie that leads to thinking about the movie. <br /> <br /> Mithee, the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma (Shabana Azmi). Mithee after her marriage to Jojo and divorcing him believes that she is still with JOJO and her five children in 15 Park Avenue in Kolkotta) (There is no such address in Kolkotta - it looks like there is one in New York) and she is intense in her faith, almost like an intense religious belief, ultimately, what is reality? she tells Anjali: "If I tell you that you are not a professor, but just think you are a professor." The open end reflects this reality, in a so-called search for her house in the park street, Mithee is The penultimate scene is Mithee and looks at a group of five children who play and look at them with joy to return to her family and then she is lost. About this concept of reality I am reminded of another fifty film called HARRY with James Stewart The protagonist believes a big size rabbit (?) called Harry, a He is always with him and he always talks to him. In the end, even the doctor may believe there is Harry. What is the reality is what the protagonist believes or what others believe Shabhna Azmi dominates the movie with her excellent performance as the stronger older sister, with frustration. Konkana Sen Sharma gives as much performance as the schizophrenic. <br /> <br /> However, the film is not as strict as Mrs and Mrs. No more. There seem to be a few loose points. And maybe there are too many characters. Those who want a closed end may not appreciate the open end here. But the end fits the theme of the movie. <br /> <br /> Another good movie by Aparana sen.
