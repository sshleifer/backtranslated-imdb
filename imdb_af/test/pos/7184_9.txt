I was a little scared when I went to the cinema to see this movie. Indeed, it is always difficult to make a movie from a cartoon and the first episode of the adventures of the French two greatest heroes was good, but not fantastic. Finally, from the beginning to the end, it is very funny, with unexpected gags, some cartoon scenes, no timings, a big FX, a big role, big landscapes, everything !!! !!! how they succeed in translating all the French names into English or German, because it is definitely funny in French, but how will that be in another language ???
