It may actually be the best movie of 1999. No, I'm not joking. This documentary directed by Chris Smith captures the spirit of artistic coercion. Smith does the clever thing any documentary filmmaker has to do: he keeps invisible and refuses to judge his subject. <br /> <br /> As the viewer looks at Mark and his efforts, no matter how funny aggressive they can prove to complete his films. He refuses to compromise and suffers repeatedly as a result. But if we don't forget, Speilberg, Scorsese and others remember just as humbly. <br /> <br /> And what a great subject he chooses. Mark, his family and friends are all fascinating characters, much more than any character created in last year's fictional film products. This film ranges from comedy, tragedy, sympathy, and ultimately leads us to inspire any viewer with an urge to create, in spite of talent issues, to take out their butt and make something. <br /> <br /> The film is about maverick artists and their passions. It's also about families, no matter how co-dependent and dysfunctional they may be and how unique and beautiful that organism is. In the film Markus proves that he is not only devoted to his dreams, but also to his family - and to them. <br /> <br /> Why this movie was not nominated as a documentary of the year is beyond me and criminal (it assumes it was eligible last year). This movie is sought and appreciated.
