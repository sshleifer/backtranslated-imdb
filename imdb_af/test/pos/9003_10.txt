First of all, I hardly know anything about rugby, so although I found the rugby aspect of this movie to be interesting, it could be any sport and I think I would have enjoyed it so much. The fact that it did not make it better or worse for me like rugby. <br /> <br /> What made this movie good is the story itself based on real events that have occurred over the past 30 years with the Highland Rugby club. Coach Gelwix is ​​the kind of coach most every parent would like them to have children, someone who cares more about the person than sports (although they have won 17 national championships and lost only 9 games in more than 30 years !). The more I learned about the coach and the team the more I enjoy this movie and its message. <br /> <br /> I watched other sports films that were initially nice, but then I just examined the details to find them. Most of the movies were 10% fact and 90% fiction, with 10% being of the facts is very exaggerated. Not so with Forever Strong. It may be too good to be true, but it's so wonderful about it. If it were fiction, it would just be a pleasant story and nothing more. Instead, the movie is inspiring and you want to be a better person. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie due to some negative reviews by professional critics. I read some of their reviews and most of them gave the movie horrible reviews. It is generally the same critics who thrive on movies that most people hate. In fact, I would worry if some of these critics gave the movie good reviews because I almost always disagree with their opinions. <br /> <br /> Check out this movie and post your review (positive or negative)! Currently, most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I'm interested to see if this trend continues. Thank you!
