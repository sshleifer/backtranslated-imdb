This movie is about three teens who have become the best friends ever, and go on the most wasted journey of their lives. When Heroine becomes the drug of choice in their town, these three teenagers find themselves in it. This movie depicts heroin addiction very well, and is something you can't stop looking at. MTV has never been the best to do for TV movies, but this one has very good content not to watch. I enjoyed this movie, at first I thought it would be the worst movie I saw, but then it got better and I couldn't turn away.
