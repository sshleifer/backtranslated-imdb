These critics need a new job !!! This movie is based on a true story that made history. It illustrates how love can overcome love in everything in war and tragedy. The breathtaking Cephalonia of Greece caught my heart and soul as though I was there. The Blue Eyed Cage & the Delicious Cruz were wonderful! Together, they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only be approached in the time of war. This movie will touch your heart as it did mine, you should see it !!!!
