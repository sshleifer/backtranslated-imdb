I've already given my comment on this movie under the name of BruceV3. Now under BruceV13 I want to add something! After a long time I saw many heroic bloodshed titles! But not many come close to the action shown in John Woo movies! That's why I think for years that it's strange that "China White" doesn't earn the credit it deserves! No matter what version you've seen! Plus, the action is! The landscape, China Town in Amsterdam is very unique. You get the impression that this is a great district. But I lived in Amsterdam myself, but I know it's only a small part of the red light district that has many Chinese shops and restaurants! But because of the way they shot the movie, it actually looks like a big and important area where people know not to waste with the threesome (Chinese mafia)! Besides the action "China White" is a compelling gangster drama with some good acting! For this I need to give Russel Wong credit! Too bad we don't see much of him, because he has a lot of potential! Must watch movie!
