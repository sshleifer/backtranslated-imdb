Dirty Dancing was one of the best films to come out of the seventies. It was a low-budget movie with high returns. With a soundtrack that makes you stand up and dance, to a love story we all want us to live (at least if you're a woman), it's a movie you'd like to watch over and over. <br /> <br /> The music, which drives the movie, is optimistic and flows well with the emotions drawn from the viewer. Some of the classic '60's hits like' Love Man 'by Otis Redding and' Big Girls Do not Cry 'by Frankie Valli until' 80s hits like Eric Carmen's "Hungry Eyes" and Frank Zappacosta's "Overload". Dirty Dancing is a mix of fun and sensuality, showing the transformation of a young girl from shy teen to a thriving femininity, all against the beautiful backdrop of a summer romance that has all changed our hope and desire. <br /> <br /> The dance in "Dirty Dancing" should not be forgotten. Cynthia Rhodes shines in her role as Penny, a dancer who can even challenge the most fluid and fine gymnasts. Patrick Swayze does more than a fantastic job and shows more and more of his skills, not only as an actor, but also dancer and singer. And Jennifer Gray shines as Baby, while her transformation in dance also shows her transformation in status. <br /> <br /> All in all, Dirty Dancing is one of the best movies of all time, and worth the least to watch. It is doubtful that the first beat of the Ronette's "Be My Baby" in the opening title will not draw your attention and will draw you into a magical world of sensual dance and musical enchantment.
