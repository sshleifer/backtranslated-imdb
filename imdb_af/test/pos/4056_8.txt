For the first time I saw "Signs of Life" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderful written ensemble production with fantastic performances by Michael Lewis and Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an obsolete ship builder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the role that Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker include, gives remarkable clarity and content to their characters. <br /> <br /> The direction is subtle and effective. I watched the movie several times over the years and would highly recommend it. A beautiful piece of film filming.
