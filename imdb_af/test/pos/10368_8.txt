Although I definitely read this particular Agatha Christie book at some time, I didn't remember anything except the name "Abernethie". This is a good thing, because since I unfolded this story without knowing how it would spell, I once again appreciated the sheer genius of Agatha Christie: the way she misled you and then the bottom of the bottom out of your feet is the main reason for her success and timelessness. Except for her stories, the excellent production values, beautiful places, great music, top-notch acting, elegant direction, etc. are. The reasons for the success and timelessness of this series - and all the virtues are present in "After the Funeral". A word of advice: Be up-to-date - there are clues everywhere in the opening order! There are also some rather unpleasant moments, unlike the peaceful English country villages, and a few small signs of humor. A must-see for mystery buffs, and just a very good movie in general.
