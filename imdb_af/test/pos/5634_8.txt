What this film gives his personality is the knowledge, in the end, that this is all true. Although it is a compelling and humorous documentary that borders on certain parts of the author (are they staged or are they really humorous)? It looks like it's been a bit long to the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny in places it should be, and flows pretty well. Remembering Christopher Guest's movies, if you like or have customization, I encourage you to watch this one out. <br /> <br /> B +
