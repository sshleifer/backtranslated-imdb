An extremely measured, well-made and activated "Rodeo" Western. No gussied stars were needed here, as all the cast members were regular people telling a true life story about a rodeo hustler and his entry into the 60's and 70's. But especially hate Slim Pickens to give what I think was his signature performance, especially because he was a rodeo clown in real life. His role has gone far beyond the mere clone role, as he handles the overall ups and downs of the difficult rodeo life and the psychological devastation so often surrounded by such a lifestyle. He and Mr. Coburn worked very well together as partners, not just on the circuit itself, but also in the real world outside the coral. Also watch Anne Archer as Coburn's native American love interest in the latter part of the movie. Must have been one of her first roles. <br /> <br /> Not as flashy, perhaps as "Junior Bonner", but equally sad and influenced in his depiction. Thanks to the Encore Western Channel from time to time showing this true grit of an underneath movie.
