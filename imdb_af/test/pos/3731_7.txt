I saw it today with little background on what to expect from the storyline. I go to the movie as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a "story". I found this to be a good movie, not good, but good. It was my money and worth my tears :) <br /> <br /> Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere is not an over-actor. He kept his own and has a certain presence that we will always expect. He brings his own style to the movie. <br /> <br /> I think it was the kind of love story that wasn't always told. It was messy and they had other priorities, but they wanted to be together and wanted to wait for each other. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend it!
