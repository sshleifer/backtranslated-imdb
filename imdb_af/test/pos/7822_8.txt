It's a good Valentine's Day gift. A beautiful man and a pretty girl are in love while trying to beat the competition during a baking competition. Very romantic. I have been a true fan of Costas Mandylor since his days at Picket Fences and he has not lost his appeal. Lauren Holly is still beautiful and rich and the two still have good chemistry together. The supporting role was also good. Since all those wonderful desserts are made, it was a glorious sight in itself. I loved that Costas and Lauren had teamed up to fall in love and fall in love. This is the kind of movie that saturates every palate, romantic and otherwise. Hallmark always shows excellence in their programming and it is no exception. The whole family can see this movie. Also show that sometimes love over any presence triumphs. I sighed and wanted more for this movie and also longed for those wonderful desserts. I highly recommend this movie for all ages. A great surprise for everyone.
