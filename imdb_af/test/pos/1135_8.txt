I really like the show !! As part of Greek life I can say that some things are too exaggerated, but overall it's pretty nice damn funny. <br /> <br /> Rusty is a nice character, his roommate is HILARIOUS and the whole role is fun in their own rights. I like that it focuses on individual situations as well as interpersonal relationships with the organizations. <br /> <br /> This show covers it all, and they do it without curse or anything else bad (how else can it be on ABC Family?). <br /> <br /> My favorites are Cappie (of course), Rusty's roommate and almost all Kappa Tau. This show is an excellent launcher for them and I am excited to see what doors it opens. <br /> <br /> Please review this show next summer, ABC Family. As I said, love love, LOVE!
