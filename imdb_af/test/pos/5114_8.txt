It is a very good movie with great humor. Jim Verney, as we know, was very good at facial expressions and shows a lot in this movie. It's definitely the best of the Ernest movies. I would definitely recommend any Ernest fan out there. I like my taste. in movies and I'm sure everyone will enjoy this movie. In the movie Ernest plays 2 roles, bad old and good guy and plays them very well. I really enjoy exaggerated humor, where things just seem impossible, such as in the naked rifle films, and there is a lot of it in this movie. I bought this movie just after I saw it. Good directing, good writing, worth renting.
