While caricatures and / or references to the entertainment industry are people or things or even brands of products usually a staple in shorts like this, they are not used in quantity. Most of the individual gags are rather generic. As I will give examples, there are pampering below: <br /> <br /> There are only three (well, technically four- there is a fast one at the end of the cartoon) caricatures I have seen, so what Low for this type of short, although one is a distinctive character with a fair amount of activity. They are Jack Benny (as Jack Bunny), Leopold Stowkowski and the indifferent Ned Sparks (as a crab at a chance is very good that, if a short short in the 1930s and 1940s were involved with a Warner Brothers, the caricature would be Ned Sparks). There are also references to Billy Rose's Aquacade and a riff on a radio program character called Henry Aldrich. It's a play on Superman (Superguy here) and the villain is starting on King Kong. That's it for that kind of gag. <br /> <br /> The products themselves are mostly generic and the gags play more on basic items in unusual situations, such as tortoises coming from sweet potatoes to attack the villain as tanks. , tomato soup tins do "The can-can", gingerbread men who are in parachutists, using parachute tissues, etc. The gags are very good and this is an excellent example of a Bob Clampett cartoon. Clampett has his struggle as a director at this point and while it's not near his best job, it's nothing to sneeze at. These cards can be found at Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Vol. 3, which is an excellent set that I highly recommend. itself is also recommended.
