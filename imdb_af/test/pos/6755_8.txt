One of Starewicz's longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog ​​looking for an orange after being animated by the maiden tear of a girl who longs for an orange. The dog comes across an orange after being sold out of the back of a car, but at night he has to protect the orange as he enters a devilish nightclub with many bizarre and scary characters. With the help of a stuffed cat, the dog gets the orange back to the girl and she is rescued from a terrible scab death. The Mascotte has new techniques I haven't seen in Starewicz's movies yet. Adding the sync sound and a mix of live action to the stop-motion animation makes for a new twist on Starewicz's old style of puppet show. Live scenes of moving cars and people's feet walk through as a puppet on the concrete pavement, is impressive and fresh. The onslaught of cars and crying by street vendors is remarkable due to the fact that small studio cases sound, expensive and Starewicz's use of the new technology looks like an old hat. New puppet characters in this movie are scary contributions to the devil's club scene. Twigss and Newspaper come to life. Skeletons of dead birds lay eggs that hatch chickens. Characters come from all over pats and pans and rocking horses. A new editing technique uses fast zooming that is achieved through editing to accelerate the pace of what might previously be a slow scene. Overall, Starewicz is able to change his style of film-making to meet the demands of a new audience that makes this film one of the best examples of his work.
