Although it deviates a little from the book, you can't help to love the atmospheric music and settings. <br /> <br /> The scenes in Bath are just how they should be. Although if you watched it as many times as you can see that the background is the same in every scene, but what I want, I like the scene where they are in the Warmbaths, but the men and women really bathed like that ? You could see that all the men were sitting around the outside of the women. It was also strange that they all had their hats, but maybe it was the style at the time. The ballroom scenes were very nice, the dance and the outfits look nice. I especially watched Catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene. <br /> <br /> The Northanger abbey looks appropriate, but I enjoyed the batele better. <br /> <br /> Schlesinger gives good but not exceptional performance to Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the best performance as Mrs. Allen. <br /> <br /> Ugh Peter Firth like Mr Tilney, he just speaks a garbage and is not a pastor like he should be, it's hard to think of he is in love with Catherine, but then the book never gave the impression. <br /> <br /> General Tilney is played fairly well by Hardy, and Stuart also gives some kind of good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey didn't give a good performance as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but I like it. <br /> <br /> I can handle scenes cut from a book adjustment. But when new scenes and characters are added, it usually irritates me. The marchioness! I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story, nor her cart-page boy. <br /> <br /> Some of the scripts are peculiar. When Catherine Elinor Tilney asked about her mother's death, she asked, "I suppose you saw the body? How did it appear?" What a stupid thing to say! Elinor's calm reaction is also stupid. <br /> <br /> Anyway, please tell me if you agree or disagree with me
