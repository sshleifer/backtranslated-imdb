Having seen the movie years ago and being disappointed by its wasted potential, when I heard it was a TV series, I flatly refused to see it. My best friend immediately became a rabid fan, and I knew my love for horror movies couldn't believe I wouldn't watch a single episode. I told him that the movie scared me for life as much as BUFFY for me, and he told me the movie even existed. He insisted that I give a shot two episodes: "Once More With Feeling" and this one. <br /> <br /> Both of them are why I'm a BUFFY fan today. He was right - I was immediately addicted. I have never seen a show that is trying to try an episode that has no dialogue, and nothing else could have done with the panache and pure creativity of BUFFY. I think X FILES might have got away with it if they first thought about it, but I'm glad BUFFY did it earlier. <br /> <br /> It's a credit to everyone involved, that you sound the whole hour, sometimes hanging on the edge of your seat. And when it was over, I wanted to know more about each character. So I went out and bought the Season One Box Set. And the rest is history ... <br /> <br /> I guarantee you that if you have never seen it, you also want to see more if you make this episode your first. <br /> <br /> The only reason I don't give it 10 out of 10 is because I reserved that score for "Once More ...".
