At the end of my Cache review, I wrote that I was intrigued by Haneke as a movie maker. It led me to get the DVD for La Pianiste, which I just finished about an hour ago. <br /> <br /> It's all expressed, here at IMDb and in many of the external reviews - the horribly distorted pathology that an individual like Huppert's Erika would create, which after years and years has been trying to make her mother, at the expense of everyone and everyone else in her life, starting with herself. She suppressed everything that would free her from her self-obliging slavery, including, of course, her sexuality, which literally imploded to the point of madness, where she couldn't even grasp what a true loving impulse would feel like. <br /> <br /> It's a graphic portrait of a serious emotional cripple, one that never gets the power to get out of her childhood situation and becomes a functional adult. I think this topic is related to all of us - we all strive for autonomy, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even at the conscious level. It is also brilliant with the contrast between what you fantasize, sexually and the reality of those fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share your sexual fantasies with another person. Huppert's character gets what she asks in the course of the film, and it's hardly the emancipating experience she thought it was. <br /> <br /> Regarding the much discussed scene in the bathroom, I really appreciated how this sequence sucked out all the possible erotic charge (for the viewer, I mean) from the previous scene where she was sitting. glass in the girl's pocket. By the time she sees her late-as-a-man-worthy scenario in the bathroom, we've already found out that she's been dangerously disturbed and that's why it's not a turn, her little domination session with our poor, unsuspecting dup. <br /> <br /> I think another amazing achievement of this movie is how I forgot halfway that I wasn't in English and that I read subtitles. It never happened, in any foreign movie, and I saw quite a few. <br /> <br /> In this movie, like Cache, the end is not all wrapped up in a nice, neat bow, but unlike Cache we get at least some finality, despite the fact that we not even sure if Huppert's character is alive or dead. After the experience of La Pianiste, when it comes to Michael Haneke, I have no need to say more than a little thing.
