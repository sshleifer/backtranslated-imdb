Yes, this is one of the big ones of the black action genre. Confusing mix of racist comedy and racist violence (at times a disturbing pitch, even for a fan of the genre), this movie is not your Shaft in the park. Wonderful pieces of Rudy Ray Moore's comedy stand that doesn't seem funny, at least not to a white boy like me, but great in context. Much better than its diverse successor, "The Human Tornado"
