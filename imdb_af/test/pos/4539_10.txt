This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Should you be pathetic? Well, yes this is. But Chris is incredibly funny. His innocent brilliance comes out more in this movie than in any of his other films. Look at both motel tones, when Spade gets caught with his zipper, and the other: "AWAY YOU FOR LOVE GOD !!!"
