In this movie "Virtual Sexuality", 17-year-old Justine is not happy in love. One day when she got up, she went with her friend to a real-life conference. There she is introduced to a machine that changes your look, death and everything you want in Virtual Reality. She decided to try it out, but started a boyfriend of her own, her dream day. Then there is suddenly an explosion in a gas pipe and her creation comes to life. I will no longer say, you have to watch the movie, which is quite nice to watch.
