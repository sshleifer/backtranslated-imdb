It's one of those classic American made for TV movies just made to watch a rainy afternoon. Although the writing is highly unreliable, it never gets too serious, nor is the role of a big tongue in miscarriage / horror movie being best enjoyed with a basil popcorn or a box of chocolate. A great bonus of this movie is the fantastic location filming and despite the strange departure and even strangers around the Tommahawk Lake, because you won't mind it! <br /> <br /> All in all, a great movie to watch over and over.
