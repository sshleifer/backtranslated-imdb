This movie will probably be too sentimental for many viewers, especially contemporary audiences. Yet I enjoyed this movie, especially thanks to William Holden, one of my favorite stars, and the brilliant beauty of Jennifer Jones. There were some real heartwarming scenes between the two and the talent of these two actors saved in less hands temporary lines. The cinematography of Hong Kong from the time of filming is another highlight of this movie. All in all, better than average romantic drama, 7/10.
