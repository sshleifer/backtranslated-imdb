Where do I start? I only saw this movie in 1995 and didn't have an idea of ​​what to expect. I was actually looking for movies where Elijah Wood was in the stars and this one strongly recommended. I sit down and watch the movie once and don't know what to think. I watched it a second time a few times later and the flood gates just opened. Never before in my life have I ever really screamed while watching a movie, and I have been driving a high and low movie that I ride right on an emotional toboggan run. <br /> <br /> It has such an emotional cord in me on many levels, the intense sadness and elation we see in the movie, the wonder and innocence of childhood, the longing for a time that once was, but not anymore. More than anything, this movie reminded me of my childhood (except for the abuse) during a time in my life when I had just pulled off my childhood a few years before and didn't even notice, I surrendered it and attacked a life completely without it. The radio flyer made me wake up and suddenly realized what I was giving up without really watching. From that day on I immediately agreed to change my life and myself, and I did. <br /> <br /> It's going to sound, but I basically rediscovered my inner child, I started a continuous path over the past 6 years and changed so much, so much for the better, that part of myself to embrace and live. I found out who I really am. I don't think it was just a case of the real film coming at a critical moment in my life. The Radio Flyer really did something very special and I still regard it as an amazing piece of work in all respects, an incredible movie. <br /> <br /> Eventually I can't call the music. I am a big fan of Hans Zimmer and this is one of his best works. The sheer breadth and depth of emotional expression he put into the movie of this movie is a big part of what the film does for me. Like subtitles to a foreign language film, its rising music is a ripple sheet for the intense emotions that this movie will bring you. Find the soundtrack at all costs, unfortunately it has been removed a long time ago, I never expected to find it, but done amazingly after talking to someone I met on a Hans Zimmer fansite gasbook. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, let yourself live the emotions, don't get into the trivial end of the end, be that child again
