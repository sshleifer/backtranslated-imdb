OK, it's not easy to confuse it with the Lame Stuart Gordon movie called "Death Bed" which came back a few years ago, because this one is the "Bed that eats". And how do I even begin to describe it? Well, for the start, of course there is a bed that eats. This is because of devil branches, which obviously affect most things, I think, in a negative way. The bed is in some old servants or something, and is responsible for the disappearance of quite a few people in his time. We have a narrator, who is a ghost sitting in the wall behind a painting, collecting all the edible candy (jewelry, etc.) on which the bed goes. He died of consumption, one of the few people lying in bed who could not be eaten, probably because he was sick, he theorized, as we see him chopping in blood. The thing about this movie is it's a very strange sense of humor, but it's all played pretty deadly. The movie is divided into several "acts", I think, "Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, And Just Desserts". For fans of the strangely strange and bizarre, well, it may just be upright you. All I can say is that you have to see this one to believe it, it's very good at description. 8 out of 10 stars.
