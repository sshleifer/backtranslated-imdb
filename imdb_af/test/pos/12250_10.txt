Not only do I think it's the best movie of 1987, it's probably in my own amorphous list as one of the 10-20 best movies I've ever seen. For whatever reason, I really related to this movie, and this is one of the most personal films I saw at that time in my life (I was 26). For better or worse, I strongly identified with the Holly Hunter character (and I'm an old one!). She plays a very bright, loyal and intense woman who could not find romantic relationships. There were so many things she said in this movie, these were things I would say or say to others in similar circumstances. And the end of the movie is so much, very sad. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this role was the big break for Holly Hunter. It was clear that I was not the only one to think so high about it.
