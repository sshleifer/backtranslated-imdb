Years ago, Madonna broke through 'Ray of Light' into a wonderful musical artwork and since then she has even passed on her own standards. This concert production, with its hypnotic editing, wonderful dance, hallucinatory lighting effects, and trance-inducing arrangements, blows away all previous efforts. Madonna's apparent pursuit of world peace through music and dance in a one-handed way may be hubris or absurd for some. But hell, someone has to do it! Thanks to her compilation of the remarkable talent of everyone involved in this production, her "Confessions Tour Live from London" puts her one of the top ten artists working anywhere in the world.
