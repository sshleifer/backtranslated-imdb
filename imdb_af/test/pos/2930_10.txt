This is a simple episode ad so far after all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) have been watched. It's the one who laughed the most, definitely my favorite so far. a toy store, a child who has the Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is wonderful since Kyle as soon as he knows if it's like "he's falling." Cartman is definitely on fire, and says what he wants to do to the teacher, to the principal, to anyone. On the other hand, we have Kyle, who is now the intolerant one. To say that Cartman was falling, he was taken to meet children with Tourette's syndrome, just to show him that Tourette's syndrome is real and that is great, as Kyle is "good" Maybe someone is having Tourette's for fun ", in short, Kyle can't explain that Cartman was falling. Probably, my favorite scene of this episode is when Cartman is with Kyle's family, but right to this scene is still" a child who Cartaking simply faking, the child with Tourette who was at the toy store, basically told Cartman to the child: t have Tourette's awesome ". But to say what he wants and to be a brave boy for everyone is just the start for Cartman, his master plan: go on National TV to say something he wants ("people will call it brilliant TV, they will probably give me an Emmy "- fantastic, in this episode the word" s *** "is used 26 times and definitely not all, South Park has won an Emmy like a month or so before this episode broadcast). But here's a twist, Cartman almost removed all the bricks from the wall. He now says everything without thinking, so we hear from Cartman that he knew his bed last night. It's not nice for Cartman and he's like "I can't control what I say" and definitely the person who was with him is like "of course, you can't control what you say, you have Tourette's" Cartman so like "my Tourette's got worse before I just blew out things. About the Jews are getting lame and stuff, but now it's really bad." There are also things about Chris Hansen and a Predator catch, actually what happened to A pervert happens here with many more perverts. Kyle and Thomas were behind it to stop Cartman. Kyle ends Cartman's savior! Great! <br /> <br /> TSA VOICES CONCERN About the South Park October 3 Episode <br /> On Wednesday, October 3, the cable network Comedy Central will be an episode of the animated series "South Park" in which one of the young characters, Cartman, gets "Tourette Syndrome". Given the nature of this program, we fully expect it to be offensive and insensitive to people with TS and to get numerous calls and emails from our members and the TS community. <br /> <br /> We have already taken preferences strikes, such as requesting that Comedy Central air our public service announcement (with comedian Richard Lewis) during or after the show. In addition, once the episode broadcasts and we can see exactly how TS is portrayed, we will be able to respond with specific problems and problems we have with the authors' shoulders. <br /> <br /> "We were actually surprised, it took the creators so long to use TS as a comedy feed in this program, since no disability, illness or controversial subject matter to them," Judit Ungar said. president, TSA said. <br /> <br /> "We always see TS depictions (good and bad) as an opportunity for awareness and education, and a show of this scope and popularity is certainly no exception and offers a way for TSA to disseminate factual information about the disorder, "said Tracy Colletti-Flynn, Public Relations and Communications Manager, TSA. <br /> <br /> We will place an official statement on this site with TSA's response to the program to the show air. <br /> <br /> TSA RESPONDING to "South Park" Episode <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as with too many media depictions of people lying with Tourette Syndrome (TS), the season has Opener from South Park ("Le Petit Tourette", 10-3-07) continues the unfinished myth, that most of those affected by TS have involuntary outbursts of false language. In fact, 85-90% of people with TS never experienced this tragically social stigmatizing symptom (medically called coprolalia). For viewers less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder, the deceptive removal message could not have been clear ?? unless you curse, you don't have TS. <br /> <br /> Despite our previous tensions, we admit that the episode is surprisingly well researched. The highly exaggerated emphasis on coprolalia, despite, for the attentive viewer, was a surprising amount of accurate information conveyed. The written input of parents, a neurologist, peers and the therapeutic session with the "TS Children's Support Group" all served as a smart device for providing these facts to the public. "Unfortunately, this episode of the South Park generates an increasing national awareness of TS. However, we are very concerned that school children are mocking TS and even being intrigued by insensitive peers who saw the program," Judit Ungar, TSA President, said. said. "We realize that for more than a decade, the authors' satirical parodies have not spared any group, namely celebrities, disabled people or political figures. The fact that TS was the subject of a popular TV show indicates that the public So much more is aware of the disorder, it is clear that this increasing awareness that we have worked too hard to reach can sometimes be to be a two-edged sword. "<br /> <br /> TSA has executive officers contacted by the program, and we will be in contact with them again. Perhaps we will succeed in turning it into an opportunity for positive TS awareness.
