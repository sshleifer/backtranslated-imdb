In the sheer streets somewhere in New York City, a lonely punk called Tromeo (Will Keenan) has little friends, but all they ever do is get tattoos, piercing and just party all the time. He falls for a beautiful rich girl named Juliet (Jane Jenson) who is also upset because her father is quite an abusive son of a man you know. But as our title characters meet and fall one another, things start to get a lot of magic for them. Unfortunately, their fathers are together, because Juliet's father wants to take over Tromeo's father's movie studio, but can really conquer love for everyone and stop this feud? <br /> <br /> Hilarious and gross horror comedy drama satire of the wacky and disgusting people at Troma is a wonderful modern day, taking William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It was released in the theaters in 1997 and received good reviews, as it is a dark satire of the legendary story that all started. It has good laughter, piercing, graphic violence and gore like a headlamp broken on a fire hydrant. . For me this is the third best Troma movie next to the immortal "Toxic Avenger" and "Troma's War" which is second. Yes, the play can be a bit bad like some Troma movie, but the stuff above makes it right and it's a must see movie if you like horror comedies, Peter Jackson and Troma, or if you To see a comic version of a beloved story, BTW also looks at some amusing performances by The Toxic Avenger and SGT. Kabukiman NYPD. <br /> <br /> Also recommend: "The Toxic Avenger", "Meet The Feebles", "Ichi The Killer", "Re-Animator", "Terror Firmer", "Class of Nuke'Em High", " Romeo and Juliet (1968 and 1996) "," Pieces "," Troma's War "," Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger 4 "," Basket Case "," Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky "," New Nightmare " , "Freddy Vs.
