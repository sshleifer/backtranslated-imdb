Having seen 'La Pianists' a few years ago, I told myself I would never see it again, so powerful and disturbing. The time went on, but I couldn't find the movie and its main character, Erika Kahut, out of my mind. The story of a respected Piano teacher in the Vienna Conservatory, cools and collects on the surface, an expert in classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, self-rejection and self-destruction that are strong enough to destroyed. more than one look. I read the book "The Piano Teacher" by Elfriede Jelinek, the controversial Nobel laureate in the literature on which the film is based and after reading it, I saw the movie again. The second time all the puzzles came in the right place. Not so often an outstanding harrowing book on the screen with such brilliancy as "Le Pianists" is conveyed. Three actors performed excellently. Franz Schubert's Piano Music, "soaked in morbid humanity", is another bright star of the movie. <br /> <br /> I have only one problem with Haneke's vision. There is a scene in the film where Haneke made some changes to Erika's character that compared to the novel. In the book she revealed to Walter, the young student in the servitude she was attracted to, in a letter. As soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed her how much he was through, she stopped communicating with him. Erika of the book will never rush Walter to throw her at him. She kept everything inside - she didn't want to act, she wasn't a hunter - she loved to look. The big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. It was trying to make Erika sympathetic (and of course, Huppert was heartbreaking), but it took the riddle around her. Jelinek didn't write the scene, it sounded and looked fake in otherwise excellent film.
