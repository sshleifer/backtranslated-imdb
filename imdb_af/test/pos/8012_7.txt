Me and one of the best friends of the university - alberto lopez, dave hall, celina alcock (we graduated uea, norwich, uk in 1997) are still gathering and watching b-movie once a month. <br /> <br /> We are perfect experts in the art of bad movies, and this movie is quickly placed in the top 10 of terrible / brilliant movies. <br /> <br /> So if you only have beer and weed, and need a movie to laugh like, DROID GUNNER aka PHOENIX 2 is the movie for you! Marc Singer is fully aware that he is here in a turkey of a movie and that for everything he can! Matthius Hues is sublime in his woodworking and muscular moronity (is it a word?) While grunts "But I want my 20 thousand!" Pure Shlock Gold! If you like this, you also see: TRANCERS, THE RUNESTONE, DOLLMAN and anything from Charles Band or Fred Olen Ray ..... (but be warned: some of their movies are completely and completely without merit and you will scream for the lost hours of your life !!!?!).
