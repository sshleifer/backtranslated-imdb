It's a must have for everyone, but especially African Americans. It's time for a movie to express and worry about African American relations. It also allows other cultures in a fictional, humorous way how positive African American relations are and the outcomes of them rather than the unwanted stereotype that bother the African American community. I love this movie, a must see!
