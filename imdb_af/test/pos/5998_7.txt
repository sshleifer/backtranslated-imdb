I didn't like them at first, and the director constantly switched from the past (gulliver's travels) to the present (gulliver in the insane asylum). But it's really the best way to film the story, even though it got used to it. Danson is excellent as the title character and Edward Fox makes a wonderful villain. The worst part is mary steenburgen as gulliver's wife. She was never Hollywood-beautiful and in this film they somehow dull her dull. I will never understand why directors make a woman ugly if it doesn't add anything to the story! Plus, you want to strangle her because it's so stupid to believe the lies, bad old assets still keep her talking. Even her son can see through the bastard. Another great show and I rate it B +.
