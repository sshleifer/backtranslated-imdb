What makes this documentary especially of a film perspective is its passivity; who is involved with the audience in the joy of gypsy music. It innovates in the form of a documentary while showing a tapestry sound and movement that invites us to celebrate the primary similarities found in the traveling music of (historically) traveling people. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the movie itself is a single "take" of the movement that moves the world and transitions effortlessly from one rhythmic culture to the next. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, the breath is taken away by the simple beauty of our general connection with music, rhythm and dance. If there is a more deeply spiritual, flowing tribute to the sound and movement of cigarette cultures, it should still be filmed.
