A team ranged between Scully and Mulder, two other scientists, a pilot, and the man playing Bana at Seinfeld goes to an Arctic research post where all members have died by killing or killing each other. They discover there is a worm - a virus - it is parasitic to the point of madness and death. The problem is, after a certain dog has run out, anyone can be infected, but who? It's not just my favorite episode of season 1, but also one of my favorite favorites. The Arctic environment encompasses the characters and, of course, like Carpenter's the Thing, it is great fun to watch these self-tempered characters suddenly turn into dramatic scenes. And the visual effects of the worm and its effects under the skin are cute, I don't mind them at all. The drama between the characters ends up working more than it usually would be because of the tension and because all the actors (including the Bana guy) understand what is going on in the story. And as usual, I loved the ambiguity of the end. Highly recommended.
