Many people don't think Dan Aykroyd is funny. This movie proves otherwise. Aykroyd is brilliant to deliver his one-liners in this comedy. The only major problem with this is that it wastes too much time jumping the end of Aykroyd's character and the doctor who is pursuing him to prove he's a fraud. The doctor is like Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) in "What About Bob?" The screens where the doctor desperately tries to go back to Los Angeles are stupid, incredible and unfunny. Others say this aspect is really funny, especially the first half.
