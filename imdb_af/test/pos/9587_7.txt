Tiny Tweet and Sly the sneak is locked up in cages for a train ride to who knows where. Swinging Tweety will start with an insatiable song as soon as the train leaves the station, so we can hope that Puddy will get Tad this time. Sly tries out some funny handcuffs, but the sports leader man is spoiled. He puts the bird in a safer place under the luggage. The cat's next attempt succeeded him in the coal engine of the steam engine. And the chase is on. Of course there is also a bulldog, and silly Sly just can't keep his big mouth. <br /> <br /> Next time, the persistent puzzle will try the old stack-of-the-suit Avery will be proud of. Unfortunately, the bulldog looks like Sylvester everywhere. He even shows a talent for moving the shape and producing huge clubs from his back pocket. Not even Sylvesters' ability to catch a speed train can save him when he is thrown off the Silver Streak style, several times in a row. At the grandmother's new place, (Gower Gulch, population 86), the cat's final attempt is cross-linked. But you know what happens to men in dresses, they always get more attention than they've negotiated. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
