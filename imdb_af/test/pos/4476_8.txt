An excellent story told by the filmmaker. The interactions between the man and the leopard have many questions for the viewers' thoughts on just what was human. The people have no reason to care for the animals just to survive. At the end of the movie you were gone and just wondering who the real "hero" of the movie was. A good story telling. The human actor did an excellent job, but the leopard stole every scene.
