Yes, I am ashamed to admit it, but this performance is positive DEVINE !!! It's so entertaining, and I have the absolute best time to watch it. Only since Cycle 1 is it great, and I have not seen a downfall Glory AT ALL.Tyra Banks as you know are the hosts, and as fantastic as she is there are the other judges and fellow hosts such as J. Alexander , Jay Manuel, Nigel Barker and Twiggy. The main point of the show is for every girl invited to become America's next top model to build their way to the top by completing and winning photo matches. It sounds good, though not, and let me tell you it's GREAT !!!! ! It's great to look at all the different kinds of pictures that the girls take, and each one is different, cool and daring. Anyone who hates this show has no idea, and I will tell you that this show will be for a long time, so handle it !!!
