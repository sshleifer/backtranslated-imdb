I have seen these movies now and still can't get sick. It's like a frickin 'drug. I know many people do not like it, but there is something about it that only involves me. Every single show is spectacular, but Aaliyah is the one who steals the show. She not only played the role of Akasha, she became it. Her body movement and beauty are exceptionally well captured. It's also nice to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an Egyptian queen (No, I'm not biased against white people, I'm one). True, it is not known what color the ancient Egyptians really were, but it was a good change. Stuart Townsend made me forget that Tom Cruise's portrayal of Lestat and Marguerite was striking again. All in all, it was a good time at the movies. For those who haven't seen it, you should see it with an open mind and don't take it too seriously. I mean, it's a movie about a vampire being a rock star. Take it as this.
