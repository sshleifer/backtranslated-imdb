Thank God that there are movies that do not follow the same old Hollywood crap formula. I think the digital revolution and the DVD revolution make it possible for more interesting work to come out there, even if you have to dig harder to find it. I love it when a movie takes its time to draw you deeper and deeper into its inner emotional reach. It was really like a journey through the soul of America and that soul is disturbed and confused. What really was my mind was the way they used Martin Luther King's speeches on Vietnam and references to his murder in a way that hit me hard. I visited every time I heard his voice. I heard him speak before, but the way they used the speeches made me feel that I understood his message in a way I never thought. <br /> <br /> What can you say about a movie with heavy statistics on war, oppression, and a plea for compassion at the end of a hiding place? In fact, there are no credits in the film at all. You must open it by selecting them in the features. Somehow it made me think very much. All in all I can't say enough about this DVD. Brilliant.
