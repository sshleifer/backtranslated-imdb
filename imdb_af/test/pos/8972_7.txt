It is possible to have a good time with this movie while at the same time all that is not. In the 1980s, a ravenous US congressman (Tom Hanks) supported engineers for Afghan counterparts who resisted the Soviet Union. Hanks is in a quiet, hail-co-filled form as rogry, politically wrong Charlie Wilson, first saw a whirlpool with three deeply available women. If only the film had the same air of ignorance; but apart from Philip Seymour Hoffman's turn as a CIA cynical agent, it is also considered patriotic. Aaron Sorkin's trademark staccato dialogue serves his purpose, but the story is no longer acceptable as one of Wilson's long stories. And there is a strange unspoken subtext: Wilson's Afghan pals later mutated in the Taliban and other anti-Western groups and exacerbated the world than it was when these events occurred.
