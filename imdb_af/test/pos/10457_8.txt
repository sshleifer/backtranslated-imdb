Feel like an impressionist movie; if there is such a thing. <br /> <br /> The story is well told, very poetic. The characters are well developed and well maintained by the interpreters (or interpreted by the actors :)). <br /> <br /> The movie sometimes enjoys its own cute emotions and works well unless you hate such emotions in movies - It's not so in my case. <br /> <br /> This is a very humanistic film. <br /> <br /> The landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are much denser in their own right. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> A good classic for any good movie collection.
