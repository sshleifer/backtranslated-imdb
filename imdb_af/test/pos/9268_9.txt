I saw this documentary at the 2005 Slamdance Independent Film Festival. This documentary is shot, directed and edited by a son (Craig) of his mother's year-long battle with cancer. In the course of one year, "How to approach" a documentary in the truest form, and gives you an inner look of a family's struggle to fight the cancer. The viewer gets an inside point of the effects that cancer has. on a family as well as the individual throughout the process. I've never seen such an honest movie, it's a powerful and raw movie, and since it's not shot by an outsider, you get the real emotions of everyone involved. Many documentaries have been shot by an outsider, but if this story is told by the boy, it adds a different emotional level to the film, unlike any I've seen on this topic or anyone else before. It is a touch that everyone should see, and can relate to. I would highly recommend it.
