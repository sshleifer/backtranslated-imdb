While most movies that place people against ominous foreigners are ultimately cheap imitations of the Aliens range, Pitch Black stands out as a good piece of Sci-Fi and an excellent film around the world. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie is the lighting. This film works beautifully in different colors, shades and intensities of light that set the mood and give a unique feel to the film itself, other than the "normal" movie lighting we are generally subjected to. Vin Diesel brings his character to life in an excellent way, with the skill of avoiding the routine depiction of the hardened criminal. After all, the movie is about the personal journey of Riddick (Diesel's character), so fortunately Vin doesn't make the ball. The rest of the cast (with the exception of the talented and beautiful Claudia Black) was unknown to me, but changed everything into great performances, and enabled the diverse characters with unique features and ways. Pitch Black is a perfect example of a good movie with the resources of an excessive budget. The special effects are more than adequate, but at the same time they are by no means the only focus, as in very high budget blockbusters. It's a good movie because it uses Science Fiction as a medium to tell an engaging, challenging story, rather to tell a mediocre story to use the flash of Science Fiction.
