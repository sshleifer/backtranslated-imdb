In the DVD era, you'd think you can find pretty much any piece of crap dedicated to celluloid and for the most part, that's true. So WHY, WHY, it is so hard to find this wonderful movie, clearly done by people who love Noir as a loving tribute (which never falls into spoofland) of most movies of genres. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are a HOPE in this and superstar-in-the-making Carla Gugino (KAREN SISCO, SIN CITY) is her latest brand red hot babe / big acting routine. <br /> <br /> This movie really has everything for fans of film. A B noir on steroids, the clever and steamy JUDAS KISS succeeds on every score. <br /> <br /> please Columbia TriStar please leave it on DVD !!!!!!
