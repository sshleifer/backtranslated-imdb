I can't understand why IMDb users will rate this movie 5.2 / 10? It's really great, very funny. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, adults, teenagers and especially kids! <br /> <br /> The story is about a 14-year-old child who always tells lies, at home and at school. One day he had his homework to write a 1000-word story. But he did not, so the teacher told him to write it and give her in 3 hours, or he would have to go to the Summer School. Yes, he wrote it in 2:45. "Big fat liar", I think it was a story of himself. On his way to school he hit a limo from a well-known Hollywood producer, and he gave him a ride. But the child forgot the story in the limo. He told his parents and the teacher, but of course they didn't believe him. And the filmmaker took him the story of the child as his new movie, "Big Fat Liar". When the child saw the trailer of the movie, he told his parents he wrote it, but they didn't believe. So, he and his friend had to go to L.A to prove one thing. The truth is never overestimated. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this wonderful movie, you won't be disappointed. Don't trust the 5.2 / 10 rate, it should be 9/10! Believe me! <br /> <br /> P / S: So sorry, my English is not good enough to make a better comment!
