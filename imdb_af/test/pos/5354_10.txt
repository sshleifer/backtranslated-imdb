There are a few aspects of Park's movies, and especially Wallace & Gromit, which I would say, make them so good. The first is subtle and observational, the flagship of which is Gromit's character. He does not speak, he makes no noise, all he has is his eyes, forehead and posture, and with this he commands the film. Park manages everything we need from this quiet character through its expression. The comedy and the emotion are conveyed by the subtle movements and it works perfectly. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie you need to be aware of the whole screen. Usually you are guided to things in the movies, the screen will not be tampered with. There won't be many things to take your eyes away from the headline or action. Park looks to the other side with its movies. He throws extra content at his audience, there is action in the background, on the side of the screen, even outside the screen, and there is almost always something in the foreground to catch your eye. His movies are about various views and discoveries. They are layered with jokes and additional action. <br /> <br /> In this movie there are low things happening on the screen, jokes in the foreground, perhaps on a potty label and background shadows that throw away action. You can imagine that the movies were always an opportunity for Park, and the movies he loves are the ones he wants to watch over and over again. That's what shows in his movies, and his beloved characters. <br /> <br /> Then there are the bizarre and ill-conceived inventions that Wallace makes, something in the storyline and the turn of the plot, everything is bizarre and off the wall, but it looks so normal in this world . You can imagine Wallace's idea inside Park. <br /> <br /> There is also one thing that makes these movies so unique, which is the modeling and precise hand animation. I must admit I was worried when I knew Dreamworks was involved in making this movie, and I thought they would bring their computer animation experience to the forefront. What I was afraid of was Wallace & Gromit to become CGI entities, or at least, CGI was used to clear the feel of modeling the film. <br /> <br /> Not so. You can still see thumbprints and tool marks on the characters, and far from distracting the movie, it adds just as much real feeling to it and a sense of physical depth to the characters and the scene on the screen. <br /> <br /> So what about the movie? Well, I have to say that the plot was something I thought well before the movie was in the theater and it didn't come as a surprise, but it got me a little less. Actually, the twist opens and the comic timing of the discovery and reactions was all, and it sucked me in just as if it was an excitement, but all the time I laughed. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was fascinating in different ways. To see how the animation is complete, how wild the inventions are, how Wallace is in trouble and Gromit gets him out, where all the cross-references in the movie are and where all the jokes are! I must admit that I talked to my friends afterwards. I couldn't believe how much I missed. <br /> <br /> There is something different in this movie than with others, there's a new level of adult humor here and I shouldn't be rude jokes (though there are some who are just as British, You can't help laughing, I mean jokes that just fly over children's heads, but face adults. The kind you see comes from somewhere like Pixar. It just adds more appeal to the movie. <br /> <br /> Well, let me try to be a little negative here. I didn't see the voices in this movie, you know how to listen to the actors and see if you can recognize them? Well, I was just waving in the movie to care or to see who they were ... okay, it's not negative. Let me try again. The main plot was not as strong and gripping as I had expected, and I found myself in the side stories and characters themselves ... again ... this is not a bad thing, the movie was just as rich entertainment. <br /> <br /> I honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie, probably the worst I can say is that the title series at the end is pretty repetitive ... to the final title ! Really, this is the worst I can say. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, well-set, well-written, well-executed. There are lots of fantastic characters here, not just Wallace and Gromit. There is so much happening on the screen, so many references and jokes (look at the dresses of Lady Tottingham), cheese jokes everywhere, jokes for the whole family. The characters are very absorbent and you will find that you have taken them before you realize. There is so much in this movie for everyone. There is so much I can say and write, but I know it will soon be a setback for Park and Earthman. It will also only turn into a series of this piece was really funny and there is a bit when ... and what I'd rather do, tell you it's a great movie to watch it and all around experience something for yourself. I will say that the bunnies are excellent!
