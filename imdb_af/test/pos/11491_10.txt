It's a wonderful and wonderful movie. The underlying theme of this movie is the innocent child (Heather Graham as Joline) struggling to make her naive wishes for how the world makes sense while being continually beaten by the real world. However, this is not an unfortunate movie - exactly the opposite. It's a funny movie with a sad side, but just thinking about the movie, make me so happy. Near the start of the film, the beautiful, vulnerable Joline confronts a drug addict trying to break into her friend's car. She reasoned with him, convincing him to seek help, and giving him $ 30 as a start. At the end of the film he appeared to pay her back, explaining that he was a drug, doing well, and thanking her. I can hear the cynics groaning. From * Course * It will never really happen. This movie does not take place in the real world. It takes place in the world we wanted us to live. The sad part is realizing that we don't live there. The lucky part is knowing there are people we wanted to do.
