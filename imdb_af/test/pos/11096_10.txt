THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN is an excellent example of an anti-80's movie. While many other films of the decade generally did not have dust, this film is pure dust. There is nothing stylish or fake or superfluous about it. It boasts two excellent performances: Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as lifelong friends Christopher Boyce and Daulton Lee respectively. Hutton, Penn and Tom Cruise were a triumvirate of early 80s actors who all watched much bigger and better things (all 3 in TAPS). While Penn and Cruise's popularity has increased, Hutton is largely forgotten, and it is a pity. Actually, Hutton is the first of the 3 to win an Oscar for supporting role in ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980, but I think his performance in this movie is even more outstanding. <br /> <br /> Hutton really catches the post-Vietnam war rebellion in his character Chris Boyce. A failed student school student, Chris, has a love affair with his father, played well by the great character actor Pat Hingle. The scene where Chris quotes the poem his father thought he has long forgotten is a particularly powerful one. <br /> <br /> Chris gets to work at the Department of Defense and uses his hatred of US government and his foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the Soviet countries. He gets his friend, Daulton, a hyper-drug-dealing self-server, to be the microphone courier of the project plans. While Chris does this on the basis of his beliefs, Daulton does it strictly for the money. The Soviet liaison is excellently played by David Suchet. Penn and Suchet have a real peculiar chemistry and this is a kind of funny set of exchanges between them. But, make no mistake, this movie is nothing but that. This is a serious character study on pessimism, malaise, paranoia and mistrust. <br /> <br /> Once again the lead makes this movie. Hutton delivers a brilliant, understated performance as Chris, a fairly clever young man who has so much potential. Penn, as usual, does a tremendous characterization like Daulton, a pathetic loser acting before thinking and not thinking at all. The end of this fact-based film is very sad at several levels. A true powerful character study.
