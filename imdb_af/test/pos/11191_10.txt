The first time I ever saw it was at a friend's house. It ended up in his parents' hands with a flake; a few video stores / bike repair shop !! went bankrupt and treated like it was at stake. We saw it twice in a row and almost wet pants were how hard we laughed. <br /> <br /> I saw historical documents like Ninja Mission and Plan 9 from outer space, and they still remain good runners compared to this one. <br /> <br /> Almost 15 years after the first contact, it is now considered the best culture film of all time (in my circles); I showed it to all my friends ... We now have a tradition of searching for the same movies: the priceless one. <br /> <br /> It can't be explained or reviewed in any normal way, because every scene, every time, every move, contains at least one error related to editing, dialing, directing, etc. <br /> <br /> For any cultured movie buff, it's the ultimate prize, the gem of all the jewels. <br /> <br /> Raiting: As for craft, it can't be graded, as it will even be an insult to homemade videos of birthdays and weddings. <br /> <br /> As for pure entertainment, this is the funniest movie I've ever seen; funny than any comedy ever made or past. Anything less than a 10/10 should be seen as an insult to the good sense of ours.
