'Boogie Nights' uses his main character, Dirk Diggler, as a metaphor for accumulated celebrities of a decade in America's shameful past, which consisted of an unexpected rise in pornography, which consequently abounds in corrupt youth cause. His main character lends features of a variety of genuine actors, who engage themselves in many illegal issues affected by Hollywood celebrities, often exploited by the press. It looks like the kind of long story that appears on an E! Real Hollywood Story Special. Drugs, sex and violence - the American dream. But what's going to come down, and the bigger it is, the harder it gets. <br /> <br /> Dirk Diggler's dreams are great, just like any other valuable asset on his body. Dirk's real name is Eddie Adams, a California who dreams of becoming a star. He believes that God gives one great talent to every individual on the planet, and his gift is a little unusual. After falling off with his mother, Eddie leaves home and meets the crazy Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), a mature movie director who offers him work. Eddie eventually becomes a big pornstar, representing the leading "actor" in most of Horner's films. With new success, Eddie is told that he must find a new alias for himself, and so Dirk Diggler is born. <br /> <br /> Eddie / Dirk himself is mainly based on the notorious porn star John Holmes, whose life story was adapted to Wonderland in 2003, where Val Kilmer was on the scene. 'Boogie Nights' is undoubtedly the better of the two, proving that pornography films can be made without being his target audience: regular movies. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 1977, an era of artistic pornography - filmmakers truly believed they could compensate for the lows of X rated features by adding deep story and enchanting atmosphere. In a way, the film's director - Paul Thomas Anderson - implements a very artistic approach to the project, which resulted in a free and artistic film over a period in American history when it was indeed gratuitous and artistic. Anderson's style is so deep and so clear that we feel like we are reliving the first-hand era. Not a moment goes by where we are not convinced of the time series covered in the film. <br /> <br /> Not everyone was happy about the set of Boogie Nights. Before filming Anderson repeatedly approached Reynolds and asked him many times to play Horner's role. Eventually, Reynolds agreed, claiming that the film was terrible and the worst part of his career, which he denied openly, before he was nominated for a Best Supporting Academy Award and suddenly closed. A year earlier, Anderson suffered title disputes over Sydney / Hard Agt. He chose the latter title for his film, and New Line Cinema thought the former was more marketable. He lost the battle essentially and Anderson completely avoided the title disputes by placing the words "boogie nights" in his movie by the mouth of a character. <br /> <br /> The decisive movie is one of its best aspects. The Paul Thomas Anderson tribes are here as well as a whole over of first-timers. To name some of the more famous stars are John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman, William H. Macy, Heather Graham and Julianne Moore. But the entire film is bound to mark Mark Wahlberg, like Eddie, who is surprisingly convincing in his role. Wahlberg, formerly known for his singing career and disappointing Hollywood intentions, has all the necessary features to portray such a character. This is his best role so far. <br /> <br /> Anderson knows how to enchant his audience and take complete control of every scene. When Jack Horner meets Eddie for the first time, Anderson uses sneaky stars in the background, a sign of things to come, and hidden symbolism as fine as it can be. The opening scene is three minutes, a long track that Jack and Amber follow in a nightclub, where most characters are first introduced. It reminds me of the discussions about detecting shots in Robert Altman's "The Player" - it works so brilliantly in Boogie Nights, and is the first indication that Anderson knows what he's doing behind the camera. His style is fast in the bait of Martin Scorsese, where shots quickly slip, but it never seems to be rushed. Coincidentally, Anderson refers to two classic Scorsese shots - the closing De Niro mirror speech of 'Raging Bull' and the nightclub scene of 'GoodFellas'. Anderson is a young, growing director, who, despite his age, is remarkably mature in story and direction. While his first feature film, "Hard Eight," was noticeably sensible, Boogie Nights is even more. <br /> <br /> 'Boogie Nights' started out as an effort of love on Paul Thomas Anderson's account. In 1996 Anderson's film filmed the extraordinary Hard Eight. The film is pragmatic to such an extreme that it almost seems. Boogie Nights enriches us with its free content, which sometimes borders on pornography, but it is far more sophisticated than such trash. It is a burning, wonderful contemporary masterpiece that is just as mentally spoken as it is wild and stylish. Probably Anderson's best film and one of the biggest and most important projects of the past decade.
