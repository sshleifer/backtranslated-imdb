No pun is meant. I'm not going to spoil anything about the story, but it's safe to assume you already know what kind of character the main actor portrays. And, of course, being a priest while being "naughty" exaggerates it all. Plus, this is the most erotic movie of Park Chan Wook. <br /> <br /> If you saw Wook's previous works / movies, he knows he is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again. As it goes away from the revenge theme of its previous films on the surface, it still has some heat hidden from below. And when it boils, some bad things start to happen. But through all the darkness, there were also moments of light (fun) too. A very quiet and ever-challenging movie, living outside the mainstream and doing a very good job ...
