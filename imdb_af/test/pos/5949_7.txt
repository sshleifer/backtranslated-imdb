I saw the effort while I was in Paris in May 2006 ... I discussed it and mission impossible. I am delighted that I choose OSS 117, not only because it was funny but could also see a FRench movie while in France. I had a good time ... would recommend it. It is important to understand the French society of Today to really enjoy the humor of this movie ... can't wait for the DVD to come out ... I don't know how some of the 'jeu De mots Translate to English I Will Surely Buy It Out! P.S. I saw on 'BRice de Nice', a movie with Dujardin that all children speak in France. This movie is a comedy, but sooner than you can imagine ... in comparing both movies, I have to say that Dujardin did a good job in OSS 117.
