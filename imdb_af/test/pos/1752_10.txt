"Mr Bug Goes To Town" was the last big achievement the Fleischer studios have made. The quality of the Superman series produced simultaneously is evident in this exceptional movie. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics of Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael (with the help of Flieshcer veteran Sammy Timberg are pretty good, but not as much as the painting of the photo by Leigh Harline who is also Snow White for Disney has achieved, Harline's "atmospheric music" is wonderful and a surprise to the ears. <br /> <br /> The layout and layout of the picture was years ago, the Fleischer's background artists surprised themselves. beauty of the movie can not be denied, and while Hoppity is the locust star, the characters of Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito steal the picture - Kenny Gardner (brother-in-law) of Guy Lombardo ... and a famous singer in his band ... does his usual pleasant job in the role of Dick Dickinsen. </p> <p> br /> <br /> The movie has been criticized for all the wrong races. The Fleischer Studios were animation experts of excellence and it shows very clearly in the final product, the film is Tunisia s, the story is great for all ages and the final scenes of the bugs that drive their lives on a rising skyscraper are some of the best plays and animations of any animated film past and present. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this wonderful hand-drawn movie. Also, do not commend the title series with the most extensive example of Max Fleischer's remarkable 3-D sterioptic process that has been built and employed in the "electrified" buildings of Manhattan in 16,000 small glass sheets for four months. <br /> Don't Bug Goes To Town Don't Miss ........................ I'll risk you'll be wrong at the results!
