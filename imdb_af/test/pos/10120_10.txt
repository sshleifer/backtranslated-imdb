I just came home to see "Radio". I haven't seen such an inspiring story in a long time. My kids are between the ages of 8 and 5 and I would like to use them so that they can "feel" the message as I did - you should find the best in people and love them for who they are, not judge for their differences . Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris both award the Oscar awards for this movie. I don't know why we can't have movies like this anymore, rather than the junk that is served daily at theaters.
