One of my favorite movies of all time, has seen it three times. It is a good job to summarize the Isrelai walk, Israeli humor and seriousness, and many of the problems that Israelis face. Universal theme to be accepted and accepted for who you are. Good subtle humor, which is the character of the characters, making this movie magic, and much about Isrlaei culture, and the irnonicness, contradictions and humor, with a great actor in it, Oshri Cohen. I recommend it to everyone, and it is a movie that is perfect for virtually anyone, family, boyfriend / girl movie, and apart from the Israeli culture, which is especially to be accepted, however important the family is, its diversity and imperfections. <br /> <br /> Great, fantastic movie.
