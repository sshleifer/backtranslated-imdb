Although this movie does not have the darkness of the books, it is, in my opinion, a good movie. It is a wonderful camp fun with the beautiful Stuart Townsend as Lestat. He doesn't have the blonde hair and blue eyes so described in the book, but to be honest, he won't look good with blonde hair, and Lestat will definitely look good. He moves like the predator I always thought Lestat would have. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. It is not interviewing the vampire, so try not to compare the two. Maintenance is Louis's story. This is a cut and paste version of Lestat's. Anyway, I strongly recommend.
