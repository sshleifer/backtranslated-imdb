Like others who responded to the web ... I'm a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard. Having said this, and I was skeptical, I expected the overall cheese factors. There were a few cheeses, but everything, not much. And the movie was pretty accurate. <br /> <br /> I looked at the trailer again today. After seeing the movie yesterday, I realized that the trailer gives the impression, the movie is nothing but salvation after rescue action scenes. That is not the case. <br /> <br /> The movie is really more character / story-driven than action. The inner struggle, both Costner and Kutcher, has to do with. Kutcher's is also known as movie as Costner's. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a minor love story. No surprise there. But for the most part, the movie tells the story of two lives coming together, and after a while we help each other to heal old wounds. <br /> <br /> Like a girl like it sounds, Costner and, as much as I try not to love him, Kutcher works really well together and complements each other very well in the movie. <br /> <br /> As critics said, you've seen it before. Top Gun, Officer and a Gentlemen, etc. But what movie hasn't been recovered a million times. <br /> <br /> I can only repeat one F word and can't really remember any other language. <br /> <br /> The movie is 2+ hours, and for some it is possible to get a bit long after the end. <br /> <br /> You will laugh, you can cry, but I can honestly say it was the $ 4 I paid. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy the movie.
