What to say about "Pink Flamingos"? It's out of criticism or even explanation because it doesn't really strive for any other movie you've seen. You will also get it, or you won't laugh at it, or roll your eyes into horror (or both). John Waters is a strange filmmaker (who is gently sitting), mixing both innocent, childish humor with shockingly offensive moments meant to know ... who knows what his intentions were. It's like a form of assault, even if it's a funny one. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes Waters' humor so infectious and effective is that his characters have a world that is both strange and completely familiar to the viewer, such as the little rivalries that plot the "Pink Flamingos "form. Certainly, everyone has experienced this sort of thing at some point, but almost certainly the issue at stake is not the title of "The Filthiest Person Alive." What makes the imaginative display for me is the way Waters creates an awkward environment and doesn't drop the joke right away. The people in his films are completely in harmony with each other. For example, when Cotton tells Babs that she doesn't want to accompany her in town, because Crackers brings his "friend friend" to the trailer, Babs responds with a whimsical smirk and tells her, in a conspiracy, "This little barn is just perfect ... "At this point we do not yet know that Crackers is planning to take his" girlfriend "to the barn to stab live chickens on her naked body while Cotton looks orgasmic through a window, but this stranger is totally common and understood by the characters in the fictitious degenerate world that Waters creates. <br /> <br /> Another example is the conversation between the girls in the basement and Channing, the deviant butler of the Marble. The first time we see them, Waters is off a scene in Connie's cozy office after Channing comes down in the basement, where we see two women there, one dead and one very alive and well. Susan is not a cowboy but is furious and insulting to Channing and jumps to launch a full-blown oral attack on her prison sentence. They both have a strange understanding of the bizarre situation, and she is not so intimidated by her abduction, as she is violently insulted and righteous. She didn't stand out for a second, while Channing was in her eyes and the two screens containing their delirious banter were two of the comic highlights of the film. Later in the film, when Divine and Crackers break into the Marbles home and discover their crimes to keep abducted women in their basement, it represents the total lack of support that Divine and her family have for the mark of depravity that the Marbles pandering - There is something divine not knowing, a corruption that is being invented by her newfound competitors, and she despises it. In addition, while kidnapping does not look like something divinely wanted to think twice, she is indignant that the girls are being held there and releasing them happily, portraying the revenge they take on Channing. <br /> <br /> At the other end of the dirt spectrum, Waters sometimes reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the "real" world. The first time we see Connie, she is a minor character called Sandy Sandstone, who has never heard of Divine. Cookie, however, reacts with a hilarious fact-of-fact evaluation of Divine's title as the "dirtiest person alive", revealing that she also owns this world of unspoken and sophisticated lunacy. <br /> <br /> Something should also be said about how the players are in touch with their respective roles, especially Divine, who doesn't miss a note. Not once does he fall into the ridiculous clothes and character he has given, and it takes "Pink Flamingos" to a new level or strangeness. People actually believed Divine was like this in real life, and it's easy to understand why, because while watching the movie, you don't really think about the movie, you think of these people who made it . As they do the outrageous things in the writing, you start to think that it may not be a story, but a bizarre documentary. <br /> <br /> But even more, "Pink Flamingos" is not that much. a movie as it is an event, or something that happens to you. Although his shock value has mostly gone for me now (I say mostly because the a ** golf scene and the chicken scene still make me win), I still find this film hilary and habit-forming.
