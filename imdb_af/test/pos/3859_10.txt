As the mother of a 3-year-old and a 2-year-old adolescent I am AristoCats. It is a movie that does not contain double invaders, no almost swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no pants or flatulence, so common in even the best children's movies. . The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is wonderful. The love story is very romantic. The kittens are rich in treasures, and the different characters are unique and attentive. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. The characters are well thrown well. I like to listen to Eva Gabor's velvety voice, and there are so many others who are known from a young age and also fit the characters as well. It's really a movie about love, tolerance, good manners and faithfulness. Who does not want their children to be exposed to these values? It's a movie I don't care to watch over, unlike Happy Feet, where I couldn't even see the whole thing, because it was so annoying. I wish production companies would move towards making movies more like this one.
