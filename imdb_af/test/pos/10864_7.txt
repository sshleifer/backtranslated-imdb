The labeling of this film is a "lesbian love story" about as accurate as calling Pride & Prejudice a "straightforward love story". There is just so much more than that. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character is a lesbian, but her story is classic bildungsroman, a journey from childhood to adulthood, from sexual innocence to adulthood, from personal blindness. to self-discovery. There is a stylistic element of the camp towards the movie, but it is not a hindrance; rather, it serves to emphasize the plays and dramatic parts of the main character's life. Those who know Anna Chancellor of the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice will definitely be surprised with her here. Rachael Stirling is star as the main character Nan, and Keeley Hawes are all wide eyes like her lover Kitty Butler. Chancellor may have the film, apart from Sally Hawkins who plays Zena Butler. This movie is not for the most beautiful of the heart, but it is not a piece of pro-gay advertising either. It's a real story, with real comedy and drama, an engaging story with compelling characters, and worth watching.
