I found the story just to be enough of a thrill, that the wonderful henry mancici music didn't sleep for me. Julie Andrews was excellent and I probably don't understand why this movie had problems at the box when it came out, because it just makes me happy to finally sing everyone. and i like happy centuries to the end i think you can say this movie has with some traditional blake edwards humor ...
