It's an entertaining surrealistic movie. It was written by Joseph Minion, who also wrote After Times, Martin Scorsese's excellent surrealistic film. The movie follows the adventures of a 10-year-old child named Gus, who manages a red Ford Mustang on some fictional states with names like Tristana (a tribute to Luis Bu√±uel's film, perhaps?), Essex & South Lyndon after eight elusive Motorama game cards from several Chimera Company petrol stations. The movie has a surrealistic feel, because many of the things are unusual, like the money, for example, like a blank paper with numbers. <br /> <br /> Most characters are nasty to Gus's trip. They tattoo him, push him, but it doesn't stop the child from pursuing his relentless quest. Some strange actors like David Lynch, Jack Nance, Meat Loaf & Flea also make appearance. Jack Nance plays a motel owner, who, once he meets him, says to him: "If you see any squirrels, give it to me." It's a movie where a man and his wife abandon their young children because the man owes Gus $ 100; and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice harder while talking rude. If you're a fan of Twin Peaks and surreal movies, you'll love it. A strange jewel of a movie.
