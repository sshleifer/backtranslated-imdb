How did they find the movie of the car clashing with the back of the semi? And then Roy sat up - wonderful! The DVD seems to be scheduled for May 2006 - over time !! Watch it on a big screen or movie revival in a theater if possible, to fully appreciate the full aspect ratio. My other favorites in this category are: Original Italian Job with Michael Caine; Bullit with Steve McQueen; To live and die in LA with the CSI guy when he was young; French connection to Gene Hackman; Ronin with Robert Deniro; Vanishing Point with Barry Newman; Enemy of the state with Hackman again - What are your favorites?
