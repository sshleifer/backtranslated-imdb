I remember remembering this movie many years ago at VHS in a friend's place. Initially, I thought it would be a boring movie. But to my surprise it was one of the best movies I can remember for his time. <br /> <br /> It has a good story line and best of all, it has some great Aussie cars and street racing. I really loved Fox's car, most of which was a worked Dodge Charger. The paintwork done on this car was, in my opinion, really excellent :)! <br /> <br /> There is also a black two blown 57 Chev which comes later in the movie. <br /> <br /> I actually managed to get a copy of this movie on VHS last year at K-Mart here in Australia. I had plans to convert this movie to DVD, as I believe it is a movie worth converting. But much to my surprise this weekend while I was on the DVD movie, I got it on DVD. So of course I grabbed while I could because it was the only copy there. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you really want to see some classic street racing with real muscle cars, including a wonderful story line without a rice burner in sight. Then this movie is for you !! <br /> <br /> Here are some additional information taken from the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> He'll win at any cost. Fox is a young man who lives in the fast lane. He believes he is the fastest man on the road - but street racing is illegal. If he does not accept his latest challenge, he can lose his girlfriend ... if he accepts it, he can lose his life. Living dangerously, living fast and winning is their obsession. They do not turn back, they do not give in and ask for help.
