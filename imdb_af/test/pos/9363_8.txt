RKO Radio Pictures became a true classic in 1947 and even managed to nominate it for the Best Picture Oscar award. The acting, writing, continuity, etc., are all about perfect; and the story is worth the viewer's 82 minutes. Although the leaves are soft leaves the true life story by making the murder victim a Jew rather than a homosexual, most viewers will be the victim of a Jewish homosexual. Such disguise never works, maybe it's not meant. <br /> <br /> I can pick numbers over a few details, but just for fun. There was not a whole night film house in Washington, DC in 1947 --- and if there was I wish Robert Mitchum and his partner would not talk about the show. There were no bars where a GI could pick up a pretty blonde. NO! If Robert Ryan wanted to read the latest murder, he had to buy the Daily News; not the Times-Hearald, Evening Star and certainly not the know-nothing Washington Post. But these little things take nothing away from these classics. <br /> <br /> The movie is very beneficial for the absolute lack of musical score, except during the credits. I just saw it in a few movies. <br /> <br /> On the downside, since 1995, it comes with a TMC introduction where some liberal blabs talk about what the public was ready in 1947. . blah blah blah! As if this fool is trying to judge his fraudsters. I would say that the former GIs in 1947 - the Greatest Generation - were much smarter - and had better values ​​- as a commentator, film historian or other wise mouth in 1995. Put on a sock!
