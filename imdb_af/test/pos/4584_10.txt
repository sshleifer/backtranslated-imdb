I have never heard of this movie when a good friend recommended it. I trust this friend's taste, so I bought the DVD. My wife and I sat down to see it without knowing what it was all about. I thought it was the funniest movie I've seen long ago, mainly because I saw the truth in satire. I strongly recommend this movie to all my friends. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie for everyone. Some people will see the crass humor and aura of stupidity, and find idiocracy one of the dumbest movies they've seen. What these people don't seem to understand is that the crazy humor is there, not to entertain the audience, but to show what the morons are addressing in the future. <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson was well-thrown as an "average Joe." He is mainly there to be a penchant for biting commentary on society that is being distributed throughout this film. Many of the more beautiful pieces are in the background, so it's easy to see several times. What makes the movie even harder, and more frightening, is that I see elements of it in everyday life, in people I meet or on the media. Then I go back and look at the Idiocracy again and realize how good it is. <br /> <br /> The few people who have seen and enjoyed this movie can be part of an elite club. I will see an ad for a product with a breakthrough new ingredient, and turn to my wife and say, "It has electrolytes!" She knows exactly what I'm saying.
