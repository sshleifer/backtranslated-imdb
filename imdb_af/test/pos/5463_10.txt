As a former TV editor, I can say it is as horrible as it gets. It even led to Letterman's producer (thought it was a source) who finally resigned in real life. Letterman was furious (OK, one goofy thing is that he throws softballs on a tire on his estate; total manufacturing), but the main information is hilariously true, of the fool offering war for Letterman after deciding on NBC leaving Leno's problems with an agent who wasn't ready for a long time, but who led the show (almost to a disastrous exit) from his famous loyalty. If any of your kids don't understand the idea why Letterman is jealous of today, see this band.
