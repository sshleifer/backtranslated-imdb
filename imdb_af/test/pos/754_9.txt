If someone ever meets a compendium on American American horror, which is worth the salt, there will be an entry for SF Brownrigg's unsaturated practice in Asylum Horror. Every time I watch this movie, I am impressed by the complete economy of the movie, of the compact, completely independent plot with a mysterious start and an all-terrific ending, the engaging performances by what essentially " a group of non-professionals were actors and a preliminary sense of fear and claustrophobia that effectively used the narrians with a certain inevitability, which is increasingly frightening because the viewers know what happens long before the hero, with the only question when going to wake up and smell? <br /> <br /> Shooting at a dental floss budget in Brownrigg's native Texas at an old beautiful townhouse that serves well as the setting for a private sanatorium, DO NOT CONSIDER THE BASE Another intriguing twist on the good old Edgar Allan Poetoms about prisoners taking over the asylum just before an otherwise "normal" outsider unknowingly joins the ranks without realizing until it's too late not everything looks like it, they are completely cut off and out of any outside, and find their own common sense inevitably questioned, as the madness is out of control. The original STAR TREK TV series had a twist on this with their WHOM GODS DESTROY episode of 1968, Juan Moctezuma gave The proceedings a Peyote fueled Mexican psychedelic journey in DR. TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON in 1972, and tangentially related to Fernando Di Leo's ASYLUM EROTICA / SLAUGHTER HOTEL, which injects the elements of an unknown killer and an end that can only be defined as "Splatter Cinema". Brownrigg may not have seen or thought of SLAUGHTER HOTEL, but he did come up with similar ideas. <br /> <br /> Legaliciuos former Playboy Playmate Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale, RN in Clinical Psychology, who has just left her good work as a supervisor at a major. hospital to travel out in the middle of a god who is leaving, straight from a Peckinpah movie with a dr. Stevens working at his private sanatorium. Dr Stevens played a new form of therapy based on the emotional and psychological scarcity to encourage, bring to the surface their inner obsessions and hopefully rid the patients of what their sense of reasoning was. Nice idea, but to argue and tell a 6ft 250 pound totally mad man that he must extinguish his aggression. And then it is not the smartest idea, and Dr Stevens is sent before Mrs. Holotik even appears on the screen with a good slap to the lower part of his skull. <br /> <br /> This event effectively leaves the sanatorium in the hands of one Geraldine Masters [actress Annabelle Weenick, who also serves as the script supervisor and production manager], a woman of disturbing professional attitude using the situation Sam, the movie's wonderfully unlikely hero, played a lobotomized African American bohemian, played by an actor named Bill McGhee. He was unfortunately robbed of a supporting Oscar nomination for his turn as a mass muscle with the brain of an 8-year-old boy. Sam's one wish is that someone will help him put his beloved toy boat in the water and his constant demand from the various female members to do so [and his uninterrupted consumption of chocolate popsicles] as * SOME * kind of underlying theme, although we will avoid such here because the children can still get up. There is also a quick subplot about a staff member who has decided to leave after being threatened by one of the patients, but I will leave the details of it after your discovery. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Holotik comes just as Dr Stevens is effectively laid to rest and is quickly overcome by my funny professionalism. Masters, who reluctantly allow the young young nurse to stay despite the tragedy that has just happened, oh TWENTY MINUTES AGO, which you should admit was rather of her sport. Holotik's Nurse Beale starts showing signs that she is not the sharpest meat nail in the drawer, but when she is informed that she is living with a lot of maniacs and that there are no locks on the doors and does not trample on the nearest Ace no. Hardware store to get a hasp and padlock to protect herself, and we are treated to some really creepy scenes where some of the prisoners sneak into her room and do things that smell her hair, try to kill her with butcher knives and caressing her neck with axes. But this is all part of the work in such a radical psychiatric healthcare environment, m. Master's her knowledge and she is about her strangely defined "rounds" consisting of wearing as a leg to define a nursing outfit as you can find in a 42nd Street fetish boutique and to get to know the prisoners. <br /> <br /> Allysson is an obsessive compulsive nymphomania with murderous tendencies like taking off her shirt and providing the movie with a few T&A between passes of histrionics; Harriet is a young former mother who killed her child in an accident and now knocks on an old doll that also protects her murderously. The Seargant is a real seargeant [and implied Vietnam veterinarian] whose negligence led to the death of his platoon and now looks from the window with binoculars to tackle an invisible enemy; Jennifer is a Phish fan who could not sign a New Year's Eve ticket and became insane and likes to download nembutols and other barbitates when no one is watching, and also has a murder crime related to it. with her inability to find a bra. Judge Cameron is apparently a murderer who has become busy with his own power and now likes to cut things with axes. Me. Callingham is an elderly poet who serves as a kind of soothsaying old hag from MACBETH before the cat gets her tongue; and Danny is an insane idiot included in the movie as the random element that cannot control the plot and whose antics act as the true catalyst for the series of tragedies and murders that ultimately end up in this dark, old, creepy house. the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> The house itself is a wonderful set, with an early early 1970s d√©cor that is remarkable in its immaculate, with a fantastic use of color achieved by subtle environmental lighting. The house is a series of corridors and rooms with shiny brown wooden floors, winding stairs, seperate cupboards and corridors leading to the various larger areas, and of course the cellar mentioned in the title is only visited once, but son sure to be a doozy! I love the spilled old freezer where Sam likes to push popsicles, the completely ordinary exteriors that remind me of a summer house that our family visited every year and forced us to swell in the heat: Everybody is covered with beads of persuasion and looks exhausted, and even the ever cheerful Sam at one stage suspects that bad things are happening, although he cannot understand what it all means and Rosie H. is too firm in her belief in her profession to even suspect what really happened, and while Mrs. Holotik's limitations on an actress has reduced the effectiveness of her Big Revelation scene, she is a big screamer when the whole hell breaks loose and Brownrigg has devised some pretty camera photos of her in various suggestive positions or stages of clothing point out what a beautiful lady she is without exposing anything more than her contract. Too bad! <br /> <br /> The real show stealer is Sam, and fans of what I have been taught to refer to as Splatter Cinema will not be disappointed by the shocking finals, and there is something about how Sam Run to the protection of his friend and brutally kill everyone within seconds within the arms, either suggesting he is a common motha before his lobotomy, or the movie is CUT. Anyway, you won't be prepared for the end of the first time you see it, though as a viewer you know the score is long before anyone else in the movie has gathered it all. <br /> <br /> Except for one person: Rhea MacAdams's unceasing stereotype old boyfriend, Mrs. Callingham [apparently inspired by the Donald Sutherland Old Woman character from Michael Reeves' 1964 Christopher Lee movie CASTLE OF LIVING DEATH, in addition to a rather nasty death through a round tip to the eye], not only the Predict future, but have most of the movie's hardest, entertaining little dialogue while on a walk in the garden with me. Holotic walking that looks like this - <br /> <br /> "It's really nice outside. Come out, Mrs Callingham?" asked Holotik, after which the old woman replied. <br /> <br /> "That's YOU who need to get out." <br /> <br /> Hilarious, and one of those things you should see, see yourself "getting". DO NOT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE, available on at least half a dozen "bargain bin" code-free DVD releases by companies such as Brentwood Home Video, Diamond Entertainment, VCI and Platinum Disc Corp's HORROR CLASSICS series; I like as Alpha Video's sexually gorgeously decorated $ 6 release from 2003: <br /> <br /> Dig through that bargain! But make sure you get one with the 89/90 minute print contained in it; An older 83-minute version is completely confusing because of some of the trims, and you should really see the end credits that are meant to bring this sick, twisted and surprisingly entertaining yarn. <br /> <br /> Masterpiece? Maybe not compared to THE EXORCIST OF ROSEMARY'S BABY, but it's a very unique American horror movie and a true classic of the drive-in age that is earned to be rediscovered by anyone looking for something with more than just a little brain made. juice, and not a penny more than they absolutely need. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 from ****
