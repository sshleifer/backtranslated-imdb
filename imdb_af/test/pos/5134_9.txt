In "Hoot" Mullet Fingers is busy sabotage to stop the pancake house. The problem is that the builders just start again, and he has to take more drastic steps. When he is confronted with the dogs, he scares them with snakes, not before he is bitten by a dog and goes to hospital. <br /> <br /> At bedtime Roy asks his father working with the Department of Justice how he deals with crooks. His father says it involves boring steps to look through papers, because sooner or later they all slip. You can see it at Enron and WorldCom. Roy looks at documents related to the pancake house, and finds a suppressed document (he must break into the company's trailer), so when the police see it, he has the law on his side. Unlike when he evaded the police. <br /> <br /> As you mentioned earlier, Roy is not always obedient to law, and when the company kills man illegally, Mullet takes Finger's direct action. He can't wait for the law (Mullet Fingers is hiding). The film suggests working in the system.
