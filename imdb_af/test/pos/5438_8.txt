This film was very different from what I thought, but exceeded my expectations. This movie has the exact right mix of comedy, drama, political criticism and satire (not necessarily in that order). Without being condescending or erratic, it reveals the open and subtle problems of our capitalist, democratic, high-tech society. It immediately makes you laugh and stays behind. For those of you who would like to dare the dog and want human and male politicians, this film should definitely be the choice! <br /> <br /> "Politicians are very much like diapers: they need to be changed regularly and for the same reasons."
