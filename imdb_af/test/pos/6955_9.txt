Jay Craven's criminal-ignored film is a sober breath of fresh air in the general narcissistic and derived world of independent film. First, photography is purely aesthetic pleasure, in the late autumn of all the gloomy beauty of North New England (film Paul Ryan has the 2nd Unit at Malick's Days of Heaven). Secondly, the performances are uniformly excellent. Rip Torn's Noel Lourdes is very charming and Tantoo Cardinal's Bangor is immediately sensitive and exuberant to say nothing of a supportive role. Overall, however, it is a tribute to the story's strength of the film that the story holds a strong and vibrant pace as it unfolds in its own time, and the film comes to a conclusion, of course and sincerely, yet not expected expected. It is one of the scarce valuables in the independent film world, a film that examines a small piece of crossings between people and history.
