Some movies are designed to entertain you, others to make you laugh, or cry or lift, others like this, trying to evoke you, make you think, and make you angry. I was angry at this movie, not on the movie, but the fact that it was true, tortured America, the free, in the illogical view that it does it for the bigger good. The tortures in this movie were troublesome, people's indifference was shattering, the film was compelling in his argument and just showed how wrong it was to torture people. Of course, it now makes me a "booming liberal" label that has been shifted by other people who concluded their minds that this didn't happen. People who do not realize that, as the movie said, are being tortured for every person, you get ten or one hundred people who rise up to revenge. You get an ever increasing cycle of violence. This movie didn't let me hate America, though I can see how it can do, but it made me hate as America responded in its 9/11 post. There is a significant quote in the movie, just after we learned that 19 people were killed and seventy-five in the bombing scene, the quote "one American is dead". It makes the difference. You can't kill an American, America can kill thousands, but you can't kill one American, or they'll do whatever it takes, including torture to do justice. This is clearly the American way. Call me a liberal, call me naive (though I think the people who think torture is good are naive), call me, cheat, call me anything you want, but this movie is a brilliant example of what in America and the west is wrong. I wish this movie will be shown to all school students at all times. This movie will stay with me for a long time, I would like to forget it, because I wish this kind of thing never happened, but I know it does, the other part of my wish I will never forget, because we must remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again. Whatever happens to me, this movie will have been with me for a long time, and I will tell everyone what I know to see it, not to be entertained, but to challenge, because sometimes we all have to be challenged.
