Of the opening styles of FIERCE PEOPLE (an interaction of tribal customs photographed by the anthropologist, father of the young narrator Finn Earl, to show why this South American tribe Ishkanani is so fierce), the direction of the film is sober: look we to dark comedy about comparing life in the New York streets to uncivilized peoples, or is it a message movie of a more serious intention? But as the story develops, this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact is becoming increasingly apparent. Griffin Dunne's direction of Dirk Wittenborn's adaptation of his novel can sometimes be indifferent, as it deviates from rational plot development, but ultimately there is a strong enough final impact to upload the holes he created. <br /> <br /> Our narrator Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) lives with his chef-addicted masseuse / sexually obsessed mother Liz (Diane Lane) in New York. He is waiting for the summer when he joins his anthropologist father on a field trip to South America. a father he only knows about letters and videos), when a drug brush suddenly changes their lives: one of Liz's wealthy clients Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland) saves the family from time to time and moves them to his ten-acre estate , the hallmark of wealth and power. In exchange for Osborne's private masseuse, Liz and Finn can live in the house with Osbornes daughter Mrs. Langley (Elizabeth Perkins) and grandchildren Bryce (Chris Evans) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Osborne and his doctor lead Liz on the drying path and Finn ties with Osborne and his grandchildren. And despite the difference in poor versus the rich, the living situation works for a while. Incidents occur to change feelings and Finn is attacked and raped by a masked attacker, a turning point for the film and Finn's view of the Osborne family. Osborne reveals his past to Finn and together they succeed in discovering the truth about Finn's disturbing incident - and also about the fiery disease of the rich class. <br /> <br /> The movie uses many clips of tribal activities during the film, drawing some disturbing parallels for some of the more challenging scenes. For this viewer, it works well, but when the director chooses to put full-fledged battlegrounds in the context of the Osborne estate, the concept is confronted, as if the audience is forced to get it. The different subplots between girl Jilly (Paz de la Huerta) and Finn and the introduction of an obese, delayed chalk artist Whitney (Branden Williams) push the credibility of the emphasis on the line between the rich and the 'lower class', but the performances by Sutherland, Lane and Yelchin are strong enough to forgive us the film's decline. Not a good movie, but one with many worthy ideas has flocked to the screen of a project that often feels lost in its direction. Grady Harp
