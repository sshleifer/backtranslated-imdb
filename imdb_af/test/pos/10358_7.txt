I saw this black and white comedy noir at the London Film Festival yesterday. Structurally, it was compared to Pulp Fiction, but it may be closer to the structure of Amores Perros and the sleepy mood of Kevin Smith's Clerks. Four stories cut at a French highway dinner. The first vignette left behind Franck (Edouard Baer) at night. The waitress, Suzie (Anna Mouglalis) is sorry and tells her her story. The second has two incompetent kidnappers, Leon (Bouli Lanners) and Paul (Serge Lariviere). They take a teenage girl from her rich family. Unfortunately for them, she's suicide and her family doesn't seem to have her back. The third is a dialogue between two obsolete rock stars who are watching each other (Alain Bashung and Arno play themselves). The last part is about four ex-criminals who smuggle their old partner out of the hospital to visit their old hiding place that has since become in the home? the dinner. An 'epilogue' returns to Franck and Suzie to complete their story (not actually an epilogue, more a conclusion). <br /> <br /> The structure doesn't really work. The stories are not sufficiently intertwined as in pulp fiction. The dinner is also not essential for the action for at least two of the stories in the way the car accident was necessary in the four stories of Amores Perros. The quality of the individual stories varies. The hideout story is a cute idea, with some good gags, but doesn't come off; and the rock star reunion is useless and boring. On the other hand, the abduction story is hilarious, although its association with dinner is tough. The most balanced and successful story is the Franck and Suzie one. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't quite successful, but has moments of interest and hilarity. I look forward to seeing more of the work of author / director Samuel Benchetrit.
