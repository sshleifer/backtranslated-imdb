If you like Paddy Chayevsky's Network, you'll probably also like this black comedy, as it's another brilliant Chayevsky script, a great satire on metropolitan hospitals and a perfect vehicle for Geo. C. Scott. He plays a burnt head of medicine on the most chaotic day he or she has ever seen. His personal crisis comes on his head and his hospital falls around him, as locals demonstrate to the hospital and patients and doctors die at a disturbing pace, thanks to a biblically-inspired and murderous saboteur. The latter, which theatrically declares himself the "Fool for Christ", "Paraclete of Kaborka," "Revenge of the Lamb," and "Angel of the Ruthless Pit", bumpy doctors on the head, administer lethal injections and exchange patients' identities, which causes treatments and operations to be performed on the wrong persons. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you uncomfortable as deadly mistakes like this happen (hopefully not so much, not so often and not in one place) and at the same time make you laugh at the precious character portraits. One is Richard Dysart ("L.A. Law") as dr. Wellbeck, a kind of celebrity surgeon who spends much more time on his investments and publicly traded stock than his patients, who are fatally suffering from his great indifference and neglect. There is Princess Rigg as generous, hippie-ish Barbara Drummond, who seduces the beleaguered head of medicine (Scott) and tries to run him away. Then there is the fraudulent murderer, who remains Barbara's father and who "functions well enough" back to the Indian discussion where he lives with his daughter and even manages a clinic, but is just being pushed to psychology. The strongest portrait of far is Scott's dr. Bock, who bore his soul as a former boy genius, failed father and husband, brilliant doctor and responsible administrator, who constantly dreamed of suicide, but had to be under the demands of his work. Scott is exceptional in this demanding role. <br /> <br /> To the final scenes one doesn't know if Bock is leaving the hospital for Barbara's Indian discussion and a quieter, simpler life, or her murderous father will be caught. whether the protesting, riotous locals will take over and bring the hospital to its knees. Looking at the mad killer, one of Chayevsky's suspects tells us that our lousy society is doing him because we are told he is another person away from cities and people. <br /> <br /> As my own father was the chief administrator of a number of major hospitals over the years, I had an idea of ​​the demands of his work and the great responsibility he sees. This story makes that responsibility the tip of Scott's crisis. It's both a funny and scary movie, with the actors claiming the substantial demands of Chayevsky's writing. It's also a movie I get more from every time I see it.
