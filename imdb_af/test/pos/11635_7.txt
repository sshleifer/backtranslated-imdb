Mighty Like A Moose is one of many short film director Leo McCarey who starred Charley Chase. What a dandy it is! Charlie and his wife both underwent plastic surgery to improve their terrible appearances that were not known to each other. They then meet at a party and are beaten with each other. Now they can't allow each other to find out they're cheating. This is the outrageous premise of this angry farce. Vivien Oakland, one of the few comic strips leading to a booming career long after the silence, is perfect as Charley's long nostrils. Charley has a terrible case of late-night, which is quickly sent to the dentist. When a party is caught by the police, there is no other reason to practice raids, and Charley and his wife try to avoid each other at home because they fear the changes in appearance are known. Both were photographed at the party with their new features. The hilarity at home ends in Charley to teach the no-good-nick fraud with his wife a lesson. The no-good nick is, of course, the new Charley, who has long realized his wife, before Charley teaches a fidelity lesson. This is one of Charley Chase's better efforts. *** of 4 stars.
