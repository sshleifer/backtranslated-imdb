A remarkable film that has all kinds of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the Elton John music. I remember being in the movie when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I never knew anyone else who saw this movie when it was released. <br /> <br /> The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago never left me, and when I watched the movie, it has just returned everything. However, I confess that my children (in their 20s) did not experience a similar emotional rush. A generational thing? <br /> <br /> Why isn't it on DVD?
