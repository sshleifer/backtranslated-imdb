I listen to Istanbul for the purpose of closing my eyes. In the beginning there is a gentle breeze. And the leaves on the trees. Swing softly; From there, far away, the bells of aquifers turn incessantly; I listen to Istanbul for the purpose of closing my eyes. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul for the purpose of closing my eyes; Then suddenly the birds, birds birds, fly high up, with a hue and cry. While the nets are being pulled into the fishing grounds. And a woman's feet are plunging into the water. I long for Istanbul, with the purpose of closing my eyes. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul with the intention of closing my eyes. The Grand Bazaar's quiet and cool, a riot at the pivot of the Market, mosque yards are full of pigeons. While hammers bang and moisten at the docks, spring winds carry the smell of sweat; I listen to Istanbul for the purpose of closing my eyes. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul for the purpose of closing my eyes; Another assassination of past delights, a seabed with dune boats is falling asleep. Amidst the dune and drunk of the southern winds I listened to Istanbul again, in view of my eyes. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul for the purpose of closing my eyes. A beautiful girl walks along the pavement: Four letters, whistles and songs, rude remarks; Something's falling from her hand It's a rose, I think. I listen to Istanbul for the purpose of closing my eyes. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul with the intention of closing my eyes. A bird fluttering around your dress; On your forehead, is there sweat? Or not? I know. Is your lips wet? Or not? I know. A silver moon rises above the pine trees: I can feel it all in your heart's beat. I listen to Istanbul for the purpose of closing my eyes. <br /> <br /> For you <br /> <br /> For you, my fellow man, everything is for you, nights are for you, the days are for you; Daylight is for you, moonlight is for you; Leaves in the moonlight; Wonder and wisdom in the leaves, Myriad green in daylight, Yellow is for you and pink. The feel of the skin on the palm, its warmth, its softness, the ease of laying; For you are all the greetings, and the masts have gone into the harbor; Names of the days, Names of the months, Fresh paint on rowing boats is for your Mailman's feet, Potter's hands. Grease on forehead, Burned on battlefield; Digging is for you and tombstones, prisons and handcuffs and death sentences. For you everything is for you. / look and cry. I remember my first glimpse of the world Through a mussel shell I opened: The greenest water and the blue sky And the ripening of the fish of the flock. My blood is still flowing with salt. The oysters cut my skin. What a bad speed ours was In the high seas on the whitest foam! Foam does not carry evil, like lips whose adultery with men is not shameful. <br /> <br /> Vessels sail over our dreams Over the roofs, ships in a color school, and my arm, Year long seasons. <br /> <br /> - Orhan Veli <br /> <br /> I couldn't say anything better than Orhal Veli Kanik said about Istanbul. About this movie is all I have, praise. A very beautiful and balanced introduction to a city and its music that has been linked in one time from Asia, Europe and Africa.
