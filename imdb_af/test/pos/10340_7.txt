The plot of this movie is as silly as a bag of hair. Jimmy Smit plays a character who might have been upset by the ludicrousness of the story. He is angry and a woman clatter. It's a character so far from its NYPD and LA regrolle as you possibly can. <br /> <br /> If you thought he had the look and the acting characters to play the very bad son roll, this is your gift. <br /> <br /> But !!!!!!!! Mary Louis Parker wears black mini skirts and small black mini dresses throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> She has always had the biggest bones in the history of the movies. This makes the movie worthwhile for this leg admirer. <br /> <br /> For this reason I would only buy the DVD if it was available.
