The first time I saw this movie, I just thought "what the hell?" A 10-year-old kid who runs bizarre places, meets bizarre people, goes to a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yes! I really enjoyed this movie! <br /> <br /> Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a pity he stopped. He very well interpreted his character Gus on the movie. <br /> <br /> Gus loses an eye, has tattoos and goes to the strangest cities dealing with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Bread! Want more? <br /> <br /> OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why does this movie need one? Just open your mind and let Gus drive you here. <br /> <br /> "Motorama Gus, you won Motorama"
