Kevin Spacey once again picks a winner with K-PAX, an impressive movie that expresses the Prot character's naive profound revelations of human existence, yet undoubtedly wise, point of view. <br /> <br /> It's nice to try. to work out if he is or not, because the plot is enlarged and the Robert Porter character is wiped out. But some may find the end somewhat unsatisfactory, but in reality it could not have been otherwise. <br /> <br /> My few movie problems revolve around the pretty cartoon and simplified portrayal of mental patients. I was amazed that the movie plot shows a lot of intelligence and I don't feel it would have lost anything by being honest about how people with mental health problems are acting. <br /> <br /> It says I realize it was a movie and not a documentary and the movie itself was shot very well and the story is done in a pleasant way. <br /> <br /> Bridges are fantastic and Spacey offers a peaceful and relaxing show, more like a riot than a stranger. <br /> <br /> A good movie that will make you talk to your friends.
