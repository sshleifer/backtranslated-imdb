People are often uncomfortable with "The Merchant of Venice" because of the anti-Semitic topic. Fortunately, this movie avoids it, and rather prefers to show how anti-Semitism ruled the highest in Europe in the 16th century. The story is, of course, that Antonio (Jeremy Irons) needs money so he can help Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) to ask Portia's (Lynn Collins) hand in marriage. He gets the money from Jewish administrator Shylock (Al Pacino), who claims a pound of Antonio's meat if the latter doesn't repay the loan. When Antonio can't repay the loan, Shylock is determined to get what he's guilty of. <br /> <br /> We expect this cast to do a good job and they won't disappoint. This is another test for what a good actor Al Pacino is.
