I realized that many people comment on the nature of this show racist and homophobic, but I don't feel that is what this performance is about. <br /> <br /> The show is about parents who aren't ready for kids and aren't ready for teens now. This performance helps bring humor to a very difficult topic that is sometimes over: parenting. <br /> <br /> Yes, we all had shows that families had in them, for example: Family Matters, Step by Step, Family Ties, Full House .... but it will always have the same old recipe as it's episodes . "Steph" cuts off from school and is caught by her father. They have a heart-to-heart conversation and music is played and it's over with a two-week basis that gets a smile, a "aww, dad ..." and the show is over. Where is the comedy in such a situation? Where is Realism? With the war at home you get real-life situations from a real father type figure. Most parents who follow this show hear about the lines that the parents smash, and they also laugh (because they know they said it!) Or they nod their heads (because they know they thought it and never had the trouble To say it!) The War at home has situations that bring great comedy to a father who thinks his son is gay. Doesn't sound funny, most think it makes the father homophobic, but the comedy comes in the bumbling dad trying to talk to his son to open. Which parent knows the right thing to say, especially in a situation like this? I highly recommend this show to anyone I know, have a sense of humor, and especially to anyone who is a young parent or young when they had children. You are related to a show like this whenever you are.
