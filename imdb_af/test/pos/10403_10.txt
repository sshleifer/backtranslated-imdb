I absolutely loved this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a typical Asian horror, haunting an abominable look (usually a woman) scared around people. You hardly see ghost for a majority of the movie, but the way this movie interests you in the plot and characters is genius. It's not the movie for you if you're in the mood (eg Saw, Hostel) or 'surprise horrors' where things appear on you (Hollywood horror, slasher movies), but this movie has an underlying "creepy" factor throughout whole movie I loved. Noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror among the ridiculous remakes and inexhaustible shit released by Hollywood in today's society. <br /> <br /> Don't let the documentary style of filming turn you off (why should it ?!). It's much better than the Blair Witch Project, because the play in Noroi is brilliant and it really makes you feel you are watching something you're not supposed to see. <br /> <br /> Noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Just a few movies made it into my Top 5 horror; and this movie holds a solid # 1 spot on my list.
