It's a great movie! The characters were so realistic to me, it was hard to believe they weren't real people. Because I came from the south, I thought Judith Ivey's character really looked real, and as everyone said, she did an excellent play. The characters are not pretty and do not look like the average Hollywood stars - their imperfect bodies and personalities look so much more natural and real. <br /> <br /> One reviewer mentioned that the main character, Alice, had no good reason to run away from home. She had no moral or sincere reason to run away, like a child who escaped. abuse, etc. I thought she was just deadly work in a working class life and wanted to flee to Florida where her friend lived the attractive and privileged life of a college student in Miami. The actress shows Alice's confusion, uncertainty and questioning in decision-making and willingness to take control of her life with impressive naturalness. The film also shows how Alice is trapped in situations with seemingly no options, causing her to panic, take action and reach out for help. <br /> <br /> Initially, the grain film style deterred me and thought it was a very low budget or home-made movie, but in reality it was doing very well. The home movie quality really makes you obvious with the characters, part of their RV journey across the country. This is definitely a movie worth seeing, though I don't understand all of its descriptions as a heart-warming upcoming story. It is sometimes vulgar and disturbing, even if it is not completely sad.
