I have never paid much attention to this movie until I learned that Paddy Chayefsky, author of the brilliant "Network", was the scriptwriter. His work there instructed me about his genius, so when 'Hospital' appeared on TMC, I was anxious to see it. I was not disappointed. Looking at this movie and "Network", it looks as if its great theme is the absurdity, filth, and mere misery of great human enterprise (eg, hospitals, networks) against the holiness of individual experience and the human spirit and all delivered with a knife-edge feel of completely black humor. "Hospital" is so black of a comedy as "Network", and the excellent cast, led by the incomparable Scott, does his job full of justice. It is a custodian; definitely not to miss.
