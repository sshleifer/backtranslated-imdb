This show is actually pretty good. Like all shows on TV, it has its good episodes and its bad people. <br /> <br /> I've read where people compare this show with Married to Kids, and I think it's a similar show for the new generation. Due to what is expected and allowed on television at Getroud met Kinders, the show has been taken to great lengths to show that it was actually a television program and not intended to be serious. <br /> <br /> The War at Home has the luxury of being a little more realistic. The parents talk to each other like parents of real life, often do their children one thing, when they turn around and do the opposite. <br /> <br /> Certainly, some of the content may be considered controversial. But I find this show really tries to maintain a sense of honesty. Like it or not, there are many families out there, just like this one. <br /> <br /> Every episode teaches a "valuable lesson". It's just that the lesson is that you won't find a perfect solution for every family problem, and sometimes the solution is to choose the least of two evils. We all know that in some cases, as a parent, the only purpose you can have is to keep your children from very difficult trouble and hope they learn about wrong things. <br /> <br /> I respect the writers to try to keep the performance alive, instead of having a magical end, as the Cleaver family always had.
