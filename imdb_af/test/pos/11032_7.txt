I remember this movie, it was the first movie I watched at the theater. The picture was dark. I was very nervous. It was back in 74/75. My dad took me my brother and sister to Newbury Theater in Newbury Berkshire England. I remember the tigers and the lot of snow in the movie also the appearance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery, I think one of the tigers is shot and die. If anyone knows where to find it on DVD, please let me know. The theater has now changed into a fitness club. The nearest cinema is now 20 miles away, would like to hear from others who have seen. this movie or any other likes it.
