While holding his predecessor, "Fast Times At Ridgemont High", as a standard to compare other teenage comedies, "The Wild Life" is one of the lesser-known films of that time - and a worthy successor, if you can call it that way. I believe his tagline read, "From the makers of FTARH, something even faster." This definitely applies. Although it may not be the depth of the former tackling issues such as first dates, teen sex and abortions, "The Wild Life" is a good movie. It's pure chaotic fun, especially because of Chris Penn's top character, Thomas Drake. If Spicolli was high on boil instead of weed, he would be Drake. Eric Stoltz, in his first big role, is wonderful as the direct Bill Conrad. The two characters work well apart. Think of a younger, their Odd couple, complete with 80's luster. Besides them, there are so many other good things about this movie to mention. Lea Thompsom has never visited before, especially during the scenes of her work at the donut shop. Jenny Wright is just fun and fun to watch. Rick Moranis plays a big nerd / perv who dies to get in her pants. Thomas Drake's wrestlers are hysterical, especially Benny, the little Puerto Rican man, who says some memorable lines. In particular, he was screaming at a strip club during a night, I saw on the floor for the first time. It says something! Finally, the movie ends with one of the best 80's partytone on film, ever. Watch out for special appearances by Rolling Stones Ron Wood, Leo Penn (Sean and Chris Penn's father), and a random Michael Jackson draw at the party. Throw a score by none other than the man himself, Eddie Van Halen, and you can't go wrong. For Van Hagar fans, keep your ears open for riffs that appear on such albums as 5150, OU812, and For Illegal Karnish Knowledge. <br /> <br /> If anything disrupts the flow of the movie, it is a small subplot Randy Quaid involved as a forbidden Vietnam veterinarian. It just looks out of place and unnecessary. Other than that, it's almost perfect. If you're a fan of sensible, but fun 80's movies and haven't seen this one, you're in for something special. RENT THIS NOW !!! <br /> <br /> The credits say Cameron Crowe has a cameo as one of the police officers. He turned his back on his scene, because I haven't found him yet. Someone please help me.
