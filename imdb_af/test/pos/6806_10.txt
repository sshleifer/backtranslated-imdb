My daughter has already written a review of this movie in my record ... but I want to add a few words. <br /> <br />? National Velvet 'was one of my two favorite movies as a kid. (The other is' The Wizard of Oz ??.) The cinematography, the acting, the script and the music all came together. Such a wonderful heart felt drama that could still bring tears into my tears. Based on a book by Enid Bagnold, the book followed the book very well. The characters are created so thoroughly. It's easy to get emotionally involved with the whole family and the beautiful little Irish village in which they live. The premise ... full outsider believes in her horse and herself enough to make a chance of the biggest horse race in the world ... is awesome for any young person, especially a young girl in her 40s ... a time when girls are sometimes ignored as people leave creatures alone. You will have to be terribly cooked not to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> But the perspective I liked most about this movie is the unprecedented innocence in its moral message. It's almost magical how 'mother and apple pie' the movies were then. I was really surprised by the IMDB judge who asked ... "Did the world ever really trust?" and then chastised the director for his complacency about an overnight trip with the two main characters. My answer to his question is an unambiguous YES! The movie is going to be the world that trusted in the 40's. <br /> <br /> My grandparents remember to take my mom to this movie when it was released. Then my mom took me to see it when I was young, and my daughter was happy to be born at a time when she could watch it on videotapes repeatedly. Now we have it on DVD. It was a family favorite for generations, although generations of horse lovers. It was never about sex ... it's about age! It's about faith in yourself and hard work to achieve your goals. Even so old did not even agree on the prize money! It's about the girl who understood her horse who needed it to be the best. And yes, the director was indeed worried about Elizabeth Taylor's lack of physical development, because the book made a big problem about Velvet Brown (Liz Taylor's character) cutting her hair and tying her breast so she as a male jockey could pass when she went to the Grand National Steeplechase. It was just a guys' sport ever since ... I think there were only 12 women ever to compete in this race. It's almost insulting that anyone will bother the Lolita thing about this particular movie. In addition, anyone who had anything to do with an adolescent girl and her horse knew that the only thing they ever had with stars in their eyes had four hooves and a tail. <br /> <br /> And now for a little bit of trivia ... the stuntry was performed by the famous Horse Whisperer, Monty Roberts. I believe he is called for his ride in the movie credits. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 10 out of 10! I never get tired of looking at it again.
