I'm selling the dead is a big, messy horror comedy that refuses to take itself seriously. It has advantages and disadvantages. The 85 minutes of the movie breeze and the movie is full of little, sometimes funny, sometimes frightening, sometimes gory, sometimes three at a time, but the individual bits are much better than the sum of the movie's parts. <br /> <br /> The story, as it is, follows professional gravestone Arthur Blake (played by Dominic Monaghan). Arthur's infidelity Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden) has just been cut off for murder and Arthur spent one night before his own head was forfeited for the same crime. Arthur insists he is innocent of murder, but there are many other crimes he is prepared to confess because he was bribed by a Catholic priest (played by Ron Perlman) with Irish Whiskey. <br /> <br /> Since the movie, a series of defusing anecdotes is confessed by Arthur. It becomes a kind of horror anthology - a series of irreconcilable stories, all linked to a similar cast (Arthur and Willie) and a similar theme (grave robbery). Like most horror anthologies, there is no consistent mythology, because all mythologies are simultaneous and occur simultaneously, even when they contradict each other. <br /> <br /> It probably didn't help that I saw this movie the same night as a trick 'Be Treat, a horror anthology that drops all the falls I sell fall dead. In fact, Trick 'r Treat, designed as an anthology, tells a more unified, consistent story than I sell the dead, intended to be a unified story. <br /> <br /> The other problem with the movie (and I admit it is insane nit-picking) is the way the movie plays fast and unlocks with history. Grimes are murdered with a Guillotine. We may be pointing out that he was killed by a Scottish Maiden, a precursor to the French Guillotine, but the Scottish Maiden was abandoned in 1709 and this film was set a good hundred years later since Burke and Hare. named. and they were executed in 1829. The grave that robbed as an industry has become obsolete with the passage of the Anatomy Act (1832), so that the film has previously taken place. <br /> <br /> I know it's emerging is the ultimate in historical humility and we're clearly busy with a universe where all kinds of dead, dead and legendary dead are possible, but the easiest way to anchor a fantasy, To convince the audience to suspend their unbelief is to use something real and genuine. to sound down the fantasy. And it's not like the history of grave robbers or body riders or rebels (call it what you want) is a boring story. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating thing is that writer.director Glenn McQuaid clearly knows the history, especially the good bits. As an example, when Grimes, for the first time, assumes Arthur as his pupil, he correctly explains to Arthur that they, like the rebels, do not steal the clothes from death, because the stealing of corpses is an offense, punishable by a small one. fine while clothing steals an offense, punishable by deportation or possibly even death. So you'd expect Wille and Arthur to strip the body at this point (and for the rest of the movie), but of course they don't. You can accuse the director of ignoring his author's writing, but not when the author and the director are the same person. <br /> <br /> My point is not that there are many naive bodies in The movie, my point is that if you want to act this act in the law and make it clear that Willie and Arthur will follow the law no matter how stupid it is, but what you have to do after its logical conclusion, even if it means that Willie and Arthur arrive to chase a zombie through a cemetery to rip off his clothes and return them to the empty coffin to fill, so that they are not deported to steal the body of the body Do not give up the matter at all. <br /> <br /> Historical downsides aside, I sell the dead is worth a small but funny horror movie that could be much more.
