I never read any of Sarah Waters's novels or Tipping the Velvet. I just heard from Fingersmith when I was browsing through the "The L word" sites. The story of Fingersmith interested me, but I passed it and thought, "Lesbian in the Victorian era, it never ends well, I have enough of that lesson series and movies that are not going." <br /> <br /> But during Christmas my local DVD store Fingersmith gave a discount, I brought the DVD, and my life has never been more colorful. <br /> <br /> This mini-series deserves to be cherished and praised. The acting is so great that I hardly mention it. Sally Hawkins, Elaine Cassidy, Rupert Evans, Imelda Staunton, and more that I can't name, brought light and darkness to their characters. Just by touching a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, they really made their characters and as a viewer I couldn't help but take them home, keep them close. <br /> <br /> Vingersmid, in the Victorian area, is a story of Sue-a thief who loves and lives with her "family" of pickpockets. Little did she know that her fate relates to Maud Lily â€” a somewhat shy, scary girl growing in a mansion miles away. Maud's mother left her a fortune, but Maud herself cannot touch it unless she is married. Worst of all, Maud's uncle makes sure she will never hold her in the house in jail. <br /> <br /> Gentlement, a beautiful, fine thief with a heart as bad as any. He wants Maud's prosperity for himself, and to do so, he raises Sue as Maid Lily's virgin, and asks Sue to persuade Maud to sneak with him. As time passed, things would be simple if Sue did not fall in love with Maud. <br /> <br /> And it will be simple if the story is what I just said. I don't want to spoil, so I want to stop there. But I can assure you that everything has been turned and turned before you can even be aware of what has happened. Then, when this happens, ask what will happen next. In addition, the story is full of passion, unlike any other. There is no self-seeking sexuality question: "Oh my god I love girls", because the girls in Fingersmith are buried so deep in their own darkness that they can barely care. The story with such a twisted plot moves as smoothly as water, running passionately, but strangely calm. <br /> <br /> We've been watching Fingersmith for weeks, but Maud's eyes still haunt me, and Sue's words still warm my heart. "You're pearl, your pearl, your pearl," she said. And such a pearl is it.
