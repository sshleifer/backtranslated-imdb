Seen this movie just two days ago. A very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine. I have no special interest in wine, yet I found it very enlightening. The director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people the way they are. While exposing many things to the surface, he does not succeed in setting his mind and leaving it for the viewer. He shows great sympathy for people (and dogs) and sympathy and lets people tell their story and at the same time expose what they don't want to tell. <br /> <br /> The movie shows us where our world is going, what are the benefits and what is the heavy price we pay. It's a movie about the love of wine and love to make it big, personal and worldwide, character and formula. <br /> <br /> The right stars of the people for me are the older winemakers with their disillusioned appearance. to the world and themselves. <br /> <br /> Using the hectic camera moves and editing takes time, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
