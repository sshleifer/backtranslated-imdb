This movie is my favorite comedy of all time and I've seen many comedies. First, I shouldn't have this movie no script. Just a storyboard. The dialogue is almost entirely written by the actors. What makes this movie absolutely hifierical.The cast is one of the best comic ensembles you'll ever see. The story is about the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia and some of the participants in them. Parker Posey shines and is absolutely amazing! This is one of those films that is most of the laughter of the absolute pathetic character of the characters. ***** / *****
