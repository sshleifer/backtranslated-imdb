A wonderful piece of film that has been well understood and kept me on the edge of my seat. Brilliantly orchestrated in his timing, and the comedy kicked exactly when the tension needed a release. The acting was generally well done (the "director" had asked Alec Guinness for acting), and the shot choices were impressive (like prolonging the hall as Billy tried to run the door in the studio). This movie has not risen since the opening scene.
