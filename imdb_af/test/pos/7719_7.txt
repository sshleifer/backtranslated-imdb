My comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator (the extra on the film) and his unhappy review of the film. I think his perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director. The film was sweet, acting enough, the experience to see it a nice distraction from a busy working week. It wasn't "The Hours" (acting), or "The Matrix" (Special Effects), or even "The Color Purple" (Direction). Most movies won't be. But it was not the crap party that would "believe you" believe you. Sorry man, just me 2 cents. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie itself is concerned, it was finally gay confirmed (+ # 1). It showed a world of diverse and less than perfect people - you know, just like ours (+ # 2)! It opened a door on one culture without excluding other cultures (+ # 3). And I like the music (+ # 4).
