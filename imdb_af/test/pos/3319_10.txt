If it's not my favorite movie of all time, it's definitely in the top five. I like this. Everything about this is perfect - the clothes, the set, the lines - yes, they are not how ordinary people are talking, but ... up to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office, girls changed their shoes, choose a wedge, water the plant ivy plant, sit in the fridge for lunch ... Identical to what our office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the little characters are wonderful. If someone like Joan Crawford is over, it's all part of the package. If you choose a lot of things in the movie, it is very clear that it was in the early sixties, as women did not start to lay it, at least not if they did not want it. As far as characters are contradictory, for example, Suzy Parker's character is acting as if she were all for flings, but then too soon assigned to Louis Jourdan's character. It's not that how many people are like them - inconsistent? They blend in real life with scenes such as Diane Baker's character to find the love of her life after killing her illegal baby in an accident - lying in hospital with a big old band around her. It's also part of the package, it's charm - shiny escape. I like to mix real-life stories that are relevant today (the stereotypical career woman only dealing with men with married men does not have a family when she is older) with those who wish you: "ah, if not could fall in love with a doctor and he will love me, even though he knows my sordid past, and has hurt me all after the scandalous accident !! "Also, I only have the DVD, widescreen, it's even nicer than the full screen ... Yay!
