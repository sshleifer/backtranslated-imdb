If Archie Bunker was armed, he might be "Joe". But, "All in the Family" would have been a short while, because the censors would never have allowed it to run into the rules of this movie. Joe is a worker guy who is a racist and a bigot, and has a big mouth, especially if he's drunk. One night he met a man in a bar, Bill, who drank a drink to calm his turbulent nerves after he accidentally killed his daughter's junkie boyfriend. What happens is that Bill's daughter lived at the junkie, and after taking an overdose to hospital, he went to the apartment to collect her stuff, but didn't expect him to walk into the boyfriend. . In fresh from a big drug deal. In the battle that is being experienced, the boyfriend is accidentally killed and Bill does not want anyone to really know. But he let Joe slip, and when the newspapers and TV reports came out, Joe saw them, sat 2 and 2 together, and suddenly this man was a hero in his eyes. He later falls with him and Bill is of course worried that Joe is going to extort him, but not for money, he wants to hang out with him. What is in a way almost worse. Now, Bill's daughter from the clinic in which she enters escapes back home and hears accidentally what has happened and then goes on and most of the rest of the movie is Joe & Bill who's "underground" "infiltrates to try to find her. It builds to a pretty shocking end, which was totally unexpected to me and ended up on just the right note, or wrong note, depending on your point of view. A kind of decent but dim view of life in the early 70's, mostly from the point of view of a working class, which doesn't make it for everyone, but it's not a bad movie at all and it's a decent watch. 8 out of 10.
