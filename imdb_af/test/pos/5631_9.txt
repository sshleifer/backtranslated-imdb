I rented this movie for two reasons. The first was all the good things I read about it. I was definitely impressed and couldn't agree with all the reviews I read. The second reason is because I know these guys. I don't know Mark, but I do Mike. He didn't change much from the years we knew each other. I know him as "the reaper" of a local Milwaukee radio station (WMSE). The way he is in this movie is really Mike 100%. He once gave me a table. It was a small one, about 15 "high, which Metallica said about it. The strange thing about it was that it had only two legs. Sometimes it is the thought that counts, and Mike always thought of others.
