This movie is about as good as the first Jackass, but with slightly more disgusting sketches. I wouldn't say it was as good as the first, but it got very close. Jackass fans won't be disappointed, but if you don't like the first movie, you will hate this one. There are scenes that will be seen as Jackass classic (the elderly fit with "additions", the "taxi ride" and many others), and those you would like you never looked at (eat shit, drink semen, etc. ...) Overall this movie was a good look and I'm glad I saw it. I'm sure this movie won't have the best rating due to critics who rate it (I've been in the press section and most older viewers were disgusting), but don't let that keep you from enjoying it.
