Excellent movie with Anthony Wong who definitely lives up to his title. Erotic, but increasingly violent, courtesy of dreams bought from a mad occult who quickly turns into nightmares to the extent that the wizard enters into them for poor Mr. Wong to manipulate. Well filmed and very fast moving it is a non stop story of serious magic, herbal medicine, power and corruption, but also time for some good sex scenes and a very bloody violence. There is also a bit of humor to catch you from time to time and make the whole thing for the most exciting 90 minutes or so. Excellent performances all around.
