This movie about a group of small towns that decide to rob the local bank is excellent. Brian (Justin Walker) wants to come from his small town, like Jimmy Stewart in "It's A Wonderful Life." However, unlike George Bailey, Brian is going to rob a bank to attend his art school dream, even if his father is not supportive. The offer to Brian is to act like a client and to divert the guard. It is a tempting offer that, if presented to many, I question what they would do. Anyway, Brian does it. When the sheriff (James Remar) and she may surround the bank, things go from bad to worse. It is a defeat with the Feds that will soon move to kill the children if they have a clean shot. The Sheriff must prevent it and try to end the standstill in a peaceful manner. Unfortunately, tension rises and the teenagers inside turn on each other. Some are out of control. The paper cutter scene is gruesome and difficult to watch. Very Intense!
