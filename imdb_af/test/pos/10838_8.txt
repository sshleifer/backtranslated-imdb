The drama apparently stirred a little while six years ago when it debated on television - not much television news included, it passed under the radar; but after seeing it, I'm not surprised that it caused a stir. Not particularly because of the content (although it is a bit more "indifferent" than the regular TV feed), it has more to do with the reactionary media in this country. Anyway, these three series are based on a book by Sarah Waters and focuses on lesbians - although the plot also has room to explore other 'dark' sides of sexuality. Our main character is an oyster girl named Nan (short for Nancy) from Winchester. She is married to a Kitty Butler by a female man after seeing her at a theater show and soon attending all her shows - eventually touching the artist's eye and becoming her dressing room. It is not long before Kitty gets a chance to play at bigger stages in London and after becoming good friends with Nan, she invites her for the ride. The act gets bigger than Nan also goes to the stage and the pair become a stage duo ... but Kitty breaks Nan's heart and leads her into an odyssey in London's clumsy lower body. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that my DVD collection does not contain a shortage of thin and sordid movies, so there was nothing in this one that was enough to shock me. Despite having laughed at it, I have to say that I'm still surprised by anyone who says the movie has gone too far; Of course there are lesbian sex and other things, but it is never exploitation or over-exploitation and the movie couldn't really be made without it. The main focus is always on the story; and the story is really well done. The movie is almost three hours long, but something that is not long enough to get it all over. Sarah Waters is, of course, an inventive writer, and the film remains interesting for the duration. The play is solid as you would expect, but I have to admit that I found the first actress Rachael Stirling uncomfortable and difficult to start first; while growing in her role as the film progresses. The performance is a bit of a problem and director Geoffrey Sax is a bit too gimmicky for my taste. The story also gets a little nice at the end, which is a pity because this movie is the strongest in the dark moments (episode 2 is the highest point of three for me). There isn't really a defined point on the movie - or at least not one I could see. It's not that important to me; However, like Tipping the Velvet tells a good story and exceeds my expectations. Worth to find out for people who like these things.
