It is not denied. Sci-fi on TV is difficult. There are so many problems that the genre brings with it. Like the need for a good budget, solid writing, decent behavior. Perhaps the budget and the writing are the departments where I feel most efforts have failed. So does "surface" succeed? Not quite, but more so than most. <br /> <br /> The way I see it, a good sci-fi display doesn't really need much CGI to work, nor needs a lot of money. What it needs is the ability to create a greater-than-life feel. The feeling that there is more to the eye, something to make me curious and willing to find out how it will end. Add the pieces of the puzzle and sometimes say "Aha!" is what makes a show like this one break. <br /> <br /> "Surface" had some flaws. First of all, the basic premise is not as exciting as it could have been, and the revealed story is not as exciting (or ventured) as I had hoped in the beginning. Also the TV feeling is very much present. All the way to the crappy CGI (ranging from decent to terrible) to the shifting quality in the acting department. It also feels a bit too family-oriented because it sometimes gets the edge and gets pretty pretty. But apart from these mistakes, it's a pleasant performance. Maybe not as spectacular as some of the other sci-fi's out there. But it drives me interest throughout the season and it also offers some nice cliff hangers between shows. The end to me is not so attractive. I don't like shows that end without ending up talking, so the story remains unresolved. This is especially unfortunate in this case, as the show is canceled after the first season (it has not yet been decided). <br /> <br /> For me, HBO is the benchmark for quality television. Their range has the best actors, the best production values ​​and most of all the most solid writing. It's not high quality, but it's good for what it is. Good enough to have another season without a doubt.
