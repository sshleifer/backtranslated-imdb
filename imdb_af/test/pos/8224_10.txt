Considering the flight, written and executed by Bill Irwin, is a true classic theater piece that translates fairly well into the small screen. Full of quick and sparkling dialogue and of the best physical comedy of the decade, it is head and shoulders above 99% of the "Comedy" as it is presented today. I'm sure it will one day take its rightful place with such a big show as "The Fantastiks", and "Wait for Godot". Why it's not yet available on DVD is a mystery and a tragedy.
