MONKEY is surely one of the best shows ever shown on TV. I remember when I was a kid, I wanted to go to my grandmother's home on Saturday morning and switch on the TV so I could see MONKEY. I loved it. It had shovel action scenes, cool special effects, a wonderful story, a fantastic theme song guaranteed to never leave your head and hilarious dubbing. But it's strange it's in China and the actors are Japanese and filmed in Japan, but it's not a stop to love this TV show. <br /> <br /> MONKEY is about the adventures of three people: Pigsy (Toshiyuki Nishida), Sandy (Shir√¥ Kishibe) and of course the memorable and lovable character, Monkey (Masaaki Sakai) traveling from China to India bunch of sacred roles to save the world. <Br /> <br /> MONKEY is great fun and it's magic.
