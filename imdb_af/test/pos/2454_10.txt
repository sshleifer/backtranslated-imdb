I've never heard of this movie and just got it because I'm a Martin Sheen fan. Now I'm amazed at why it didn't receive the praise and recognition it really deserves. The four characters make you all feel, the father tries to claim his authority. The mother still sticks to traditional family values ​​and tries to stop acting despite the total fragmentation of their family, the daughter who wants her own life and the boy. haunted by his experiences in Vietnam. One felt that this was a scenario that had to be played in thousands of 'ordinary' families to Vietnam. Emilio Estevez as Jeremy was wonderful - totally unholy by his war experience that none of his family could meet. The screen chemistry between him and his real father, Martin Sheen, was incredible. And there were times when Emilio's face was as Martin was in "Apocalypse Now". I feel sure, as Martin Apocalype chose as one of his best films, Emilio will count this one as one of his best. The scene with the gun was blowing completely, because all the emotions were there on the family's faces. Brilliant acting by Estevez, Sheen and Kathy Bates. I watched the movie for the first time last night - and today was the main story in the news about a Gulf War veteran who shot several members of his family. How many more young men are going to destroy their lives through the war?
