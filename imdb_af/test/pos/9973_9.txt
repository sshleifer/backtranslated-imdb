Michael Radford did an excellent job bringing this tricky game to the screen. He took a play with a reputation for anti-Semitism, and showed us that Shakespeare knew the mankind of the Jews fairly well. Radford said after the show, and I agree that Shylock is his first tragic hero, the first of his characters to be undone by a floating, compulsive revenge need. He also rightly points out that a man who was anti-Semitic could not write Shylock's speech of "If you bump me, I don't bleed?" Radford himself is of Jewish descent and he picked up the good and bad of all characters with delicacy and honesty. no character is free from defects; no character is angry. Radford placed the play in the 16th century, giving a sumptuous backdrop to Venetian politics and decade to project Shakespeare's words. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to hear Radford talking, I strongly recommend recommending that you take it, as he gives details of life in the fifteenth century of Venice that has many of the choices he made , enlightened and gave considerable extra depth to the performance. I hope the DVD will come up with extensive comments. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons is a beautiful portrayal of Antonio, a man who thanks himself for carrying the burden of his previous crimes. Lynn Collins, a family member who is unknown, gives us an absolutely flawless, beautiful and detailed work as Portia. Not only is Mrs. Collins beautiful - she also gives Portia-low intelligence and humor to the test scene I have rarely seen in any production of this play. The rest of the actors also do a fantastic job, with a notable performance by Kris Marshall as Gratiano, and a wonderful subtle work by Allan Corduner as Tubal, who plays the movie to Shylock. Finally, while Al Pacino devises his normal strong (and hard) performance, his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he says no words, but you can see all the emotions and madness flowing in and out of him like him see his fortunes change. <br /> <br /> If you like movies from time to time, I can't recommend this movie enough.
