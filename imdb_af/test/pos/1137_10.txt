I saw this movie once, only once, and I didn't know where it came from, and I watched it for about six years, and I finally found it at IMDb.com! Just the whole concept of the movie is wonderful, I believe it has something to do with a race of bioengineered creatures, which holds tabs on us and our planet, but there is one person who apparently does not match. And the way he does it, to keep himself and find it, is to entertain the movie. I don't remember exactly how it ended, but I remember it's finished with a great climax and a good twist.
