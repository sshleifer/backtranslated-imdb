Mickey Rooney (like Mi Taylor) is a young man drifting along the figurative road, meeting 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor (like Velvet Brown) - she is adoring horses, but has a sad history with the animals. Me. Taylor is angry with Mr. Rooney's horse sense; She took him home, and found him room and advice with her family. They are very well supported by Anne Revere and Donald Crisp (as Mr and Mrs Brown). Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are Taylor's tense brothers and sisters. <br /> <br /> The plot of "National Velvet" is irrelevant to an error; For example, the circumstances that led to Taylor's ride in the "Big Race" are quite a stretch (but were probably more credible on paper). Yet, the characters' association with horses, and mrs. Revere's character is good. Rooney and Taylor are excellent in the lead roles; There is a balance between Rooney's fading "child star" and Taylor's lavish new "child star", adding depth to their characterization. <br /> <br /> The outstanding performances of Rooney and Taylor are further enhanced by fine direction, photography, and editing by Clarence Brown, Leonard Smith, and Robert Kern. A sentimental classic. <br /> <br /> ******** National Velvet (12/14/44) Clarence Brown ~ Mickey Rooney, Elizabeth Taylor, Anne Revere
