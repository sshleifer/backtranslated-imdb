There are movies that make careers. For George Romero it was the night of the living death; for Kevin Smith, CLERKS; for Robert Rodriguez, EL MARIACHI. Add to the list Onur Tukel's absolutely wonderful DING-A-LING LESS. Flawless film-making, and as secure and professional as any of the aforementioned films. I haven't laughed so hard since I saw the VOL MONTY. (And even then I don't think I laughed so hard ... to speak.) Tukel's talent is considerable: DING-A-LING-LESS is so full of double entenders that one has to sit down with a copy of this script and do a line-by-line exam of it fully appreciate its width and width. Every shot is beautifully crafted (a clear sign of a right-handed director), and the performances around the world are solid (none of the top views you expected from such a movie). DING-A-LING LESS is a movie of the time.
