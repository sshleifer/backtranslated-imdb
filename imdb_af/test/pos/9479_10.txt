If you like Cagney, you'll love this movie. It has the appearance of American integrity at any cost, personal or social. Cagney heads the weights and measures in NYC. Cagney is up against crooked politicians, the criminal underground, a prominent philanthropist and simple groceries who add a few ounces to the price of a chicken. The chicken scene is screaming where Cagney finds a weight in the cavity by an unsuspecting butcher. The chicken is thrown around the shop in a hilarious scene over who controls the "evidence". If you like old phones, there are interesting screens of bubbles, phones and even bizarre telephone cords. Compared to a lot of film made today, it is pure entertainment and includes mystery with comedy and a message that honesty above all must be the main principle of humanity. Made in simpler times, a world that we cannot find today reflects. The fashion (especially hats) outerwear and cars all play a prominent visual role in defining this small movie.
