I remember when this NBC mini-series was broadcast when I was in high school. After reading the novel, I thought I'd review some adjustments. Didn't expect much from a TV mini series, but now I might have to look more. It's really great, and the best possible movie version can be made. Author Simon Moore, who wrote the disappointment for the original Traffic mini series, based on the Soderberg film, has sparked a brilliant story that runs smoothly: he rammed Gulliver's adventures as flashbacks, with the real story starts when Gulliver first returns home (everything happened on a trip). Gulliver, played by Cheers' Ted Danson, is kind of crazy when his wife, Mary Steenburgen, welcomes him back to his home. Unfortunately, the house is now owned by local doctor James Fox, who has designs on Steenburgen. Gulliver only seems to be disturbed in the first place, but when he starts talking about the stories of small people, it's all the evidence that Fox should throw himself into a crazy asylum. All four of Gulliver's travels are in this version in the same order as the novel (the only time it's done on film). I like the way his current situation reflects his flashbacks. Gulliver's little boy, whom he has never met, reminds him of the Lilliputians. The doctors who overcame him in his cell of a mezzanine remind him of the Brogdingnagians, and the doctors' scientific inquiries remind him of the insane scientific experiments and theories of the Laputans and the professors of the Academy. Finally, when he is tried, he is reminded of the Houyhnhnms and the Yahoos. The movie of this thing is wonderful, including Peter O'Toole, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Omar Sharif and Warwick Davis. The biggest mistake of the mini-series is that the play is really uneven. You have all these good actors, but the smaller characters are often played by actors who are probably fine in episodes by L.A. Law was, but not doing well in costume drama. Ted Danson is not very good, although he has a few rows where he excels. It's probably better that he didn't try one, but all the other characters of the movie speak in an English accent. Steenburgen is actually pretty good in it, and is pretty good in general. Another flaw in the series is that the adventures are getting too fast. It is unbelievable that Gulliver had left home for eight years, as claimed. But, in general, it captures Swift's tone and purpose very well, while, with its structure, adding a new emotional level.
