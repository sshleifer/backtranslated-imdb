The summary is only for those who hate this movie, because the movie is OK or the average is acceptable. Visiting this movie on IMDb made me nostalgic, because I can't help going back in the year 1994. I was one of the few lucky ones to see this movie in theaters. It immediately became one of my favorite comedies and lasted years to make my favorite. How can I say what made this movie my favorite? Was it the excellent writing (story was OK, but screen games and dialogs were fantastic) Was this the superior performance? Was it the mood of the movie? <br /> <br /> After thinking about it for so many years, I say it should be a mix. It's one of those movies that didn't have any mistakes, not even its music. (The other movie that appears in my mind is Sholay) <br /> <br /> PS: Rajkumar Santoshi, please keep a balance between your drama and comedy films. Just 1 comedy is not enough. I want moreeeeeeee ..........
