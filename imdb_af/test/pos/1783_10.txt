After the full-length movie Kieslowski made from this episode of "The Decalogue" years ago, came back to this viewer when we watched the full ten vignettes. As with the other films, this one is loosely based on the fifth commandment, or: "Do not kill." <br /> <br /> Kryzsztof Kieslowski, writing with Kryzsztof Piesewicz, has a look at the idea of ​​a young man who commits an ominous crime to murder an innocent person to evoke his own frustrations. This installment has a Dostoyevsk character that we've launched on "Crime and Punishment", or at least some of the features of the novel are passed on to the aimless youth who apparently have no redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> The story shows the young man walking around the streets of the city without a clear idea of ​​what to do or where to go. The only tender moment he shows is when he visits the photographer's place to ask for an old photo of his sister. Kieslowski makes it fate to manage the killer, with the aim of robbing the driver, but it is his anger and frustration that gets the best of these youths to kill a man who has not deserved to die. no. The last moments of this criminal are one of the most gripping sequences in any film, past or present. <br /> <br /> The other element in the story is the relationship between the public defendant and the criminal. Nothing can prevent the court from condemning the young man to death. The lawyer at the end felt that he had failed his client and went to the judge to see where he went wrong. All he is asked by the young man is to pick up the picture and send it to his mother. <br /> <br /> Kieslowski's version of how he interprets the fifth commandment is forgotten for a surprising movie that remains in the viewer's mind after this episode.
