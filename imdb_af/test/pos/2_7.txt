My measure of measuring a movie's viewing ability is when I become squirmy. When I start shifting positions and noticed my buttocks hurt, the movie is too long. This movie didn't even come close to boredom. Predictably certain, but never boring. <br /> <br /> All the other military branches have written love notes about them and seen their recruitment levels rise, why not the Coast Guard either? They are definitely undervalued, until the day your boat sinks. <br /> <br /> The movie was very enjoyable and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn't know when to stop. However, I was very impressed by Ashton Kutcher's performance. I never liked him, never watched any of his TV shows and always considered him immature. Well, punk. In this movie he does a good job! He is well on his way to having leading status. I think the movie we showed had to be a quick cut or something, because about two-thirds of the way the film became very granular, the sound level dropped and microphones were dropped everywhere. Also at the show were representatives of the movie looking for hearing feedback - especially on the parts of the movie we didn't like. <br /> <br /> ***** POSSIBLE SPOILER: The feedback I gave a few lines in the beginning. Kevin Costner comes home to see his wife, Sela Ward, pick her up and move out. He says, "Maybe I should be the one to move out of." And she said, "No, you don't know where anything in this house is, I should be the one." It doesn't make sense: If she knows the layout so well, Costner is right, he should be the one to leave.
