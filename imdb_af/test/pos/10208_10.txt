Fritz Lang directed two major Westerners: "Western Union" and "The Return of Frank James". The Frank James movie is equal to "Jesse James". "Western Union" is one of Randolph Scott's great westerners. I've never seen Robert Young before; He is wonderful as a telegraph employee. It's the only movie I can think of, it's about the telegraph company that opens in the west. It's a highlight of the telegraph in the west, a triangle love story and about loyalty. <br /> <br /> The supporting role is excellent. Dean Jagger, who made some westerners, plays the telegraph manager. Virginia Gilmore, Jagger's sister plays the love interest in the movie. Me. Gilmore had a short career in movies. She left films in 1952 and became a drama coach. She is mainly known as the first wife. Yul Brynner. It's great to see Slim Summerville in a movie with Mr. See Scott again. They were in two other big movies: "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Jesse James".
