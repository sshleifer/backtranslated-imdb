One of the great tragedies of life is that Disney is so successful for everything they do. If they weren't, we might have more unique jewels of animation like "The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird." The story is that an evil king has succeeded the throne of a place named Up-and-Down (the name could get wrong). He is hated by everyone. His favorite hobby is shooting birds and at one time or another he probably has the wife of Mr. Wonderbird killed (a bird played by Peter Ustinov.) He created four young chicks. Meanwhile, we see that others are painting the evil king's hobbies. He did three paintings in particular: a self-portrait, a painting of a shepherd dog (of which he fell in love) and a painting of chimney cattle (of which he was jealous). One night, the shepherdess and the chimney cattle get off their paintings and run away together. The king's self-portrait also climbs out of his frame and does away with the real king (you think I'm doing it, that's the right plot) and sends the royal police force to the young lovers. Mr. Wonderbird then helps the lovers to try to escape the king's powers. <br /> <br /> The plot is wonderfully surreal, and the on-and-off land is an incredibly imagined place, full of tower buildings accessible only by elevators. It is an equal mix of the world of "Metropolis" and "1984" and the drawings of Dr. Seuss. <br /> <br /> Look for a very unique viewing experience that doesn't fit the standard formula for most animated features.
