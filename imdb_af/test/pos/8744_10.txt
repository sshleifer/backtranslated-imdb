I remember remembering it when it was made and thought it was brilliant at the time. Watching it for the second time nearly 20 years later, I still think Traffik is brilliant and much better than the American film based on this drama. <br /> <br /> It should also be looked at by all of us today coming away tomorrow's politicians who think they can win the war on drugs, as the issues in this movie are so hot today that at the end of the 80's, and unless they change their policy, it will be in another 20 years. <br /> <br /> Well-written, well-made, beautifully performed and excellently filmed. An enchanting drama that is also entertaining as well as some of the harsh realities of criminal drug trafficking.
