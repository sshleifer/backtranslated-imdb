I watched this movie at the 2005 International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, Everything Illuminated is the director's debut of actor Liev Schreiber. Schreiber also wrote the script. In the film, Jonathan (Elijah Wood) collects obsessively items from his family, from toothbrushes to containers to paper paper, which he then sealed in ziploc bags and pens in a wall in his home to record his family history. But the space for his grandfather is strikingly bare. Already Jonathan really liked him was a piece of jewelry and an old photo of him with a woman who hid him during World War II. Jonathan decides to make a search for Ukraine to find the woman, thank you, and learn more about his grandfather. <br /> <br /> A few characters support a tourist business for Jewish people, including a young man who is obsessed with Western culture (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather (Boris Leskin), who thinks he is blind and whose memories and own demons can have from the war, and his grandfather's temperamental eye. <br /> <br /> The script effectively combines both humor and drama as the three characters travel through the countryside and search for Jonathan's grandfather's town, deeper and deeper in the memories of the past. The best performance probably comes from Eugene Hutz, who Alex Jr. Playing, the movie starts as a tracksuit, dance dancer just breaks to have fun, but develops into something more than not just Jonathan, but all the characters get their own relief. . <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber, Elijah Wood and Eugene Hutz attended the show and did a very humorous Q&A to the movie. <br /> <br /> - Schreiber was very close to his grandfather, who was a Ukrainian immigrant, who died in 1993. It made him write to get his memories on paper. Meanwhile, he was asked to do a lecture on Foer's short story, The Very Rigid Search, which was an excerpt from the still unpublished novel. Schreiber was blown away by the quality of the writing, saying that Foer did 15 pages that Schreiber tried in 107. In Schreiber, Foer approached and they talked about their grandparents, culture, movies and the nature of short-term memory in America; Eventually, Foer agreed to adapt Schreiber's book. <br /> <br /> - Schreiber's own project was meant to be a road movie, but the book has a parallel story that is an imaginary chronological history of the city of Trochenbrod. stretching over 500 years; He gave his budget and limitations as a film producer, saying he would leave it to Milos Forman and instead take the trip. This pictured chronology had moved him to make the film in the first place, the idea that a past was lovingly imagined to be just as valuable as a past was recalled accurately. "<br /> <br /> - Schreiber said the movie was a series of happy accidents and after he had not searched for an actor successfully in Ukraine, he walked through the Lower East Side in New York when he A woman from the waist, a woman in the waist, with an insane trunk, is attacking her, and the poster said the Gogol Bordello Ukranian Punk Gypsy Band. <br /> <br /> Eugene Hutz when the story took over, he had never pursued, as music was his first passion, one day a friend gave him the book, and he thought it was written in a way similar to how he wrote music; sentences / syntax, language is my own. <br /> <br /> Later, they received a call from a production company, looking for Eastern European music that was medieval but modern, and Hutz met with Schreiber, and he soon realized the movie was based on the book he had just read, not long after Schreiber asked Hutz what he had from Alex did not and whether he could do the character. <br /> <br /> - Foer and Schreiber talked about the film in the fall of 2001, shortly after the events of September 11th. Both were in Europe at that time and they were talking about the deviant comments they had heard from Americans. This led Schreiber to try to find an articular American who would defend the stereotype of Americans from Americans. Someone who was uncomfortable, vulnerable, deficient, innocent and in search of history beyond the borders of his own country. Schreiber started thinking about who it was, and Elijah came up. <br /> <br /> One of Schreiber's inspiration as a movie maker is Emir Kusturica (I think that's who he said, who also said another segment in another festival movie, All the invisible kids) you're not looking for the actors, you're looking for the people. " Schreiber said there is something about who Elijah is, that he has a generosity of spirit and sincere goodness as a man, which is on film. Schreiber said the eyes were important to try to articulate an observer's character and that if "eyes were the doors to the soul, Elijah's garage doors were." <br /> <br /> - Elijah Wood had fun asking about the similarities between his character Kevin in Sin City and Jonathan in this movie, because both are an empty slate on which emotions are projected. Wood replied that Jonathan looked quiet and seemingly emotional, but it was all about his observations, his experiences with other characters and the environment in which he was. <br /> <br /> - About the differences between directing and writing: Schreiber said he likes to write a lot more and funnyly described as "hell". After his grandfather died, Schreiber began to think about how to preserve history and himself; Is he content driven or not, or just good to interpret others' work? He said he loved the exercise to find out what is emotionally important to you.
