Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biography of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets its artistic method ('sketches' poems), its inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and its struggle to face a harsh reality in the face of its idealistic imagination. <br /> <br /> The movie integrated extracts of Miyazawa's poems in the plot beautiful. His relationships with his students were powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he offers to a student who has only been caught in the classroom. Miyazawa's selfless compassion for the farmers in his town, his sister and other unhappy people can serve as a lesson to all of us. Furthermore, Miyazawa's dedication to science is also well portrayed. At a time when Western ideas still met skepticism, especially in provincial towns like Miyazawa, he took advantage of his elegance to help his fellow citizens. The way the film presented moments of artistic passion and disappointment in the author was truly intense and well-interpreted. <br /> <br /> I felt the CGI was integrated into the movie, while it was an innovative groundbreaking collision with the more organic animation. It can be argued that it intends to represent conflict within the main character, but I found it rather unaesthetic. I also wish that the movie had Miyazawa's Buddhist influence, but it worked well without it. <br /> <br /> Although this movie was done very well. I give it a 9/10, with the one point being deducted for the CGI. Otherwise, the animation, plot and dialogue were all wonderful and sincere. I haven't seen any other movies of Kawamori Shoji, but after I saw this one, I'll surely give them a chance.
