I'm glad I first read the Sarah Waters novel, since I had my own pictures of the characters in my head. However, the people who threw this production were not disappointing at all - in fact, after I got used to Rachael Stirling as Nan, I think Nina Gold did a tough job in the ruling department. (Can Keeley Hawes be better?!) <br /> <br /> The BBC did it again: it's a great production of a very good book, and they've done it in style. If you can get your hands on this (VHS, DVD), you need to get the 181-minute version (the uncensored one). It's a wonderful journey, though it's a little rocky, which you won't regret.
