In 1850 in Yorkshire, a boy chimney sweep was falsely accused of theft by his crooked master and walked away. He falls into a treacherous local river and is transported in an underwater area, where he makes many friends and saves the mythical Water Babies of an evil shark. <br /> <br /> Based on a book by Charles Kingsley, it is a lovely children's movie, half-live action and half-animation, which is a grim and appealing depiction of Victorian times and a wonderfully pleasurable submarine adventure . It is actually two films in one, which somehow complement each other and combine in a much richer whole. The animation by Tony Cuthbert, Jack Stokes and Miroslaw Kijowicz is wonderful as well as photography by Ted Scaife and the music of Phil Coulter and Bill Martin. Pender has a good rough diamond quality than the (literally) fish from water. I like the moment he is on top of the house, see all the chimneys and scream "Blimey !!" on top of his voice. Mason and Cribbins are the dirtiest, most beautiful bulls you can see in a costume drama (if you want to see real Victorian values, don't look at Sense and Sensibility, watch it), and Whitelaw, Pertwee (who does the most vote) and Percival is all excellent. That's how a good kid's movie should be - good old singalong fun, but just a little thoughtful, sad and scary. High Cockallorum !!
