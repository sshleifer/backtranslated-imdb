Vasili Pichul's 1988 film Little Vera is a sharp representation of the decline of family values ​​and human dignity in the wake of Soviet communism. It is a distinctive film from the modern Russian theater. Pichul's brutal drama suggests a strong departure from the images of purified idealism promoted in Soviet times (as in Aleksandrov's Circus), which shifted the social chaos of his time into the public spotlight. A contemporary Ukrainian institution exacerbates the effect, first through the immediacy of the film until its era, second by using a venue that is not only struggling for identity instead of a Soviet system, but also as a nation which is different from the Russian idiom that dominated the USSR. <br /> <br /> The film's title character and protagonist, Vera, is a rebellious adolescent girl with a "dysfunctional" family, including a hard-drinking father and a maternity care. Rejection of her would be Beau Andrei, Vera begins a devastating (and mostly sexual) relationship with a student named Sergei. Despite her parents' aversion to the lazy Sergei, and despite Sergei's rude contempt for her parents, he moved into their cramped apartment. Stress escalates until Vera's father drunk Sergei stab. Vera must decide whether she will remain faithful to her untenable family by proving that her father has acted in self-defense or to constantly support and defend the one-day Sergei. <br /> <br /> Intolerable in virtually every imaginable way, Little Vera masterfully and communicates the inevitable gap left in social life after the collapse of communism. The sexual aggressiveness of the movie (it was the first movie to show explicit sex) combined with the relentless presentation of social reality (a noticeable distinction from the socialist realism that Stalin asked) has the conditions of former Soviet life effectively confronted. Most interesting, however, was public reception. While many hate writing to the director and star, the movie was very popular. Here comes the two-edged nature of "movie as social criticism": if done right, the film will make the audience uncomfortable. Because no easy solution arises, some viewers will hate the movie and filmmakers to solve the problem. Many films are somewhat similar in this regard: Larry Clark's Kids, Harmony Korine's Gummo, even popular movies such as John Hughes' Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to viewers whose prospect of nearly two hours of turbulent domestic conflict and social miasma is not too scary. The film is absolutely beautiful, and incredibly challenging. Despite the trouble of watching the movie, there are a few moments inside. Of course, the socio-historical and cultural meaning of the film cannot be overlooked, and even works as an even more assertive reason for watching this movie.
