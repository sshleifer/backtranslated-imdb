<br /> <br /> I only saw this movie shortly after it was exhibited in 1995. I turned it down and said that July was not Daniel, and never gave it a chance and said it was terrible. /> <br /> But here it is, 5 years later, she's at Disney and I watch it again. And I think it's not as bad as I make it. Miyagi is still Miyagi, just like cabbage as ever, the music count has always been nice. And Swank's character is not that bad, her acting is pretty good in the light of the writing. It beats the third installment with a wide margin. So, my original rating of 4 was increased to 7.
