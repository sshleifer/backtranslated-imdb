There had been some interesting conversations on the set of Eagle's Wing, with Martin Sheen straight from the Apocalypse. Now he was sitting with the actor on Coppola's film, Harvey Keitel. A real unloved child of a movie, dating back to the last big group of Westerners in 1979-80, was very disguised at the time because it was made by a British studio and director. It has conveniently rejected the fact that many of the classic American westerners are a bit of an overreaction. <br /> <br /> The plot is simplicity itself, as Martin Sheen's inexperienced hiker finds himself with Sam Waterston's nonosyllabic Kiowa warrior on possession of a beautiful white horse, the Eagle's Wing, about a hard and primitive landscape at a time "before the legends began." Apart from Caroline Langrishe's prisoner Irish governor, the supporting role-player has little to do (Stephane Audran doesn't even get her mouth open) and it's a bit slow, but Anthony Harvey's movie boasts fantastic Scope photography by Billy Williams and a good score by Marc Wilkinson.
