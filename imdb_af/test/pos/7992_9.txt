1992's "Batman Returns" was Tim Burton's second round as director and again he made a hit by making this movie dark and gloomy as his 1989 one. Gotham City is again a place of darkness and gloom with crime and corruption boiling out of every corner of the street. It was also smart to see Burton using politics as a subplot tied well and neatly to the business corruption of businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the plan for Gotham mayor of the "Penguin" (Danny DeVito) to make! Anyway, Keaton comes back as "Batman" / Bruce Wayne and he gives another star performance as a strange and torn man who just can't find love in a normal world, but he is challenged when he's just a lonely soul met in Selina Kyle. Kyle has a dark secret of her own very slim and she is just a straight vamp as the sexy and mysterious but dangerous "Catwoman" (Michelle Pfeiffer). A plan to destroy between both villains Gotham and most of both want to get rid of the bat. Actually, this movie, though violent and somewhat rough with many penguin scenes, is clearly an exciting ride from start to finish, because you never get a dull moment and thumbs up to Tim, because his exploration of the characters is so dark and contradictory it just makes the movie even more interesting. The show by Michelle Pfeiffer was the best ever, as no one could have played The Catwoman, and Devito was perfect as the Penguin. His body frame fit the character, but his performance perfectly, although it was nice to watch. "Batman Returns" is an entertaining excitement you can't relieve. As a viewer you will enjoy it many times, it is so exciting and explosive.
