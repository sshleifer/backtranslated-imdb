Wow! The French really get it. Looking at their first Asterix movie, we see a good story with nice actors (especially thanks to Gerard Depardeu), but very special effect. In a fantasy story like Asterix special effects are very important. Well, they did it right! It looks great. I personally think Mission Cleopatra is the best Asterix story ever written. In the movie there is not one moment, you are bored. Check out here! One thing! They didn't go exactly through the writing I think is a bit pittyful. For example, in the comic Obelix the nose of the Sphinx breaks, immediately all the small disturbers break the nose of their miniature Sphinx. (really funny to see). Well, they didn't put it in the movie, but they made the nose under the Sphinx gesture. Asterix: "They'll never find it here" (guess again). Was funny but not as good as the original. Another thing I didn't get from the movie was their choice for music. It made the movie for children. But still ... This is a must C! <br /> <br /> Grz Da Jean Holland
