Love Jones is one of the best movies I have ever experienced. <br /> <br /> The key element that comes to me is the fact that it is very well-targeted. I studied this film as a whole - watching movies more than once makes certain things unconscious - the direction of this movie as well as the writing is chic, hip and artful! I'm in love with the direction. The scene where Larenz Tate and Nia Long drive in the north of Chicago is amazing. The director of this movie earned awards for his great work. <br /> <br /> Love Jones is an elegant and sexy movie. It emphasizes the fact that we can be people who love, who have mistakes, who love life, learn and just us without the hype. To be our natural self. <br /> <br /> The poetry is great, but the story line, the dialogue, and the screens really make this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves to be seen. It's a great movie for lovers and friends to sit back and watch, or the hopeless romantic (like me) to sit back and enjoy on a Friday or Saturday night alone. Any day of the week where peace, loneliness, and some entertainment are needed, Love Jones is what I recommend.
