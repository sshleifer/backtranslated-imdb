*** SPOILERS *** Well made and interesting film about the alienated youth of America back in the 1950s. Back in those days, many parents got caught up in making big money and staying high on the pig. Remember that their children, especially teenagers, need a lot more than a car and a heavy grant to feel part of the family. They also needed love and attention for their big problems, which is the 16-year-old Hal Ditmar, James MacArthur, never from his successful film producer, Mr. TomTmar Ditmar, James Daly. <br /> <br /> Never really connect with his dad Hal is getting far away from him and she cares, Mrs. Helen Ditmar, Kim Hunter, as well as from society. After his dad put Hal on him to borrow his car, he and his friend Jerry, Jeffery Silver, drove into Hal's beating and barley operational 1930s jalousie to the local tractor to catch the latest western movie. <br /> <br /> Feeling like hitting the world. Hal works like a real first-class jerk who sits his smelly feet in the faces of a couple, Eddie Ryder and Jean Corbett, in front of him, and Jerry tries to watch the movie. It leads Hal, as well as his friend Jerry, not just to be kicked out of the theater, but with him the theater manager Mr Grebs, Whit Bissell. It seems that Hal was already willing to leave the theater without first getting his money back, but if Grebbs was trying to grab him, Hal turned around and called him right in the coast. <br /> <br /> Now, in real hot water, he is charged with assault and battery, sits on his James Dean act, at the local police station, which seems to be too cool or just stupid to realize what he did; almost knocked Mr. Grebbs' teeth out. That's when Sgt.Shipley, James Gergory, tells Hal that his father picks him up to pick him up when he finally gets to know what he has done. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie has Hal trying to straighten himself out, but can't do it because the low esteem his father has from him. His father thanked him for understanding what he had done in Mr. Grebbs' banding was, in self-defense. Hal's dad acts as if he were at the theater and saw the whole incident with his son Hal as a street thief instead of a young man grabbing and pushing without provocation. <br /> <br /> Not excusing what Hal did to explain to Mr Grebbs, he was actually prepared to admit his hooligan behavior, but he wanted both mr. Grebbs and his father treat him at least with a review of consideration; Gebbs in the fact that he is Hal and Mr. Ditmas challenged not even to hear him! Feel like a criminal without anyone, but his mother, really turning around, slowly loses it just to have Sgt later. Shipley and Mr. Grabbs agrees to abandon the assault charge. You'd think Hal had already learned his lesson, but the real lesson, more than a stretch behind bars, that Hal was so urgently needed, was a lesson his father totally ignored! To be there when his son needed him the most and mr. Ditmar did not fail with flying colors. <br /> <br /> Things are actually straight for everyone in the movie after Mr. Grebbs has a band, ends with a shiner, again through Hal, who goes back to the Grebbs theater, tries to get him to call his dad and tell him that Hal only defends him when he first , not the second time, split him. In the end, Hal learned a real lesson to get along with people and not to cause problems. But most of all, Hal's dad, Mr. Ditmar learned the most valuable lesson from understanding his frustrated and estranged son and acting like a father to him instead of a jailer and a sugar daddy. As the song says, "Everything you need is love" to get things right and it was both love and understanding for his son Hal. Ditmar's best dismissed until the end of the movie.
