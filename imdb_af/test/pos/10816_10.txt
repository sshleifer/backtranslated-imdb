Bon Voyage is fun for the audience as it combines the required silliness of a comedy with just enough sobriety to actively engage viewers and invest in the outcome. However, the film is also historically educational; It captures the tension of the so-called "false war" and later, the French nobility's flight from Paris before the German attack. Yet Bon Voyage is not a "war movie." It's a comedy about the lives of a handful of people against the backdrop of extraordinary times. Bon Voyage carries the chaos, confusion and emotional confusion of a nation of collapse and the wide spectrum of French responses to the new political order. This film is a comedy that entertaines the audience, a romance that uses many clerks skillfully, and a story of a handful of people whose nation collapses around them.
