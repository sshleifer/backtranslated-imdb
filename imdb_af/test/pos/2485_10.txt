Realistic Masterpiece. Thirty years later, the pictures may look a bit old, but actually it's just the 'fist in the face' effect of the movie. I have never seen a movie like this in my whole life. The first time I saw it, I didn't know if it was a fiction. And it didn't look right. The movie is a masterpiece that every person in the world should see. It is the best critical film of society. The ultimate film demonstrating that the system is down. And the system hasn't changed much for thirty years. I think this movie should be considered a piece of education.
