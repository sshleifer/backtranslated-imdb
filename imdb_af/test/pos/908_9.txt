Stan Laurel regards PUTTING PANTS ON PHILIP as the first real L&H movie. THE SECOND THIRD YEAR was the first 'official' L&H film, but it was the one where Stan completely resigned, not only to perform (he has, under certain circumstances, with the Hal Roach Studios as a director and gag-man 'reported - under their Oliver Hardy's accident with a lambing bolt that Stan had to replace him, and the extra money that would provide himself and his new wife, Lois, had his historic return to CEO, as well as writing director, editing and involvement in other production areas), but also realized that he was part of a team that worked well together. So it's a historical and very important movie in the history of comedy. <br /> <br /> It's also a surprisingly funny, small, quiet movie; rather than what Laurel & Hardy will become known to and from what they are more directly associated with today. The characters from Stan & Ollie do not appear. Scottish Stan Laurel is the cousin of Oliver Hardy, a respected man over town who is reluctant to be seen with this strange colleague with a kilt and the habit of chasing pretty girls. There are some very funny moments in this well-made, charming little movie, and the performances of these two kings of the comedy are spot-on-watch Stan's small "scissor kick" and smile saying, "Well, waddaya knows?" ' for example, when he sees girls, or the hair-creaking scene at the airport. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you can, with music from the Beau Hunks Orchestra (available on the VVL video releases) which is the 1920's and is very, very enjoyable to listen to. This is a brilliant and understated movie, so I said it was surprisingly funny.
