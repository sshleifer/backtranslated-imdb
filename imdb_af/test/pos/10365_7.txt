This production was pretty good. The usual fabulous scenery, interesting, peculiar characters. It was just as strange not to have Captain Hastings, Miss Lemon, and Poirot's office / residence, as prominent in the original PBS / BBC secrets. <br /> <br /> In the original series so much happened at the office. Hastings reads the paper, while Poirot "exercises his gray cells." Mrs Lemon, when needed. <br /> <br /> Poirot without Capt. Hastings will be like Holmes without Watson. He can definitely solve the crime, but it's not that interesting. <br /> <br /> And what would be a Poirot secret without Hastings, with its impeccable ways, falling for a beautiful, unattainable woman.
