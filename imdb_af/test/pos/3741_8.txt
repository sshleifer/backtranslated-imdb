NIGHT IN RODANTHE brings two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere back to the screen in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they currently have. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The places, the beauty of their attraction to each other when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other, is actually romance that goes to an audience. with gentle care. James Franco in another microlight is just the right one, and the elegance of Lane in combination with the beach house is a true Autumn 2008 movie to remember forever, such as the NOTEBOOK.
