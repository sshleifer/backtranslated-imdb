The fact that it is still a highly risky movie after 50 years, says a lot about it. It's more intelligent and interesting than almost all the recent movies of the same genre you can find, and has a certain engaging sense of innocence. I'm not a big fan of these kind of movies, but I can watch the whole thing without boring. It makes it a good movie to watch with someone who doesn't necessarily share your taste in movies. I like the black and white palette, the excellent casting, the smartest spectacular scene that guesses what trick they are going to pull next and the end like everyone else. To see the hoist sequence, one realizes the power of silence, which unfortunately is so untapped in today's theater.
