I expected a good movie. What I got was a better movie. The chemistry between James and Smith is just incredible. Keep watching him once in a big movie! <br /> <br /> The movie works because the actors play their parts perfectly. Will Smith is fantastic with his never-ending charm; Kevin James is hilarious and Eva Mendes ... let's just say she's playing the bitch / sweet / annoying role to the best of her ability. <br /> <br /> What I loved about the movie was the fact that Will Smith didn't even try to love. He was just !! The "date doctor" has all the right moves, said everything in the most perfect ways, and never went over it. <br /> <br /> The funny parts are hilarious ... and the cute, romantic parts are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. And no, it's not a chick flick.
