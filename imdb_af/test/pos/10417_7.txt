Despite its New York area and New York characters, 'Summer in the City' is not an American movie, it's better than that. What is most unusual is the mixing of styles and genres. Director Niami's show shows a thorough touch in the combination of comedy with tragedy, pathos with drama. <br /> <br /> The secret of Niami's success seems to be a smorgasbord of great characters - each one could have built their own film around them - and then complete with beautifully realized performances of one of the most wonderful eclectic works that one will struggle in the same country to see in the same movie. From Bai Ling to Ornella Muti, Robert Burke to Peter Stormare, who reveals here that he has a lot more in him than the bad old stereotypes he plays in Hollywood pictures. Even Sandra Bernhard is funny here! <br /> <br /> An additional bonus, substantial cake, is John Cale's soundtrack.
