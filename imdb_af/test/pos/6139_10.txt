William M. Thackeray once said: A good laugh is sunshine in the house. "When I look away, I must say that the sun shines in my house. This film was wonderful, the opening was very clever, the story kept well. Two candy bar functions that are usually forced enemies to form an alliance of sorts to a David and Goliath battle against a fast food chain that builds a restaurant on their street. The end was hilarious, though I found many people who didn't agree with me. <br /> <br /> However, the film was very discreet, depicting contemporary Australian ethnic stereotypes, especially the collision or cultural collision, as you move between traditional Anglo-Australian and Italo-Australian stereotypes, and how they found unity of indifference, very nice. <br /> <br /> I was first in Vito Colosimo's performance as Tony Stilano an Italo-Australian Fish a Chip shop owner, his acting was very real and convincing. He succeeded in bringing the essence to the surface, or I have to say the soul of the Italian Australian stereotype, which is actually not too Italian, but also Australian, Colosimo found the balance, inhaled in his lungs and gave it life. <br /> <br /> The cinematography could have been better, more shots from the local area would have been nice, From what I can see, was it in Melbourn e, but where in Melbourne? for me it seems somewhere between Ivanhoe and Bullen, although I'm not 100% sure. <br /> <br /> I don't know why so many people compare this movie to "The Castle", although they have similar themes that run through them, stand out in their own league. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was great with a capital "E" it has it all, it's funny, the jokes are good, it's about contemporary issues facing the Australian society, the story good, i loved it! I highly recommend it.
