I saw it before 'bubba ho-tep' at the fantasy movie festival in montreal. all about it is to tap the hat to (or completely rip off) Tim Burton. However, I enjoyed it, even though it was extremely distracted. What impressed me most was the quality of the footage that gave the obvious shoe string budget. The set design and props were inventive and original, although the writing was definitely not.
