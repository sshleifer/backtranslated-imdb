We saw La Spettatrice @ the Chicago International Film Festival last night, and we were both extremely moved. It is a ghost story of loneliness and missed connection in which the longing for intimacy is contrary to our fear of revealing too much to ourselves. The three lead (Barbora Bobulova like Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising. <br /> <br /> After all the movies that older women devalue, it's great to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) as beautiful and sensual, as well as seductive and powerful. We were conditioned to believe that when a younger woman enters the mix, the older woman will become jealous of the younger woman, the man will leave the older woman for the younger woman, and so on. In this movie, Emotional Truth is considerably more complex. Highly recommended.
