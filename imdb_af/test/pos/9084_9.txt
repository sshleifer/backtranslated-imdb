A film that reveals the discomfort of modern men and women alive when confronted with death. We are beyond the simple religious belief in the afterlife, and what is more in any kind of hell or heaven. Religion is declared dead. Yet man is more obsessed than ever by death, especially as we can push it away for some time. In addition, the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. It was quite typical of the late 20th century. Today things change, especially when the US President Barack Obama, in a public address to journalists, speaks of their quest for truth and qualifies that truth is, of course, relative because it is more of a quest than a final end, purpose or achievement. The film shows the end of the good old metaphysical thinking that began to evolve into a truth obsession, an obsessive conception that truth was unique and irreversible. Postmodernism has not yet reached Hollywood, but today it seems it has reached the White House. So some young doctors and medical students decide to die and come back. Technically, this is possible, but the result is not surprising. It reactivates old guilty feelings and frustrations buried in the unconscious. One is dealing with a drug-addict father of a Vietnam veteran who commits suicide, another with a young boy who was stoned by some other death-robbers, another with a young black girl in high school. was placed and harassed by racism, sexism and hatred if not fear of her shame. It is so naive that you can cry for these highly-qualified young adults and act like babies crying for their bottles of edulcorated fruit juice. However, the film is interesting, but in something else. The institution and the shooting and every detail or treatment of any detail are baroque, morbine, decadent, much in the style of "Death in Venice" or Greenaway, or other artworks dealing with making friends with the basic enemy who dies is. Of course, it doesn't save the movie, but at least it makes it worth watching. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris University 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Versailles University Saint Quentin and Yvelines, CEGID
