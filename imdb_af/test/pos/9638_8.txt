In my personal opinion - "The Patriot" is one of the best Steven Seagal movies. <br /> <br /> I've heard people say it's the worst ever, it's not like SS etc. I do not agree. As a highly spiritual person, a great master Seagal has established a good tradition in action movies. He always has a good background, good action, high professionalism and a smart message. This movie has it all. You have good shooting scenes, fantastic aikido. Although not much of it, it shows us its quiet side. This change in his film production only proves his spiritual growth (he does not end up being the friend of Chisolm). <br /> <br /> "The Patriot" is definitely one of the best movies of the "filmmaker's" point of see I've seen lately. You have great panoramic shots of Montana, we see real American nature and beautiful wildlife (including horses and flowers). The soundtrack also deserves a few words. During the film I had a great opportunity to listen to classic American cowboy western music (not Country). Similar music was heard in "Back to the Future Prt.3". SS's acting has improved significantly since its last films. His role is unknown to him (unlike policemen and commandos), but he does a good job of playing the retired doctor-of-government. His play is convincing and his lines are good. <br /> <br /> I was very happy with the cast. LQ Jones proves that life and death run together, Whitney Yellow Robe plays a beautiful and clever scientist. Camilla Belle looks great as McClaren's daughter. <br /> <br /> Mr. Sesagal discusses the much debated "Real American" Tradition and the militia squad, which offers its own view (he just loves the Constitution, but thin bearded men have nothing to do with it). There are also good points about the East-Western Medicine system and nature. <br /> <br /> Seagal's best. And opening new horizons in his film career. <br /> <br />
