"Meet Sherri .. for an evening of pleasure and terror! '' Cheap special effects, cute lines, is the original 1978 movie '' Nurse Sherri '' Starts Geoffrey Land as Peter Desmond, and Jill Jacobson as Sherri Martin and Regie by Al Adamson. <br /> <br /> The movie is about an evil ancient spirit that a nurse owns at a hospital, and then his doctors start killing one by one. The scene was good, but some of the acting was robot. storyline was good, but the sex scenes were just thrown there, probably more views. The direction was bad. And the special effects look like a drawing, the effects no one clapped. The deaths are pretty good, but the director mixed too many things with no sense like sex scenes, nudity, soccer and much more. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie, but not the best. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
