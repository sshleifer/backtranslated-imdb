A stolen shipment from Vigoroso, the Mexican Viagra; a beautiful girl trying to rebuild her life and leaving her husband, a boss of the Italian Mafia; a young sheriff who falls in love with his old darling. This is the plot of "The Shipping", a land comedy in the small town of Paradise, Arizona. Despite its simple and classic story, movie (director Alex Wright) has his fun moments: when Elizabeth Berkley (as Candy Porter) looks at a Vigoroso green pill, says: "What is it? A mouth-watering candy?" "Or when the girl enters the sheriff and finds him completely naked. Or when the Vigoroso shipment ends in that more, in the final order ... The cast offers some good performances: by Matthew Modine as the sheriff of Paradise Valley, who still loves his old friend; and by Elizabeth Berkley, whose character still loves her old boyfriend ... The supporting role, including Nicholas Turturro, Paul Rodriguez (like Mexican Jos√®) and G Michael Gray (what kind of teeth ...) makes a pleasant job too. Not an Oscar material, but not so bad. A fun comedy without pretext.
