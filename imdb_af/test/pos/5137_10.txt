Hoot goes over these three teenage children trying to save a bunch of owl. Now for me I think it's right, they stand up for what is right and what is wrong. In this film, a boy Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman) moved from Montana to Florida. And as soon as he arrives on the bus, a bully name Dana Matherson finally starts him with a bully the next day. Roy hit the bully and ran out of the bus and chased the mysterious running boy. After all that Roy finally met with the Running Boy, named Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley), his nickname, his stepson Beatrice (Brie Larson) gave it to him because he could catch Mullets with his bare hands. Anyway, Mullet Fingers and Roy become friends and they join Beatrice to stop the construction of a new pancake restaurant. Mullet Fingers is the one behind all the vandalism that happened there and later he gets a bit of one of the dogs sitting there to protect the construction site. so they got up to the muckle driving the bulldozer and everyone saw the owls. It was a wonderful movie because it showed where children can make a difference in life by standing up for what is right and what is wrong. That's what is nice about this movie. It teaches a lot to everyone about wildlife and how important it is.
