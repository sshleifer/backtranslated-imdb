This movie was very interesting ... it's also shocking because the movie's similar events only occurred 10 months after the movie. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see the problems that could be experienced and realistic enough to show that no matter how prepared you are - you are not. If it was made for an American audience, it would be different, as they would have used it as a full propaganda movie and not as a wake-up call the BBC did! It's still propaganda, so far - no movie today with these themes can't be - but it has dealt with the problem. <br /> <br /> A film that has to be shown in all terrorism / counter-terrorism courses, but won't because it shows errors that should not be recognized! A big movie in which the BBC took some risks and unfortunately London no longer needs a fictional story because of the reality of July 7, 2005.
