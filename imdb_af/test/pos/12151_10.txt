If you get the ugly pleasure from Pink Floyd's music, you'll love this movie. the score is completely pink Floyd and of course the drug plays a big part in this movie that gives you the doubt about life in the worst moments. This movie also touches the heart of the story of love and the people around you ... there is also a great connection with the world around you with the vicinity of a personal island. this thing tells me i need ten lines to make a summary of a movie but i'm done this is all you get. Therefore, this movie is a 6.1 which is a great setup for any movie with a score like this. Take a look at requiem for a dream and the fountain .... equally good scores for our generation but overestimated
