I rented this movie without knowing what to expect, but WHOA I was a surprise! <br /> <br /> For anyone who, like me, waited for a good movie that combined horror and sci fi, it's time to Verheug because the guard finally ended. Writing, acting, filming and directing - all the top. I hate to admit, but I actually cried at one point (when Dracula talked to the lame). Actually an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. The corridors of the ship provided the perfect haunting environment for this story and the actors really could bring their fears into life. And Coolio as a vampire .... very beautiful! <br /> <br /> Believe me .... as big as most of the movie was ... the end will bleed you away! I know this movie gets a lot of flack on this site for some reason, but I know NO of you have seen the end. Brilliant!
