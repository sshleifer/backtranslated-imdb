This is not a movie I would normally see at 2:30, but I came in and couldn't stop until it was over. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf has shown that he is not only a young actor here, but can handle more demanding roles. The fact that he was handed over those roles over the past two years is proof of his ability. <br /> <br /> It was really his movie. Sure, there were others involved, but they were pale compared to his role. <br /> <br /> It was a time when gold was reserved for the privileged. This victory opened it to the masses, much like Tiger Woods opened golf for all races. <br /> <br /> As Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) told Lord Northcliffe (Peter Firth): "... if Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) wins tomorrow, it's because he is the best because of who he is. Not who his father was, not how much money he has, because of whom he is blood! And I will thank you remember that. " Get rid of it.
