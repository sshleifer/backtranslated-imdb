When I watched the last 2 episodes, I remember a TV addition from my childhood. It found the wild west, very dusty and dry, and there is a small salon, a man comes in the bar / salon, he is thirsty like hell, lips cracked, etc ... He just passed through the Nevada - desert walk and hasn I drank for days. He broke into the bartender. "Gimme a packet of potato chips. As he eats it, we can feel the thirst he gets, we hear a voice in the background and say," Keep building thirst, build it until you can't. hold it again ............. then it blows away with TEAM "The man drinks TEAM (a cool drink) It feels like a few dozen bags of potato chips. The thirst is so intense that I can Season 2 has even more twists and turns season 1. The end answers many questions, but asks a lot more questions, hopefully we will know the answer in season 3, but I doubt that I feel LOS momentum goes far beyond 3 seasons, if the people behind the camera keep up their good work. <br /> <br /> I will keep watching one. <br /> <br /> From Pakistan with Love
