Another fantastic movie by Catherine Breillat, this time about the trouble of shooting a sex scene in a movie. Use comedy? a new genre for Breillat ?? We get a background look at movie filming, but in documentary style. The character who plays the film of the film is based on Breillat. The sex scene in her previous film, A Ma Soeur, is considered the main teenage actress. But the movie, like all the Breillat's work, is not entertainment alone. It is praised by philosophical observations on the nature of sexuality, as well as a dedication to purity (as opposed to pornography) that is a cornerstone of Breillat's work and a commitment to true emotion. We see the director's character as the young main actor and actor to bring out the best in them, hypnotize them in the parts they need to play, which are part of themselves the director can see in them, but they cannot see in themselves until they reach the heights of acting they demand from them. She makes meaningful movies, not titillations, but she shows the work needed to produce them, and gives us insights into both the (definite French) film processing and the psychology of male ?? female sexuality.
