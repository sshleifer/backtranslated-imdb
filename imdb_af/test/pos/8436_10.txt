This film is definitely Fonda's best movie. The plot is wonderful, the acting is great, and the direction is wonderful. An all time classic, it had to have won the best picture kramer Vs. Kramer. Although not even nominated. Jack Lemmon and Micheal Douglas are also at their best. One of the best ends ever. If you haven't seen this movie, don't go to rent it. Must have been on the top 100 of Africa. See it not only for Fonda, but for everything. <br /> <br /> **** from **** 4 out of 4
