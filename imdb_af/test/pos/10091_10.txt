I have to say I'm an avid horror movie fan, and at present I can't get enough of strange horror. Since the US horror it's really too much at stake. <br /> <br /> This movie is fantastic. This movie reminds me a lot of M. Night's SIXTH SENSE. The way the movie was directed was wonderful. The director took his time to set everything up. It took about 40 minutes to compile the movie into a horror movie. I thought the movie was just a drama. This movie just builds up and the installment is not too much. <br /> <br /> I've never done it before, but that's the main reason I like the movie. I actually shouted out loud because one scene has only hell out of my fright ... which is kind of pathetic .... but for a movie to do it, it's great.
