I caught this movie right in my eye when I passed a squatter hall in nearby theater. The tagline was kind of confusing and immediately after reading it, I thought of the possibility that it was similar to the National Lampoon's Dorm Daze. I like the movie, apart from a huge collection of such genres, I decided to skip it to the theater for my exams for a thriller. <br /> <br /> Nice, I got out of the cheek to cheek and have an equal amount of laughs on bits and ends of the movie. Amanda Bynes certainly did better than Keira Knightley in Bend It Like Beckham. Being both a male and a female actor is definitely not that easy, especially with the similarities of life, along with the responses that the actress has to respond to. This movie requires a lot of confusion to confuse themselves and our viewers at the same time. The only way to pull it off is through this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the principal is sickly hilarious in a serious way, the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the actors. I would recommend this movie to anyone who needs a weekend break and don't worry, you will laugh throughout the film. This is a definite guarantee.
