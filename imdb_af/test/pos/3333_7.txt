"The Saint Takes Over" stars George Sanders as Simon Templar, also known as "The Saint" in this 1940s series in the series. It's also stars Wendy Barrie, Jonathan Hale and Paul Guilfoyle. On board a ship to the US, the Saint meets and tries to spend time with a wife (Wendy Barrie) who gives him the brush. Simon comes to New York to help inspector Fernack, now thoroughly discredited for a gangster framework; $ 50,000 was found in his home. The gangster, Rocky (Roland Drew), was of course found not guilty, and he and his fellow citizens paid the bill for the frame and attorney representation - $ 90,000 in total. Today you need to defend yourself against a parking ticket. It was a murder rap. <br /> <br /> Rocky sent his bodyguard, Pearly Gates (Guilfoyle) to the attorney's house to steal the $ 90,000 from the safe. The lawyer catches him reddish and sends him back to his boss with a message. Seconds later he died. Rocky meets a similar fate. And over and over - who kills this group of gangs? The Saint must get one of them to talk so that Fernack can be cleaned - can he come to someone before they are killed? The woman he met aboard the ship appeared again clearly and in the case. <br /> <br /> Few players have a line with a line like George Sanders, and his dry white, good looking, smooth voice and depth as an actor. fits Simon Templar perfectly. Paul Guilfoyle gives a bit of humor as the nervous, milk-drinking Pearly Gates, and Jonathan Hale is wonderful as the sometimes exaggerated but worried sick Inspector Fernack. Wendy Barrie, who appeared in many sacred episodes, is very good like the woman taking Simon's heart. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant.
