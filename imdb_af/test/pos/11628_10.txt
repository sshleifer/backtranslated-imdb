I saw this show when I was younger. It's a very good view to watch. It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old. Barney is definitely super DE duper. BJ is pretty funny. Baby Bop is very cute. The kids are also very cool. This show is about learning numbers such as sesame street, but different kinds of shows and characters like Barney the purple dinosaur, B.J. the yellow dinosaur with a baseball hat on his head, and Baby Bop the cute green dinosaur with a pink bow. The first one to start was a very old Barney and Friends show. But then the second was different from new episodes. Also the last in the 2000 was a new scene of Barney's park. They also have a show by Barney at Universal Studios in Florida, where you find Barney, B.J. and see Baby Bop, and when the show is finished, you play, shop and meet Barney. This is a great show, watch this show as you learn about many things that you will enjoy the movie and live show at Universal Studios Florida.
