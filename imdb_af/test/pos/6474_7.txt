Recently in Norway from Bergen, Norway, they stopped in the village of Voss, Norway, and there was a monument in honor of Knute Rockne who was born years ago in Voss. The people all know Knute to this day and tour guides are proud to stop at his monument. This film is a wonderful story of this great man and his great love for Notre Dame never realized that Knute had so many talents in chemistry and laboratory science and also taught chemistry for years and at the same time coaching the soccer team. Ronald Reagan plays the role of George Gipp (The Gipper) who was an excellent soccer player; Reagan played a short role, but played a major role in this role. Donald Crisp, (Father John Callahan) was excellent as a priest who always had good faith in Knute during his entire life in Notre Dame. This is a good Classic movie and will be viewed by many generations ahead. Enjoy.
