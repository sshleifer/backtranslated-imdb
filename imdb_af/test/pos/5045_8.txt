"Autumn Spring" tells of the misadventures of a brave, confronted walrus, 78 (about) year-old Czech man who indifferently populates and grooms everyone who knows him with his ominous ways, while his wife carefully plans her funeral. The center of Hana (Brodsk√Ω) shows us how to get babies to kiss you when you get 78 and how to get a feel in a lift and thank you, as he watches his warm and glowing look day by day. old age boasts one man's creative, amusing, but socially unacceptable ways to enjoy life while refusing to be seduced into the old people's home. "Autumn Spring" is a plodding, subtle comedy with messages for all ages that will have the biggest appeal with more mature foreign film buffs. (B +)
