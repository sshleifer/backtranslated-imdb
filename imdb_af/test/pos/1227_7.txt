Good, boring or bad? That's good. Do you value your money? If you can save it for a ticket, sure. Better than what the trailer looks like? Yes, weird. <br /> <br /> There's not much on the screenplay - Guards working at the armored truck company are cashing large amounts. Guards see the opportunity to retire as millionaires, one of whom is too honest to go with it and a well-planned plan goes to hell. <br /> <br /> It could have been a poorly executed Reservoir Dogs ripoff, but the cast of the cast and the director's ability to just make anything timely, pull it out of the realm and put it on a solid foot.
