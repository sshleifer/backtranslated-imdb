SPOILER NOTHING BUT SPOILER <br /> <br /> I need to add my name to the list of people who feel the other viewers don't. But no one even mentioned the "s" word as far as I saw. <br /> <br /> While I agree that the child died, I think we could be more specific: he committed suicide. He raced down the hill in an old wagon, shooting off the cliff and ... "flying away". Perhaps the whole account of the form of death is allegory or perhaps he commits suicide in a wagon as explained. Anyway, he flies away. (Don't be that hard). <br /> <br /> Maybe I just got one thing for Tom Hanks, but I was right with the story. In addition, he raises $ for the WW2 memorial and you must love him for it. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I loved the movie and found it moving incredibly.
