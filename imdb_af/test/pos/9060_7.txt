Not since "Harold and Maude" suicide has been used so successfully as the theme of a love story. The acting, with an upper part, is great. With a well-structured mini-dissertation, things are progressing with a pleasant fit. There are moments of black comedy, but I will classify "My Suicidal Sweetheart" as a unique romantic comedy, with a touch of dark humor. The relationship between two psychologically challenged lovers is both tempting and enticing. The movie actually asks you, what is a normal relationship? I recommend my "My suicidal sweetheart". Search it on DVD under the title "Crazy for Love". You won't be disappointed. - NOTE
