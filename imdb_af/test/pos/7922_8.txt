(Warning: spoilers! - Although it's hard to spoil this movie by telling story details.) <br /> <br /> Eisenstein's black and white propaganda movie isn't for everyone. It's very old and it's clawed. What makes it great for me is the soundtrack, not the original, but the updated soundtrack. Better still, the orchestra version Prokofiev created (my favorite show was by Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony). <br /> <br /> The movie is actually funny in places. This is reminiscent of the old "Midsummer Night's Dream". Some of the exteriors are very beautiful. Some of the actors are also very beautiful. (The actor who played Nevsky could have been a superstar today. It is definitely a rocker for the fighter, Vasilisa.) <br /> <br /> It can be the world's best collection, on film, of spicy Russian words (there are tons of them - they make up most of the spoken lines). <br /> <br /> The battle scenes actually look much more realistic than most high-budget Hollywood flixes. These guys are so clumsy with their battles as true farmers. The weapons seem nasty, so the actors probably tried to prevent them from actually injuring each other. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays the German "grand marshall" tries * very * hard to watch early in the movie, but he looks like he was really a pussycat. After being caught, he looks so pathetic. (Speak volumes about the intended audience, then?) A very humorous touch is that the German army brings an * organ * with it, played by a character in a black cloak. Watching the Russians bring this man off while playing. <br /> <br /> After the battle is over and almost all the Germans are dead, the best part of the movie (and the music) comes, sang the song to the dead soldiers who died to defend the motherland. This part is so sad it is almost an anti-war statement. <br /> <br /> Ten times as many men as ladies rated this movie. Wonder why? <br /> <br /> Warning: Joseph Stalin loves this movie. Ironically - he killed more Russians than anyone. "Those who come to Russia will wear a sword, will die by the sword."
