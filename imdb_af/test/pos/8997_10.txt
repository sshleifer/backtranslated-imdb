This movie made me a rugby and coach Larry Gelwix fan. The story's characters slipped and fell before they began to grow as they struggled with incredibly strong conflicts. It was understandable and completely credible. Like life, there were no easy answers to the problems they were all confronted with. Wonderful actors and an excellent script have brought this true story to life. I wish there were more movies like this one. Nowadays I look almost entirely worthy of true stories, as they are typically much more interesting than fiction. In addition, this one is inspiring and teaches us not to give up too quickly.
