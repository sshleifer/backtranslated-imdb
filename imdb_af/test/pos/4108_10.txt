I don't see so much error with this movie. Granted, the main singers can't be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can definitely carry a song. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I love to love their songs, especially "The world is a circle", "The things I will not miss" and "Ask me an answer". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is vague and that the snowy mountain styles seem to be made of plastic. I do not agree. I've seen snow powder before and the snow in the mountains has seen me realistically. And above all, in defense of this movie, it is suitable for a family audience (at least I remember it when I saw it on Christmas day a few years ago.) I find it refreshing to note that this film deserves its G rating. And they don't say that naughty "F" words every ten minutes like some movies I've seen. Thank God. Although this movie may not be everyone's cup of tea, it does have some value and I give it ten points out of a possible ten. That's my story and I like it.
