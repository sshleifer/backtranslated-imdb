I have to admit that I like this movie a lot more than I expected. Will Smith has that clean cut charm that you can only help but love it. The plot was a small sting on basic romantic comedy stuff, reminiscent of Jane Austen's "Emma". This old Kevin James has a true flair for comic timing and physical comedy. I've never seen his TV show, but he's played very well in this role. Amber Valletta was good enough. I can't remember why she was a rich celebrity in this movie, but if she were an actress or model, then the decisive thing might have gone wrong. I enjoyed Julie Ann Emery and wish she had a bigger part. But, saving the best, Eva Mendes more or less stole the show. Her beauty and charm, and just the right amount of standoffishness, put me on the screen when she was there. I hope to see more of her in the future. This movie is definitely worth checking out.
