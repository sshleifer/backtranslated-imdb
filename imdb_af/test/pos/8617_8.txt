This film was very interesting to me, almost a movie in a movie, which deals with a very whimsical director who convinces an actress and actor (who do not dislike each other) to make sexual chemistry on film. The director is confronted with a fusillade of stumbling blocks as she tries to excel at the two individuals on film. Sex is Comedy is much more than a comedy, packed with awkward impressive moments. The film also addresses the psychological and innate instinctual behavior of men and women in connection with the sometimes controversial sexual act. I loved this movie, the character Jeanne played by the beautiful Anne Parillaud plays wonderfully on the screen as you share in her struggle to produce filmmaking.
