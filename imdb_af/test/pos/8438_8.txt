I recently rented "The China Syndrome", mainly because I read that it was this movie that inspired ABC to make "The Day After". However, "syndrome" is more of a thrill than a drama. The movie is fairly political, but I strongly agree with its message - nuclear power, though extremely effective, is far too dangerous for general use. The risks are simply too high. Hopefully, the people in charge of real-life plants are much more responsible and ethical than those portrayed in the film. However, as the actual near disaster at Three Mile Island took place a few months after the release of the film, it puts the question. (In fairness the case is probably more of incompetence than of corruption.) Syndrome is not only critical of nuclear power, but also of modern news media, similar to the "Network", much more serious. I myself am a printed journalist, and I am very familiar with how people observe the media. but it was a little scary to see that even in the 70's TV news had already been sold. When Jane Fonda's character tries to convince her boss to leave her real news instead of fluff, she is advised not to try the change, as "research" finds people prefer a pretty girl to do fluff, not difficult news. <Br /> <br /> What really makes the movie unforgettable, however, is the incredible tension generated in its final third. During this period, the viewer constantly fears the lives of the protagonists, whether the danger comes from hired thugs or the potential collapse of the nuclear plant. And the last scene - of course I won't give it away, but it will guess you. <br /> <br /> On a final note, I got a clear sense of watching the movie that looked like times more like a TV movie than a real movie. However, this may be more due to the fact that the rental band I watched was rather old and not formatted to fit TV screens as the videos and DVDs are today.
