It was absolutely one of the best movies I saw. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances of a wonderful A-Lys roll that move you from smile to laughter for tears and back. <br /> <br /> I couldn't help but care about the characters. Mrs. Merkerson will blow you away, just as the young man will play the young lead. <br /> <br /> I also thought the set design was the best rate. The viewer is really placed in every era as it is presented. <br /> <br /> The music is also an explosion. Nice choices to suggest mood, time and place. The blind blues man is stereotypical, but he does produce some good songs. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful story that survives many repetitive views. Take the time to see it!
