This new Child's Play series installment doesn't have one scary scene, but tons of hilarious jokes like a chucky stoner give him the finger and say "rude f-king" and many references to the series: " I come back. I always come back. "The film's title was probably thought before the script and was written about it. It's completely different from all other movies in the series. It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones. Chucky seems to interfere with characters from another movie, a soap opera about two teenagers walking together to marry. There is a cool, extremely comprehensive image of death that flushes broken glass and water everywhere. The movie is very good, very funny, and has pop culture references from Martha Stewert to Jerry Springer. Don't see this one before you see the other three. This will really destroy the effect, as the first one is really scary. Very guilty fun and fun. <br /> <br />
