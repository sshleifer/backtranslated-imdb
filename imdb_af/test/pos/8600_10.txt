In light of the recent typhoon that hit the country hard (that is Typhoon Ondoy), I thought it was up to me to re-write "Black Rain" (1988, Japan), Shohei Imamura's haunting black-and-white masterpiece the destruction and consequences of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima at the end of World War II. The destruction and impact of both catastrophes (war and typhoon) may differ in grade and quality, but the trauma and scar (physical and psychological) is still there. <br /> <br /> It's proof of a movie's power that its images remain as strong and indelible as they did when they first saw it. It's just that the difference now, in my case, is that looking at those images has a greater sense of poignancy and strength due to a first-hand experience of a near-monumental weather calamity. There is a sense of kinship, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Imamura has always been one of my favorite Japanese filmmakers. His films are always a pleasure to watch because of their anarchy, sensuality and kindness: "The Pornographers: Introduction to Anthropology" (1966), "Eijanaika" (1981), Warmwater Under a Red Bridge (2001) Palme d "Or winners" Ballad of Narayama "(1983) and" The Eel "(1997), to name some. Given the mood of his films, who would have thought he once served as assistant director to Yasujiro Ozu, the Japanese theater's toughest and minimalist filmmaker? But then it is Ozu's strict formality and household that Imamura was rebellious. <br /> <br /> But with "Black Rain" one can unmistakably recognize Ozu's imprints. The father (or the father figure) is planning to see his daughter marry before the time goes out on both of them and the silence and calm of the scenes with all the members of the family (especially dinner or in Ozu's movie lexicon, the tatami) is something the venerable master film producer will constantly explore in his works ("Tokyo Story", "Late Spring"). In essence, the overwhelming and deliberate quality of Black Rain is a remarkable contrast to the bacchanal chaos and instinctive drive of Imamura's entire filmography. <br /> <br /> It should not, however, say that the movie is being watched. would not be a totally disturbing experience. "Black Rain", as appropriately described by American film reviewer Leonard Maltin, is "filled with haunting black and white images." In the first 15 minutes of the film, Imamura draws no punches to see the immediate and graphic horrors of the nuclear bomb, one after the other (stiff-burned bodies, flesh hanging, dead, fires and debris everywhere, madness). An assault on the viewer's senses, it certainly, along with Takashi Kawamata's sombre b / w photography (he has the lint in Yoshitaru Nomura's crime drama "The Incident") and Toru Takemitsu's cold score (he has the music such classic Akira Kurosawa's "Ran" and Masahiro Shinoda's "Double Suicide". <br /> <br /> Even during the movie's supposed "quiet" phase (it's five years after the atomic bombing), one can never have a sense of satisfaction and order, with the anxiety and pain that still feeling strong. by the survivors, not only in terms of physical health, but more so in terms of psychological trauma and social stigma. The human race, now undeniable, is destined to carry the legacy of the bomb as long as it lives. <br /> <br /> Years ago, I wrote a piece about Black Rain (uploaded in IMDb.com), but only compared to Volker Schlondorff's beautiful Tin Drum, another film about the monumental human folly trade. global catastrophe. In addition, it was never my practice to write twice about a movie I have previously written. This is in view of the recent weather disaster that has ruined our country that I have been asked to visit again and write something about this remarkable Imamura movie because there are a wealth of lessons to be learned from both the film as the recent event regarding the imperfections and dangers of scientific knowledge and action and the long-term scars and wounds caused by wide-scale destruction (or human or nature-induced). <br /> <br /> There were a number of films dealing with core holocaust and destruction ("Testament", "Threads", "The War Game", each in their own respective countries), and "Black Rain" are among them, if not more, for both its unapologetic and gloomy depiction of individual and common disintegration caused by atomic destruction and the fact that it has a historical event as basis. <br /> <br /> A few weeks from now, another Hollywood Hollywood movie, Roland Emmerich's "2012" will eventually hit (no pun intended) the big screen. As we all know, these American directors' bunch of "disaster / apocalypse" films - "Independence Day", "Godzilla", "The Day After Tomorrow" - is no other purpose than just being an entertainment value. insight into the nature and wisdom of apocalyptic disasters and the human condition affected. I wonder how this "gigantic" movie will exploit the trauma, disorientation and anxiety experienced by our people due to the recent weather disaster. To say that this movie is a precautionary story will probably be no more than an overstatement. <br /> <br /> Yes, I'll still watch "2012".
