Here in Germany, King of Queens has a great cult status! Almost every teenager (and adult) looks at this sitcom. It's really fantastic !! Better than the other terrible American sitcoms like "Full House" or "Set by Step" (the only series, which is still OK, is "Al Bundy"). There was no Amercian sitcom in Europe that was as effective as this really funny show !! Kevin James and Leah Remini as Doug & Carrie Haffernan are the craziest couple I know, Jerry Stiller as Arthur is the funniest grandfather I know, and Victor Williams and especially Patton Oswalt as Deacon & Spence are the most different, but funny guys who I know. I watch it as often as I can, and I still don't have enough good humor!
