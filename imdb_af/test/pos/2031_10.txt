If you like the 80's rock, you should definitely see this movie! I just saw it and fell in love! <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very entertaining, offering you a great load of music and not a single second of the movie. find boring! It was a good idea that some of the real musicians were here and doing what they did best. I was pleased to see Zakk, as well as Blas Elias, all of whom made solid performances. I tend to say with many people that the first half of the movie was much better than the second one, especially according to the writing. It could have been a little better, but not a big biggie. One thing that bothered me a bit was Jennifer Aniston's performance. I thought she wasn't the right person for this role, I just couldn't see her as a rock star girl. But as the movie goes on, you realize somehow she did a good job with it. There is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity that she delivers, which does not just lend you cold. <br /> <br /> Taking a good and a funny movie, not in characters, but giving you great fun, a sense of nostalgia and of course the powerful vocals by Jeff Scott Soto and Mike Matijevic!
