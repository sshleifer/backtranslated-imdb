This is an excellent, little-known movie. Tom Selleck does an excellent job in this movie, featuring Japanese 'Clint Eastwood'. I would like to see if this movie was still on DVD, but there are some places that are clearly cut. Hiroku (Tom's love interest) clearly cut down parts. It would be interesting to see more of Japan in the movie. The baseball order is by far the most realistic of any baseball movie. I'm sure most of the actors were current or former baseball players. I like to download the tape of this movie at least once a year. The best scenes include the lack of hat attack after Tom weaned in the big game, and an intensely sensual Tom's hot-bath with Hiroku. Dennis Haysbert also does a good job, it is good to see he finally gets some recognition, not just in baseball movies (he was also in Major League).
