I just watched the 100 bottom movies according to IMDb users to see if there was something to review what I didn't have and I found this little screen jewel. One of the occasions when you consider a movie to be one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few who really likes it. Darn, well, I think I will mock and spit on this, but for me it was a good movie when I saw it. It was a while, however, I remember coming to HBO late in the morning and I watched it two or three times and I didn't really see it and I'd love to see it again, as Jolie knew has. The story follows a cyborg and a man trying to escape the clutches of this corporation and a few bounty hunters to them. I think it's basically all there is, throw a few scenes with Jack Palance and we have our movie. Some good action here and there, and also blood and violence. There is also a love story at stake, as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fall in love with each other. Sometimes the dialogue gets bad and it is by no means a top film, but for a b-movie it's really good. I don't know if it was a theatrical release, because it doesn't look that high enough for it, but it makes it one of the better direct videos when it's one of those.
