Like Margot in 'Fear of Fear', the victim of her ambitious man, like Fox in Fox and his friends, is suicide by his boyfriend who has driven all his money away, like Xaverl Bolwieser in 'The Stationsmaster's Wife' prison for his fraudster give him the chance to get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann who is looking for shelter in madness to flee his stupid wife and bankrupt company. Hans Epp is also a victim of the German Wirtschaftswunder Society. after World War II in RW Fassbinder's "The Merchant of the Four Seasons". From the fact that Fassbinder has played through social abuse between men and women as well as between heterosexuals and couples, it must be clear that he does not benefit from any section. <br /> <br /> In Hans Epp's case there are the women who enter into despair, illness and eventually death. When he returned from the Foreign Legion where he had flown because he could no longer stand the pressure of his mother, she complained that he was still alive while the neighbor's good son was killed. Then he gets a job as a policeman, but is surprised by his foreman while being deceived by a prostitute. After losing his job, he works as a fruit trader with little income, and goes from backyard to backyard to "exclaim" his products. His mother, one of his sisters and her husband, were ashamed to have such a "street worker" in their family. "The love of his life" (she has no name in the movie) refuses to marry him because his work does not fit her social status and origin. So he married Irmgard who he didn't love and who didn't love him. From her constant pressure on him he flies in the drink. One evening, after his wife hit him, he exploded and hit her. She fled to her family for which this opportunity was just what they were waiting for. When Irmgard calls a divorce lawyer, Hans suffers from a heart attack. Imrgard decides to stay with him, but from now on he can no longer do heavy work and drink alcohol. He therefore begins to feel more and more redundant, becomes more rigid and quieter and more and more depressed. If he finds out that Irmgard is cheating him, he decides to end his life, but not like Hermann Hermann by having a journey in the face of madness, but he is drinking himself before Imrgard, their daughter and his boozing friends. Fassbinder said in an interview that Hans knew what he had done. The question, however, is: Did Hans kill himself because he could no longer perform his unfortunate environment, or did he himself make justice?
