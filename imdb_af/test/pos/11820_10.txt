Very nice movie! I was watching the channels on my TV and I usually ignore the channels that air drama movies, but then I saw this channel that aired old school movies and that is where I saw this movie. Only when I saw the title "The Cure" I thought it would be boring, but when I saw Brad Renfro in this movie, I had a favorite movie of all time, "The Client" where Brad also starred ). Then the screens got better and better. The story is so beautiful and very enjoyable! I cried loudly in this movie I don't usually do. Great decisive! and there are so many beautiful lines / quotes in this movie that are very conspicuous and make me cry hard! Now I bought my own copy on DVD and I always recommend it to everyone!
