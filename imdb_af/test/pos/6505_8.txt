Scratch is a documentary about DJs and their art of scratching. From the one line description of the movie you would have no idea how entertaining and educating this little movie is. It is a joyous and lively celebration of a little-known subculture. It's filled with good underground hip hop music and you see some top DJs (eg DJ Q-Bert, DJ Shadow, and Mix Master Mike of the Beastie Boys). In the film I was not sure that 'scratch' could really be called an art form, or that the turntable could be regarded as an instrument in its own right. Scratches completely changed my mind on these points. What these guys do with their turntables is really great - it's definitely a kind of art - and the turntable, if you know how to use it, can be turned into a tool you can play, as much as a drum or guitar. And you even get a lesson on the basics of DJ Q-Bert's crab (eg how to use the fader to get different sound effects). All these DJs in their own way were inspired to take the art of scratching after watching Herbie Hancock's song Rock It (you remember that song or not?) Live at the Grammys. What got their attention was not Hancock himself, but his DJ and she scratched. Not only is Scratch scraping, but it does scrape a bit of its own thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is shot and edited. There are moments where cuts are quickly rewound and then transmitted a few times, which is mirrored (in the film medium) which happens when a DJ quickly moves the record on his turntable while he is using his father. wicka-wicka "sound. Whether you are a fan of hip hop or not, you can count on Scrat to give you a very enjoyable night at the movie. After I saw it, I had an itch to buy a turntable myself, and I mean it as a compliment.
