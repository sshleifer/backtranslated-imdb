If you watched this movie for the nudity (as I did), you won't be disappointed. I could have done crooks or the bear without the bumbling. Some bottomless nudity could be shown, but for what it was, I think H.O.T.S. must be the best of his genre. <br /> <br /> It's not the kind of movie that could be made today, which is a pity, because it's the kind of movie that is worth watching at these times. <<br /> <br /> It is a pity that the DVD has no extras, but since it did not have DVDs, it had a spectacular nudity. is filmed which is understandable. I would have liked to know more about the shooting of the movie, especially when they shot the soccer game at the end.
