It's definitely an excellent show. I didn't have cable, so I started renting them because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know who's who, that kind of thing. But it wasn't. It is surprisingly deep. It's also very funny. It moves at a very fast pace, and more and more jokes you catch every time you see it. It's a comedy drama that's scarce if it's done well. It's about Rory and Lorelai's relationship. Instead of the classic mother-daughter relationship, it's a story of the best friend relationship - about a mother and daughter. The characters are thrown perfectly and everyone does a great job. This is definitely the best TV show I've ever experienced.
