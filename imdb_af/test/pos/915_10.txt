Most of Kieslowski's movies look like puzzles to me, meant to expand mind and soul. The characters are not very credible, are idealized, are schematic. Nonetheless, the way in which Kieslowski offers their winding ways through life, their intricate interaction with others, with the universe, with coincidence or fate, let me understand faith, make me believe in God. That at one time or another it has a meaning, if not for me, then definitely for someone. Trois couleurs and especially Rouge come closer to making me feel, feeling, experiencing the truth, the "meaning" than perhaps any of his films. The only problem exploring the paths of the "puzzles" is a bit too similar to his other movies and at one point it becomes somewhat predictable. There is still much joy to be here. It's like a well-known wine brand - you know what to expect and deliver, sometimes with a new-found bouquet that can come from aging - either wine or yourself.
