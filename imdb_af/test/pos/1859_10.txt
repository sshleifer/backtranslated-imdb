I read reviews of this movie that found it "disappointing" and "confused". I have a loss to understand why this should be so. From the beginning I watched it a remarkable experience and a complete joy to see. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The opening titles cover a beautiful visual of the evolutionary process, introducing the story to a tranquil and versatile style. The film isn't about the process itself, but it's about Charles Darwin's struggle with his conscience, his love for his wife, his late daughter and his quest for the truth. <br /> <br /> The appearance of his daughter is the manifestation of a tormented thought that knows it killed God. The daughter is an adult and makes adult comments about his work and personal tarturing Darwin. Was he somehow responsible for her death? Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly really do great performances like Charles and Emma Darwin, just like Martha West and Annie. Bettany's size and awkward gait give Darwin's character a real sense of reality, while Connelly feels very comfortable with her English accent and sometimes a little awful persona. <br /> <br /> It is easy to misunderstand the times this movie is living. The grip that religion had on society and the inner struggle that a man like Darwin had to endure to seek the truth in what he saw. Science and religion have always been awkward bedspreads and although it didn't cost him his life, science has a barrier between husband and wife, fact and faith, as it did with so many earlier men and women. This film portrays the obstacle extremely well. <br /> <br /> I give Creation ten stars because I think it is beautiful, deep, wonderfully well-behaved and a real, non-weird-freaky look at one of the world's true geniuses. <br /> <br /> What looks obvious to everyone today (well, almost everyone ... see Bill Maher's wonderful "Divine") hidden for millennia. The truth, once discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many. Creation examines that pain and realizes that we are all who own us. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie experience.
