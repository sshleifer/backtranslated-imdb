This enjoyable Euro-Western starts with a scene that predicts a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for "Once Upon A Time in the West", but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear. Three tough gunfighters drive in a village. One is dressed like the man with no name in a poncho. Another is like Colonel Mortimer dressed in a few more bucks, and the third is like Django, except he drives a horse instead of pulling a coffin behind him with a machine gun. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a cart loaded with three coffins. "Any gun can play" is a spaghetti western with an in-joke on spaghetti westerns, as the hero here erases the three killers. Aside from a little too much comedy, especially in the acrobatics, it is a top average oater. <br /> <br /> The notorious Mexican ban Montero (Gilbert Roland of "Barbarosa") and his gang of trigger-happy pistoleros rob an army train carrying $ 300 thousand dollars in gold coins across the border. Director Enzo G. Castellari of "Inglorious Bastards" leads the likes of a variety of camera angles that put you in the forefront of the action. The convicts grab the locomotive with the gold-carrying coach and separate it from the rest of the train that the US cavalry houses. While Montero and his armed men jammed the Cavalry, Pajondo (Pedro Sanchez of Sabata) ordered the locomotive, killed the engineer and his crew and rolled it away and left the other pistols. In essence, Pajondo double crosses Montero and steals the gold for himself. Later Montero arrives with Pajondo at the Rio Grande. Before the bandit can reveal the booty to Montero, a Cavalier painter shoots Pajondo dead. Before he dies, Pajondo tells Montero about a medal that serves as a clue as to where he hit the treasure. The irate Cavalry captain (Ivano Staccioli of "Commandos") stops Montero, but he can't loosen the bandit's tongue, even after using his whip on him. The captain threatens to have the Mexican shot if he doesn't speak. Meanwhile, the prison guards had a priest talk to Montero, but he was not really a priest. The six-gun to Stranger (George Hilton of "The Ruthless Four") masquerades as a man of the cloth and saves Montero from a firebox. Unfortunately, before Montero is saved, Clayton (Edd Byrnes of the TV's 77 Sunset Strip) takes the medal away from him and holds it for himself. Clayton is the bank representative sent to protect the gold. He is shocked that Captain Montero wants to shoot. Clayton's career at the bank depends on his ability to recover the gold. The alien puts a fire at the fort to divert the coach and Montero takes the Captain as hostage and tries to escape, but the alien shoots him off the horse. Before the authorities can verify that Montero is dead, the alien claims the body for the attractive reward he will receive and he goes out with the Captain's gracious thanks. Not soon, they left the fort when Montero's men arrived to rescue him from the alien. From this point on, the Stranger, Montero and Clayton create short-term alliances while looking for the gold. Castellari and scenic Tito Carpi, who wrote a number of Spaghetti Westerns, like a few dollars for Django, and another Castellari oater, Seven Winchesters for a massacre, rely on clever humor and surprises reversed to the action to keep fresh and fast. rate. One cool scene put Clayton at a table to eat his meal when he heard behind his suspicious sounds. Clayton throws his liquor on the table and sees the armed men behind him with stuffed six guns. <br /> <br /> "Any Gun Can Play" lives up to its title. In fact, many guns play, and at least twenty or more corpses fall before being dropped. These westerns are not so much a parody, as it is a hit by Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly." Remember, bad guys and good guys fall into a building line as often as ten, but their deaths are not portrayed in the brutal way of a Leone western. "Any gun can play" doesn't take him as seriously as the Leone masterpiece mentioned above. The three lead jockey back and forth for rule. Each one has a piece of the puzzle that will lead them to the treasure, but they refuse to share their information to the shoot-up final. Lenser Giovanni Bergamini's colorful widescreen photography is spectacular, especially the opening shots of the train winding along track paths, with distant mountain peaks that dramatically enhance the backdrop. Another big shot takes place when Montero tests the stranger's unstoppable calm. This scene happens after the alien Montero rescued and the Mexican minions come to save their chief's bacon. Montero aims to confront the alien's six-gun, and strives for the poncho-clad hard man and throws out the turret and places his well-targeted bullets harmlessly in and around the unsteady rifles. Bergamini, who photographed Castellari's Second World War thriller "Inglorious Bastards", rattles the scene with the Alien in the background and his pistol in Montero's hand in the forefront for a pleasant three-dimensional style shot. Meanwhile, Francesco De Masi's lively orchestral soundtrack is unforgettable for his own idiosyncratic melodies. Ennio Morricone's soundtracks were for the Leone Westerns. The opening song is reminiscent of a 1950's Hollywood western with its catchy lyrics and guitar riffs. Although not a great spaghetti western, "Any Gun Can Play" is always entertaining nonsense with interesting plots and good performances, especially the insatiable Gilbert Roland, who was 62 at the time!
