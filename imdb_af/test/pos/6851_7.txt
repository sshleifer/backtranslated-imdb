More from a nearby than a flop, MR. IMPERIUM star Ezio Pinza as Alex, a small European nation writer, fell in love with a willing American actress and entertainer, Fredda Barlo (Lana Turner), but as a result of Alex's clever prime minister. King, played by Cedric Hardwicke, separates lovers for 12 years before reuniting them in Palm Springs, where their love is revived. Director Don Hartman, who also writes, cannot fully exploit his talent for a funny dialogue because of Pinza's provisional English usage. The requirement rewritten, along with the overall report in evidence between the two stars, led to a somewhat turbulent tone to the screenplay, aggravated by the studio's unparalleled cut of many scenes, leading to a confusing end. The overwhelming Pinza dominates his scenes with Turner, but both performs with good work, while Marjorie Main is impressive with her paternal effects as written. Debbie Reynolds is on the right track by Louis B. Mayer for Singin 'In the Rain because of her quick performance here; only Barry Sullivan is heavily victimized by the flagrant cut. The film was filmed largely in Pebble Beach, California and other Monterey County. The film is equipped with Pinza's iron-strong operational basso in Solamente Una Vez, as well as with original songs by Harold Arlen and Dorothy Fields, with Douglas Shearer handling the sound wonderfully recording and knowledge of the fine decorations by Edwin Willis and the effective costume designs by Walter Plunkett.
