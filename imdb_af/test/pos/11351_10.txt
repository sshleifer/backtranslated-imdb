I will not carry you with story and plot lines, as it has already been presented on this page, so? It's time to come since I saw such a movie. Beautiful, elegant and well-kept, with a narrative fit to match. A film with sensitivity and underestimated properties is scarce in these times of clich√©d plots. The beautifully muted photography, saturated in rich, luxurious colors, and the lack of better words, fills every frame with a tension arrow. The settings and locations are repeatedly used, but the movie can breathe new life into them every time they appear. There always seems to be a key stick, light fixture or a piece to show the audience a little where we are in the characters world. <br /> <br /> The play reminds me of "The Bicycle Thief", not the style, but the fact that you forget to watch two actors involved in their craft. There is meaning behind every gesture and almost every movement has given meaning to explain the inner world of the characters, the relationship, the feelings and the situation of the two lovers. The dialogue is sparse, but the meaning of the rest of the movie is significant. Talk about meaning, the soundtrack is contagious. Here it becomes a storytelling device. And although the film is of Chinese origin, even a song sung by Nat King Cole in Spanish gives the film a subtle meaning. The orchestrated soundtrack is repetitive, but the repetition makes it comfortable. It is used in conjunction with the story, and not just a way to set music to action, or to call the audience to feel a certain way on a certain plot. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie. For everyone, I fear that most people will be scattered through the calm flow of the story, but I would recommend it to someone looking for an alternative to the romantic shock that fills the multiplexes on our side of the world. I have to say I was completely taken by this movie, and I watched it night after night. The story takes time to present itself and carries repetitive views, as very few movies in this genre are open to such a broad interpretation. A very beautiful movie.
