Dutiful wife Norma Shearer (like Katherine "Kitty" Brown) is waiting for man Rod La Rocque (as Bob Brown) hand and foot. While he was having breakfast in bed and helping him dress up for a Sunday golfing trip, Mrs. Shearer before joining Mr. La Rocque joins, noting how rarely the two see each other. But La Rocque dismissed her and said her presence was detrimental to his play. Then, unexpectedly, does Shearer meet the true reason for her husband's regular absence? his pretty blonde mistress! <br /> <br /> Three years later, Shearer is a glamorous and flirtatious divorce. During summer in Paris, she met a friendship with rich, older social Marie Dressler (such as "Boucci" Bouccicault). Me. Dressler invites Shearer to her Long Island home, socializing with friends and asking for a favor. Dressler is worried about her granddaughter's relationship with a suave, worldly man. She wants young Sally Eilers (as Dionne) to marry Raymond Hackett (as Bruce). Aware of Shearer's flirtatious victories, Dressler asks her to pull the unwanted man away from me. Eilers. Shearer is amazed to discover the man is La Rocque, her former husband. <br /> <br /> Shearer and Dressler make this a fun, entertaining game. They are in the best shape, with guaranteed-to-popular performances, with enthusiasm and professionalism. The story is stupid and predictable; Still, in a way that helps the humorous situation. And the end is pretty clever. In fact, the cartoon "Let Us Gay" may have been better than Shearer's greater production, and more seriously, "The Divorcee", which was released about the same time. It pours uniformly well. La Rocque is better than his film with Lilian Gish; but its role is not at all special. Gilbert Emery (as Towney) and Tyrell Davis (as Wallace) are funny fans. <br /> <br /> Those who are not familiar with Norma Shearer cannot realize it is she who looks like the dowdy woman in the opening styles. This is Shearer as "Kitty" for her makeover. Look at Shearer's close-ups with light, natural makeup, for a good look at an intriguingly beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> Let us be Gay (1930) Robert Z.
