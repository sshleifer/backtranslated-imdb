One should not be too critical of the director's second feature. <br /> <br /> I really like Madiba's camera work. Like Mr. Shawn pointed out, he had a unique way of looking at things. <br /> <br /> But how does a 14-year-old boy get on such beautiful images? Remember, he has no training of any kind. I don't think English is the common tongue in Cape Town ghettos. Worse still, Madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14. <br /> <br /> Any way, if you overcome the above peculiarities, you can see the movie and still enjoy good camera work.
