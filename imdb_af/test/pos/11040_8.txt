I loved the great lighting and was warmed by this story of the American working class association and sea life in the first half of the 20th century. I was drawn by the timeless viewability of this realistic show. see and feel the strength. melancholic "greek" comedy. Anyone in the mood for a shot with a beer back? ... or a little ginger? Hey, waterboy !!
