Don't know what movie or version Jeff saw, but this whole movie was great, not just Poitier and Going. The story was sounding, exciting and engaging. And for the guy who complains about historical accuracy, it really gets. Yes, there were a few black deputy officials in the Indian area, but they had no power to arrest Whites outside Indian territory. As a rule, they did not "patrol" but only used the criminals. I found it strange that Corby didn't have an "Indian friends". I know their numbers have been reduced, but it seems rather strange to me. Just as Corby returned to his people, she remained Indian cohorts, faceless and nameless.
