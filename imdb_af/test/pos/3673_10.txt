I absolutely love this movie! I never heard it when I saw it at the video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in it, so I thought it should be a bit worthwhile, you know? I watched it for the first time, just shaking my head. . . huh? Then it was the last scene and I got myself so hard to smile so loudly. I clicked "play movie" and looked at the whole thing again. This is without a doubt the most remarkable movie I've ever seen. But the more I see it, the more I love it. It's absurd and crazy and sweet and sweet. Kathy Bates is impeccable, but the rest of the cast is also fantastic. What strange characters they are all! The midget is just too funny for words. And Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow are hysterical. It's just a funny, fantastic movie. I urgently need to see it again. Whoever sees it for the first time, please keep it to the end. It is worth the effort!
