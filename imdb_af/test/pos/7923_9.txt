ALEXANDER NEVSKY is nothing but a big movie on a large scale. The film opens a window to a world and culture, most Americans will never become familiar with. And much was said and written about the film's thinly-covered patriotism in the face of the impending war with the German Nazis. <br /> <br /> At American standards, the play is a bit quiet. The script is short on words and great on visual and action. And while the action may be annoying, the footage is often beautiful. Direction is incredible. <br /> <br /> On another note, fans of Ralph Bakshi animation can see that he stole many of his visual photos for WIZARDS directly from a copy of ALEXANDER NEVSKY.
