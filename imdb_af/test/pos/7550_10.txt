Unfortunately, many big movies on IMDb like this one have "adjusted" their scores by IMDb. It is truly a fine and intriguing film by the ongoing director of Bonnie and Clyde, Little Big Man, Night Moves, Mickey One and The Chase. <br /> <br /> If you click in the user rating area, you'll see that the real median for four friends is 7.6. However, IMDb adjusted the rating to 6.4 (<br /> <br />). <br /> <br /> Per IMDb: "IMDb publishes weighted voice averages rather than raw data averages. Several filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce voice filling by individuals who are more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion on it .... The exact methods we use will not be disclosed, it must ensure that the policy remains effective. "In other words, we will not disclose our methods, so you cannot question how we came to the score! What a shame to see fine-minded films like Four Friends Prize is no better than lame formal comedies because of IMDb's "filters".
