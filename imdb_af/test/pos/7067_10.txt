I'm not American, but Meatballs still hit me. Maybe because it's a nice, nice movie. To see it again, made me sentimental for a time when I couldn't really put my finger on it and a place I couldn't remember. <br /> <br /> Meatballs are just a good movie. It reminds me of innocent days when nothing really matters and everything is possible. <br /> <br /> If you read it, you probably know what I mean. <br /> <br /> All I can say above what I've already said is that the Meatballs should still be nostalgic if you're American. <br /> <br /> I think you know what I mean by that.
