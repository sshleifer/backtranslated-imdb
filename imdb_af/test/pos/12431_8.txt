A beautiful woman, a backwoods, a gut monster, a super sweet monster truck, a way to kill the zombie brother and 2 friends. An anal retentive, too sensitive nerd and the other a dirty mouth, adolescent sob. Throw them all up with a little Jeepers Creepers, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Road Trip and you have Monster Man. A hilarious horror / comedy trip that never comes out to say anything. It's a simple, straightforward feast. Unpretentious and well-made, this horror / comedy is in his heart, a girlfriend. This film offers some hilarious and sickly sets. I recommend being terrorists who are looking for entertainment.
