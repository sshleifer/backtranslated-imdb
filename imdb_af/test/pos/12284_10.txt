Most Hollywood movies appear to be one of a few pre-formulated and highly predictable plots. This movie is not and is a perfect example of what I see for IFC. <br /> <br /> There's a guy, Michael, and his girlfriend left him out with a word. He wants to know what happened. Is she OK? Can he say goodbye? Maybe you get closure. He was unable to make contact with Grace and in an attempt to find her he made a film that asked you for help. <br /> <br /> Michael figures, we may need a reason to help him, so he revives us his story through his relationship with the help of a friend (Nadia) to play the role of Grace (The girl left) <br /> <br /> Hind sight is 20/20 and that is no different for Michael. By telling his story and getting feedback from his friends, he realized his mistakes and how much he appreciated what he had lost. Unfortunately, it is a lesson that we all had to learn (or learn) and are easy to identify. That's what makes you want to hear more about Michael's story and want to know if he finds Grace.
