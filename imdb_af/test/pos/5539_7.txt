If you're looking for a not-so-serious mob movie, with a woman as the head, you're in the right place. Pfieffer did much better with it. You can see she has grown beyond this picture. <br /> <br /> When I first picked up this movie, I expected Pfeiffer to be badly mistaken, but she played her girlfriend role. Not a bad show from Baldwin. <br /> <br /> If you don't pay attention to the hair, you can enjoy this movie. But don't take it too seriously ...
