I loved this movie. Gloria Swanson, like Leila, is in a dusty marriage with a man who barely takes notice of her presence. (although he sees her absence). The film shows very well why she is tired of married life, and why she is susceptible to a lovely talkman, without making her selfish or demanding. Leila's reaction shots at dinner on her anniversary, while her working man (eating dinner again) eating seasoned shellfish with gusto and pushing bridal and bridal puppets from his plate, is perfect. <Br /> <br /> The show is stolen - and stolen effortlessly - by Elliott Dexter and Jim, Leila's negligent husband. After losing Leila to another man, Jim really cleans his action, shaves his mustache, works out to lose the middle-aged spread and tightens. There are several shots of Jim at home, lonely and thinking of Leila, including a powerful scene when he gets one of her old dresses in the closet. The film gives the audience the advantage of watching with Leila Jim's transformation. It is not only the exterior that is more attractive; We know much more about the kind of person Jim really is, and we see quite differently from Leila's second man, Schuyler (Lew Cody). Dexter shines as the front and back Jim, determined to discover Schuyler's true character, to win back Leila if he can. The film's most beautiful moment comes when Jim and Leila discover they are under the mistletoe, and Jim talks about what he has lost. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching.
