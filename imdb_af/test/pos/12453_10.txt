I saw most of the Tarzan episodes. Certainly the rated X with O'Keeffe & Bo Derek, which is totally unfortunate. <br /> <br /> I've seen this version several times since it was originally shown. <br /> <br /> All the cast had memorable parts, great acting monkeys. Last night I saw the same thing on the Spanish station and others as a French dialogue in Spanish. <br /> <br /> As far as Hudson doesn't want Andie's will, he didn't do anything to the end. He looked at the daily newspapers and could hire a dialogue coach. It seems stupid that a story about monkeys and a man raised by everyone is talking about Gibberish attacking Hudson Andie. This was the story in the movie. she was an American cousin. The last time I looked at was Carolina in the US. <br /> <br /> She was beautiful in film and her eyes, and beautiful hair, alabastic skin, all of us ground males. She didn't need Bo's level. <br /> <br /> She remained a LADY for the rest of her career and should consider this film (half her life ago) as the point of departure. Her performance, sincerity, made this film enjoyable, believable that a half-wild man could determine her inner beauty. <br /> <br /> Great steering wheel for Sir Richardson, he steals the movie.
