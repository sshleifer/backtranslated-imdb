With "Batman Returns", Tim Burton has become a major priority in the American movie. Three years after the most successful film of the year, "Batman" (1989), the hero of Gotham City comes back to the pleasure of many spectators. Like its predecessor, "Batman Returns" enjoys enormous commercial success. Tim Burton returned Batman, believing that the victory of the latter on his enemy did little to improve the image of Gotham City. In fact, violence and corruption still exist and here the second word is formulated by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the penguin (Danny De Vito). These two crooks who are eager to take control of Gotham City will make life difficult for Batman. His job will be more difficult with the appearance of Catwoman ... <br /> <br /> Tim Burton has done a lot of work on the landscape and he seems to be trying to fix the mistakes of the first movie. This means that the director made room for fighting better-mastered than in the first Batman. But he did not neglect the psychology of his main characters. As in the 1989 movie, Burton focused on Bruce Wayne / Batman's psychology, here it is the penguin that is of course interested in him. The director tried to make him, acted very well by De Vito's ambiguous character. On the one hand, he is full of bad intentions (previously quoted), but on the other hand he looks for his past and wants to be regarded as a real man. <br /> <br /> "Batman Returns" also appears to be smarter than its predecessor, especially with the throw. I think of Mich√®le Pfeiffer who offers a brave and powerful performance as Catwoman. In addition, at the moment I write this review, it reminds me that a new version of Catwoman is currently at the theater. But with the bad reviews (3 out of 10 on IMDb!), It is certain that her acting Halle Berry must shine in insignificance next to Pfeiffer. <br /> <br /> Eventually, this movie is one of the best prosecutions of 1992 and it can develop Tim Burton's peculiar style. We also find his taste for the strange and the Gothic. As for Batman's other screen adjustments, you can hit them. "Batman Forever" (1995) and "Batman and Robin" (1997) are not good. I heard that Christopher Nolan shot the start of the Batman story and it will be released next year. Will it correspond to Tim Burton's works?
