I can't believe there are people out there who don't like this movie! I thought it was the funniest movie I've ever seen. It's my b / c I'm Mel Brooks's biggest fan ... I know almost all the words and get very discouraged when they censor them when played on a family channel. :) this is one of my favorite movies, so I don't know why anyone else would agree! thanks Kristina
