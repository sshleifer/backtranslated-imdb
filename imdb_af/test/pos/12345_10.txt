This is my favorite horror movie, a second 2nd to 'Poltergeist'. I saw 'One Dark Night' when it first appeared in the theater in 1983 at the theater where I worked. <br /> <br /> I was born in 1963, so I have some love for '80s horror movies, despite them being a bit dated and the dialogue is not well written. What I thought was so original about the fact that the phenomenon of 'psychic vampirism' was not addressed (at least to my knowledge at that time) and is a very real phenomenon. <br /> <br /> I didn't "Don't worry if Adam West was in it (nothing against him, but his supporting role wasn't unforgettable), but thought Meg Tilly was decisive. The lesser-known Donald Hutton (from 'Brainstorm' and 'Invaders From Mars') as an ambiguous scientist who has been studying Ramar's abilities has unfortunately been overlooked. As a gay man, I paid more attention to David Mason Daniels, Meg Tilly's unlucky but beautiful boyfriend. He now sells real estate in Texas. <br /> <br /> I felt the movie "realistic" in two ways: Raymar, who was discovered to kill 6 girls in his surrealistic apartment, had a funeral that was small and not just He was secretive, a hermit, but a murderer. As you know, these species are buried without fanfare. Second, if corpses were telekinetic, they would move, drag their feet. The filmmakers could have been shocking, moaning, arms stretched zombies, but opting for what would be credible. Kudos! The sober electric discharge of Ramar's eyes at his jail (as he oversees his kingdom of the dead) throws a terrible magenta light into the mausoleum that will stay with you for years! If you've ever gone to a mausoleum, even on a sunny day, you'll notice that they have their own rosetta lighting due to stained glass windows. Don't start me on the hollow silence. Even Ramar looked like someone who could succeed as an eccentric, distorted old man. The score was one-of-a-kind and memorable, and I kick myself because I didn't get it on the cassette when it first came out. The track shooting was done where it was supposed to be. I especially said the meticulously planned features of each body: the bride, the badly decomposed child who still holds his teddy bear, the grandmother, the long thin black man and half the World War II veterinarian, and the green eyes elderly gent , who was the first to greet the Sisters clique initiators. Even bodies can be good actors, I think. The only thing I had to complain about was the arm that came out of one of the cellars and choked Julie's boyfriend. It couldn't be possible unless a body was in the stomach and feet, but why? It has also become a bit fresh. <br /> <br /> The movie begins ominously with the fact that we never see Ramar's face (until the last quarter of the film, which is like a birthday present unpopular) girl careers in his daughter's psychological flash. We then see that coroners move their body away in his one-bedroom apartment, where we see that he is experimenting with his telekinetic craft by moving his dishes into his wall. The rest is not going, because the Heesters-like Sisters group is closing in July for a final launch by spending the night in the mausoleum, but it is a well-placed buildup to the emerging horror later. The movie is not bloody in any sense. The weirdest part is when Ramar's daughter uses a compact mirror to give his power back to him, and he then bubbles bubbles. I've always felt that a power like Ramar can never die and a successor might be worth watching. I can see it now: One Dark Night II: In The Tomb. But let's face it. That movie alone. I heard the movie had other titles, but the original fit. <br /> <br /> A remake would be senseless. But if there was one, I would write better dialogue and extend some scenes, such as showing the studies on Ramar's abilities in the lab, rather than hearing it on a tape recorder. In this information age, such something would be well documented on DVD. And more corpses! Why just raise one in the mausoleum when Ramar's power can also spread to the cemetery? Let's just say I hate being one of the people who had to clean up the mess at the end of the climax; something that can also be shown. I think one of the initiating Sisters recognizes one of the bodies because a family member would have a few good things if it were disturbing. With CG effects, some amazing scenes with Ramar animated remains will be off the wall! <br /> <br /> Say what you want, "One Dark Night," but it has everything. So see at least once in your life ... or death!
