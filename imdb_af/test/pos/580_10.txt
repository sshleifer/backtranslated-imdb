It's a movie that will brighten your day. Kermit the Frog, is just an ordinary frog in his swamp, when a talent agent stops and tells him that Hollywood is looking for frogs to be in film (lol). On the way, Kermit meets Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, Gonzo and his chicken Camilla, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. But Kermit also owns a restaurant chain, Doc Hoppers French Fried Frog Legs. All the things being considered make Kermit and the Muppets Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended for everyone, young and old. <br /> <br /> It has some great musical numbers like "The Rainbow Connection," I'm Going To Go Someday, "and" Movin Right Along. "The Muppets also use many modes of transport in this movie. driving a bike, Fozzie driving a Studebaker, and another car, Gonzo fleeing with a bundle of helium balloons (which is one of my favorite moments;)), and Kermit and the rest of the Muppets finally go the rest the way through the Electric Mayhem's bus (Dr Teeth, Floyd, Janice, Scooter and Animal), who meet with them in the desert after Fozzie's car broke down. <br /> <br /> Even some Sesame Street Muppets make appearances (ie Big Bird runs along the way, heading for NYC to break into public television.) The end is also a very heart-warming moment, with every single Muppet created in the final scene, alo ng with a final "Rainbow Connection "reprinted. <br /> <br /> But the poor Muppets worked so hard on their movie set, it all fell down and the ka mera explodes into a big ball of sparks. You will think everything is destroyed and destroyed. But the rainbow comes to the end through the roof, and all this makes the magic of this movie and you know everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> Perfect 10/10. Watch it and you'll be captivated by the fun and sadness of this movie.
