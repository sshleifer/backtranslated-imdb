I was surprised to enjoy this movie as I watch the "watch your brain at the door and fun school of film. However, this film touched my heart. I have friends like Emily's mental disability. I have friends like Unsocialized Evie. And I was in Evie's shoes and chased out the opportunity for fear and dedication to others. <br /> <br /> Amy Madigan's disappointment in her daughters was almost stuck on the screen and the awkward moments she was trying to bridge The gap with Evie was grumpy and painful to watch. And maybe I'm closer than most, but I've never seen the twist with Evie's dad coming. Usually I quickly cotton on those things. <br /> <br /> My discussions are similar to others posted here. I thought Christopher Lloyd's wonderful, sympathetic character (a very different role to him, I thought) was underutilized. What happened to him when he realized what was going on with poetry? Will he, like James, try again ??? Secondly, the end, as it was, did not reach or reach anything. I didn't expect the pieces to be packed up and tied all ends neatly, but I felt I was not let down with the characters. There was no true healing here or any real healing effort. br /> Otherwise, beautiful and lyrical and disturbing and for some, very, very true.
