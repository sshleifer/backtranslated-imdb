I remember remembering that this series was zealous and so disappointed when it came to an end. Over the years I have tried to find out if I can get a copy of it on video or the like, for no use. However, I was delighted to find this site with details, just to be disappointed with the purchase, that the videos available will not play on English recordings! This production was so wonderful, absolutely accurate with Nevil Shute's novel, which followed the storyline after the end of the war, with Joe and Jean's next life - absolutely wonderful - and I just wish I could see it again, since It's original performance, there are no repetitions on British television.
