My interpretation is that the term 'far' is used in the sense of the opposite of 'warm'; people who are not warm to others. The film reminds me of the teachings of the Dalai Lama in 'The Art of Happiness' where its main point is that the key to happiness connects with others. Not only are the characters in the film insulin, but they are also humorous, shameless, shy, quiet and unfriendly. These features include preventing them from forming and enjoying relationships and discussing and dealing with their problems. And as a result, they are terribly unhappy. I see it as a strong justification for the Dalai Lama's teaching (I'm not a Buddhist by the way). If you're one of the people who think their behavior is a natural response to life in a big city, I think you can be right, but I recommend the Dalai Lama's book. City life doesn't have to be that way. <br /> <br /> I can see why some people found it boring - it is dragging a bit in places and the characters are not very nice. And it contrasts with Lost In Translation where the ocular characters are much more fun and connected, although they are not generally in contact with people.
