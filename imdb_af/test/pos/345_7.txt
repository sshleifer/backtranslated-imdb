Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a desert cult who is trying to raise one of his people just to have a heart attack himself! He ends up dead on an operational table, and for the sake of revenge, his spirit takes over the body of the title character (Jill Jacobson), and then continues to hack and cut until her fellow nurses learn what to do. To challenge the devil. <br /> <br /> Knowing enough about the director filming to know that it's mostly a direct shock, Nurse Sherri isn't really that bad. Certainly, it is clear that this was a very low budget, but all that I found particularly casey was the visual effects. The acting is not as bad as you can expect. <br /> <br /> There are two different versions of this on DVD available. A much more sex-oriented version with abundant amounts of T&A is the original cut, with such hilarious stupid vignette as the victim and her love interest sharing their "strangest sex" moments, including one that fellatio during a college lecture include! </ br /> <br /> The movie will then be cut again for the theater version with the horror elements more emphasized. Some scenes are dropped with new ones added (with Stevens, the role J.C. Wells played expanded). The movie's most memorable ride in this track is a play in a casting, and it works pretty well. This cut of the movie is more interesting in general; I recommend that a viewer both see and compare them. <br /> <br /> Both versions reached their speed in third place, benefiting from a wonderful play-telling performance by Bill Roy as the mad Reanhauer, and a moody climax in a cemetery (though actually filmed in Adamsons backyard!). Marilyn Joi is also worth mentioning, as the cute nurse who is attracted to soccer player worked patiently, Marcus Washington (Prentiss Molded), who lost his eyes in a car accident. He is also the key to solving the story with his knowledge of voodoo rituals. The film also makes use of music from the personal collection of composer Harry Lubins, including compositions for such TV series as 'One Step Beyond' and 'The Outer Limits'. <br /> <br /> "Nurse Sherri" (known by More Alternative Titles (including "Beyond the Living" and "Hospital of Terror") as any other Adamson movie is actually pretty entertaining low-budget food. had a good time to look at it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
