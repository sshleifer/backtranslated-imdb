This show is great! I love every episode. Carrie is a fire and Doug is a lovely and sometimes a moron. Arthur, Spence, Danny, Diaken and Carrie's boss just add a nice ending to the show, and fix all the funny pests in your pants. In one of those seasons, Doug tries to get Carrie drunk because she is more beautiful when she is drunk. Pretty man right? Carrie is not much better, if her boss needs an IPS driver to testify in a small case at her job, Carrie hesitates because she regards Doug as a mess and does not want him ashamed. So she's renting Doug's friend instead. . Woman of the year. But whoever I think is the funniest is screaming random Arthur. He is deadly, hilarious and angry. Hey, you'll be too if you had to live in a basement where the shape has a strange smell and makes you dizzy. This show is hilarious, and if you haven't seen it yet, then you haven't lived!
