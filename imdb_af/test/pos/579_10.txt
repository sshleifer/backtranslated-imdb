This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family's comedy funny, entertaining, sweet and unforgettable, it's hard to decide where to start. <br /> <br /> From the opening number, "Rainbow Connection", Paul Williams's excellent score is sung with kermit D. Kikker, giving us a prologue of what the whole adventure is all about. In the story, it's a fun movie. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this is a road trip movie where Kermit travels across the country with a dream to entertain a "rich and famous contract". Along the way our green hero meets a series of other aspiring actors, comedians, singers and musicians, who happen to be muppets like Kermit himself. Is this how the Muppets really started? "About how it happened," Kermit tells us. <br /> <br /> Not since "It's a crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy world" has the cameo formula used so much and successfully. The aspiring stars meet many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; Some just flash over the screen, but others have very memorable cameos. Steve Martin's amusing little bit like a rude waiter is probably the best. The puppeteer Jim Henson's nod to his inspiration, Edgar Bergen, is especially noticeable. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has ever watched the Muppets television show will see all their favorite characters, they are all here. The puppet show is wonderful; Especially watch Kermit riding a bike (how are you?). In jokes and references to old movies are everywhere, but the best one-liners are reserved for Kermit itself. An example: when the crooks terrorize Kermit and Piggy, she graciously tells her short, green and attractive beau, "I won't give anything tonight, would you?" "Uhhh, make me an offer ...." I also love the gun fight in the OK Corral scene: brilliantly absurd silliness. <br /> <br /> Now get 'Movin' right, but to summarize: a good natural movie that anyone can enjoy, regardless of age or movie genre taste. Highly recommended.
