This movie was originally released as a soft "X", apparently erased with the explicit sex. Later the producers "listened" and released it again with the cut-out scenes restored (apparently only about 3 minutes). I think since Kristine was of age, it was held against her and her promising career has come to a standstill. I think it's all in the timing (witness of Pam Anderson's career) - but Ronald Reagan was in control during Kristine's debacle (we didn't hear Nancy Reagan's business). Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski were in full swing during Pam's "coming out" <br /> <br /> The sex is just icing on the cake, both versions are compliant. These naughty musicals are much more similar to others released simultaneously.
