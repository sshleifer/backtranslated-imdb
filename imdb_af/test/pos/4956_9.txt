OK, yes, it's bad, yes, it's a fluff, yes, it makes dobbin the mules look like an Oscar winner, but look at it like me, I was 13, special effects were in the 90% Ole days when movies need a story line. OK, so even the storyline is a bit dodgy .. but wow I came in this movie as a child in the 80's. cheese-like rock, bad special effects, but airplanes an airplane and it had queens one vision on the soundtrack. See even the worst things have a silver lining. All in all, if you want a bad movie, you need a 12-year-old who shows hate computer effects (if there is such a movie) it is the ideal choice
