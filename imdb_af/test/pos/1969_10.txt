It was a movie I got accidentally. I was through and saw it was on Showtime so I watched it. Now I look at it at least once a month. It's a movie filled with symbols that some people can hold. Don't listen to people who hate this movie, if they want an action movie with expensive f / x, they should have hired a movie they promised. If you're in the mood for a good sci-fi, I highly recommend it. If I buy on DVD, I recommend the Alliance Atlantic edition of the movie, it contains much more extras than the Dimension Movies edition.
