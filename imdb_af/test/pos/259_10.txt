I watched Love Life on vacation when filmed at a Florida Film Festival. It was a wonderful surprise to find a British film that was not distracting or exploitative. A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm audiences who are willing to sit back and enjoy the soft pace of the movie. I found the transitions between scenes a bit distracting, but overall I think Love Life is a winner, a ruby ​​in the fabric. One for the whole family. A pleasant change to see a British movie for teenage audiences not filled with four letters. Try to see it.
