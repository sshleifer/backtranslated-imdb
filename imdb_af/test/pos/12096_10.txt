This movie is one of the most memorable movies I've seen. I was reluctant to go to a Turkish friend who recommended it. I'm not a very enthusiastic supporter of music documentaries, but when Aynur Dogan, a Kurdish woman who sang from Turkey for years, sang her piece, the theater was in awe. I will give myself everything to hear a CD recording of this haunting, beautiful song. And she is just one of many artists interviewed and recorded, speaking of their experiences of performances in Istanbul. Even now, a month later, I remember Aynur's footage being sung in an acoustic auditorium, and I try to remember the music as echoed in the cinema. Well done to Faith Akin, the director of this movie, and his good idea to catch the very wonderful sounds of such a cosmopolitan city. It will definitely encourage me to visit Istanbul.
