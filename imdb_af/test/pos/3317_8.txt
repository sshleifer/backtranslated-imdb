Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) just makes time to get a job. Her real ambition is to marry Eddie and have a baby. <br /> <br /> April (Diane Baker) is too innocent to stay so long and fall in love, a dangerous combo. <br /> <br /> Greg (Suzy Parker) is a go-getter and wants to be an actress. <br /> <br /> All three are doomed to dramatically in 'The Best of Everything', a 1959 soap opera / morality play / sometimes solid film that is obsolete against the second. <br /> <br /> Set in the so-called "World of Paperback Publishing" is not as trashy as "Valley of the Dolls" but not as vanilla as "Three Coins in the Fountain." <br /> <br /> The men in the mix - Brian Aherne, Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan and Robert Evans - are smooth, well dressed and not good, for the most part. Aherne is the resident sexual offender - pinches anything that goes away and makes unwanted aprons right and left. His character is offensive like hell, but it is not played seriously. Harassment has not yet been discovered, I think. Boyd also works there, although you never see him do anything. He is too busy to be older, wiser and drunker. Evans is just as foreign that Diane can suffer in style - he is a rich child who has found her in "trouble", instead of marrying her, as he promised, she takes surgery. <br /> <br /> Jourdan is a director who wrongly has a relationship with Parker. They share a battle scene which, in any case, occurs in a movie, as the case may be, in a movie, but the scene is eventually ruined by Parker's hurricane. She almost ended up with him, and she really didn't deserve such a joyful fate, but her bad acting. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford blows as Amanda Farrow, the resident 'witch', who is automatically rude and dismissed by any of her legions secretaries. Well, they're younger, aren't they? Isn't it enough reason to hate someone? Caroline doesn't think so, as she admires Miss Farrow, every chance she gets. Crawford only gets rid of once when she tells her married boyfriend, "you can both go to hell with confrontations" You never see the poor soul daring to cross her. <br /> <br /> Martha Hyer's 'storyline', as it was, is extremely poor and she is painfully over it as an unmarried mother. Shortly after wearing a big "W" (for "whore") on her stocking, she walks around like a pathetic mess for most of her screen time. Worse still, she is not conceded that all this is somehow connected to the end. It won't matter much, but still. <br /> <br /> It is painfully obvious, it has all happened in a totally different world. People were more beautiful for each other and work was not a mourn, but something exciting, for a girl from outside NYC. <br /> <br /> Aside from an unconvincing drunk scene, Hope Lange helps it look pretty real like Caroline, who has at least one side to her character. <br /> <br /> I admire women being seen with an opinion, a chance and a choice. Not that it is wrapped in a nice bow, but it makes points for equality. In 1959 it was probably significant and possibly controversial. 10/07.
