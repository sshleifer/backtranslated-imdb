Cecil B. DeMille rectified a series of household comedy plays in the late teens and early 20s. He found his perfect front lady for these challenging pieces in Gloria Swanson. In Don't change your husband, Swanson plays a bored housewife whose rich businessman (Elliott Dexter) gives more attention to work than to her. She is chased by a beautiful rouge (Lew Cody) until she leaves and separates the boring man for the new lover. Things are soon known and Swanson discovers the new man is as neglected as the first. To make matters worse, she discovers Cody has a wife on the side (Julia Faye). After several confrontations and convenient meetings, things are solved. <br /> <br /> It was a smash hit in 1919 and helped make Gloria Swanson an important star. Although she was only 20 when she filmed it, she was very good as maybe the foolish woman. She looks good and wears some beautiful gowns. <br /> <br /> There is a memorable scene that is 100% DeMille in which Cody Swanson promises with promises of wealth, pleasure and love. As he joins her, she suggests the screens. Fun is a fantastic scene from Swanson in a spanking hammock swinging over a pool while dancing. Wealth is a scene in which Swanson is equipped as a Babylonian queen, as servants bring her jewelery, which in turn throws. Love is a scene in which she is a bush nephew who loves a Pan-like character (Ted Shawn). Pure hokum, but very entertaining, and Swanson looks good. <br /> <br /> Dexter is very good like the mere man who shaves his mustache and starts working out to win back his wife. Cody is also good as the fake charmer who is a liar and dishonest. Faye is funny like the other woman, with the name Toodles no less, getting her. Sylvia Ashton plays Mrs. Huckney. Ted Shawn was married to Rut St. Denis and together were pioneering and influential modern dancers (of the Denishawn School). <br /> <br /> Whenever I see her, Swanson impresses me. She seems to be such a natural actress, yet there is a way the camera captures her expressive face that is just hypnotic. She is a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining movie with lots of color tones in different scenes to keep things alive. And many of the furniture is 86 years later in style.
