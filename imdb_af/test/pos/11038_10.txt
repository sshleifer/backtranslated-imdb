This Popeye World War II cartoon has some very good siggats in it, and it is definitely averaging for its genre. It was also beautifully drawn with some big corners, good detail and .... well, interesting attractions. <br /> <br /> What that means is Popeye at sea in his small boat and accidentally running In a small Japanese boat, with two guys on it. (Incidentally, why were the "Japs" always presented with large, round glasses and curved teeth?). <br /> <br /> Anyway, these innocent Japanese sailors want Popeye to sign a peace treaty. Oh, boy, think the believer Popeye, "wait until the admiral sees it!" In one of the wonderful artworks I mentioned above. We see slowly how the little Japanese ship is really a big destroyer ..... and Popeye is deep. "Why do you double Ja pansies!" Shout our sailor. <br /> <br /> How he comes out of the situation is fun to watch.
