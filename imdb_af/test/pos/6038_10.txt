This is another of my favorite Columbos. It sports a top-notch cast, including John Cassavetes, who never handsomer or sexier, Anjanette Comer, Myrna Loy, and Blythe Danner. Now there's something I've always wondered about - Gwenyth Paltrow was born when this episode was shot or was Danner at that time pregnant? Thanks to IMDb I answered - she was five months pregnant. Now I can really feel old. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to Danner apparently uses the social connections of her mother (Loy). He has a mistress on the side, Anjanette Comer, a prominent pianist, but she announces his will more. She is sick of back street. On the night of their concert, he gets rid of her and looks like suicide. Columbo has a few problems right away. One thing he remarked: "You have a beautiful woman here - bedroom eyes - she has money, a body and a career. Where's the man?" It's great to see Falk and good friends Cassavetes together. There is a very funny episode at Columbo's Bassett vet. Everyone in the role-play is wonderful. <br /> <br /> This is one of the episodes Columbo made the classic series.
