I would strongly agree with previous lame comments. I watched it not expect too much from it. The fact is that the cast was great, especially the main teenage woman. The dark sides of them all passed through, all were blurred in an unclear way. There was an underlying stream running through the film of teenage anxiety and sexuality. The serial killer role was also well played, as you could feel that he had gone through the things they had as children. What this film is is a strong drama / thriller. Yes, I will agree that they do not make the obvious, but you can relate to the bruised teenage heads. They did what they did and it is credible. Also, a decent dark end, instead, could easily be an opt-out one. The attention to detail in the movie was also fantastic. I am very well solid 7 out of 10. A little slow at times, but let a thinking person see where the characters come from.
