I didn't read the book. I don't care either. The movie was a beautiful romance, and I think women will enjoy it. no, it wasn't a "10" movie, but it was nice. women, if your husband is bored like mine, then see for yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophical doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue to 'enamored' and 'loving'. <br /> <br /> Also, if you like cage he was awesome and funny. I enjoyed watching the developing romance. <br /> <br /> Also, if you like Christian bale, see him in balance. this is a "10" sci fi movie. <br /> <br /> see this movie. ignore the previous user's comments. <br /> <br /> One - especially the ladies !!
