Great little pioneering film (in 1955) about an important topic. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much from Sinatra's performance and was pleasantly surprised. Love Kim Novak! She was beautiful! <br /> <br /> Love the jazz score by Elmer Bernstein! As big as Lazlo Schifrin for "Bullitt"! I am very surprised that this is not available on CD (if anyone knows about the availability of the soundtrack in any other format, they should write it here somewhere!) <br /> <br /> Preminger's direction was as usual boundary line flawless. <br /> <br /> Didn't read the Nelson Algren novel, and also had no idea how faithful the script was. The subplot of Frankie as a "hot" card dealer was also a surprise, just like some other things. But look for yourself. It is worth seeing ...
