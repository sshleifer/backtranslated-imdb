------ Spoilers ----- Spoilers ----- Spoilers -------- just a few little ones <br /> <br /> Seen on Satilite channel, missed first 30 min movie, these comments will keep you brief and informative. <br /> <br /> The movie is basically about 5 characters. The acting is very bad for down characters. 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnapped 3 different people, but it returns and the 3 kidnap the 2. This is one of those kinds of movies where writers try to think or philosophically, mysteriously and ... you get the point; But do for their own, personal, lack of thinking they fall terribly short. Like one of the prisoners supposed to be a kind of psychology nerd - the part looks like it, but its tongue can't speak it. The authors think that if the nerd uses many 8-letter words amateuristly - unaware, I believe that viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it. I wish I could give an example, but I can't remember - just as it was said. The end was also bad. But the one female prisoner acted as an old and relatively wise lady, although she and the rest had many clich√©s. <br /> <br /> So why would I give this movie a 7 star if I thought all of the above? Simply, I give the whole seven stars to LISA KELLER - one sexy a $$ mom. She's fine fun. I am a beauty, and she is exactly that. But don't get me confused because I'm not a pervert and this movie is NOT a porn in any way. they are something about her that I cannot explain, but I like it. I remember the scene where a prisoner was released and as he was looking for a way out, he stumbled into Keller. She tried to get away, but she didn't have a chance. He threw her down, kneeled on the stairs and pulled off her pants, no underpants;). Now, though she has an AMAZING ass - and the shot leaves the imagination for a long 30 seconds I think - it was her facial expression that got me. She wanted it, and it made me think I was behind it. I would have betrayed that booty! After that expression, I could no longer objectively look at her, I AM IN LOVE. lol. I'm happy to see this movie, but if Lisa Keller doesn't play the lead, I would have changed the channel. Well ... after I saw the scene I mentioned above. I'm a LISA KELLER fan, but she doesn't seem to be a consistent actor, as this 2003 movie is her latest. But I look forward to another movie with her in it.
