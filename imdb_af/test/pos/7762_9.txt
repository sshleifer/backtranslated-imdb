Okay, let me start by saying that I generally don't like much of anime. I have enjoyed some of the regular "classic" series, but consider the medium as a whole exactly the same way I do American television: that a good 90-95% of it is full, with Die res falls from anywhere from "viewable" to "decent." That's the case, it's no wonder I don't like the self-defeating anime parodies out there. I don't get most of the jokes, and the medium itself forces a certain style of humor that doesn't make me attractive - loud, hyperactive, lowbrow and totally over the top. <br /> <br /> So, when I was searching this series for a friend, I looked at the first few episodes for disappointment. I figured out that the characters were supposed to represent cliché characters from a store story story frame, and that their actions should also be so satirical. I could see where it came from, but didn't think it was so smart - many "wacky, fun, high-school shenanigans and goings-on, just now we are ironic about it." At about the third episode, my opinion change drastically. <br /> <br /> At that time, the strengths of this series began to manifest themselves. The characteristics of the non-chronological episode command, its snarky sense of self-awareness, and especially clever humor with a well-executed straight man. <br /> <br /> In what I consider a rarity in any medium, this show offers well thought-out, greasy interactions between diamond-linked characters. Protagonis Kyon's perpetual sense of vague irritation is the perfect foil for the performance of the character character of Haruhi's generic "anime-like" exploitation. It's a fraction of the formula, and it works incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Based on that strong foundation, the series continues with a truly phenomenal level of attention to detail. As mentioned before, the episodes air out of chronological order. I consider it a gym at first, but it works surprisingly well. The chronological sequence of events makes sense, but the broadcast sequence of the episodes follows the traditional structure of Aristotelian drama. The selected order leaves no confidential gaps that cannot be filled by simple inference (but while it is possible to guess what happened in an untouched "preceding" episode, it still feels essential to watch exactly how the events unfold. ) and excellent planning prevents any pitfalls or inconsistencies. I watched this series a second time immediately after completing the first, and I was amazed at how well even seemingly unceasing events were all tied up. <br /> <br /> The last point indicates the utmost attention to detail in each area of ​​the series. While the anime drawing designs stir a little, the background art is beautiful, realistically rendered based on actual photographic references. Animation quality is also excellent at key points. For example, there is a music performance left in the series in which the characters are shown, which actually plays a song. It may be trivial, but the subconscious effect of watching (movie quality) animation actually matching the soundtrack is incredible. br /> <br /> In short, I love this series for some reason. Of course, this is something I don't usually like, but its execution is so unique and well executed that I can't help it.
