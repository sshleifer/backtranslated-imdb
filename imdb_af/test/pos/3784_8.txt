Charles Chaplin's 1918 Shoulder Arms was his longest movie to date, but in just over 45 minutes it wasn't quite a feature film. With the First World War they just came to an end, many popular entertainers of the time did their part to inspire their indigenous troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovely tramp went to war! The film starts with the Tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept on even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-swinging, to the aversion of his chest surgeon. The Tramp then finds himself in the trenches, with a more formidable enemy, although the Germans eventually endlessly become more incompetent than even he. The turbulent moment when the Tramp declared that he had taken thirteen German soldiers by hand, surrounded me. <br /> <br /> There are many other great moments in this movie. Chaplin, waking up to find his sleeping pads underwater and unable to get his own feet, is hilarious, as is his ingenious use of a record player's tube to sleep beneath the surface. <br /> <br /> Most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly include Chaplin behind the hostile lines disguised as a tree. The reactions of the dark German soldiers, unaware, only meters from a sworn enemy, being one-on-one with one-handed disabled, are very amusing, especially when one soldier grabs an ax with the intention of creating a tree for cutting firewood. <br /> <br /> It's a very enjoyable movie, and one of Chaplin's pre-1920s efforts. Highly recommended.
