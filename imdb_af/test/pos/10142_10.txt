Excellent role play, story line, performances. Absolutely credible. I realize the close knit group that illustrates the Marine Corps. But this movie brought fear to my heart. The marines let the principles be condemned. It seems that this movie is based on real life situations. It shows how difficult it is to act against the business. Anne Heche was completely convincing. Sam Shepard's portrayal of a Gung Ho Marine was disillusioned. And Eric Stoltz as her lawyer was so polite to balance his loyalty to the Corps, but also his loyalty to his client, while being high on his tighthead. He knew what his true actions were. But he was pulled apart by his immersion in the marine tradition, loyalty to the corps above all. I sat on the TV screen. All in all, I give this one a sounding 9 out of 10.
