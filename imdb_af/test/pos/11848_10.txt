I paid attention and enjoyed the very rich expressiveness of the main actress, Julianne Nicholson. I have no words to describe how much I am enchanted. All the actors and actresses played well. Especially I noticed the solid good character that was consistently in the foreplay - Andy Richter who played Carl. I think the idea of ​​showing a variety of friends and family with different opinions, and the various consultation meetings, is like the real world. Jay Mohr, who played Ed, the future man, also played very real behavior. But I want to emphasize to me the point of very rich expression repertoire that Julianne Nicholson is capable of doing, of course. Indeed, the subject that deals with this movie seems to me to be very important and becomes strongly meaningful to many people. I've seen this movie several times and haven't been bored. This time and again in my mind.
