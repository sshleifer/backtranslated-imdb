This movie was all but boring. It's about reality. For those who think this movie was boring, open your eyes to the real problems in our society. Our children die. The effects of alcohol and drug abuse should not be ignored. I work in a correctional facility as a chemical dependency counselor, and I deal with these problems every day. People of all ages and levels of life are brought about by the effects of their alcohol and drug abuse. It destroys families, hurts people and causes serious brain damage, all kinds of health problems and death. This is all preventable. This movie must be featured in every high school in the world. If someone owns and wants to sell this movie or sell me a copy, please email me at: Ottenbreit2@netzero.net thank you
