The lovely young nurse, Charlotte Beale (a beautiful show by the exuberant redhead Knockout Rosie Holotik) is going to work on a remote rural asylum provided by dr. Geraldine S. Masters (the excellent Annabelle Weenick) is managed. Under the foolish assortment of colorful crazy patients are insatiable, aggressive, nimfomanian Allyson King (the delicious Betty Chandler), cute Judge Oliver W. Cameron (a lovely hammy Gene Ross), paranoid veteran Sergeant Jaffee of Vietnam (nicely played by Hugh Feagin) giant Sam (the lovely William Bill McGhee), and brave old hag, madam. Callingham (the most annoying Rhea MacAdams). Saying patients are dangerously encouraged to carry out their fantasies by dr. Masters, of course, lead to a rash of brutal murders. Director S.F. Brownrigg, working from a clever and appropriate writing by Tim Pope, does an expert job of creating and sustaining a suffocating and sad atmosphere of sickness and oppressive claustrophobia. Robert Farrar's haunting score, the grim set design, a few wild bastards, Bruce B. Alcott's grungy no-frills cinematography, very nice, robust, scenery-scarfing histrionics of a no-name cast game (especially Ross is a total eye and the really shocking surprise massacre conclusion further adds to the overall infectious sigh of this choice trashy piece of 70's low-budget local horror exploitation cinema.
