When "Madame" decides to have her cats inherited, it makes trouble. Snobbish Butler Edgar, who is due to inherit next year, decides to get rid of the cats. This allows the story to start and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that allows them to meet the beautiful, but not completely reliable, cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations to the inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> The power of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is just hilarious as the offended butler who is out to score and of course he takes serious beats. One of the best plays is that he is driven by two dogs, Lafayette and Napoleon. The score is huge and as in the Jungle Book, you have scenes that are almost "musical" in the sense that the story does not progress and the focus is to express the protagonists themselves by dancing. And of course we like the fact that the score is very jazzy. <br /> <br /> And of course it's not just me, but also my kids who like this one. <br /> <br /> Regards Simon
