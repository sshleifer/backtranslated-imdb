I will make it as clear as possible to those who are unaware of Bill Hicks's legacy. He was simply the largest statue comedian in the world, almost certainly in my opinion the greatest ever lived (his rebellion idol is the great Richard Pryor, whose addiction is his addiction). His death in 1994 barely noticed in the popular media, just weeks after Kurt Cobain committed suicide. His tragic death at such a young age obscures any sense of injustice he has criminally ignored during his life. But the harsh truth is clear as day: no one rose to claim his cloak. There is no rebellious comedian who lives with almost the skill and invention. <br /> <br /> The observation is made in the dedicated tribute. It's just a ride, that the rise-comedians often see the work as a step stone to richer pursuit - lame movies and morally-driven sitcoms, made to realize - but never enrich - the lives of an inexorable audience . That's all Bill Hicks talked about. His sermon was always a rally cry for people to think for themselves, to investigate authority, to come together as one race. <br /> <br /> His appeal continues to grow with every passing year since his death. His star will stay bright for a long time, so many less lights have blown out. Once exposed to its brilliant, intelligent but ultimate compassionate output, you will be enriched and rewarded. <br /> <br /> The man himself loved Dylan to quote: "To live outside the law you must be honest," he said, Bill Hicks was honest, and he was the funniest of them all .
