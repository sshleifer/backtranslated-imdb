The first time I looked at it when it came out (1994), and the last time I looked at it, it was just before I wrote this review. It still makes me explain my brain. After all these years it didn't disappoint. Truly the smartest Bollywood comedy ever made. This is an Indian movie that earned its place in the IMDb Top 250. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan are probably one of their best comedian roles. The thing that makes this one less classic is its comic timing and wonderful editing ... The jokes are refreshing and not cheap. This is a movie that is really ahead of its time. If you haven't seen it yet, go it now! !!!!!!!!!
