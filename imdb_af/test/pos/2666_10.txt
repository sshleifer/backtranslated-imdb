Instead of writing a paragraph, I give four good reasons why 2001 is the greatest cinema experience of all time: 1) This is a visual Odyssey that can only be told on the big screen. The special effects won by Kubrick's only Oscar are the foremost effects before the age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least the most accurate) depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills space screens not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds to the sphere of the film (discussed later in the HAL). The fact that Kubrick shot the moon tones before the Apollo landing is a grim but fulfilling move. Many said it was a favorite "travel" movie on its original release. I can't think of any other movie that has such incredible footage for its time and even of all time (sorry Phantom Menace fans!) 2) Kubrick's live style is fantastic. As in all his films, Kubrick likes to use his camera as a means to deepen the characters of his characters and plots in psychology. His camera is not as mobile as other sizes like Scorsese, but watches the story unfold. Faces are the key element of a Kubrick movie. Like classic movies, like M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the audience a psychological view. Even he uses extreme close-ups of HAL's glowing red "eye" to show the coldness and determination of the computer science villain. I can go on, but in the summary, Kubrick is aware of his style. 3) HAL 9000 is one of the most shameful characters in film history. I totally agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL 9000. Most of this film takes place in space. By using silence and the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and his crew were isolated between the earth and the jupiter, nowhere to escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated action of HAL 9000 and you have the most horrible villain imaginable. I still feel, although I have seen this movie several times, dressing my chest in a particular scene. 4) The controversial end of 2001 always turns people away from this movie. Instead of giving my opinion on what it means and what my idea of ​​2001's meaning is in general, I would like to discuss the fact that the end is to leave the movie open. Kubrick said he was planning to open 2001 for discussion. He left his meaning in the hands of the viewer. Respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick allowed his film to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful discussion on man's past, present and future. The beauty of 2001 is that the end doesn't have to mean anything deep, it can only be a purely plot-driven explanation and the whole movie can be seen as an entertaining journey through space. No other movie, except the wonderful Citizen Kane, will open it in 2001. It is really meant to be a surrealistic journey that involves not only the eye but the mind. Instead of waiting for the Phantom Menace in long lines, rent a widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest movie experience.
