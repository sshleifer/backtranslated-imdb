This movie was full of tension and well-directed, the black and white effect made it a wonderful secret. Fay Emerson (Hilda Fenchurch), who was twice married to well-known musician Skitch Henderson and also Elliott Roosevelt's son (FDR's son), fell in love with Zachary Scott (Ronnie Mason / Marsh). Ronnie wins the hearts of all the ladies in the picture, even Mona Freeman (Anne Fenchurch) and presents the marriage when he can. Rosemary DeCamp (Dr Jane Silla) (well-known radio and TV actress in the 30's and 40's mostly played the small town's friends) warned the ladies about Ronnie Mason's sick mind and the abusive childhood he had when growing up , which caused his love / hatred. relationship with women. Fay Emerson and Zachary Scott would have been bigger stars with more rewarding roles, but their lives were short in real life. This film is out of criticism, it's a trully great 1945 movie classic for many generations to watch and enjoy!
