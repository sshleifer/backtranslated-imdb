Unfortunately, he is brutally, murderously killed, while Betty secretly watches. It makes her unholy, and believes that Kinnear is really the character he plays, dr. David Ravell, and she is his former fiancee. She heads for LA to find her lost love, without knowing that the stolen drugs are in her drum. Her work is Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock respectively), the men who accidentally killed, found Del before finding out where the drugs were hidden. They follow her across the country, while Charlie gradually falls in love with his image of her. <br /> <br /> And in LA things get bizarre because no one realizes Betty is deceptive.
