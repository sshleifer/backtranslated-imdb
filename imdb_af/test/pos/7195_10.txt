This is the first time I can remember where an adaptation did exactly as the book did. In fact, just jokes are added to the story, rather than content mixed or deleted! <br /> <br /> Like the Egyptian slave Cellularis who had trouble communicating, LOL! Or when Tidivinnus played like a quasi-Sith Lord and got annoyed in the Roman Empire, the General ordered the Empire to ..? Oh, look at the movie people! <br /> <br /> I can easily believe that this photo was one of the most expensive in French film history and to me it was worth it, Depardieux was excellent as was the Roman bashing and Boar Obelix stamp. Clavier, who plays the tiny insatiable Gaul, was perfect and far from his days as the clumsy barrage of Jean Reno in "Just Visiting." <br /> <br /> The battle between Artifis and Edifis was hilarious and was great to see the Matrix theme not borrowed to disrupt an otherwise perfect fight! <br /> <br /> Redbeard the pirate and his crew almost stole the picture, from their own boat to the car Otis (Edifis Assistant) invention eventually used. <br /> <br /> I understand there is Asterix and the Olympics with lots of the same team back, at Toutatis, I plan to see it too!
