I stumbled upon this site while looking for a video or DVD of the 1959 Porgy and Bess version with Sammy Davis as Sportin 'Life. If anyone finds it on a home movie format, please let me know. I always talk to my daughters about things they think is new, which is already done. A couple of years ago we saw a live theater of version and all I could talk about was this movie. Unfortunately, my daughters can't remember the production of Sammy Davis Jr., although they heard about him. Needless to say, they are not familiar with the other big actors in the movie. It's a great overview not to have this classic movie (because of the cast) on a home movie format for collectors and future generations. Anyway, I think this version was the best!
