I went to a preview show of this movie. I was about to take 120 minutes of clumsy lines, senseless plot and the kind of nauseous play that the "Postman" made one of the most malignant performances of cinematic blundering of our time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a starring role that Costner addressed to the soul of the audience. Shock that Ashton Kutcher can act in such a serious role. Shock that a movie that was both actually engaged and trapped with my own emotions. Not since Robin Hood I saw this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion. Kutcher apparently adapted the serious play he played in the "Butterfly Effect". These two actors came in this movie with a serious, focused attitude that shone in what I thought was one of the best movies I've seen this year. No, it's not an Oscar worthy movie. It's not an epic or a profound social commentary. On the contrary, it is a story about a simple subject, illuminated in a way that brings the audience to a higher level of empathy than possible. This is what I think is good filmmaking and I am thoroughly impressed by this work. Bravo!
