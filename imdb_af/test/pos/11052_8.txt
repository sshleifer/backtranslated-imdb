78 years ago ... the premiere of "Anna Christie" advertised by the slogan "Garbo Talks!" The movie runs for 16 minutes and the viewers reach the peak of curiosity: Greta enters the bar and gets through a long-awaited transfer of silence to sound: a few seconds closes her silent era and eventually Greta Garbo says a historical line: "Gimme a whiskey, ginger ale on the side and don't be firm, baby!" <br /> <br /> "Anna Christie" (1930) is the movie by Clarence Brown who introduced a big silent star, Greta Garbo, to talkies. Nowadays, we can only imagine what a serious transfer it was to actors and actresses. The careers of many were tied to the end - something we hardly ever see. And it was no coincidence that it was Clarence Brown who aimed the first talkie with Swedish beauty. Garbo trusted the director after two of his big silent productions, FLESH AND THE DEVIL (1926) and a wife of affairs (1928): movies that achieved a great success at the box office, both with Garbo in the prospect. <br /> <br /> But we are in 2008 and that fact about the movie, which is just historical, seems to be of lesser importance. The question for today's viewer is not what Garbo's voice sounds, but if the movie is still viewable after these 78 years. In other words, we all strive to answer the question if the movie was a test of time. Is it? <br /> <br /> When I recently looked at it, I came to the conclusion that, apart from some small technical aspects, including static camera, "Anna Christie" is still very entertaining. On the one hand, it is a wonderful story of a life, of a reality the young woman faced (based on Eugene O Neill's play) and on the other hand an artistic manifestation of true greatness in the field of direction and acting. Let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs. <br /> <br /> CONTENT: Chris Christopherson (George F Marion), a heavy drinker, lives a sailor's life. He was saddened by a letter from his daughter Anna (Garbo), whom he hadn't seen for 15 years. She says she will come back. He started to change everything for better, but forgot that his daughter was no longer a child without experience, but a 23-year-old woman who had lived on a farm in Minnesota for various kinds of things where she lived and worked. Furthermore, he forgets that she has the right to accept another kind of male love. in her life ... This short presentation of the content, not from the main characters perspective Cter, but the one that was introduced to us earlier as Anna (her father Chris), makes you realize how universal it is. Simple letter of the whole text that appears to be life has been erased after all these years. Cases discussed here in 1930 are still meaningful and valid. <br /> <br /> PERFORMANCE. There are not many characters in the movie, but there are two that really shine in the roles. This is of course Greta Garbo herself who did something extraordinary in her 15-year-old phenomenon, the presence that marked the history of early theater (something I have already discussed in many of my previous remarks about her films). But here's Garbo a little different. I admit there are moments in this movie when she doesn't feel very comfortable with her role. It seems due to her new audio experience in English; However, her performance is, as always, really and unique. But that's what everybody expected from Garbo. The real surprise of the movie for the 1930 viewers and also for us is Marie Dressler as Marthy. She is excellent in her facial expressions, in her accent, throughout the portrayal of a drinking woman who looks at life from the perspective of "the bottle beating". Her best moments include the conversation with Anna Christie in the bar preceded by her hilarious conversation with Chris. The rest of the supporting role is fine but not large (here is the German version for that). Special Dressler, except for Garbo himself, is an absolutely flawless choice. <br /> <br /> If you asked me what I would like from "Anna Christie", that's what I'll tell you: it's a classic movie. However, there is one more thing I must mention at the end. It's humor, wonderful white that is remarkable throughout. Although the content is very serious and "Anna Christie" is by no means a comedy spirit (the only Garbo comedy is NINOTCHKA), there are such moments when you will divide your sides. For example, don't hit Anna and Matt's visit in the amusement park, especially in the restaurant where he orders milk for her to think how thorough and innocent she is, beer for herself and where suddenly Marthy joins them ... <br /> <br /> "Anna Christie" is a perfect movie for classic buffs and a must at least a little bit interested in the true magnitude of performance. If you're tired of many of those modern stars, look for such movies and you'll be happy. Well worth your search! <br /> <br /> Scale Greta Garbo! Scale Marie Dressler! Let's drink a toast for the great work you've done in the movie! Scales after all the years when wine tastes tastier and your spirits are with us in a different way ...
