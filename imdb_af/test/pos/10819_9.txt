First, a word of warning. The DVD buck describes this movie as a comedy. I don't think it was the intent of anyone associated with the movie except some marketing monies. While light and a little funny are in places, it is NOT a comedy and if you expect to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I've never heard of this movie and have had absolutely no expectations. Since the other two DVDs I picked up were great disappointments, I was so happy when I saw this movie. The acting, writing and direction were excellent. The story itself has definitely interested me because you don't usually watch movies over the last month of France before the Nazi takeover in 1940. It provided insight into the parasites who gave up so quickly and agreed to divide their beloved land. Along the way there is a selfish and weak actress who played by Isabelle Adjani. It looks great after all these years. She hit an ex-lover and then found a poor juice to take the fall. This juice escapes from prison and finds her - with another lover - a high official and weasel played by Gerard Depardieu. In addition, a subplot about a Jewish physicist trying to smuggle the deuterium out of the country is set up and eventually it becomes the main plot. The story has very nice twists and turns, a light sense of humor (without being a comedy) and some exciting moments. Together they create a nice package, it is sure to please.
