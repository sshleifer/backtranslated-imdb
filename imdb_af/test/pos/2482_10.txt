It kicks you in the stomach. There are other films with more convincing characters, a more realistic story, and perhaps even more deeply about political appointments. But then most of them are not directed by Peter Watkins. Perhaps the one true genius artist of the British film that came out of the 1960s, Watkins has made quite a few rarely films that perfectly capture the spirit of the aesthetic world - the world of political expense, social problems and government solutions. So, his work is probably less "filmy" than, say, politics, which some might call a weakening of their inherent artistic quality. Then again, why should art not allow itself to get engaged? Watkins dares. And succeed. You will not feel good with this one. You will not feel happy. Actually, you won't really like the movie; it is uncompromising, honest, direct, unashamed; a smash in your face, briefly. You can't help getting angry, you can't resist making the things you see happen to you. This makes Watkins's films so rewarding.
