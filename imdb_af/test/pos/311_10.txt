This movie has transformed the art of film making and telling a complex story in a powerful new way. The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy, with a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolor smoke. The movie does not use music as a score found later, but as a practical part of the scene that is made up of speakers, radios, and so on. Play. Coppola uses classic literature as inspiration, takes plays and characters and places them in a completely different environment. It's a tough and brave thing to do. Then he takes a superstar, Brando, a fortune for him, and rolls it so that he can barely see his face. The pure guts that require such a move are amazing, and it works beautifully. This movie is in the top ten.
