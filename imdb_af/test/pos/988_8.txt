This is a masterpiece of filmmaking. Many themes are smeared and occasionally boiled in these warts and all the study of the poet's bohemian, self-sufficient war years covering the London air bombings and the external calm of a Welsh coastal view. - the boundaries between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and selfishness towards heroism and self-sacrifice and more. An adult, subtle writing that suggests and sometimes brings dramatic focus, the underlying tension is well served by perfect performances (apart from the strange inappropriate smile Keira Knightley tends to, although perhaps led this time as the other characters often name). But above all, the exceptional visual composition of every moment, with ingenious and elegant use of near, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to watch. It is so beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more appealing than some of that master's work. A very rare type of movie these days - it draws attention and stirs the emotions without leaving artistic integrity and giving to manipulative, superficial shortcuts.
