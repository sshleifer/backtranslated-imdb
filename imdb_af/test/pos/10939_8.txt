I watch many Vampire movies. I know vampire movies. Hammer movies have always been my favorites. Christopher Lee will always be the best Dracula. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is a fun movie from start to finish. The dubbing is not good, but I also like Godzilla movies, so I'm used to calling movies. Anyway, I love this movie a lot. The SFX is huge. Although Jackie Chans part in the movie has nothing to do with the plot and seems to be added to selling the movie, he is pleasant in it. The Fang work is excellent. The acting is not good, but it can have something to do with the bad dubbing. Perhaps the real language would sound better with the movie if I could understand it. I'm sure the movie Gone With The Wind sounds in another language worse. <br /> <br /> I own it on DVD and won't share it. I put it on my bookshelf next to my Hammer Movies DVDs.
