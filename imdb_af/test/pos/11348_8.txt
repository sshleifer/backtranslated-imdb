In 1962, Hong Kong (in turbulent times, as we were informed) managed to remind this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between two married people who are associated with their traditions, the scene of old Hollywood in the scene. scene of lush colors, yet limited sensuality (as opposed to the required sexuality and occasionally naaktonele that became part of the norm of a romance in film) and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication set. It is not difficult to see the influence of Marguerite Duras here, as she is known for minimalism in storytelling as well as the description of powerful drama using the art of verbal and non-verbal conversation between two strong-band characters as well as the use of re-plays that can eventually take place in the characters' lives. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATO CANTABILE, her pen is clearly visible from the moment we get the concise rooms of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) penetrates into the last scenes that regret the feeling he feels when he remembers the opportunity lost in reaffirming this relationship. <br /> <br /> The plot even looks like Duras could have written: Chow and Mrs Su Li-zhen, neighbors in an apartment, while being both fairly successful professionals, are beginning to discover in the most banal ways their spouses are deceiving, and of course they discover that they are together. The question is whether they should act on what they feel towards each other or not as their partners. Every scene plays with the notion that they will give each other at any moment and at one point it is suggested that they will eventually both be intrusive, as the camera indicates our encounters (which on a daily basis as seen through the regular changes of Cheung 's dresses), we never see it. And just as some of their spouses do not see, their own love story is exalted, because they do not see through their appeal, the ultimate separation makes even more bitter because we want something at any moment - something catalyst - and the only the one who comes is when Leung reveals to her that he loves her, followed by his quiet, brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband, which means he will not. It also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do: from a Western point of view, fulfilling their romance in a more solid, lasting relationship would have been possible especially in the 60s, but as it is Hong Kong, Cultural values ​​are remarkably different. <br /> <br /> Performances here are of the high order: it is very easy to play an urgent love affair, but to constantly play a suppressed platonic relationship that is full of desire, it is hardly imagined to be difficult is and makes all the sensuality more cerebral than tangible or visual. Cheung and Leung smolder and their stainless chemistry leave long after the credits rolled.
