What is your freaking problem? Do you have nothing better to do than sit on your fat asses and blog about how to find something in bad taste? Here's an idea: Go outside. That's right: walk outside your mother's basement where you've been living for 13 years and GO OUT. "But I can't leave! Star Trek is in 30 minutes and I haven't married that avatar on World Of Warcraft yet!" Oh my God, stay in that case! All right, I could have gone overboard there. I mean, Star Trek is good, but I don't see it anymore. Anyway, you really should write crap about Mind or Mencia writing. It's a good show. Maybe you just get out of the way because the girl dumped you on World of Warcraft. Or you're constipated. Try fiber in your diet.
