Spoiler starts The film focuses on three friends, Samantha (Summer Phoenix), Chris (Nick Stahl), and Owen (Aaron Paul). The movie starts with Sam and Owen as the drug addicts, and Chris, the trainer, as the one who cares for them. As things get worse for Chris, he asks Sam how the drug is. Sam is out of rehab and newer at this point and tells him that makes everything better. Chris then took Owen and started using it. It takes Chris twice to become a full-time member. After a few problems with a dealer and a confession to Sam, she came in again. So the downward spiral starts for them. Chris od is when he breaks a promise to Sam (I want to be a surprise from the movie). He dies, Sam comes to college to be an architect, and Owen is arrested. so the story ends <br /> <br /> Spoiler ends. small spoilers throughout <br /> <br /> Nick stahl is wonderful. He will one day have an Oscar. His portrayal of Chris was heartbreaking. He was the only one who felt in the film as far as drug use is concerned. Aaron Paul, who played Owen, acted like he wasn't on heroin. Summer Phoenix was good, she is talented, but what can I say Nick Stahl stole the movie. His stunned eyes, his slow movements, everything was perfect. <br /> <br /> The authors need to show movies in the movie. This is a major reason why people do not want to stop. Other then there are hilarious scenes (the mall scene and the Backstreet sonel scene, man Stahl nailed the reactions right to the head.) Touch, sad scenes (Like the scene between Sam and Chris in her bedroom after he turned up, I shook, and the park scene.). It was also realistic. As S uses again when Chris wants to flush the drug in the toilet, and uses Chris again after fetching Owners, even though he was clean for two weeks, the move was too strong. It's all realistic. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie for a good role, good music and a semi-truthful version of drug addiction.
