Age cannot ignore the beauty of this East-West love story. Disregarding the familiar and sweet title song and lyrics, which we have, is a dramatized biography of two remarkable people caught in a moment of counter-currents that include social conformity, bigotry, war, doubt and the need for tremendous courage . With Hong Kong as a backdrop, this movie tells the story of a Eurasian doctor and an American journalist who meets and falls in love with the Korean War. Like Mark Elliott, William Holden is intelligent, weak and slightly weak; Jennifer Jones may be well-liked as Dr. Han Suyin, in doubt, ecstatic, eager and hesitant. Others in the big movie include Torin Thatcher, Isobel Elsom, Murray Matheson, Virginia Gregg, Richard Loo, Soo Yong, Philip Ahn, Jorja Curtright and Donna Martell; Many of Hollywood's best Eastern actors also played smaller, accredited parts. The writings of John Patrick follow His beautiful novel now; Henry King's direction was solid as always. The storyline story is how reluctantly Han would fall in love with Elliott, with her busy and demanding schedule as a doctor and her doubts about their future. and how indifferent he was, despite the intolerance and interference they faced. The film is inextricably physically busy, interesting and often beautiful. The hill where the lovers disintegrate, the beautiful bay where they swim, is set against a busy and busy business town, large social events, and exquisite streets, hospital corridors and traffic-filled arteries. With cinematography by Leon Shamroy, Ben Nye's make-up and Helen Turpin's hairstyles, the great work by decorators, sound and lighting, art department and everyone involved, it has to be one of the most memorable productions in a great non- American city of all time, and one of the most difficult to catch on film. But the one who remembers the most here is the loved ones, who are unfortunately not young, face the odds and precisely determine what they are - then continue as if the love matters and the conditions as barriers to love is set. The highlight of the case is Markus going back to the war; after that he received his letters, even after she knew that he had been killed; they look better messages. A world where hope is all that matters, courage is the price of access to the world and it is always summer on a high and windy hill that falls apart and above an area where beauty and individual desires can be victimized. or brush aside by militant forces of evil. Truly, love is a very beautiful thing, says dr. Han; and this movie is one of those doctrine's shining evidence, lucent as a pearl, timeless as a Chinese proverb and beautiful as polished jade against a rough background.
