A movie of high intelligence and activity. Apart from being a strong capsule of the time and the 60's, the movie is VERY surprising in its forward thinking themes and the unique presentation of the power system in a group. William Greaves puts him in the authoritative role in the group. He asks his crew members to film and film and keep filming. First, the two actors, then the crew who filmed the actors, then the whole set including bystanders, policemen and eventually a homeless man who lived in bushes in Central Park for 9 weeks. <br /> <br /> Greaves edit the movie (thousands of feet) and make a surprisingly powerful story with an interesting bow and motivation. Don't expect to get bored with this movie. Each crew caters for conversationalists and often gives the mind the observer watched this movie. Greaves does well to integrate the multiple camera tasks with synchronized three-in-one photos and other attention shift methods. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie will really only be effective if that's what you're looking for. : If you're looking for some abstract art films that feed your own self-supporting ego while never having a point, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a movie you've been talking about for a long time and thinking about the desire for honesty and sincerity in the documented "reality" and the inevitable transparency that comes from it, then this is the perfect movie.
