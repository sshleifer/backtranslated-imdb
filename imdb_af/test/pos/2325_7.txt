It's a very underlined movie to say the least. As pointed out in previous posts, this movie has a somewhat loose and highly impeccable writing, but you find yourself "Who cares?" while shooting milk (or placing drinks of your choice here) through your nose. It was indeed due to a scarce combination of actors in synchronization. While Kelsey Grammar is of course a gifted actor (reference 'Frasier', this movie), supporting actors / actress play their roles very well. I found interesting how they threw the part about Duane Martin blowing the shot in the 'big game' for Navy's basketball team; If any of you are a basketball fan, remember Martin of 'White Men Can not Jump' and 'The Rim' and you'll know that Martin had a short stint in the NBA with the Knicks. Fun how they cast credible character traits like this. Rob Schneider's anal-retentive character was the perfect compensation for Grammar's tranquil attitude. Lauren Holly played the brain gutsy sex pot well enough to make you succeed. It's a movie that makes you laugh, even though you've seen it many times ... the comics in this movie are definitely down. I'm still 12 years later. <br /> <br /> "Is this one of my chickens?" "Uhhh ... No. It's a parrot .... from the Caribbean." "Well, don't fly it away ... it's dinner." "Arrrrr ..... arr."
