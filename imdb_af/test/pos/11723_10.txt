While growing up in Boogie Nights, I think it was Burt Reynolds best performance. He is also a good director and has made a hard, violent film that doesn't hold back (a hooker's death with 12 gauge) and is an excellent detective story with some great actors (Brian Keith, Bernie Casey, etc.) And an outstanding jazz soundtrack. 10 out of 10
