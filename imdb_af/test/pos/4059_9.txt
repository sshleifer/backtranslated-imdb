Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy, who are a team. While Rene Russo, William Shanter, and the guy from the Everyday video are next door for the ride. It's a funny and good movie. Not only is it the case, but it is a good friend. <br /> <br /> Tom Dey (Shanghai Noon) directs this hell of a movie. From start to finish it was a masterpiece. No slapstick humor here. But good old time was laughing. Make fun of all the other policemen (to name a few deadly weapons, Beverly Hills Cop, Fifteen minutes and so on.) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie, see this one. You will like it. It has a wonderful saucepan and crew. So, get a ** look at "COPS" and watch "Showtime" for a cop movie. And remember, they'll offend your neighbor at um ... um ... oh! Friday nights at 8:00 am (man, everyone says I'm a bad author).
