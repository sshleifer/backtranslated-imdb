... We are the grandfather's hour. More than the gangsters, it is a detailed depiction of an American family around 1930: the father, proud of his work worried about his son giving up high school, the mother everyone wants, the daughter who is eating in his knee's arms and the twins who absolutely love ("Don't sleep first!"). <br /> <br /> And there's the grandfather playing the Yankee doodle on his flute. Did you notice that this melody plays the same role as Doris Day's "Que Sera Sera" in Hitchcock's "The Man Who Went Too Much" (1956)? And there is this grandfather who is ultimately the bravest person of the family. He doesn't even tell you his age, but prides himself on his country and resists the gangster's hateful extortion. <br /> <br /> A good movie by Wellman.
