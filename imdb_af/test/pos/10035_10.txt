That movie is excellent. One of the most notable things is that Flynn's performance is excellent. It's worth emphasizing, as he was often killed as an actor by Bette Davis et al. <br /> <br /> I remember the scene where Flynn Arthur Kennedy gets drunk about him to his punishment in the Battle of the Little Big Horn. The cold, calculated look at Flynn's face, as he does, is extraordinary - much better than much-appreciated Spencer Tracy or many other stars. The other thing to note is the excellent performance by George. P. Huntley Jr. Lt "Queen's Own" Butler. It is surprising why he stopped filming shortly afterwards - one would have thought he would be a character actor for many years.
