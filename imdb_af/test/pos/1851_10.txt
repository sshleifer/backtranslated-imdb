I love this movie! This has it all! Bonnie Hunt wrote a fantastic work, directed and co-starred in this film. David Duchovny is just completely completely. and Minnie Driver is as cute as ever. combines all that talent with David Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson and Jim Belushi, you have an Oscar-worthy movie! I'm surprised they didn't get one. If you haven't seen it, rent the DVD, watch it once and comment on directors ... Bonnie Hunt is fantastic!
