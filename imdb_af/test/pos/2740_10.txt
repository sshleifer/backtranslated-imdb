My dad had this movie as an 8mm coil. I loved it when he pulled out the projector, pasted a sheet on the wall and played Gerald McBoing Boing. The thought of a child communicated by sounds fascinated me. <br /> <br /> Nine years ago, my son was diagnosed as autistic. The doctors will ask me questions about my son like "How does he communicate with you?" I will respond, "Have you ever seen the cartoon, Gerald McBoing Boing?" I would like a copy of this cartoon to show my son and his educators. This is how my son sees him as the world. Recently I talked to a digital transfer specialist who indicated the most personal 8mm movies. did not contain sound until the mid-1970s. I think I was very happy to experience the images and sounds of Gerald McBoing Boing in 1972.
