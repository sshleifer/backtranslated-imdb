Cinema, at its best, is entertainment. If one has to doubt every aspect of one of the issues of disagreement, and much of history is based on contemporary opinions - often biased - the cinema must be abandoned because their prejudices will always spoil their enjoyment. When I saw an airplane flying in a movie dated 33BC, I was amused. The background in Casablanca is absurdly false. So, I moan and say the movie failed to convince? Fiona, relaxes and enjoys an excellent play. Wajda's decision to cast the protagonists as French and Polish was inspired. one was immediately aware of which side each of the main characters represented. No need to stay on the authenticity of the wigs. It's a powerful cinema. If there is another political message that is still relevant today, you have a dinner - a Château d'Yquem with the foie gras; A Puligny Montrachet with the starter; a few Polish Vodka sorbets and maybe a 1961 Château Lafite-Rothschild with the beef - and discuss the political aspects of Danton until you fall into fatigue. Danton would certainly have agreed?
