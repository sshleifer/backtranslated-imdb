There was a recent documentary about film making, which had a long list of actors and directors talking about making movies. One common theme is that you can have a good script, good movie, best director and lots of money and still create a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Down Periscope proves the conclusion of that theory. Not an original or terribly well-written script. A few solid actors, but mostly unknown, and this movie just makes you laugh! It would be easy to just say that Kelsey Grammar was wearing this movie, but that is not really the case. Other character actors, such as Rob Schneider, and the hilarious Harland Williams, have significantly added to the enjoyment of the film. <br /> <br /> Cast dynamics, or the mysterious "movie magic" is really happening here, creating a movie that flows smoothly, has incredibly well-executed transitions and line to line of well-written and well-executed dialogue. <br /> <br /> A preliminary premise, very technical inaccuracies and just foolishly plan things that are not in the real world or the real fleet, but you just don't care. As traders myself, I found that the overall feeling of the movie, although not likely, was not too far from the point, as far as sea life is concerned. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny movie, a good family movie, and especially if you're a fan, many Kelsey Grammar white, sarcasm and just damn funniness.
