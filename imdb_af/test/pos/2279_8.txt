This film received less attention than "League of Their Own", possibly because it has only one "name" star. But while the woman's professional baseball has just been an eight-year, Midwestern town, Japanese baseball is a bigger entity, both in financial underwriting and popular support. It will only make the better movie. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Baseball" shows the facts of Japan ball life: the regiment of cheer, respect for referees, the pressure of corporate owners on drivers, the extreme conservatism of play - and none hot dog players are welcome. <br /> <br /> It's also the isolation that any gai-jin - but especially an American jock - doesn't feel the best people in foreign cultures - living in Dai Nippon. And the Japanese are not comfortable for foreigners and show it in various ways ("the gai-jin strike zone", one American player complains, "bigger than a Buick.") <br /> <br /> The script may not have won awards, and once again played on the theme "salvation with improved plays", but I have much more fun watching than the pokey "League". Definitely recommended for those who want to see a different angle on this great sport.
