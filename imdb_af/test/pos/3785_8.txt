This movie as it is now is much shorter than it was when it was released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other, medium-sized, silent Chaplin features (a DOG's life and the pilgrim) that Chaplin released in the 1950s. In the day, SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of humor in a uniform approach. It's still very funny (Chaplin in disguise as a tree spying on the Germans is so ridiculous that it's hysterical), but it suffers from being in his own age. Charlie's handling of the First World War, a frightening conflict that killed 20 million people, but not the worst war (terrible to say) of the 20th century. Chaplin would also see that war, and would reject the chief architects in the GREAT DICTATOR. But the latter is more accessible to modern audiences because that movie is a talkative. Hitler as a target also looks more important in 2008 for audiences than Kaiser Wilhelm II and his general staff. <br /> <br /> SHOULDER ARMS was helping us set up the tramp, his training, which he used to ditch warfare, and his real fight against the "Huns" on the Western Front. Much of this is now over - one segment (when Albert Austin is a doctor investigating Chaplin in his office at the drafting center) still exists and is shown entirely in the documentary UNKNOWN CHAPLIN. This is a pity, because the movie is about forty-five minutes long, and gaps appear to fill these scenes. What remains is the first time, but one wants more ... and feels a little thing. <br /> <br /> Sydney Chaplin and Henry Bergman are doing well in supporting parts, especially Sydney and Wilhelm. He had previously done that with Charlie for the sale of bonds, given a militaristic speech before banging with a big hammer titled "War Bonds". Here we see that the tramp succeeded in concluding Wilhelm and the general staff. It was just caught by Stan and Ollie who caught the German army with a tank and barbed wire. The funny thing is that Chaplin actually had a big crisis because of its war activities. He was not a naturalized American - not in 1917 or in 1952, when Attorney General McGranery publicly announced that Chaplin could not return to the US because he was an enemy alien (Chaplin and his family were in Europe on the move - Charlie settled in Switzerland for the rest of his life in anger, except when he made a COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG and when he was in Hollywood for his special career "Oscar" in the 1970s. An American was not able to be set up by the US, so he sold American War Bands (with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford), but in Britain, tens of thousands died in World War I arteries, and public was there in Chaplin, who regarded them as a "slacker" and a coward. Chaplin eventually overcome it, but the remnants of resentment followed him until he died, not reflecting the success of SHOULDER ARMS as a movie, ma It suggests why Chaplin had not done a modern war movie until 1940, and a value sentence.
