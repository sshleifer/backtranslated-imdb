A beautiful film, cleverly shot with an eye on war-era detail, and (taken into account during World War II) minimal violence. <br /> <br /> A small cabinet weaves an emotional journey through the occupation of Czechoslovakia, the separation of loved ones as the pilots leave for England (the separation of the spaniel becomes heartfelt), spitfire scenes, love, friendship and betrayal. The theme of betrayal runs deep through the film, of betrayal of love, betrayal of friendship, and ultimately the betrayal that the communist regime showed to former RAF pilots after the war. <br /> <br /> A desperate sad film, all the more so because it is so factually accurate. I would recommend it to everyone.
