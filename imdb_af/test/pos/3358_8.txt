I'm a tough Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change it. I have all the tapes, DVDs and audiobooks and every time I see it, I listen to them. <br /> <br /> The movie. The film is a repetition of certain episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy in the gates, Battleship and many others with a different edge. Introduction of a new general instead of Captain Square was a brilliant step - especially if he didn't pay the check (something seldom done now). <br /> <br /> It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting and training. All in all, it's a great movie for a boring Sunday afternoon. <br /> <br /> Two drawing rugs. One is the Germans' deceitful accent (come one, Germans can't say the letter "W" as we say) and Liz Thezer's Two The casting instead of the well-known Janet Davis. I like Liz in other movies like the bear, but she doesn't wear it correctly and Janet Davis would have been the better choice.
