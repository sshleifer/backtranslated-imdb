Anyone interested in Texas should have this DVD. It's just a good movie about real Texas with great scenes. It took a lot of Texans to do it right. Hollywood would never have found it. There are so many subtle things Tubb put in the movie and may not even have thought, but it makes the show. <br /> <br /> Guest comos are not seen as a comedy at all. Each star fits in perfectly and does not detract from the movie. Many of the guest spots blend so perfectly that when the credits roll, you go back through the movie to find the character. Street's role is dead, it couldn't have been better done in real life. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is quite different from the first one, it gets a little "hokey", but that's right. Somehow this storyline works. The hokey stuff is like after-school, but it seems credible and natural. <br /> <br /> I've never heard of anyone using the Sonny Pruitt line before, except the locals I grew up with. It was the icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Definitely a collectible, right there with Pure Country, Sugarland Express, Jr. Bonner, Texasville, The Last Picture Show, Giant, and of course Hud. <br /> <br /> Gig'em Aggies '86
