Clayton Moore made his last official appearance on the screen as the Masked Man in director Lesley Selander's epic adventure "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold", co-head of Jay Silverheels as his faithful Indian explorer Tonto. Selander was in his 40 years in movies and television an old hand in half western countries with over 100 westerns to his direct credit. This fast-paced perdopera embraced a review perspective in the portrayal of Native Americans who have been gradually accepted into Hollywood oats since 1950, after director Delmar Daves blew the route with the James Stewart Western "Broken Arrow". Racial tolerance figures as the primary theme in the Robert Schaefer and Eric Freiwald script. Schaefer and Freiwald wrote 13 episodes of the "The Lone Ranger" series. They were all thoroughly familiar with the formula, but they made the input for this scene outing. Our vigilant heroes ride to the salvation of Indians who are avoided by white white crying, for no apparent reason. The mystery about the identities of these assassins and the reason for their murderous behavior is revealed fairly early so you don't have to guess what happens. Although the violence in this Selander saga is softened by contemporary standards, the fact that the Lone Ranger shoots a bad man to kill in one scene, rather than wounding and a brave woman striking a dual accomplice A tomahawk sinking in its back between its shoulder blades was shocking. The television series never went so long, and when the Lone Ranger turned his six-gun, he shot the gun from the villain's fist, rather than blowing him away. The other contradiction here is the Indians who make one of the raiders and torture him for information, but they are never raised on charges of kidnapping this henchman. Douglas Kennedy did not have the shameful image of Lyle Bettger who threatened the Masked Man in director Stuart Heisler's "The Lone Ranger", but he gave him good enough as a cowardly ban which is one of his own minions without a killing obstacle when the abuse threatens to announce its name and the identity of its cronies to a group of vengeful Indians. <br /> <br /> "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" opens with an overview of the masked protagonist's origins as an Texas Ranger ambassador and his transformation into the Lone Ranger with Tonto serving as his sidekick . This two-minute recharge is a great way to start a series-oriented character, so everyone, including non-Lone Ranger fans, is equal. The primary plot about a gang of relentless white dragons and does not call it surprising? The Hooded Raiders start killing Indians and stealing medals worn around their necks. The Lone Ranger and Tonto are too late to intervene, but they get a close baby. With the baby and the dead Indians, they drive to a nearby Spanish mission supervised by Padre Vincente Esteban (Ralph Moody of "The Outsider") and turn the baby and body towards him. Initially, the Padre must assure an Indian girl, Paviva (Lisa Montell of "Gaby") that the masked man does not hurt them and is their friend. Padre sends Tonto to the town around the doctor, dr. James Rolfe (dean Fredericks of "Gun Fever") to fetch. Tonto is immediately in trouble in the form of the paunchy town lawman, Sheriff Oscar Matthison (Charles Watts or "Giant"), who despises Indians. Tonto tries to see the doctor treating prisoners in the sheriff's jail, and Matthison's men start to riot him when Rolfe intervenes and drives back to the mission. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Lone Ranger and Tonto can catch one of the Hooded Raiders, but an Indian Redbird (Maurice Jara from "Drum Beat"), and his fellow braves kidnapped the henchmen and brought him back to their village. They stabbed him and shot arrows at him to release his tongue. Headdress Ross Brady (Douglas Kennedy of "Hell's Crossroads") and his cohort William (Lane Bradford of Devil's Canyon) drive out into town and Brady uses his Winchester to kill his prisoner hooker. Little knows Brady that his henchman was talking. The Lone Ranger and Tonto don't come long after and call Redbird for his perfidy. Redbird tells them what the man said before he died and the Lone Ranger decided to take a disguise so he could learn more. He conquered as a gentleman bounty hunter with a mustache and faux southern accent. <br /> <br /> Despite its concise 83-minute run, the Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold have no excitement or surprises. Selander holds the action forward at a full gallop. The dialogue is largely expositor rather than memorable, as Schaefer and Freiwald are more often than spring surprises, but there is one big surprise related to the good Indian theme. There is also a scene where the Lone Ranger pushes his own credo on justice that is available to everyone under the law, when the High Court, Judge Earl Warren, tackled the High Court's landmark decisions that recognized and mitigated the conditions of segregation, civil rights, separation of church and state, and police arrest in the United States. One thing that distinguishes the "Wage Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" from its predecessor is its epic scale with flashbacks to the age of Spanish conquistadors with a little science fiction involved in the form of a devastating meteorite. In general, Lone Ranger restricts stories to the 19th century without compromising European history. No, the Lone Ranger was not the first movie to go with the Spanish conquerors. Robert D. Webb's "The Seven Cities of Gold" (1955) refers to the Spanish south-west search for the parable places, but Selander's western beat Gordon Douglas 'Gold of the Seven Saints' (1961) to the screen.
