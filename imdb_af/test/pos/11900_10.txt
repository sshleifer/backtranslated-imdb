This movie was one I've been waiting for some time. I was happy to find that is all that was expected. The writing of this film was so finely crafted and explored far beyond what is seen by the audience. I find it amusing that so many people who don't read between some very important lines, but fail to do so, will make the movie feel different and brilliant. The film has many stories and characters cobbled around this one Character Kilo, a Man who rose from the streets from the streets and became a very powerful criminal. After a bit of time in Prison Kilo there is a gap in the legal system and by a disturbing event is only released to find that everything does not seem what it seems. Kilo Finds himself in the Higher Community Area and Political Kings to make clear how important a Man's Word is and stands. A war begins when the street is in arms against the Lord of wealth and corrupt power. <br /> <br /> A build up of explosive and powerful, non-stop turns. This movie will make you sound. I found the movie of this movie to be outstanding and not a movie that is ignored. Excellent. Go hire it today !!
