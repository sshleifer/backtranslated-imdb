it is another good western, which I enjoyed. It's not an epic or anything, but it's good for what it is. It is about 3 furrows, led by a man named Jed, who is rude and uncivilized. Jed and his two friends find themselves explorers of a fort which is the only thing that stands between them and an Indian group, which disrupts the Americans on their land and wants to take it back. This is the essence of the story. What follows is action, excitement, even a little humor and a forbidden romance. One of Jed's friends, Gus, reminded me much of the character Quint (played by Robert Shaw) in the movie Jaws. They both have that crunchy, gruesome demeanor.anyway, if you "I'm a Western fan, you have to find a lot to keep this particular item. I think it deserves a 7/10
