I recently saw it on TCM and through the IMDb I found that there were seven "crime doctor" movies with Warner Baxter as the psychiatrist detective. Baxter is a bit in the tooth compared to his steady performance in 42nd Street a decade earlier. Not noir, and a little campy today, the movie also has a touch of the possible supernatural. The plot, black and white cinematography and characters are much more complex than those of the Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan series. There are subplots, unexpected twists and performances by a number of B movies. We should all recognize immediately (no one ever made it into A status). It's a wonderful unpredictable 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a DVD series of these movies.
