Yong-ki Jeong's "Puppet Master Only With Scary Parts" was the most recent Korean Horror movie I liked to watch. With the title "Inhyeongsa" in Asia, this movie struck me right away when I saw it online, with images reminiscent of Puppeteer, Childs Play and other toys / pop-based horror flicks. But for some reason I didn't think. "Boy, it'll be tough," I thought it would be creepy and fun. Ghostly horror has done almost well. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly but I like it, so it was good. The score, almost as I found at Acacia, was beautiful and many reminded me of classic horror scores of the past. I won't give away much, but the story was strong in this one, and I strongly recommend it to any fan of Asian HORROR. It's not extreme, it shouldn't be taken with the greatest severity, but it's really good.
