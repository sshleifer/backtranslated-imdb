Of all the 48 films by Brigitte Bardot, "Une Parisienne" is generally considered (one of) her best. What we see is special: because once the plot has its own value, it does much more than just offer a cheap vehicle for BB's sex-loaded look. <br /> <br /> This movie is your true and well-worked-out lightweight comedy with a good and coherent story. In France's government circles in the late 1950s, it is from beginning to end. It offers many amusing twists and turns and a little slapstick. Everything was done by at least three major roles, including Bardot. <br /> <br /> "Une Parisienne" (= French for "Parisian female") focuses on telling a story, not to show Brigitte Bardot. Brigitte does the plot very well by using her talent to play in light comedies. <br /> <br /> When you sit on your couch on a Friday night, tired and tired of a week's slavery, just turn "Une Parisi". This movie will make you feel better.
