It is rare for a film to include the problem-solving process and a fantastically far-reaching moral speaker, and be a fairly accurate historical film, but Fat Man and Little Boy pull this trick off. <br /> <br /> This is the story of the Manhattan project - World War II attempt to build the atomic bomb, said the conflict between the two men that made it happen, General. Leslie Groves and Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> The historical figures are a major study in opposition: military vs. civilian, practical vs. idealistic, emotional vs. scientific, brute force against consensus-based problem solving, inability to long-term vision. A fictional character, played by John Cusack, is added as a kind of synthesis of the two historical figures, to show mankind denying the right people (and, of course, the mandatory love interest played by Laura Dern). One looking for a straight documentary can criticize the decay in the melodrama (and sometimes debauchery with the facts, but it is Hollywood for you), but the purpose of fiction is to synthesize and invent events in more universal truths. I think it can be forgiven. . <br /> <br /> One of the great visuals in the movie is when Oppenheimer is experiencing the first atomic explosion: it is completely done by its reaction, and considering the wonderful footage inherent in an atomic explosion, it is A brave and completely effective way to describe in an instant what the ambivalent effect on man has to unleash such a force (the kind of thing lost in the typical Hollywood shoot-up version of history. ) The use of music is especially excellent in the last third of the movie. <br /> <br /> Fairly accessible and highly recommended as both a historic movie and the highest order drama.
