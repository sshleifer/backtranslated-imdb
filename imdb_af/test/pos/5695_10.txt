BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely exceed its limitations (it's an indie flick) by constantly suppressing expectations to prevent it from being an intense experience. <br /> <br /> In the tradition of all good animal-centered thrillers, viz. Jaws, The Edge, the original Cat People, the directors know that restraint and what isn't shown are the best ways to tackle a punch. The performances are real and poignant, the crocodile is very well done, indeed, if the Black Water website is to be believed, it's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous. <br /> <br /> If you go to a B-grade gore fest crocodile forget about black water, but if you want a smart, exciting ride that will fear the water and wonder what hell will do if I that tree was then a must see.
