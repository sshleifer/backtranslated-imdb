CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST is a perfect movie. A flawless film about all the deficiencies of humanity. Outside, it looks like a movie about death, but it's actually a movie about life. I can't recommend this movie enough. And don't be afraid, dear readers, it's not a depressing movie. As said, it is a movie about the clarity of life coached under the guise of death. You will laugh. You will cry. You will realize that life is fragile and short. And you'll leave the show with a better understanding of how precious life is. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br />
