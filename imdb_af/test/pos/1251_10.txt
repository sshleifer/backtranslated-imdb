It's so nice to see Bruce Willis coming down from his action throne and let's see he's really a talented actor. He shines in this movie as the 40-year-old image consultant who was completely lost to his inner child until he met him face to face. It is one of those rare films that does not come to its audience and really offers something for the whole family. It's about caring for one another, keeping the child inside you and realizing that you're not growing up as you thought. Willis appears to be an impressive record for working with children (just testifying "The Sixth Sense" with Haley Joel Osment), and he has great chemistry with Spencer Breslin here. There are some nice photography and music, and the end is great and uplifting. A great movie to watch with every member of your family.
