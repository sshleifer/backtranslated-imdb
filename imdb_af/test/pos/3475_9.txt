Inside I'm Dancing (Rory O'Shea Was Lord) is the story of two disabled young men, Rory O'Shea, who is almost completely immobilized and restricted to wheelchair, and Michael Connelly, who is weakened by MS and also limited to wheelchair. <br /> <br /> In Ireland, the film is open with Rory arriving at an assisted home. He eventually touches Michael, but only after some tense scenes where Rory acts against the staff and other patients on the regular "movie" to play hard metal music using profanity and general concern. His budding friendship with Michael is cemented by the fact that Rory is the only one who understands Michael, or at least is willing to try. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, through a trial and tribulation, the few petitions, and are granted, are the right to own their own in a specially adapted apartment. The apartment is paid for by Michael's father, who left him essentially disabled. The two also hire an attractive assistant called Siobhan (played by Romola Garai) to help them with their daily lives. This is essentially where the core of the film evolves as both feelings develop for her. Michael is hit very hard. Unfortunately, for both, but especially Michael, Siobhan does not feel the same and causes her to leave. As Michael temporarily regresses and wants to return to the Asst. Living Center, Rory convinces him to continue to live on his own. The movie ends with a sad note, which many viewers may have seen, but in the end, we felt that Michael had become truly independent and the future was, as Rory pointed out to the end of the movie. <Br /> <br /> You know, I can't say I've seen many "disabled movies" and I don't know if they can be considered a specific genre. But there is a kind of formula for them. One person is unwilling to live beyond his illness until a liberating force forces him / her to do so and inside I am Dancing is really different. However, what works is probably more subtle about the peaks and valleys that the two men go through than you can expect. There are no intentional free moments and no "stand up and courage" manipulations. The sad parts are sad and the funny parts are funny. Some viewers may remember a little that Rory is the nail punk type, with the survival in his nose as the perfect "rebels" clich√©, but actor James McAvoy somehow really does. The same can be said for Steven Robertson, who plays Michael. If Michael's heart is broken, it doesn't seem to be a poor writing trying to work the audience, but rather a young man who is really in pain about unrequited love. The kind of pain that many can relate to whatever their physical condition is. Again, these are the kinds of things the movie works and make it offensive without being persuasive and enjoyable at many levels. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
