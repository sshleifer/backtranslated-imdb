Let's start from this point: This is not a movie intended for the general public. Completely bizarre, somehow incomprehensible, completely unpredictable, it just keeps you on the screen to see what will happen next. If it doesn't even matter to you, it's an excellent movie, then you go back to your "family" movies and forget about MOTORAMA. It is important to be considered a cult film. It can be placed in the same category with films that earn awards in Cannes or other intellectual film festivals, but unfortunately Hollywood has already dropped into oblivion, simply because it is not commercial. The performance of young Jordan Christopher Michael may not be Oscar material, but he does the right touch on the story. Even the genre is hard to describe; It's not a comedy in the right sense, you don't know if you're supposed to laugh at the strange situations in which Gus gets involved. It's more like an impossible adventure some kids might want, but don't let them see it ... it's not a movie for kids. So, if you like Disney movies or are looking for a "Home Alone" style, this one is definitely not for you. But if you like to read Edgar Alan Poe or Tim Burton's works, then you'll love Motorama. So, jump into your red Mustang, get a tattoo peg "Tora" and a Cruise Strangeland with Gus. I'll love it ...
