Darr was a Super Hit movie, loved by many. It tells the story of Shahrukh Khan's innocent obsession with Juhi, who likes Sunny Deol. Honestly it was an entertaining movie, but if you look carefully, it's not too realistic. Shahrukh Khan keeps calling, Juhi and tells her he loves her pieces. He announces in college that he loves her, and gives her some nice surprises like beautiful photos of her. Unfortunately, instead of being flattered that a man loves her too little, she becomes very scared. I know 100 people from people who are offended by someone, and these people enjoy it because they play long. Yash Chopra gives us a good movie that is entertaining, widely due to Shah Rukh Khan's character. Sunny Deol is supposed to be the main actor, but Darr belongs to Shah Rukh Khan who is a great performer. Shah Rukh Khan is literally the villain of the movie, but I would be happy if he has the girl because he loves her so much. Sunny Deol gives a decent performance, but he hits all the guys on his own and survives a brutal knife attack. Juhi Chawla is cute as ever in a pretty good performance. Some good songs, including Tu mere samne, are the best.
