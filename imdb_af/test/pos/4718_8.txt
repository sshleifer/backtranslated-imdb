It was high time to make a film about the situation in a largely ignored Asian country like Myanmar, and Beyond Rangoon is Hollywood's answer. Initially I thought Hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 uprising and add in the traditional Hollywood spice of Titanic-type love between the main hero and the Burmese male leader who is an old man. Fortunately, nothing of the kind was in place - which could also explain why the film wasn't financially successful. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie was honest to God and I was delighted with the accuracy of events depicted. . Apart from the fact that filming was done outside Myanmar in Malaysia and Thailand and that I missed the exotic Burmese places, I couldn't fault the movie much. <br /> <br /> You can't blame the movie for the despair. of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions. After all, these are real events of a civil war. The music of Hans Zimmer is definitely the USP of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection with it. <br /> <br /> I was just a year old in Rangoon (now Yangon) during this turbulent time. When I heard a movie was made on my real experience I was too young to absorb, I had to get the DVD and needless to say that I could almost have complaints about it, as it is a miracle for me.
