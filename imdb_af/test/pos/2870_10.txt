Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight. He lives in this burnt old hotel, where eight teenage convictions are going to clean. Most of them die, except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. I still thought the deadly scenes were really well done. Like when one girl is eaten by hungry dogs. The best should be when he slid the phone down the blonde girl's mouth. Kane was a serious horror movie actor, he watched this serious movie all over and it will never change. It was his only look at the whole movie. Great action and deadly scenes, I don't think I can give it 10 out of 10, but 6 looks good.
