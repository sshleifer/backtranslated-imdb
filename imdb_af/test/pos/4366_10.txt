Yes, this movie was just hilarious and the play was all about it. Besides Shelley Winters The German accent was not so good, but it doesn't matter because she's scarce in the movie. So if you're a fan of her beware! The two main stars of this film are Laurence Harvey and Julie Harris. Now before this movie, I only see Miss Harris in East of Eden with James Dean and I have a soundtrack from The Glass Menagerie that she did on stage with Monty Clift and Jessica Tandy, so I don't know how to be "D" in this role and YOUNG, she impressed me. How was she hammy? I love him! ;-) Mr. Harvey, he tickled my tickle! I am now a full-time Laurence Harvey fan! That hair !!! * links * OMG! It's almost like Burt Lancasters, that crazy messy look, it doesn't get any better than that. He is young and so innocent in this movie. See it now! It's definitely in my top ten! :) I'm so glad I found a copy of mine! Unfortunately, this movie is out of print and very hard to find on video. :( <br /> <br /> VAT, look out for the hospital hotel room scene !!!!! This is one of the best parts! Or if Mr Harvey convinced him, he is sick and he tries to get his knee get kick, you know how doctors with that little rubber hammer ;-) Well, he does it himself and kicks his leg and it kicks the table * squeals * Check the look on his face, so innocent !!!! I can't describe it, but to all the people who say he can't do very well and other camel mum comments, see this movie and you'll see what a BIG actor he really was. You'll bow! If you are not, then I am afraid there is nothing I can do for you, you are hopeless. ;-)
