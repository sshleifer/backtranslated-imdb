I didn't know much about this movie. In my roommate I dragged myself into it. I was so pleasantly surprised! The plot really grabbed my attention and held it, and the characters are well drawn and realistic. The script is very clever and funny, and the film does good things with it. And the best part is that it has managed to entertain without any explicit sex or violence! If this film comes anywhere in your area, you should really see it - stand for this little movie, it's worth it!
