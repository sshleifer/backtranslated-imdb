Recently, it was a pleasure to see this emotionally charged film by director Mani Ratnam at the 2002 International Film Festival of Toronto. I awarded my highest honor to the Film Festival on this feature. Make sure you don't have the opportunity to experience this spectacular gem, but you'll be predicted. This movie will make you tear if you belong to the species known as homo sapine! A 10 !!
