This is one of Julie's greatest tributes to music, along with her album "Trapped in the Body of a White Girl". To quote the wonderful Medusa "Dare to go naked, just wear your underwear, you will drive home every time" - Wow !!! Now it's good advice. "You can dance, at my party! Yes, justify your dancing shoes! ..... You're invited to the party in my pants. Yes, come on, boy, let's dance, at the feast in my pants." Julie Brown is hilarious !!! It's almost sad that this video is only 51 minutes long, but every minute is fantastic !!!
