There are only a few movies that can be mentioned, and SHEPHERED is one of those movies. In many ways it was ahead of time (and you could say it was a source of inspiration for several better known films). Copy by many, similar to none, is truly a fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> The story is complex, but unfolds itself as a solid but regular, spectacular and highly thought-provoking exploration of the nature of humanity. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people have to live underground and rule chaos. C. Thomas Howell is a 'Shepherd' who protects the population from various religious leaders by killing any incompetent members of society. The whole idea made me think about our society. It's really a brilliant social comment, which is more than I can say for some recent sci-fi / action block busters. MATRIX RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS did not feel that any true innovation had taken place, just dull video game effects. But SHEPHERD also counts on the action scale ... <br /> <br /> Not once does this movie let the viewer breathe. Peter Hayman proves himself as one of the few genius action directors. We speak 100%, high grade, home kung fu fight! It was excellent. Really good special effects, shoot-outs, pale-futuristic cyber-punk noir style ?? the movie really has its own elements. <br /> <br /> Talking about SHEPHERD makes it impossible to talk about how much style it has. The vision of this city is really stunning. It reminds of images of Tim Burton's very memorable vision of Gotham in Batman. And these images are photographed by Graeme Mears with a skill that makes Gordon Willis and Conrad Hall ashamed. Even the special effects were wonderful. The scenes where battles take place are undoubtedly landmarks in all films. This movie is a ballet of wonderful visual performance. <br /> <br /> Still, at the base of it, there is an interesting story cast by a strong role. The play (especially Rowdy Piper) and the plot are both large and excellently targeted. Unlike many futuristic films made with a strong artificial flavor, the characters are credible and the dialogue is natural and full of white. I'm always proud to see a good movie as SHEPHERD meets. It is a pity that it did not receive good distribution and made nothing in the box office. It's a rarity you are looking for. This movie will impress you and make you feel 10 times cooler because you've seen it!
