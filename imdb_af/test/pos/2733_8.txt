I watched this movie with my family, which is a neat story like mr. & mrs.iyer expected. They returned home disappointed. So, this is a warning to all '' final story lovers '' to stay away.15 Parkway is not trying to answer questions or give moral solutions on how to treat the spiritually challenged. His intention is hard and clear. Questions that every person's, healthy or not, is reality ability. In fact, I even raise doubts about my responsible sense of common sense. The safety, slavery, satisfaction I find in my present is really what I am or really makes an illusion that we all desperately and sometimes ignorantly cling to just the neglected "meethi" in us all on one or another. exist, fake console? So why does Anjali make it so pointless to point out her thoughts when she is really upset by the realization that she is becoming a monster? Are we not all who think we are normal? and helplessly vulnerable about it deeply? Isn't it better to be happy than to create the impression of 'normal' while suppressing fragility? meethi brave, crazy, sincere make it and society her as "schizophrenic". The end made me confused in the first place, but then you realized that my courage and sincere faith had her where she wanted to go. She found what she was looking for, not caring what society had to comment on her search. And these are the seemingly 'real' people - Anjali, the psychiatrist and yoyo - who never reach anywhere. My family thinks I'm also schizophrenic to try and make sense of a movie that is largely "insane" for the rest of the world. Ionone willing to believe in my sense of reality ......... ..?
