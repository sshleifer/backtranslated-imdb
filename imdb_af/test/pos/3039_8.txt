Not only do I consider it the best film ever made by Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home), but a real tribute to teachers. <br /> <br /> Despite incredible chances, Pat Conroy (Voight) has succeeded in reaching a group of students and bringing them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods are criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs such as Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners. <br /> <br /> Voight really showed that he had love for teaching and that it was, of course, high for him. He didn't overshoot the role, and I found him to be completely credible. Voight is Conrack. <br /> <br /> Apart from a love of education, we also see an important point in this movie. No matter how good you are at work, if you rock the boat, the bureaucrats will get you.
