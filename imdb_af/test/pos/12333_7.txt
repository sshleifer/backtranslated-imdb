As part of an initiative film July (Meg Tilly or Psycho 2), spend the night in a mausoleum, but Karl Rhamarevich, a master of telekinesis, recently died and was brought in. When Julie's fellow master profaned sisters where he started the real terror. <br /> <br /> This little movie had a lot of atmosphere and I enjoyed building up, plus the last twenty minutes is just fine. Anyone looking for a lost gem of an '80s horror movie doesn't have to look any further. Very understated. Plus Elizabeth Daily is rich. <br /> <br /> My Grade: B <br /> Media Blaster DVD Extras: CD 1) Comment with director Tom McLoughlin and co-author Michael Hawes; and trailers for "The Being", "Frankestien's Bloody Terror", "Just Before Dawn" and "Devil Dog" disc 2) Alternative director's cut (it is almost irreconcilable due to bad print) & Behind the scenes featurette
