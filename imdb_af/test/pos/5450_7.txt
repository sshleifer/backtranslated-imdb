It's a clever and entertaining movie about the backdrop that picks a sequel to Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show. However, the film's eventual thesis, which overlooked David Letterman's superior comic talents over his controversial nature, and the performance diminished by the collapse of inferior Jay Leno in the premier television comedy program, is simply false since anyone who has both watched Leno and Letterman perform can see for themselves. The hard and simple truth is exactly like one NBC exek that is called in the movie. "Jay Leno is the funniest man in America." And David Letterman is not. Once you realize it, much of the turn in the movie becomes irrelevant. Eventually, the whole movie comes from Letterman fans, just like sour grapes, which just can't assume that the better comedian was chosen by people whose business it is to know these kinds of things. The final proof is that, despite Letterman's early lead, possibly due to the hype emerging from the battle for Tonight Show succession, Leno's performance appears to be consistent, the more popular it is, so in my mind, to unfairly disprove Letterman's claims deprived of his rightful inheritance.
