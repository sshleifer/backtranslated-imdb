It's a good movie to watch as it's so beautifully directed by Andrzej Wajda, but at the same time, I wanted the movie to have a little more depth in terms of its story. It's a historically relevant film about the last days of the French Revolution, but the film forgets to focus on the character's motivation that might make the movie a bit too shallow to view it as a brilliant and relevant movie. /> Somehow it doesn't make the movie any less good to watch. It is made with passion and attention to detail. Every aspect of the movie looks good, like its settings, costumes and camera work. <br /> <br /> The story also continues to work vigorously, although at the same time it could have been so much better and more powerful with a little more character development and insight historical information. Guess if you are quite familiar with the French Revolution and the stories of Danton and Robespierre in particular, this movie will be a perfect one to watch. <br /> <br /> It is somewhat typical that a French movie tells a story slowly and subtly, without ever going too much in detail. Often, it works charmingly, but in this case the movie could really have done with a little more depth. Unlike this, this movie is still a good example of the French film, despite the fact that a Polish director and star also directed many Polish actors in it. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is great in his role, although the film also decides to focus on many other characters. The movie may have a bit too many characters, but each performance is a good one, so it doesn't really get a big deal, unlike delaying it, the story did a bit at certain points. <br /> <br /> A great movie that could be brilliant. <br /> <br /> 8/10
