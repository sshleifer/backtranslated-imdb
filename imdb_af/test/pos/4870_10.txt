OK, so in any Wile E. Coyote Road Runner cartoon, we know that WEC will set up all kinds of falls for RR, but always have to man in different ways. This certainly happens in "Beep, Beep". Predictable? I think that is, but when you think about it, these cartoons show the more you harm someone else, the more you get hurt; kind of like how Daffy Duck always tries to undermine Bugs Bunny's integrity, but Bugs are concerned. <br /> Overall, this is another classic from the Termite Terrace crowd. Sometimes I think if we really wanted to save the Cold War tensions, we could only have the Soviet Union a sign of Looney Tunes cartoons; I'm sure they loved them. Another great one. <br /> <br /> PS: I learned about "Jeopardy!" that Wile E. Coyote's middle name is Ethelbert.
