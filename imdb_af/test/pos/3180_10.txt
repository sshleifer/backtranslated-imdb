I remember coming from school to look after it. It was the story of a black family moving out of the gheto into a class community. The family was Wilson Frank Wilson, a man with his own building business. His wife, Joyce, was a bank manager. they had 3 teens Kevin Valerie and Marcus. It was a very good performance. It was educational without preaching. The show was well written. This show gives us a glimpse of a successful African American before the Cosby Show. Many of a black actor appeared on this show from Esther Role to David Hubberd to 227 Stonnie Jackson to name a few. If you can find this show on DVD, get it for your whole family
