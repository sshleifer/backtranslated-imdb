Good Movie, acting mainly from Eriq Ebouaney (Lumumba) and very well directed. <br /> <br /> It also shows how Lumumba was saved by the Belgians, the US and the United Nations and how they made him a "communist" to scare people as they did to all the honest true African leaders like Nkrumah , Kenyatta, Nyerere and many others did. It shows how Western countries proclaim democracy while they have something different on their heads. This is a story of injustice, struggle and brutality. It shows how Lumumba couldn't control his people, yes they were his people. But before we get the blame on him, does he get enough of any of the people he has appointed in his government like Mobutu? Whether his colleague had other things in their minds, to find out, check out and watch the movie! Certainly, Mobutu, has plundered the country for the next 35 years before he overturned and fled the country. A billionaire dead. <br /> <br /> Some mistakes: There was too little explanation on how the man (Lumumba) should rise in the first place. There had to be more explanation about the country, Congo Kinshasa (after independence), now known as Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as Zaire when it was under Mobutu. There had to be an explanation why he (Lumumba) couldn't hold the second largest country in Africa in one piece. And also what happened to Tshombe and Katanga. Just stop watching the movie that Tshombe controlled the Katanga region, which (if I'm not wrong) is the world's number one copper producer. <br /> <br /> In all, it's a good movie to watch. You will learn something new about Africa, these are leaders and they are people and will probably open your eyes to why this continent is being waged.
