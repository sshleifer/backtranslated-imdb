Barry Champlain is a radio telephone call host in Dallas, whose ideas on a variety of social issues disturb and offend many of his callers and listeners. Is Barry a media messiah looking for the truth, or a social mistake to attack his audience? <br /> <br /> It is an intense, challenging character piece about a man with almost no redeeming features that at the same time seems to be on a very profound philosophy. Although co-written and directed by Stone, it is really Bogos's piece altogether and gives an astonishing, loud and intrusive performance that has no escape. Barry is sometimes one of the most horrible characters imaginable, spitting out angry misanthropy at all around him, especially those who care for him. But at the same time he is also oddly empathetic, hypnotic, sage, even sweet. Bogosse's hawkish features burned in the frame, with its green eyes constantly moving around as if they were constantly looking for an answer to a mystery. The movie is basically an angry, self-righteous riot against all the dwarf, injustice and banality in the world, leading to a wild three-and-a-half rotating single shot from Barry, delivering the ultimate I-hate speech . but boy grab it a punch. The support cast is great, especially Greene as the ex-wife and Baldwin as the boss. Robert Richardson's desire to preserve photography holds that the single radio studio set is interesting and there is a tense score by Stewart Copeland, with a moving coda with the engaging music piece, Telephone And Rubber Band at The Penguin Cafe Orchestra. If you are unfamiliar with Bogosse, watch his incredible talent in this movie - such as his contemporaries, Bill Hicks and Denis Leary, he is rarely seen in the mainstream media because his writing is there. I find Stone's movies variable; I don't care much for his great successes, but if he is more commanded and objective, like this (or Salvador and Nixon), he is much more vivid and captivating. A good primary scream of a picture, based on a play by Bogosse, inspired by the true story of Alan Berg, a radio talk-image host in Denver murdered by neo-Nazis in 1984.
