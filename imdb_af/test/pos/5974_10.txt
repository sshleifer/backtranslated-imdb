The Ascent (1977) <br /> <br /> Larisa Shepitko is a very little known name. Her shiny career as a director lasted only a few decades, and suddenly ended with a tragic car accident. However, despite her short career, she has succeeded in creating some of the best Soviet films of her time. Her last film, The Ascending, is widely regarded as one of the best Soviet films of the 1970s. However, her work has remained unclear in recent years, usually only available on scarce and poor video copies. It has now changed, thanks to the people at Criterion. They released two of Shepitko's best works by their Eclipse section - Wings, and her penultimate masterpiece The Ascending. <br /> <br /> During the darkest days of World War II in snowy rural Russia, two parties are moving across the country in search of food after their party has been attacked by Nazi patrols. They are originally just to go to a nearby farm, but when they arrive, they find it destroyed by the Germans. If they do not want to return empty hands, they continue in the area of ​​the enemy. Along the way they should not only confront enemy soldiers, but also the difficult circumstances of the Russian plains, potential betrayal and their own souls. <br /> <br /> The movie does not fall into simplistic plot devices or destinations. It addresses difficult questions with painful rationality. It never takes the easy path or gives us comforting answers. The second half of the film is filled with moral dilemmas. Shepitko shows us the intimate horrors of the war by the internal conflict between fellow Russians - those who worked together and those who fought back. However, while showing the coworkers as the clear heels, she also shows why many survived such tactics. <br /> <br /> The film contains a number of religious references, especially to the crucifixion. It is a spiritual journey, in the hearts, souls and thoughts of the two partisans and those who experience them. Shepitko and her kinographer take the journey in beautiful black and white photography. The camera moves in long shots, similar to the camera work of another of Russia's greatest filmmakers, Andrei Tarkovsky. Shepitko, like many others, is clearly influenced by Tarkovsky's style, and takes the Ascent from his rhythmic notes of Ivan's Childhood. It's a beautiful movie to watch and does a great job of capturing the cold and frightening atmosphere of occupied Russia. <br /> <br /> A decade later, Shepitko's husband will pay their honor to her big movie. Elem Klimov made his own war masterpiece with one of the greatest movies I've ever seen - Come and See. The story and themes of that movie are clearly influenced by The Ascent. Although that movie is also a pretty dark one, it received much more attention than any of Shepitko's films. However, it acted as a bridge for Shepitko and was one of the best help to keep her work alive. <br /> <br /> The Ascent is a great movie and should be considered one of the 70's best films. It's wonderful cinematography is inspiring; his mood is terribly authentic; and his lessons are memorable. It is, in any definition of the word, nothing less than a masterpiece. How sorry Shepitko's career has been cut, just as it strikes its peak.
