Usually I'm a typical "creepy-crawly-hatin" girl, but after watching this movie (of course on YouTube) I have different perspectives. And I also didn't know that my favorite animation studio - Fleischer's made another movie about the community of insects whose city garden's house is threatened by humans (light cigars and cigarette butts, footsteps, etc.) And how? a soft young locust named Hoppity saves the day and wins the heart of the honey; I love the beautiful Mevrou. You know, after watching the movie, the bugs remind me of Don Bulth's Thumbelina's jitter bugs. And from the songs in the movie, I love "We are a couple in the castle;" when I sang the song it almost cried me. <br /> <br /> This wonderful movie was the second (and last) feature to come out of the Fleischer studio. The film was originally released on November 1941, but since the Fleischer rival, Disney, earlier issued Dumbo weeks, Paramount changed the date to December of the same year, but Mr. Unfortunately, Bug fell into a then unrealized fall. of horrible timing. Mr. Bug had the accident two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Mr. Bug was a financial disaster and resulted in Max and Dave Fleischer wiping out the studio they founded in 1919 and reorganizing the company as Famous Studios. Another big factor in their departure was the fact that Max and Dave Fleischer were no longer talking to each other because of disputes (how sad it was). Overall I love both movies of the Fleischer Bros. - Gulliver and Mr. Bug.
