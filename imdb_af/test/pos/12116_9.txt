It was a good anime. True, the animation is old, but it's still worth watching and has a better plot than Ninja Scroll, the problem it was so long. <br /> <br /> Japanese movie star Hiroyuki Sanada, who played Ujio from Last Samurai, played the main character Jiro and it was directed by Rintaro who did Galaxy Express 999 and Metropolis. <br /> <br /> The anime has a good animation for an old anime, interesting characters like the main villain Tenkai and Ando Shouzan and of course, we should not forget. the beautiful musical scores in the movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is worth watching for fans of anime, animation in general, action and Samurai / Ninja flicks. Despite the lows in the film that was not the movie to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie.
