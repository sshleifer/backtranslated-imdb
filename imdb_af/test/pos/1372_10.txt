I have to admit that I know of the people involved. I was in the forefront of The Planet, Evil Unleased, but it was over 10 years ago and I've lost contact with them ever since. I heard BBC News watching and a piece about Scottish Cinema, which is called and has clips from The Planet and comments from its director Mark Stirton, asked me to order a copy of the movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> Now, the level of acting, writing, directing and sfx is there with some of the best around. OK, it's not Star Wars, but I've seen a Hollywood product that is far inferior. It is very strange to see a movie in my local North-East Scottish accent, but it soon passed. <br /> <br /> ^ Mild Spoilers ^ <br /> <br /> The Planet draws on various scientific classics; Star Wars, Alien, Pitch Black, Forbidden Planet and Predator, a handful of deep space shuttle crew members, survive their vessels that are attacked and destroyed by unknown ships, escaping on a deserted desert plan, one by one they become murdered by invisible attackers, the ship's only passenger, a mysterious prisoner, also makes it on the planet, a battle occurs as the crew member to survive. <br /> <br /> The planet is a brilliant piece of sci-fi film that makes it. definitely hide it's limited budget, well done to Mark, Mike and all those involved, I'm looking forward to your next job.
