My God, Ryan Gosling has made many characters in his career, this is one of his wonderful acting works. For me it is a very deep film, much concentration needed, not because it is difficult to watch, just because you understand it when you put your shoes in this child, even if everything and has a well-known dad author is. A deeper mind, you do not understand why he kills this poor child, until you really hear what he has to say and at least you think many things he says are true. Simple child, sweet, very gentle, in a way like any teenager, but inside him suffers because he is looking at the world in another way, then you understand why he did what he did. I recommend this movie to those who love deep drama.
