There is no other word for it. Fox poured it out, with no marketing of any kind. No one in the country, except those looking forward to this movie, knows nothing about it. All the red flags flew. It must be a mess, it can't be anywhere as good as Office Space, right? Wrong. Although Office Space is not, this movie certainly has satirical bites and whites. It is a blemish at certain levels, but whose fault is hidden. <br /> <br /> Based on what is currently in theaters, I can say IDIOCRACY is a good movie. It's funny, sometimes laughing out loud. It is effective, sometimes ingenious. What it's not as far as I can tell is finished. We'll see something coming from this movie again, whether it's an extended track or repeat. Even if it's hilarious. It is sometimes cold. <br /> <br /> Leaving the scene, surrounded by the mall, I am surrounded by advertising and billboards, commercialism and stupidity. It's not quite such a dystopia as 1984, but this movie refines an ugly future for our culture. And there doesn't seem to be much that anyone can do about it. Anyway, check it out if you can and try to find out what happened to be so specifically buried.
