I have to admit I didn't come around to see this movie in the theater. When released at the start of a summer season season, this cute movie can't help but it's lost in the shadow of a million million special effects movie? <br /> <br /> "Return to Me" has a wonderful and simple story in its core and is extremely well-directed and written by Bonnie Hunt (who was in a number of great photos as an actress himself.) Along with this one!) The beautiful intertwine is beautifully woven with clever comedy and is lively with great performances by veterans as well as younger actors. <br /> <br /> For those who say David Duchovny didn't really have a good chance of breaking out his "Fox Mulder" form, I agree. I saw his other film work and is by far the best thing he did for himself. Minnie Driver is simply beautiful, charming, funny and alive in her role as Grace. <br /> <br /> Outside these two, you are surrounded by Grace's family and friends. Jim Belushi is an absolute sting, Bonnie Hunt is a stable and real force. However, I can't leave without the talents of Robert Loggia and beloved Carroll O'Connor. Ironically, I watched this movie again on DVD the day before he died. It was his last film, and he gave a show that an actor of his caliber can definitely be proud of going to the finals after a good career. <br /> Overall, "Return To Me" has changed what would have been just a fun love story and has grown into a movie that has become one of my favorites! Take the time rent this one ..... it's worth it!
