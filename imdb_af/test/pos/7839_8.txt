First of all, I would like to begin by saying it is a refreshing start to seeing a British drama that eventually looks and feels credible. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart plays the role of justice as (Ian Hood), the government's science advisor, with his constant and unwavering view of authority and thoughts about the future of the "real world" science and how he feels . used or abused by others. <br /> <br /> Not only are the castings maintained throughout the series, but their characters seem more credible than most other British dramas. <br /> <br /> Ashley Jensen also presents a first-rate performance as Dr. Hood's designated bodyguard (Rachael Young). She brings a refreshing approach to the unscientific, uninteresting everyday views of science, and her continuous struggle with Hood makes for some very funny and unforgettable moments between them. <br /> <br /> The way the series holds all the scientific elements more realistically. I find positive and more attractive than the psychobabble we are so accustomed to other fiction or science fiction TV shows. . <br /> <br /> There are, however, significant disappointments with the series. Every time an episode ends, I find myself disappointed that they don't look all the aspects of the plot and sometimes release unresolved stories. <br /> <br /> Although we keep in mind that this is still the first series, I hope that in the near future we will get a return where these open end stories can finally get a meaningful conclusion that they rightly deserve . <br /> <br /> For those who enjoy more slow science-related plot lines, this is the ideal view to watch as it always remains truly credible and more important.
