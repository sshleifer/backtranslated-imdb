I never really knew if I kept this documentary or not. It is shown on Channel 4 before a cut-off version of Revelations, and is on the Revelations video tape before the uncut display. The documentaries are basically friends of Bill who say how good he was for an hour with video clips of the show being mixed, a bit like a trailer for the movie you're going to watch. It also features David Letterman who, as a worm for Bill's spill from his show before he died, is the reason? Bill made a joke about how Pro-Life had to pick funerals, and Letterman had pro-life advertising. Anyway, watch out for the video because Revelations is Bill's best ranting :)
