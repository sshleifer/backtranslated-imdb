Earl Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) has just been transferred to a hospital in Italy during World War II. He is terribly burned by an ambush. His nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) tends to incline him, body and mind because his fear is right that he can be a very upset soul. In the course of his care, Earl Hana began to tell of his recent past. He seems to have worked in a governmental capacity in Africa, where he met a beautiful married woman named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a brief case, Katherine ended and left the spade. Still, the two will meet again under heartbreaking circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana herself falls for a Sihk man in the British bombing group. Yet the war is ruthlessly furious. Can love exist if the world is in turmoil? It's a great movie, based on an equally fine but complex novel. The plot has many story lines that are beautifully woven together, each of them above the description. The writing itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is wonderful, both as the burnt offering and if the man who loved it was a myth. Scott Thomas is also very good as the woman fighting her passions. As far as Binoche is concerned, she earned the Oscar she presented abundantly, as her nurse is a shining example of hope in a hopeless situation. The landscape is absolutely beautiful, like the costumes, the direction and the production. If you miss viewing this movie, fix it soon, very soon. The English Patient will be one of the greatest achievements in the film for centuries.
