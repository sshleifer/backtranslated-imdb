On Thursday it is clearly derived from the 'new wave' of crime films released since Quentin Tarantino in the early nineties stormed the genre with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but it has enough ideas to make it an interesting little movie remains. On Thursday, a few characters usually use a single place. It works because every character is special enough in their own right to be memorable, and when composed, it is a very amusing little thriller. There is little substance in the plot, but it doesn't matter, because no one is in this kind of movie that expects a life-reducing experience. The plot follows Casey; A former drug dealer who went straight and now lives with his wife as a successful architect in suburbs. The two want to adopt a child, but things become disgusting when Casey receives a visit from his old crime partner, Nick. He brought a case of heroine and a load of money stolen from the police. Thursday is going to be a very interesting day for our former criminals ... <br /> <br /> The first scene sets the film beautiful and assures us that we know what to expect. We see a coffee order going wrong, which becomes a murder scene that immediately covers the culprits when a police arrives for refreshments. The scene is soaked with dark humor and humorous dialogues, and it is performed throughout the rest of the movie. Thursday is a very funny movie, and scenes like those that the adoption visitor sees come at an awkward time to ensure the movie is hard to keep. It is true that the film does not bring anything new to the table, slides or sudden, but the fact that it is fortunate to flush makes more time for the absurd situation of building the central characters. The actor is decent enough, with the whole role of this plot enjoying fun. Thomas Jane starred in the film, while amusing depictions of James LeGros, Paulina Porizkova, Michael Jeter, Glenn Plummer and Mickey Rourke recovered. This movie will probably not impress the renowned movie lover, but if you just want an amusing little movie with some nice twists and turns, Thursday is probably enough.
