Already in one country, Spain, Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali combined to establish the benchmark of short-term, cinematic surrealism, Un Chien Andalou, Walt Disney and his associate Ub Iwerks in America on Steamboat Willie, the most prominent of the earliest synchronized sound characters (it was revealed that this was not the first, unlike other reports). It is also one of the more successful simplistic and funny of the Mickey Mouse shorts (still in a silent movie - the only sounds are tiny irks and Mickey and animal diapers). It will also run pretty fast for its less than ten minutes. But in these minutes, one gets the immediate sense of how much Disney has its characters, and how the new-found use of sound changes how its creation uses animals as musical instruments. There is no story to talk about, just random things that happen and happen because of Mickey (err, Steamboat Willie) on this boat on a river. And like the better Mickey Mouse shorts, its lack of talk plays an advantage. It's a must-see if you haven't seen it as a child, but if you have it, it might be worth a look.
