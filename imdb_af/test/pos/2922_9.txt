It often happens, while a Hollywood movie grows up, impresses a youngster. It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspires him to study ancient cultures as a career. So was the case, with the 1954 film titled "The Egyptian." Obedience was rid of the sets, costumes and great acting of this film. So many other films soon followed in vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who grew older shortly after he was born. With such a dubious start it is not difficult to wonder why he would spend his life and ask questions. The son Sinuhe, which means, "He who is alone" (Edmund Purdom) grows to masculinity and continues to ask why, even if he graduates from The School of Life to become a doctor. During his formative years he gained a lifelong friend named Kaptah who was brilliantly played by (Peter Ustinov), and Horemheb (Victor Mature) who rose from a simple officer of the bodyguard to the commander-in-chief of the army. His life offers everything from a rapid increase in social status to convicted criminals, wiped out, a marvelous healer, and finally to a life station he never expected. Fine acting goes to Jean Simmons as Merit, Michael Wilding as Akhnaton, Bella Darvi as the requester, Nefer, and John Carradine as a memorable grave robber. Tommy Rettig, plays Thoth, the son of the Egyptian. In his last years, "He who is alone," finally finds out the answer that he is trying to find his whole life, which he bequeaths to his son, now in the care of his lifelong friend. Excellent movie! ****
