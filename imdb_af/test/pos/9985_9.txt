First of all, it is a good, exciting story, with well-developed characters. But all the other details are well-crafted, leading to a great movie. Don't let the Disney label guide you to think it's dumbed-down or just for kids - it offers a lot to all ages, whether you want golf or not. One of the more impressive things is that the movie manages to make a golf game look very exciting. And if one of the many who can't stay on golf is not a little thing. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie does a great job of explaining the basic characters with their motivation and backgrounds, enough to end up enjoying all the important rivals once the spin moves halfway through. Sure, you're rooting for Ouimet's character already, but his primary opponents are nice and interesting in their own right. The background layer is important once the golf game becomes a game that uses mind as well as golf clubs, as you get a good understanding of what each person's strengths and weaknesses are as the game progresses. <br /> <br /> The computer effects are flashy, but they help the story more often than not. The directing has all sorts of smart golf shots, and the costumes and sets are really great. <br /> <br /> There are a few small sticks - many of the small characters seem to be a bit too stereotypical from class warfare, but it is forgiven with the great characters so well drawn. <br /> <br /> Playing Shia LaBoeuf Francis Ouimet is as usual ridiculous and sympathetic. But the right look is Steven Dillane, Harry Vardon. He rarely moves his face, but his intense, often sad, eyes and small changes of expression say so much. <br /> <br /> Ouimet's caddy Eddie Lowery, played by Josh Flitter, steals the scenes he is in. After seeing the movie, Google found the real photo of Ouimet and Lowery at the tournament, to get an even better appreciation for how amazing this game really was.
