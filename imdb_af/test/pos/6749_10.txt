This is an excellent B-movie horror movie that borders on horror and comedy. It's about a genetically mutilated scorpion in outer space. Can it become more unreal? It's a hybrid between "Alien" and "Chain Saw Massacre." The film was shot in Stockholm with a mixed role-players of Americans and Swedes communicating with each other. Director Martin Munthe is doing a great job getting the comic highlights in this screenplay and getting some good laughs from the audience. The movie is shot with little or no money and it is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources. Stinger has all the features of a B-movie horror movie. It's comic and scary at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause. It's great to see that movies like this can still be made! I would recommend seeing them if you like these movies.
