This movie is based on the true story of Christopher Boyce and his friend, Daunton Lee. This fascinating story takes place around the time of the Whitlam dismissal, in which Christopher, during his time as a clerk for TRW, was receiving classified correspondence that recognized the CIA's involvement in Australian political and union circles. The movie shows several scenes involving Gough Whitlam (transmitted over American TV) where events occur that confirm the classified documents Christopher had previously read. The removal of Gough Whitlam was an organized CIA coup. Elsewhere in the film, it was mentioned that most people have no idea of ​​the level of fraud involved, ultimately ensuring that the US is used as a vehicle to promote certain policies at the request of all. In the present time nothing has changed. <br /> <br /> Christopher's life is deeply affected, read shocked, by his knowledge of what and how the CIA forms foreign democracies, including the democracies of Allied nations to the United States. Christopher responded, probably not in the best way, by selling top secret information to the Soviet Union with Daunton Lee acting as his exchange. Finally Christopher and Daunton were caught and condemned for treason. <br /> <br /> On May 23, 1982, Christopher Boyce agreed to be an only interview with Ray Martin of 60 minutes Australia. the Australian connection that has affected him deeply. It caused a turmoil in the Australian media for about a week, then it became quiet. <br /> <br /> I like the movie's symbolism of the falcon, and in it Chris is called the Falcon, and Daunton the Snowman connection), but in fact the title "Falcon" was not something Chris used no. <br /> <br /> Christopher Boyce: Criminal or Man of conscience?
