Good drama / comedy, with two good performances by Hunter & Hurt, but Albert Brooks steals every scene he is in. With a big screenplay, roll the movie and give everyone the opportunity to show their plays. And although Joan Cusack is not that much, she has one or even the funniest scene in the movie. The highlight of the movie for me was Albert Brooks's talk about the devil. Just one time back is the fact that it goes a little slow in places. And I was only quite interested in Brooks's role, not so much in Hunter's or Hurt's. I give it a 7 out of 10.
