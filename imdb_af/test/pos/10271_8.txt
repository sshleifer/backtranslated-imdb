A smooth production that holds the interest of the very first scene where Max picks up a ring in a jewelry store. Many of the following remind us of Shakespeare's "A Mid-Summer Night's Dream" in which Demetrius and Lysander fall in love with each other's girls. Here, Max and Lucien are both inclined to love Lisa and Alice at first sight, and Alice complicates things when she calls herself Lisa. In addition, Max tends to get involved in incidents that brought memories two years ago. And because Max has many of these dreamy episodes, we are flashing one back to the other topic, too much to my opinion, because at the first show of the movie I wasn't quite sure whether I was in the present or past. There are many running corridors, stairs, doors, elevators etc. I accept everything in a fast-paced movie, but do we have to clash with so many people? After four clashes, if you excuse the pun, it will stop having any impact. High points for art design! The apartment itself is really nice with its tasteful decor, but I wonder how some young women can afford such luxury in Paris. Jumping a person's intent to attempt suicide to jump out of a window is always exciting and it is also in this movie that Max goes out almost at the same time. But a kiss or two soon makes him better. If you manage to find all the flashbacks, you'll eventually find yourself at the airport where Max's dedicated sister gives him a loving kiss. It can be said that she is the one who solves the complications of love, such as Puck in a "Mid-summer Night's Dream".
