After three outstanding BBC television series' and a Christmas Specialist, the bizarre and grotesque (but perverted) characters of the dark fictional town of Royston Vasey make the leap to celluloid, along with their creators - The League of Gentlemen. <br /> <br /> Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are the more well-known three-quarters of the four, with the central roles shared between the trio. In a further turn, the last member of the team - Jeremy Dyson - is portrayed by actor Michael Sheen. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Dyson (Sheen) is in conversation with his writing cohorts, when - horror of horrors - he is visited by two of his worst characters. Both Tubbs (Pemberton) and Edward Tattsyrup (Shearsmith) are unhappy with The League's decision to kill the Vasey residents. "You're not really!" Dyson shouts in vain, as the local shopkeepers from hell make up their revenge. Mayhem follows, as reality and Vasey joins with the vast array of characters entering our world to save them. <br /> <br /> Confused? You will be, like the camp, the innuendo-hidden Teutonic, Herr Lipp (Pemberton) is forced to accept the daily cover of Pemberton (Pemberton), while Pemberton (Pemberton) is kidnapped by the cannibalist butcher Hillary Briss (Gatiss ) and Geoff Tipps (Shearsmith). <br /> <br /> With shades of even more demented misery, Briss Pemberton is trying to rewrite the movie - thus continuing his life - but it's never a good idea to leave Geoff. The former comedian is used in The League's latest, post-vase adventure - The King's Evil - in a typically turned 17th-century England, complete with Victoria Wood's cameos, Peter Kay and David Warner. Geoff, known as George of Asda (due to his chosen line of clothes), saves the day and is treated as a hero, but for the unbundling of the film he closes old and old characters at the church of Royston Vasey to their makers. <br /> <br /> For the fans of the series, the movie is a must see. And yes, that means Papa Lazarou (though it is a bit too brief). Pen-loving Pauline, Mickey, Barbara and the cursed veterinarian Matthew Chinnery are among the other favorites at the show, and The League's portrayal of themselves (plus Sheen's as Dyson) is also a fascinating insight. <br /> <br /> The League of People is the Radiohead or British Comedy - they are ambitious, groundbreaking (testifying to the excellent Three series) and not happy to rest on their laurels. They also divide the opinion accordingly. <br /> <br /> Certainly, their macabre sense of humor isn't for every palate, and although it's not just written for "fans," a grasp of the storyline will benefit those who have previously watched. series. Nevertheless, Apocalypse is a film in its own right and The League will undoubtedly succeed in attracting a new fan, as well as attracting the existing pleasant and pleasant actors.
