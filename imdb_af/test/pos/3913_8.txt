I think anyone who's dumb enough to be a laundry dummy, just like they can go to a soccer match, or they don't want their car to leave to escape, deserves everything that happens to them. <br /> <br /> The guy, Wade who "went to a barber shop and asked for the Hair Man hairstyle" was not my kind, but there is this very cute scene of his making his eyebrows and hair has. This is a little too high for me. <br /> <br /> Also fun, but not my kind is the big guy in the big sunglasses that looks like Elton John, but only gayer, but the whole plot goes nowhere! <br /> <br /> Blake was hot, I could see him with him if he wasn't in his girlfriend, which is a nasty Paris Hilton in a wig (no Chihuahaua in her handbag, though would have been really precious). I don't think girls like this are going to soccer matches anyway. Nick the car thief is the sexiest! One of the best parts is where a football is landing at him, and instead of throwing it back, he puts out his cigarette and burns the football. See, it's just the kind of guy he is. He has a sister who looks dumb at his white wife. Her bra straps show, like 1/2 the movie! <br /> <br /> Usually you just want to wake your legs and never go to soccer matches after you have seen them.
