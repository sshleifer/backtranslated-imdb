I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen telling of a friendship story shared by the war. The costumes are great, the story lines are good, I love how the story goes from character to character to guess what is going to happen next in their lives. There is a good balance of good and evil. Some of the evil characters are too good not to look at. Every time something more despicable than the last happens, I curse the TV as if they can hear me. I love how these miniseries make me engage in the drama. However, I would recommend NOT watching the third movie in the DVD series. This is a decrease compared to the first two movies and most of the original characters do not come back. I don't want to remember how the third movie ended, I prefer to live with the thoughts of the end in the second movie. It makes me happy.
