Whatever you do, don't stop watching if you think the movie is over! Hang out for the first group of credits or you'll miss something! We saw this movie at the Savanaah Film Festival and thought it was the best of the bunch. Dreya Weber is really a wonder, not only because of her performance, but because she can pull it so far above the ground. At the Q&A she said there were no wires or effects, so everything you see is really her. Addie couldn't make it to the festival because she was dancing with Madonna. She was excellent and my gawd was so beautiful. I was surprised that the movie went so well with the blue haired lady crowd, but there you have it, Savannnah is not a water.
