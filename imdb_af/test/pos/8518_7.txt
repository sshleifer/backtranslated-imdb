1983 was "the battle of the Bonds". That year, both Roger Moore and Sean Connery played in two separate James Bond films. The former (Octopussy) was produced by the "official" makers of the Bond films while the latter (Never Say Never Again) led "non-official" by a group by Kevin McClory, who held the movie rights on Thunderball. Surprisingly, the "unofficial" movie is better despite the obvious mistake and the fact that Never Say Never Again is a repeat of Thunderball. <br /> <br /> Never say never again has the distinction between sports one of the best roles ever made for a Bond movie. It starts with Sean Connery, who returns to the play Bond for the first time since 1971's Diamonds Are Forever. Connery can be older, then he was but he looks better here, then he did in Diamonds Forever. Never Say Never Again is the slender and dangerous shark of Dr. No or From Russia With Love, just a few years older. Connery's delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead as ever. The one downside of Connery's age is his credibility, especially when it comes to the ladies of the movie. Let's even look at Connery, despite being in physical shape, looks as strange as Moore when he covers women half of his age. Despite this credibility issue, Never Say Never Again, Connery shows in one of his better Bond performances and a definite improvement on his two previous Bond performances. <br /> <br /> Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of her early films. Bassinger plays the role with great confidence for a family member, and she makes the character credible. Bassinger holds her own against her fellow stars and also has considerable chemistry with them. In fact, she can surprise her Thunderball counterpart played by Claudine Auger. <br /> <br /> Then there is the villain Maximilian Largo played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer's Largo is all that a James Bond movie cork should be: suave, charming, evil and above all credible. Brandauer makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap. Many other Bond villains fell by going to the top. Brandauer plays in many opponents of 007 Largo with a silent threat and charisma. <br /> <br /> The excellent roll throw also extends into the supporting role. Barbara Carrera makes good hands in Fatima Blush and the screen lights when she appears. Max Von Sydow is a beautiful appearance to Blofeld, although his appearance is more akin to a cameo. Rowan Atkinson makes an appearance as Bond's bumbling contact that makes some of the best scenes in the film. With all that culminates in the supporting film of the MI6 staff of Edward Fox's M, it is a great contrast to Bernard Lee, Pamela Salem, who makes his sweet Moneypenny and the icing on the cake with Alec McCowen's wonderful Q. has some misfires in the form of Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter and Gavin O'Herlihy as Jack Petachi, who both lack credibility in their respective roles. Otherwise, this movie sport is one of the best works ever created for a Bond movie. <br /> <br /> On top of an excellent film, the film has several other essential ingredients. From the successive Central America sequel to the battle against Shrublands after the underwater rows and motorcycle hunting, it is a movie where action ranges are not only great, but also largely serving the plot. The movie also plays good special effects in terms of cross-rocket models, explosions and all the things we expect from a Bond movie. Irvin Kershner, then careful to make the Empire Strikes Back, brings a tight direction to the film, especially in sequences such as the substation of nuclear heads and the subsequent theft of the cruise missiles. <br /> <br /> But this movie is far from perfect. Never say never again is easily one of the most dated of the Bond movies with its heavy use of 1980's computer sand video games. While technology makes a movie after a while, this film's strong confidence in it, especially in the hijacking of the cross missiles and the Domination sequence, is the movie after the release of the film about a quarter of a century. The writing is also likely to be predictable due to the fact that it is a reminder of Thunderball. <br /> <br /> Yet, for its predictability, the script for Never Say Never Again is pretty good. The scripting is a good dialogue, not a single running liner (how many of Roger Moore's magazines can you say?), Some humorous situations, and most of them awake and tense. As soon as you look past, it's a remake, there are a lot of good things in the screenplay for the movie. <br /> <br /> Music is actually the biggest weakness of the movie. Due to the "unofficial" status of the movie, the James Bond theme could not be used. It said it could have shown to the right composer that a Bond score can work without it. Unfortunately, Michael Legrand's score is far from adequate. Legrand's score is completely out of place in a Bond movie and there are only two places where it really works. To make matters worse, the film has also been hit by one of the worst title series ever to be a James Bond movie. <br /> <br /> Despite being heavily dated, somewhat predictable and having a bad score. still a good Bond movie. With one of the best works of any Bond movie, good action series, good special effects, good direction and a great dialogue, this movie proves that "unofficial" is not bad. In fact, it's better than Octopussy and the "Battle of the League" winner.
