Ingrid Bergman, dentist Walter Matthau's faithful receptionist, who gets a little loved one on her boss, is absolutely wonderful in this movie. She handles the spectacular reptile in writing with aplomb and steals a terrific scene where she and Goldie Hawn speak in a stall (Ingrid's monologue is a front, but her face tells you she believes in it with her whole heart). Matthau is a strange choice for the front man (he is too old for Goldie Hawn and too unfinished for Bergman, not too unknown to be a dentist), but I like the way he tries hard to please and stumble Goldie to try to release. himself a lie. Hawn (who won a supporting Oscar) is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today. This room is not terribly sophisticated (and also reminds one of "Any Wednesday"), but it is a welcome relief from the noisy, teen-oriented comedies they perform today. "Cactus Flower" is a beautiful sigh! *** of ****
