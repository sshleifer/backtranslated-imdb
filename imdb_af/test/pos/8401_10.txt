My God, it was a fantastic movie. Every time we look, we take us to another place of WOW. Rhett & Scarlett is brilliantly played by Joanne & Timothy. They did a fantastic job reviewing the roles of our two favorite hero's. Everyone! This is a must see ..... Don't get rid of this movie. If you loved Gone With The Wind, you'll love this mini series. Go Rhett !!! Go Scarlet !!!
