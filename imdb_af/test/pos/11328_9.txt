The plot of "In the Mood for Love" is simple enough: A married man and a married woman (but not one to another) slowly develop a romantic attachment to one another. The movie's performance is slow and precious little happens between the two. However, the background of Hong Kong in the early 1960s and director Wong Kar-Wai's fine feel to determine the beauty of the environment as well as the main characters to see this film. Actors Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are both excellent and Wong Kar-Wai has done an extraordinary job of capturing the feelings and nostalgia of the past (something that so many films and directors are trying to do, but usually fail). There are so many small details that add charm to the movie (a trademark of the director) and the colors and film art that send this other simple story above as a wonderful cinematic achievement. 9/10.
