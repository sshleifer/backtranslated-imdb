many people said that this movie was not a good movie, with a horrible point of view I agree, it was not very scary, it had horrible ways of torture (brackets where they should not), but not scary. but it was a good movie on a comic standpoint, i thought it was hilarious, so bad of the dee-sniper with his stupid theological questioning and every second word he said came out as "what is _____ defining _____ ", then the fierce mob at his house with one of them is a sign saying," We're not going to take it "(it's a song from his band, a twisted sister.) But I think the part who made me laugh most was the one man's wife who was dead. and dee snider stops her and makes her dance when i saw that i broke out in tears ... so i will not recommend it for avid horror lovers, but for those who love horror for his comedy, i recommend this movie 100%
