It should be said that this movie is definitely one of the better "bargain" movies there - I will feel a bit cheated if I paid £ 15 for it, but at about £ 1.50 I felt I was definitely more worth my money. <br /> <br /> The movie can't really decide if it wants to be Mad Max or one of the Clint Eastwood men named "Spaghetti Westerns", and as such is stacked with both clichés. Even the manic loony that hangs with the bad guys in "Mad Max" is there. <br /> <br /> The guy of "Blade Runner" also cuts a good bill, although he first appeared at the beginning and the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Favorite piece - for me the punch-up on top of the oil refinery. If you look closely, you can see the "post-apocalyptic" rush thundering in the distance as the two protagonists beat seven bells apart. <br /> <br /> Get in multiple layers, a few pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately lightweight but entertaining drives.
