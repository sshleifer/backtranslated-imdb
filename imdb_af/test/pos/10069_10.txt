I love this movie !! Sure, I love it because of Madonna, but that doesn't care - it's damn funny !!! * ALANiS Rocks *. When I first saw this movie in theaters in 1987, I thought it was all hilaries! Madonna is so funny and I love her called accent and wacky / funky look. The all-time funniest part is when Madonna (Nikki) shouts at a man about to get in a taxi. And also when Griffin Dunne (Louden) leaves and falls at the apartment maintenance scene. ** ALANiS Rocks **. Madonna's character Nikki steals / shop lifts and wanders people throughout the movie - her hilarious antiques are enough to keep you on the floor all the time. "Didn't rob you," if you rob a shop, hold the cashier. We threw a few tires, that's a bit of a difference. "I love it! It's classic. *** ALANIS Rocks ***. I don't know why this movie got like it did. I don't see anything wrong with it - of course if you're a big Madonna fan Then it's just amazing what she's doing. Anyone who wants to see some funny, classic entertainment then watch "Who's That Girl?" and another very important fact that must be known to all male or female At least to everything that exists, ALANiS will always "rock ya" to the very end! So Madonna does in this movie, and just totally! Her acting is wonderful!
