When I went to the theater, I didn't expect much. I didn't know anything about this movie, but it was the only movie I could see because I was in a small town. So I saw this movie and I was fascinated! "La stelle che non c'Ã¨" is a journey through the new industrial China and it shows it honestly! You see most of the time the ugly places of China, and you see what really happens with this new industrialization. The main characters are sad but hopefully people. He is the naive Italian man who can't believe what he sees. She is an interpreter from China who misses her son. Sometimes sad, sometimes funny, but every time poetic! A wonderful movie with great actors! So, just one star is missing!
