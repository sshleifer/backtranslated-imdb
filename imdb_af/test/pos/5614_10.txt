As you can tell from the few comments posted here, maybe I will be the last to see you, unless there is a large DVD release or TCM is playing it again! - It's a kind of "Our Gang" movie with a lot of different kids. MGM was definitely the musical studio - if the musicians, dancers and singers were not under contract, they were on tap. Heifetz was one of the most expensive ..... it makes for a small charity work !!! The fee he received in that era was unprecedented. Another musical film featuring Jose Iturbi (Mexican pianist) has played about 100 children who simply play 100 pianos. So, the skeptics who think young children are not musical are wrong: I was one. <br /> <br /> As everyone writes, "Frankie Smith" - Good Ole American name - (Gene Reynolds) was the bad but good kid who was taken by the owners of a music school from the streets. Can you believe that Walter Brennan ("Prof. Lawson") of all the Western movies was the man who runs the school? Joel McCrea ("Peter McCarthy") and Andrea Leeds ("Ann Lawson") were the bigger stars in "They will have music", with an army of well-known extras (many of which went to star in their own rights) . As others said, almost all the children in the orchestra (actually The Meremblum Symphony of Los Angeles) made great lives of their lives, either as musicians (for the studios) and other businesses. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there aren't so many young people's bands today - a sad mistake. Parents with children in school are usually so busy keeping their heads above water, and many don't even know what happens to the kids in school. Musical education can be expensive, and almost everyone will have a soccer team. <br /> <br /> This is the cheapest concert by Jascha Heifetz you'll ever hear. .... In those days, a quarter. His play is brilliant, though he or she seems rather different ... emotionally. By contract, any concert by Yo-Yo Ma is so happy, it lets you run straight and buy a cello. This guy has a good time. Like the kids in the street. concert, when they visit Heifetz to play at their school. <br /> <br /> All the orchestra numbers have been played by the kids, making it easy. I love this type of movie - their plots are so simple, it doesn't take you two days to find out if you didn't enjoy the movie at all. We need some new movies like this - can't do anything, but inspire younger kids to play other instruments than guitars ....... Bravo!
