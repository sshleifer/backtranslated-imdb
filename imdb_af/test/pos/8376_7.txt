Previous commentators noted the agreement between the film and The Third Man, director Carol Reed's classic film maker Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. This agreement almost immediately looks like the viewer. It is indeed high praise to be compared to Robert Krasker's academy, award-winning cinematography in The Third Man. <br /> <br /> The plot of Stolen Identity is also fairly accurately set out, but in rather ordinary terms. I found it very creative and entertaining. Just as common as the device "Wrong - or Stolen - Identity" is in both theater and theater, it is just a device and not wrong for the plot itself. Consequently, while the viewer might have seen this device a thousand times, the plot of Stolen Identity is full of surprises and twists based on this device. It is the unexpected turns that make this movie very fresh, more original and staggering than a plot of synopsis can convey. Stolen identity does not rely on the kind of tension that most feature film characterizes, because here is no real riddle. Instead, it is based on constant, smaller surprises. In short, the faulty identity device is fairly common; but this plot is not. <br /> <br /> Finally, although I wasn't familiar with the role, I found that the play was uniformly good, sometimes outstanding. I could easily have suggested other artists to turn this movie into a melodrama, with blown, blown gestures and obvious facial expressions. The acting is always more limited and subtle. Donald Buka is particularly determined and credible and should never "blow his lid" with a clear facial expression as we often see in films dependent on the maintenance of subterfuge to maintain dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment in this other fine movie was the very poor development of the love story subplot. As it turns out, it seems to be an afterthought - a gentle surprise, in fact, to the end. Or perhaps during their shared trials, the actors simply could not convey a tangible level of chemical that I could appreciate. This subplot should be more clear as the story unfolds. All in all, I thought this movie was a fine jewel, and I wondered why I hadn't seen it before. Try it, you will like it.
