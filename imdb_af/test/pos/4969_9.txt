It's been nearly 50 years since I first saw "Jennifer". I didn't know the name of this movie until I looked at this site, but I told many people (especially my grandchildren) how movies should not contain graphic details to scare you and leave powerful impact. The story puts you skilled at concepts that, if true, put Ida Lupino in a very dangerous situation. Every time me. Discovering a new "fact", Lupino draws the viewer into her confusion and fear. <br /> <br /> This movie has such an impact on me that about 50 years later I still find it one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. Yet this movie does not contain the blood and gore that became popular shortly after this movie was made. It is wonderful what impact a good story and good actor can make.
