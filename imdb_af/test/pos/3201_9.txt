I think I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, it had a good role, an interesting story line and a lot of other things for it, but I still couldn't feel a sense of fear. have shaken. in my stomach about how it would be. I am happy to say that I was very happy with the result and regret having been worried for a long time. The films' plays were extremely interesting and were enough to retain early interest in the film. As the film progressed, we were introduced to the characters of the film as well as what happened in prison riots. Like most reviews for this movie, I have to admit that there are a few unessecary cliches, but it cannot erase the overall power of this movie read like a good novel. The movie is all big, especially Chestnut and McGowan, and the film is known as one of the better-made TV shows this year. Definitely worth checking out if you are looking for a good courtroom drama.
