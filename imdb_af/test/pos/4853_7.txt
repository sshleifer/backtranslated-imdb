Well-educated drama based on a novel by Arthur Miller. Something as simple as a few glasses is life change. Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) is a man who has chosen to be content with his everyday life; the same work for twenty years and remains with his mother. He is told by his boss to fix his vision with a few glasses. Newman's life changes drastically and delves into hell. The glasses he chose made him look Jewish. He lost his job and became the object of heavy investigation through his Brooklyn area. In search of a job he meets the attractive and outspoken Gertrude (Laura Dern), who lives with conflict because of her Jewish appearance. Soon, the couple's new life will be filled with a nightmare of humiliation and assassination-driven attacks. A very fitting cast that features: Joseph Ziegler, Peter Oldring, Kay Hawtrey and of musical fame, meat bread.
