This BBC series is surprisingly good fun. I only saw a few minutes before I knew I had to own it and looked again with all my friends. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else, but almost anyone else will enjoy it - from the movie snob to the entertaining masses. The main character is a lesbian, but it's still worth checking out if it's not your thing. <br /> <br /> Rachael Stirling is unbelievably in the lead role that stretches her to a brilliant variety of emotions and situations, a bizarre nature. No one who saw this series will ever say she can't act. She let us laugh, cry, turn on and bang our forehead in astonishment. <br /> <br /> You can't really compare this story to anything else. It's not a rehash of style or plot. It's totally it's an own animal? Share comedy, historical drama, eroticism, come-of-age story, musical and more. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the BBC for making this story. I can't suggest anyone in the (exaggerated and formal) US it ever does. So, stop reading it and buy it.
