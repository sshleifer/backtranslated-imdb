Think of it as an extreme form of detention without trial. Without commenting on the US foreign policy, the Extraordinary Episode process entails that people suspected of terrorist activity to a foreign country are opposed to extradition if you wish, to a place where torture is not a crime, but a means of illegal information. Instead of staining your land with blood from potentially innocent parties, you do so in foreign countries where such tactics are accepted as interrogation techniques. <br /> <br /> Of course, given the severity of the tactics and attempts to break down, sometimes you will get what you want if you have the resistance or nothing, or the worst of All, get a confession just because the mind is broken to the point that the subject will agree with whatever you say. This is an ugly process and the better way to do this when you are the champion's human rights. It gives the need to use any essential means to protect more lives. In an era where information is the key to fighting terrorism and doing so in a country where the real record is likely to be in doubt. <br /> <br /> Delivery this year is Syriana, although in the run-up to the new year we have a number of political exciters to take that crown, with Rendition first, followed by Robert Redford's film Lions for Lambs, with Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep (again, though now on the other side of the fence), and the Kingdom with Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner, although this one will probably be more action-driven. Directed by Gavin Hood, who has done Tsotsi and will brighten the new Wolverine spider, Rendition is thrown into a decent thrill with a top, in a story that is quite popular today. The split, which makes for a big difference Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), a chemical engineer, is headed to the house under the orders of CIA's top buyer Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep). . At a detention facility outside the US, Jake Gyllenhaal's CIA analyst, Douglas Freeman (oh so prophetic), began his very first interrogation session, no doubt in a position he didn't report. Back to home, a very pregnant Reese Whitherspoon is looking for answers to her husband's disappearance, looking for an old-fledged Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard) assistant, as he works for Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin). Throw in J.K. Sinhons, a terrorist plot investigation and a nascent love story between Fatima (Zineb Oukach) and Khalid (Moa Khouas), you have a bit going on in a busy picture. <br /> <br /> Given a number of roles, locations, timelines and containers, Rendition was not at all confusing, playing it with clever handling of the material, never quick to judge, ideas and thoughts on either side of the equation. Each character has their own agenda, and the revealing of this agenda involves enough to not drill or confuse you. And the best part is how they, in fact, bend them into the same custody in different forms, and finally, in various lost situations, unhappy. It also guessed you - did he or she not and constantly played with your mind or earned Anwar what he got. It used a particularly clever little hand, which I didn't see until it was too late (so there goes credit), although it devoted itself to the usual stereotyping of terrorist militants and without spending much time in depth. justify exploring. <br /> <br /> It may not have been necessary, given so many movies out there that are already becoming the basis of this problem (Paradise Now, Day Night Day Night, Syriana even). While it seems to be a one-dimensional (personal tragedy to bomb ties to become a suicide bomber), I felt that Rendition was right to give no bag of sugar, that this struggle against negative, destructive ideology is not something It can't be addressed in a two-hour movie, and I'm glad it runs such fairy tales. <br /> <br /> What we have before is a well-made story that sets its arms attractions over Rendition's issue, and probably able to spark the conversation as the lights go on, on which camp you belong - do you Does severe pain support interrogation? Yes or no? This is the quintessential question of our time. Yes or no? (OK, I'm already ready for Lions for Lammers)!
