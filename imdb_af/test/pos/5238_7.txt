Sweep and still impressive early Talkie Western of pioneer days; Other contemporary films in the same action include THE SELECTED WAGON (1923), THE IRONHORSE (1924) and CIMARRON (1931) ?? Not one of which I watched, although I have the latter on VHS. It was filmed simultaneously in the "Standard" full screen relationship and in an experimental Widescreen "Grandeur" process, but only the former was released on the Fox Fox bald bone. One can only imagine how it would look in a larger relationship, but the cautious framework? not to mention beautiful cinematography? is clear enough even in the "Standard" version. <br /> <br /> Young John Wayne is surprisingly commander in the lead (a role that did not lead to the expected deaths? in 'B' Westerns for the best part of the next decade, before John Ford with STAGECOACH [1939] to his rescue!); Anyway, he and Marguerite Churchill (from DRACULA'S DAUGHTER [1936]) make a beautiful couple ?? despite its somewhat boring character. Supporting characters include a variety of supplies: veteran western, comic relief, sidekick (with a preference for making sounds with his mouth!), Brave and unashamed villain (played by Tyrone Power Sr.!), His two slender cohorts and a Southern, the latter also fills in as Wayne's competitor for Churchill's hand, etc. Also among the wagon party members is a busy Sweden (full of optimism for the promised land, but who is constantly being through his insatiable mother-in-law) and later Wayne-regular Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The episodic story decides itself in a number of alternating cornball, lyrical and action-packed vignettes ?? as we see the prospective settlers fighting the elements, the Indians and themselves; The film, however, has a completely authentic feel that is smoother about its material dated and static quality. Also, the editing is somewhat cunning (especially during the second half)? A little wonder, as the DVD edition of the movie is only 108 minutes long against the full 158-minute Grandeur version!
