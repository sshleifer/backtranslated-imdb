Leslie Carbaga's excellent book about the Fleishers tells the whole story of the Fleischer's great move from their entire animation unit to Florida, and their subsequent ejection by Paramount. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bug Goes Town did not destroy the animated pioneer credit with Paramount, although it is often told so, and it was Paramount's favorite version of the story. According to Carbaga, the big studio wanted more than just their clouds on the animation studio and completely relieved the famous brothers from the picture. Mr. Bug gave them the pretext to do just that. - The sad ending of a wonderful, innovative chapter in American animation. <br /> <br /> I also wanted to comment that the film actually made debut on December 4, 1941, not December 7th. It might be close enough to do the trick, anyway, in terms of national mood that detracts from the movie's success. But another part of the legend of this tumultuous little movie is that it was murdered by being in the theaters. Dumbo (released October 23, 1941) still did special holiday businesses. I did not do the check for cash boxes, but I want to say that Dumbo's simultaneous presence in theaters is likely to impact on Mr. Bug had. The movie was high at this time, and successful movies could be strong in the theaters for months. - Something unthinkable in these typically short-term, fast-to-DVD days.
