The story takes place in rural Germany on the eve of the Second World War, a unique environment, with some British agents being kept by the Germans in a farmhouse. Since they are not technically in war, it seems both sides need to realize what is coming. Both agents (Bruce Lester and Ray Milland) escape in the countryside and divide. A million happens on a gypsy woman, Marlene Dietrich, one evening while she is preparing for her camp alone. Their encounter is an amazing and fascinating scene, not so much for Milland, but for Dietrich, who takes a whole new plane's sexy confusion. Milland disguises himself as a gypsy to hide from the Germans, but he remains committed to his mission. He found the scientist who knows the formula for a new poison gas but also a dedicated Nazi. Hollywood takes on the gypsy life and the customs are predictably portrayed, but the underlying knowledge that they will be one of the Nazi extinction targets adds a certain strain. The film drains the line between a serious poison gas story and the urgent quest to get the formula, and a colorful but not convincing love story between Milland and Dietrich. However, they are both very good; It is the fault of the film that they have not given their relationship enough dramatic realism, and rely on and obviously use cultural differences for questionable comedic purposes. Nevertheless, there are some interesting and interesting points here and there, the surprise meetings with German soldiers and Gestapo agents, where Dietrich does a good palm reading and Milland almost as well, and a dinner of Germans of different stripes against which the Announcement come over the radio that Germany was attacked by Poland and everyone is standing and greeting a tight arm. Mitchell Leison may have missed opportunities here and there, but he made full use of others.
