For those of you who have riot competitions, you must have heard from George Carlin. He is really one of the best comedians living, so you need to know him. <br /> <br /> But he already died, God rested in peace. Or hell. He did not believe too much faith in religion, so he could also choose hell for eternal life. HAHA, just kidding, don't take it seriously! <br /> <br /> It's bad for you! It is one of the latest works by George Carlin before his death. <br /> <br /> I, one of his best works, need a fan for any fan and almost the best of George Carlin's jokes. It's not a good thing ... but it's really amusing. <br /> <br /> It has less political and religious jokes. It's just a good time! <br /> <br /> Editing is very good. It's not a concert, so it shouldn't change quickly. The slow fade to other shots was well done. Blur is the best option for editing!
