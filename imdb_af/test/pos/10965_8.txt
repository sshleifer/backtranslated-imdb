1st watched 8/26/2001 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-John Cassavetes): Well-behaved early independent film by Cassavetes suggested a style that was very different from what Hollywood showed the audience. This film has also introduced many taboo subjects, especially the actual racism that is likely to be common across the country, but not displayed by most of the time-controlled filmmakers. About the only black actors who had much respect at this time were those who acted and personality like whites (also known as Sidney Poitier). In addition, the idea of ​​ending a movie without really leaving the relationships that started has stunned many filmmakers, but really makes viewers realize that life is like that (it continues ...). I prefer this kind of end because it reminds you more about the characters and what can happen next and the conclusions are not just explained to you. The film follows the lives of people (especially a few people who have a short relationship and appear across skin colors), then we see what happens when the white man realizes what he has done. It is very well done and makes the movie very special. The play is supposed to be improvisational which makes the film even more amazing. I think you can say I love this movie, if you can't tell it. If you can find it, look at this classic early independent movie.
