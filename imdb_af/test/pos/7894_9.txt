I was amazed at how emotionally invested I became in this movie. Peter Boyle is a tour force as the working class socially conservative bigot, Joe. I actually sympathize with some of his complaints. Of course, he does not mention the underlying historical socio-economic reasons for many of his prejudices. The film also provides interesting insight into the rapid change that American society has undergone at this time. Relaxants, casual sex, and the challenge of parental authority have changed into vogue and replaced the more time-honored traditions of respect for God, country and seniority. Susan Sarandon supporters will be delighted. Joe is her movie debut. She also offers viewers with a visual treat near the start of the movie. Recommended, 8/10.
