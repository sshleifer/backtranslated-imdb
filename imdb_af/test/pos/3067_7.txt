Mel Brooks is a great writer, director and actor, but even once he can even have a vowel. The beginning of this begins almost only one character after another. You have Cary Elwes that is charming and talented, but he can't do comedy. His expressions in the camera show that even he cannot believe the clumsiness in writing. Richard Lewis looks bored and distracted throughout without doing too much and Amy Yasbeck gets stuck in high school acting mode. Dave Chapelle shows a huge comedy series that is overcrowding and hammering for the camera and Mark Blankfield is mostly cut into the role of the blind man, but he can still show a great comedy series. Eric Allen Kramer doesn't have much to do, but the few scenes he has are binding. The best roles are those of Roger Rees, Tracy Ullman, Megan Cavanaugh and Brooks for when he appears. Dom DeLuise has a funny turn as a Mafia Don using a Clint Eastwood lookalike, but on the other hand, some of the jokes are not very funny, while some of the really funny ones are similar to Mel's other movies.
