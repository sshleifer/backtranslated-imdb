<br /> <br /> The kind of movie that demands too much from the audience, but to disappoint most of them. I think of the Mexican people who (or in an attempt to support Mexican films or watch a movie of the best Mexican stars) have seen it, half of the people went out of the theater when I was going to watch it, It's definitely not the kind of movie you can expect. I also think of the people of other countries who dared to spend 2 hours, as it went to the end, "what a crap". To understand Cronica de un desayuno, you have to be Mexican, and you need to be familiar with the low middle classes (or even better be part of them). There is no coincidence in this movie, the family is and has at least how many families, in Mexico, share. You have to see it with a wide open mind to accept it completely, it's not the kind of movie you fully understand after watching it. The older brother will not allow anyone to sit on his red couch, the sister does not matter how she wants to leave, the younger brother goes to an excursion and everything he cares about is the yellow radio that the mother must prepare breakfast for the family, no matter how tense and unbearable the situation is. The father returned after knowing how long the mother was allowed to stay a night of passion that somehow stayed short-lived and ended by repeating all the attitudes of his sons. The stories around the house are surreal (and so is the movie), a transvestite looking for his penis, a factory worker and his suicide attempt, underneath the kiss of his girlfriend, a fat man riding his bike, after " an interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister? woman? mother? ... The music doesn't make too much difference, but it does get a lot, no more than a string drum, cymbals, a few strings. Thank you very much. A movie like this is done and released. <br /> <br /> One of the best Mexican movies ever! And one of the lesser understood, even by Mexican self, no matter how identified it would have been. <br /> <br />
