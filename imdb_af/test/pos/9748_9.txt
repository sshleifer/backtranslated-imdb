After 66 years, "Flash Gordon" still has an attractive scifi / adventure / epic feel that many of today's science fiction adventures are striving for and failing to deliver. The only way to enjoy this series is to just sit back and choose nothing (hokey effects, dialogue, why Flash doesn't go for Princess Aura etc). And for those older people who have seen "Flash Gordon" back on the serial screen or on TV "back in the day", if you want to dress this fine series for future generations, your kids / grandchildren get it to watch when they are young. It worked for me (Man 18 or older). 9 out of 10
