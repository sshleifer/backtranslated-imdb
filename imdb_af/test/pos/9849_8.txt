Peak Practice was a British drama series about a general operation in Cardale ?? a small fictional town in the Derbyshire Peak District ?? and the doctors who worked there. It ran on ITV from 1993 to 2002 and was one of their most successful series at the time. It originally killed Kevin Whately as Dr Jack Kerruish, Amanda Burton as Dr Beth Glover, and Simon Shepherd as Dr Will Preston, although the schedule of doctors would often change over the course of the series. <br /> <br /> The series was shot in 2002 and ended on a literal stone hanger when two of the series of main characters fell off a cliff. Viewers wrote to ITV in their thousands and one last episode petition was drafted through the Peak Practice Online website. However, all pleas were unsuccessful and ITV said they would no longer make episodes. <br /> <br /> Peak Practice was replaced by Sweet Medicine, another medical series in Derbyshire. It took a few episodes before it was taken from the schedules. <br /> <br /> Cardale was based on the Derbyshire village of Crich, and the series was filmed there and at other nearby Derbyshire towns and villages, especially Matlock and Ashover. After this program, ITV tried to launch a sequel called Sweet Medicine, which expanded the stories of different characters from the original show.
