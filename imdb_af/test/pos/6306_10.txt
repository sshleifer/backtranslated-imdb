I've seen this movie so many times, it's so good. Maybe because I can relate to Titta's way of life is why. Not everyone finds it according to their taste. Also, my Italia improves after each visit. Am I a sad matter? Thank you, Mr Sorrentino. I'm looking forward to your next movie. Although I haven't seen the movie at a cinema, I have the DVD and encourage someone to buy it. The special feature extras alone are worth the price. The amount of time a director spends on film making is rarely appreciated. The extras on the DVD provide excellent insight into making a movie. As for the story of the movie, I am biased. I make it known to all my friends, but as I said before, I am very much connected with the main character who is a loner in a situation that is not self-evident. . The Mafia in Sicily uses Titta to pay their money in a Swiss bank. He owes them to cost them millions of dollars a year ago in the stock market agreement that went wrong. Dear, dead.
