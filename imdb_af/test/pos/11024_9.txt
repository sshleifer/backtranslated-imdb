Niagara, Niagara is a beautiful and heartbreaking story about the two outsiders Seth and Marcy. Robin Tunney gives a fantastic performance as Marcy, who suffers from Tourette's Sydrome, gets worse and worse as the movie progresses. This movie is not very optimistic and it is very difficult emotionally, but at the same time very romantic. It's hard to explain, but see it and find out for yourself. It's definitely worth it.
