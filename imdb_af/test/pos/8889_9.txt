If you had a mother who described you like that, you might just repel her. That's how Danny DeVito feels about Anne Ramsey, it's just how to put the plan into action. <br /> <br /> And his creative writing class, taught by Professor Billy Crystal, gives him the idea. This and a viewing of Alfred Hitchcock's classic Strangers On A Train which gives DeVito the idea of ​​changing murders with Crystal who hates his wife, Kate Mulgrew, who doesn't just cheat him for a book he wanted to write, but is also going on with Tony Ciccone. <br /> <br /> Throwing Momma From The Train plays some kind of aliens on a train, as DeVito apparently carried his end to the murder scheme. But Crystal has a problem finishing Ramsey, even with Danny's help. The woman may have to kill, but she will take a lot of it. <br /> <br /> Throw Momma's only academy recognition from the train was an Oscar nomination for Anne Ramsey for the best supporting actress. Ramsey loses to Olympia Dukakis for Moonstruck, but the movie seems to be her best hour. Ramsey had all the throat cancer that would eventually kill her the next year, but looking at the list of credits she even managed to collect from the train to Throw Momma, she worked until the end. <br /> <br /> I interviewed both stars of Throw Momma From The Train, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, and both conceded that Anne Ramsey's performance as the mother of hell made both the movie the success and stole it from among them. Their recognition of Ramsey's talent and performance is the best possible tribute. <br /> <br /> If Marion Lorne was in Strangers On A Train, anything like Anne Ramsey was here, Farley Granger would have liked to join Robert Walker. Throwing Momma out of a train is one of the best black comedies out there, shouldn't be missed.
