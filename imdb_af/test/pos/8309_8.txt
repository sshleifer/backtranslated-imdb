CONTEXT is everything when judging a movie. When assessing this movie, consider the time it was made. We didn't really know what was inside the EARTH in those days, so you can't add the movie too much to the plot (based on a much older book). For the era it was the first time special effects and the quality of the production was excellent. I watched this movie in a masterful recovery HD master. For the time being that the make-ups and effects almost look like the guys in the rubber suits, it's plausible as a monster thing. It's pure film cheese, complete with bad rubber suits, models and creepy costumes. AWESOME. PS Doug McClure ROCKS!
