I feel very lucky to have the chance not only to watch this movie, but also to learn more about this fascinating person and time. Lumumba is an excellent portrayal, giving a full sense of the story without falling into the ordinary Hollywood bumps. Yes, he is shown to his wife and children, but the essence of the story is his politics and that of the ever-emerging independent Congo. . The film is made brilliantly and moves at a rate that is consistently enchanting. I'm looking forward to seeing other Raoul Peck films as well as more of Eric Ebouaney!
