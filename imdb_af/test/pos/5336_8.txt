Although not half-hilarious as "Chicken Run", the new Wallace and Gromit comedy "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" (*** out of ****) delivers more than most live action comedies. British director Nick Park, who created the Wallace and Gromit characters, and co-director Steve Box relies on the old-fashioned stop motion method of animation - known as clay - to create multiple visually-worshiping characters in more than enough. Side-splitting scenes over a monstrous mutant rush out to devour every vegetable in sight. Amusing as its whimsical storyline lies the heart of the hilarious way in which Park and the company made characters and gags from a brand of clay, plasticine. Basically, every shot you see in "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" requires patient souls who have made smaller changes in clay characters for a series of individual shots that work together in a true mare assembly. Hollywood laid the clay as a form of animation as far back as the silent films of the 1920s, before the industry turned its back on the intricate process. Aardman Studio animators only got usable footage a few seconds a day. For the record, "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" took five years to make. The lumpy looking characters, with thumb prints clearly visible in their respective clay complexes, look incredibly funny with their ping-pong ball eyes and over-biting mouth. Interestingly, Gromit appears to be the funniest character, a lovely mutt with no mouth, but an explicitly unexpressive face that says more than most talk characters. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are master and pooch respectively. Like the human half of the duo, Wallace is a homie who is undoubtedly looking for some way, which manages to build machines that do some incredible things. One of the funniest scenes shows the master and wakes up by a system of chicks, breeding, and spring-engaging contracts that attract and feed them. Meanwhile, Gromit is the animal half. The running joke is that Gromit shows more common sense than his master of a master. As good as his ideas and inventions, Wallace could not succeed without the loyal Gromit giving him a hand. Our heroes carry a pest protection business called 'Anti-Pesto'. Essentially, they must protect every vegetable pack for miles, using a bit of a Bun-Van 6000, which calls a Bun-Van 6000 that sucks rabbits out of their soil and literally into a large glass container. No, Wallace and Gromit don't kill the wanderers. Instead, they keep them as pets, and Wallace is experimenting with an invention. Mind-O-Matic - designed to transform rabbits into root hats. This "Frankenstein" meets the "The Fly" approach, troubling Wallace when he breaks his bits with those of a rabbit. Not long afterwards, a mysterious teasing terrorist is pushing the vegetable plates on full moon and creating chaos for everyone like the town's 517th annual vegetable competition. <br /> <br /> Initially, Wallace and Gromit appeared in Park's Oscar nominee, film school project "A Grand Day Out" (1989). Since then, Aardman has released ten other animated shorts, including "Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave" (1993) and Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers "(1995), not just because it represents the duo's big-screen debut but it also lasts 85 minutes.The first two-thirds of "Were-Rabbit" contains better gags than the last third, but Park and company never miss a chance to slip into an adult joke that children won't get but excited adults will appreciate. "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" is hair-raising fun.
