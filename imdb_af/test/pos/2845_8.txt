Nurse Betty has that strange but winning combination of a repulsive, unpleasant-intruding plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I was abhorrent to Fargo for the first time, then I realized I thought about it some days later and enjoyed it somehow, I had Nurse Betty much more that day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it is very much forced in many ways, but it seems to be part of what makes it so striking. <br /> <br /> Fair work by Greg Kinnear, good work by Morgan Freeman (though I'm worried that he's being diagnosed as the principal villain). Chris Rock was good, but not a stand. Ren√© Z. is so natural that it is unpleasant - that is, unnecessary to be "natural" that someone does not play well in. Also, like Allison Janney's "slender sparkle" performance in a small part. <br /> <br /> Don't expect so much from a "road movie", as you might expect from some synopses. (There's a road, but it's just barely relevant.) Rated 8/10.
