Crossfire remains one of the best Hollywood message movies, because unlike the wonderful intention of Gentleman's Agreement, which has donated it to theaters in a matter of months, he chooses his message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than an angry to have a star that constantly says: That's because I'm Jewish, isn't it? "It's much easier to get the message that hate, is like a loaded gun when the bodies are actually rather metaphorical. Something shameful, the short featurette on the Warners DVD does not mention that novel novel Richard Brooks is about the movie rejecting a homophobic murder to an anti-Semitic one, but it is interesting to note that the victim is mainly murdered because he is Jewish, there is little doubt in Sam Levene's performance that the character is actually gay is not a carbonature, but there is definitely a two lost soul aspect for his scenes with George Cooper's tangled soldier. There is not much of a mystery to who the murderer is: although the murder in classical noir Shadows are executed, the body language of the killer is immediately recognizable, but then the characters have their characters in front of the halfway: the tension comes out to prove it and save the falling man. <br /> <br /> There is an element of Ealing Films the soldier gang working together to get their partner out of solution (you can almost see that aspect as a blueprint for Hue and Cry), but the atmosphere is pure RKO noir. The film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born of economy as a style (it cuts back on the lighting season and allowed director Edward Dmytryk more time to work with the actors) and make the Excellent movie the best of the fine print: a relaxed but quiet charismatic Robert Mitchum, Robert Young's Maigret-like detective, Gloria Grahame's tramp and the continually creepy Paul Kelly as her companion fan, a man trying on stories tyres. But the lasting impression is of Robert Ryan's excellent performance as a man who can do with a good leave alone because he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death. A great surprise in 1946, as a reward, Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott examined themselves by the HUAC, which itself had a significant tendency to direct Jews. So much for crusade?
