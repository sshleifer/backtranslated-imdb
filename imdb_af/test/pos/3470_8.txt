Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people finding common ground, and especially the "flower" of one of them. A baffled "Spike" -type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes a youthful (Robertson) -friendly cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside the home, but McAvoy has and he is determined to return to the real world. Together, they can only do this in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking story of inner strength that overcomes physical shortcomings. The two leads are great, especially Robertson, who has for some time spent the disabled on this difficult role. He appears in almost every scene and acts as an absolute storm. For anyone who doesn't know, they can think he has CB. Highly recommended.
