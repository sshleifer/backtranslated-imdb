An American WAS kidnapped in Morocco and the Marines went partially to the banks of Tripoli to save him. So much for that. You know Hollywood. Sean Connery is the Berber chief and Muslim leader. Candice Bergan is the man kidnapped with her two children; The boy is no less Rex Harrison's grandson, Simon. John Huston is a state secretary, with a great John-Huston style straight-line at state seats, beware of that. Brian Kieth IS Teddy Roosevelt, all American, all male, a character so modern today. <br /> <br /> The harvest and beauty of the desert and Morocco are beautifully displayed in cinematography in This movie, which stays with you, a ghostly and compelling reminder. The score is as dirty and exotic as the images. <br /> <br /> It's a story about two cultures, both with great ideas and historical past, struggling for the future without any idea of ​​each other. In any case, the struggle comes down to power over resourcefulness. <br /> <br /> Then there is finally the little boy - remember the little boy? What do you think he thinks?
