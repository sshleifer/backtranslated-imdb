Pat O'Brien had his best role ever as Knute Rockne, the Notre Dame footballer. From the humble beginnings, Rockne joined Notre Dame in 1910 as a student in 1910. He is in chemistry, but becomes a great soccer player and hero. At graduation he teaches chemistry at school, but forcing him to give up chemistry to pursue his dream after coaching the game, he has the soccer fever that comes together. In a way, bad, the school probably lost a good chemistry teacher - certainly much better and nicer than the one I had in high school. (Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn is exactly.) <br /> <br /> He motivates his students. He won't tolerate academic underperformance. He is a coach for all seasons. <br /> <br /> O'Brien catches that general kind of touch. One of his students, George Gipp, is memorably played in a fine short supporting performance by Ronald Reagan. <br /> <br /> The years go by and the achievements are high, but Knute remains the same kind of coach who testifies before Congress when soccer is in doubt. <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp is outstanding as a Notre Dame priest who knew that Rockne was destined to manage football. Albert Basserman is sufficient, but his Jewish accent in portraying a priest is at best uncomfortable. Basserman was nominated in that support category for "Foreign Correspondent." <br /> <br /> Rockne's tragic death, in a plane crash, robbed the world of many more years of a completely professionally wonderful man. The movie is wonderful.
