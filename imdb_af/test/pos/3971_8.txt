On the face of it, every teenage comedy runs the risk of being somnolent and obvious, and fair enough, most of them are. There are some who have risen above the usual banality of the source material (Bring It On, Eurotrip), and they give me the hope that other people at the depressed scarce crowd can join teenage comedians who are actually funny and not just an excuse to flash not a little starlet's boobs or a vehicle for someone who was never like Tom Green. <br /> <br /> Accepted, led by John Cusack's doll Steve Pink and led by Justin Long (the smart kid in Galaxy Quest and more recently in Apple computer ads), about a lot of kids not at university Accepted and decided to make a fake one to get their parents off their back, as announced in the trailer. If they go a little too far with the site and the other kids end up writing, the kids have a few problems to solve. <br /> <br /> Well, the setup is, of course, ominous, but most comedy lives or dies In performance, and here, it accepts well. Long's Bartleby Gaines (mostly shortened to 'B') is accompanied by enough well-meant, comic-acceptable friends to help him share the burden, but probably the best supporting character is 'Dean' Lewis (undoubtedly a tribute to Rodney Dangerfield's dean Martin), also known as Uncle Ben, Lewis Black, who is wisely limited to short tracks where he can escape his unique brand of mad observation humor. Black is wonderful here to tell the kids what life really is (his explosive-loading final line is hysterical) and give the adult face to the old university. <br /> <br /> But Long has to carry most of the movies, and he does it, in spades; Bartleby is easily identified with and we are almost immediately approaching him. A fun twist is provided by Columbus Short's character Hands, an athlete who lost his bursary due to injury and eventually became the de facto art faculty at the fake college. Also notable as Bartleby's hyper-intelligent and sarcastic little sister is Hannah Marks. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film feels familiar in some places; There is a debt here from all places to revenge the Nerds. Those rejected by everyone find a home with Bartleby and his cohorts, and, of course, the villains are steroid-enhanced conformist Master Breed types that run a fraternity (good, ok, freak is angry) and try to get the strange balls humiliated and buried. for the ?? gasp ?? crime to be different. But Accepted has fun with the material, and even asked some decent questions about college children's expectations and the progress of higher education. Not that it is a brain force in any way, but accepting is not just another thoughtless teenage comedy (or Owen Wilson vehicle). It's a funny, smart 90 minutes that, while not a good deviation from its genre, is intelligent and creative enough to be very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> There is at least one moment of unprecedented brilliance in the movie, when Bartleby checks a nearby college in an effort to harvest ideas for his own school's curriculum. When he sees that the children are all being stressed at the other school (several refuse to even talk to him during class for fear of missing something), he shakes his head and thinks there should be a better way. As he leaves, he is met by a stream of children, vice versa, one who moves against a human tide, while in the background plays the opening lines of Eleanor Rigby. Perhaps an unplanned moment of brilliance, but brilliance no less.
