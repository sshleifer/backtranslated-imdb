Clint Eastwood plays a wounded Union soldier found by a girl from a Confederate boarding school and was hospitalized and nursed instead of inverted to confederate soldiers. Looks like the female people in this place have illegal motives. Geraldine Paige, the chieftain, just doesn't change him in the Confederation and even leaves him as her cousin. Of course, when the man feels better, he becomes quite the woman's husband and he almost makes the rounds, but if he gets breast, he gets VERY messed up, and so badly gets his leg cut off, but it's for his own good, of course , not from retaliation. Things are carried a little further though some women don't get what they want. I haven't seen it for years, and it still has some creepiness that today's standards are rather strange. Not typically Eastwood. If you haven't seen this one, it's worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
