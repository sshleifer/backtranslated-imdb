I saw several Yul Brynner films, but it's his best performance, as the camera captures its emotions in close proximity as it smiles, smiles and laughs. Brynner may also have arrested Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, The Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman or Chaillot, but none of these films has captured his variety of talent in close ups as in this one. He was arrested and embarrassed to look at each shot. <br /> <br /> Just as fascinating and sexy, without removing her clothes, is Deborah Kerr. The writing allows her to portray a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive - she expressed this kind of roll years later in The Night of Iguana. The film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help release the group of Russians' heads. Indeed, she is shown to run away from the Russian Major (as opposed to the Maupassant story or the Isaac Denisen story). Yet the film is bursting with the proposed but real physical character of the Kerr character. <br /> <br /> Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress, but she is a wonderful actress. She puts her soul in the valuation of the characters she portrays, which often clashes with the spirit of the character. It is this contradiction that reminds her roles in the journey, Quo Vadis, and the Night of Iguana. <br /> <br /> Why is it an unusual movie? It is not easy to see in Hollywood that Russian characters are portrayed as good people. Dr. Zhivago was an exception. Brynner's Romance of a Horse Thief was again a major film by Abraham Polonsky, but never recognized as such because of the intolerance towards left-wing people in the post-McCarthy era. <br /> <br /> The film is also unusual in its decisive French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee - rubbing shoulders with Jason Robards Jr. and British actor Robert Morley. In many ways, the film is international as American. All four are good actors and add to the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Those who have read Maupassant and Denisen's works will find that the movie is not true. Yet, the film can stand on its own, as the initiated (censored) version has a worthy charm of its own - providing the reality of the night that led to the release of the group. I think Litvak deserves the last laugh to give an interesting and credible twist to the stories that led to the making of the movie, while adding the bits of both written stories (eg the last bus ride and the final kiss). <br /> <br /> But I have one grouse - why does Hollywood never recognize the sources that inspire the stories? Just recently (eg Insomnia), the original works began to be prominently mentioned in the credits.
