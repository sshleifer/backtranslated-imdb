Evolutionary and cleverly photographed psychological mystery thriller with exceptional lead performance by a sombre Donald Sutherland, and strong supporting roles by Donald Pleasence and David Hemming. The material decides to keep it all, and moves from the investigation period to the background of the victim. The rare and pretty nature of inquiry moved me in, but when it looked back at the victim's side indicating her last days, it was not so compelling, and it became a bit stodgy and stocky. While the writing is very detailed and to some extent complicated to join us, the final and surprising revelation must be more bottling and not helped by its sloppy performance. Howard Blake's music party has an emotional sting on his clues that are simply on fire, and director Claude Chabrol's capable handling (good for the most part) has a strong, quiet and rigorous way of getting the most out of mood and flexibility get. The young faces Lisa Langlois and Aude Landry also do an amazingly good job.
