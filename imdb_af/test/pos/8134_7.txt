It was Laurel and Hardy's latest silent movie for Roach Studios. However, as the public had a real thirst for "talkies", this briefly was made just a few years later by the team with only a few small plot changes. LET GRAVY was actually the same plot, except that Stan and Ollie tried to hide a cute puppy from their coarse owners - not a goat like in ANGORA LOVE. This whole boxing corner is the worst part of the movie. While you can understand the boys who want a cute puppy (it's snow outside), why exactly they bring a goat's house, it's just enjoyable and useless. According to the plot, the goat followed them home and they got tired of shaking it and keeping it. Huh? It just makes no sense - if it was a giraffe or cow, would they have done the same thing? Apart from being an unconvincing plot, the movie itself is pure Laurel and Hardy, with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians. This movie has a few laughs, but unfortunately it is not one of their better films to stir up their quiet careers. This aspect of their careers just seems to be a bad end.
