It's a damn good movie, with some surprising twists, a good role and a good script. Just a few stupid bits, like the Rasta hit man scene (This man is a professional?), But it's already commented. The fact that I only heard one man at work mentioned it before, and didn't have many opinions or reviews to continue, made it even more entertaining. It gets a higher score than some people think it deserves, but I have to have the low budget and good effort of the movie. It makes me sick that some movies are made, whose budget is equal to the GDP of a small country, with an eclipse, good reviews, an Oscar director and / or actors, and seems to be so disappointing, with actors sleeping and uninspiring, with predictable plot lines and a story with holes in it so big, can drive Sandra Bullock a bobby-loaded bus through it. (Examples in my opinion are The Terminal, Castaway, Matrix: Revolutions). Extra points are awarded for the wardrobe department who choose good clothes for the movie, especially Paulina Porizcova, who wears a rubber dress in one scene and a jacket with a "on the back in big letters in another! A sex scene" that shows her tight ass and a good soundtrack added bonuses! And PLEASE, enough with the Tarantino equations, it didn't remind me of a Tarantino movie, and Tarantino almost borrows every idea he ever had from other movies Even if it is your opinion, as soon as a certain movie or book is written or directed in some way, no one can ever use the same ideas again - really get it, this film has its own style.
