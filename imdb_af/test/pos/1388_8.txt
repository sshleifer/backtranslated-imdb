A caption on the screen informs us that it is "the Caribbean Sea, May 1891". A small lifeboat deliberately floats on the sea, which contains six prisoners of a shipwrecked vessel, and the doctor a Lt. Claude De Ross (Claudio Cassinelli). It's night, a strange stream taking the boat to a strange, unnamed and unprecedented island. The boat hits a few rocks and is torn apart. One of the prisoners is murdered by what appears to be a slimy mutant fisherman creature. The next morning Claude wakes up to get him on a beach. He finds a pool of white bubbling water and one of the prisoners dead on it. Claude warns another surviving prisoner Jose (Franco Iavarone) not to drink the water because it will kill him. Eventually they meet with other surviving prisoners, Peter (Roberto Posse), Francois (Francesco Mazzeri) and Skip (Giuseppe Castellano). Francois wandered on his own to catch an animal for food, and he found and killed a large water bird. But in turn he was killed by one of the fishermen. Claude, Jose, Peter and Skip continue to explore the island as they drop Francois's death into some kind of animal attack. Soon Ship will be killed when placed on a peak below the pit. Now only Claude, Jose and Peter are left. They stumble across a cemetery with many empty graves and signs of recent black magical rituals. Claude sees a snake on a nearby rock, suddenly a shot is heard and the snake head explodes. A woman on the horse, Amanda Marvin (Barbara Bach), is revealed to be Claudes' savior. She tells them to leave the island immediately, as it is owned by an Edmund Rackham (Richard Johnson) and he doesn't like visitors. Claude, Jose and Peter decide to continue uninterruptedly and eventually find Rackham's big house where they are invited to stay. That night, Peter went to Amanda and tried to rape her in a swamp. Peter is fast food for the fishermen. And a Voodoo priestess, Shakira (Beryl Cunningham), who lives with Rackham, performs a black magical ritual that cuts the throat of a chicken at the cemetery. The next day Claude and Jose decide to leave the island because they feel very uncomfortable about Rackham and think he's lying to them. Jose is riding and is lost. Claude was rescued from one of the fishermen by Amanda and is being told to leave. Claude wants to confront Rackham again. Rackham reveals that he has a scientist, and Amanda's father, named Prof. Ernest Marvin (Joseph Cotten), to be kept alive. Rackham says the longer Ernest remains alive, the chances of his own survival increasing dramatically. Rackham tells Claude his plan. Rackham found the lost city of Atlantis at a depth of more than 2,000 feet. He uses the fishermen as a way to get to the lost treasures of Atlantis, and Amanda and her father have to control them. He claims the fishermen are descendants of the original inhabitants of Atlantis. Rackham offers Claude some of the treasure if he helps him keep Ernest alive. Later, Claude remembers Ernest Marvin as a scientist condemned for experiments that increase animal organs in humans. To find Ernest's secret lab, he discovers that Rackham lied to him and the fishermen are not descendants. Their actually genetically altered people have changed into amphibious creatures through Ernest's grotesque experiments! Rackham finally had enough of Claude and decided to put an end to his involvement by putting him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water, as the volcano began to erupt and the lava flies everywhere. Rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures and Amanda, Claude will almost certainly escape death to save Amanda and get off the island before the erupting volcano tears it apart? Targeted by Sergio Martino I really enjoyed this movie that mixes several genres. Sergio Donati's script is fast, interesting and entertaining. The plot is revealed a little for a bit, which makes me interested to look through it completely. I have to say at this point that I have seen the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted because it is American release by Roger Corman. Barbara Bach makes for an extremely handsome leading woman, but I hated as she was set by shooting a snake head. I thought it was more than a little unpleasant. Richard Johnson makes a big villain and Claudio Cassinelli is a great hero. The fishermen themselves look a bit fake when the camera is lying on them for too long, but they are cool and I have seen worse. Some of the miniature effects also look a bit poor, but overall again I saw much worse. There is no real gore, violence or nudity in it, but it didn't really bother me. The photography by Giancarlo Ferrando and the production designed by Massimo Antonello Geleng combine to create a very beautiful film. Period costumes, props and sets such as Rackham's home and Ernest's lab with his old scientific equipment. The sumptuous green jungle settings also add to the visual splendor of the show. I loved this movie very much and I entertained all the time. I'm not sure who I would recommend it, as it mixes several genres, I think someone might have made something different and usually good. If you can get a copy, give it a spin, I'm glad I did.
