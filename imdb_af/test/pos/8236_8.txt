More than 21 have the film version of the Ruth Gordon game, which tries to keep her marriage with Garson Kanin after joining, Irene Dunne with one of her better later roles on the big screen. It is also in line with what was an exciting spirit in America at the time that we would not be screwing the peace as we did in World War I and sowing the seed of another global conflict. <br /> <br /> The play Ruth Gordon wrote and ran on 221 shows on Broadway in 1944. She was only limited to the bungalow that Gordon and Harvey Stephens, the male head, had on a practice basis. Looking at the Broadway credits list, it was said that the production was "staged" by George S. Kaufman as opposed to directing him. I'm not sure of the distinction, but I can imagine that with a white and wanting as strong as Kaufman's it had to be an interesting time to gather the production before the start of the evening. <br /> <br /> Then Columbia's Screening Rights, Sidney Buchman had to do a substantial script reconstruction to move the action out of the bungalow. The film carries very few traces of its stage. <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays the husband and Charles Coburn, the employer of both Dunne and Knox, who are writers. Knox graduated from not only the editor but had a columnist. His words and thoughts help to sell the paper and Coburn is in a tie. But Knox feels he must come to war, the seminal event of his time to speak authoritatively about the nature of the post-war world he wants. It wasn't an unusual theme in those years. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne has some good comic moments, the kind she had when she appeared to Cary Grant. In fact, Garson Kanin directed both of them in My favorite wife a few years earlier. Coburn is his usual cantanker old water buffalo of a boss who has a good heart. <br /> <br /> More than 21 were an optimistic picture that was sad to say, was not accurate about what the Allies and I all meant. can bring to the peace conferences to create a better world. Hopefully, a new generation will get it right.
