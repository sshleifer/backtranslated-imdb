According to the business coup of the year 1941, Max and Dave, the Brothers Fleischer were removed from their own Studio by Paramount Pictures Corporation. Former employees such as Seymour Kneitel and Izzy Sparber were in charge of the new operation, which has now become known to Famous Studios at Paramount. Early on, Famous's finished product was indistinguishable from Fleischer's recent output. The existing series (Popeye, Superman) continued as if there was nothing. <br /> <br /> Today's topic, JAPOTEURS is one of the former Famous Studio's SUPERMAN Shorts. <br /> <br /> As was the use, the SUPERMAN cartoons were a great combination of fine, custom music in the score. This applies to the theme (transfer) as well as all background music (accidental) music. This was when each cartoon had its own background music, because everything was kept fresh by drawing it on each photo again. <br /> <br /> With regard to JAPOTEURS, we must remember that it was filmed during the first year of the United States' involvement and the characterization of the enemy was very stereotypical, short-handed and utterly angry. The dialogue and personality of the villains of Japanese saboteurs were strictly out of the stock characters of the old pulp mathematics, with every word spoken in a sarcastic, utterly sincere politeness, as the characters would distort their cold blood as they were the most demonic threats and outrageous acts to the western world. <br /> <br /> JAPOTEURS is visually bright and uplifting, beautifully laid out and utilizing a multi-plane or tabletop animation to give its flying rows a true depth. <br /> <br /> Using the links between animated cartoons, the SUPERMAN Radio Show, heard about the Mutual Broadcasting Network; The cartoon has a close resemblance to the Comics Page and uses the same talents of voice actors Bud Collyer and Joan Alexander of the radio show. <br /> <br /> We rate it with *** Â½ stars. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
