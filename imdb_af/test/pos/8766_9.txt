Barry Kane is a plane factory worker. Some sabotage takes place at the factory and starts a fire. His best friend is dead. They accused him of the act, but Kane knew it was a man named Fry who was there. He becomes a refugee and goes looking for this man named Fry. He is helped by some kind of blind man. He let his cousin, the plate model Patricia Martin, take the man to a local blacksmith to remove his handcuffs. They do not end there because the woman does not believe Barry and wants to take him to the police. But soon he will change her mind about Barry and find out about another sabotage attempt that will soon take place. There is a group of anti-American fascists. And Frank Fry is a member of the group. Saboteur (1942) is another example of the fact that Alfred Hitchcock couldn't make a bad movie. Robert Cummings plays Barry Kane and he is really good at it. Priscilla Lane plays with her good looks Pat Martin. Also really good. Otto Kruger is a great villain as the leader of a fascist group, Charles Tobin. Norman Lloyd, still alive at 94, plays Fry and makes a very credible scoundrel. Vaughan Glaser is the most sympathetic character of the blind man Philip Martin. The dance hall order is fantastic. And also the moments on the circus train. In the end, we're at the Statue of Liberty.
