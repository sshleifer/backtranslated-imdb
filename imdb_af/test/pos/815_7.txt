At one point, Kitty says she can't be alone with him if there's no one else in the house. change from just a year or two before, when anything and everything was right. Good solid plot, but a lot of conversations and mushy love talk. This raises the question of what a girl should look for in a man; should she endure for a man with integrity who treats her well, or just finds a man with big money, as most of the movies have been from the previous 20 years ...? and how do people change when their situation changes? beware of the violence in the strange dance marathon scene. Television viewers from the 1960s will recognize Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon of Batman ..... Also, some strange drama in the off-screen lives for some of the role-players in this one. - Paul Kelly was in prison because he was murdered in a love triangle. Mickey Rooney had a relationship with Norma Shearer, who was 20 years old; Rooney married eight times. Tyler Brooke (Emory) and Spencer Charters (Dad) turned off in real life. The title "Blind Date" has been repeatedly reused, for movies, TV series, and even cartoons, but none of them look the same as this one.
