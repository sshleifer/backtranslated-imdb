If you are looking for a typical war movie, it is not the case, such a note for all the testosterone-pumped massacre war buffers out there, don't bother. Although the film deals with Russian characters in World War II, you should not expect any Nazis, cannons, blood, gore, etc. Seen not. It is not a film about people who are causing war or war. It's a movie about ordinary people about war and the choices they make to handle it. <br /> <br /> Acting, cinematography, writing: all the perfect 10's here. You will definitely appreciate it if you are Russian like me, but if not, you will probably love it. If you don't speak Russian, look for the RUSCICO (Russian Cinema Council) DVD version. It has subtitles in about 14 different languages, but the English dubbing on this one I want to say is just as good. This is of course not as good as the original Russian track (some things are translated into translation), but just as well as the English subtitles. So look, especially if you study film in any aspect.
