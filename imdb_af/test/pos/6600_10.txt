Actually, I have more of a question than a comment. I loved Z-Boys and the Lord of Dogtown. I saw for the first time, when the doc, and while I love the story, I'm curious about why in the movie, Sid was an important character, but in the documentary he was not part of the team, and only called as just a child they knew. Does anyone know the story about it? The story of these boys was wonderful. I never had the skateboarding wagon where I grew up, but my kids enjoyed it. What I saw in local skate parks is what these boys found out. I never knew it. When the movie showed the competition, and Z-Boys did their thing, they were ashamed of the others in the competition.
