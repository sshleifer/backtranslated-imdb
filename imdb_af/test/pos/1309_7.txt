I just watched it with my three children - 12 years (boy), 10 years (son) and 8 years (girl) and this movie was a good old-fashioned family action adventure. Although it is definitely aimed at the children's market (I want to say 5 to 13), it was definitely visible and as a parent it is a pleasure to find a movie that focuses on a wide range of ages, while still being suitable for the whole family to watch - especially younger children. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Ricky, a bit of a nerd with a lively imagination (it can certainly be seen in his daydreaming series) that delivers a kidnapping and great art theft while on - a flight to Washington for a school trip. Ricky's father is an aircraft mechanic, so Ricky not only knows the structure of the aircraft, but is also a top rifle on his computer flight simulator. It's handy when the pilot and co-pilot are cold through a series of misadventures and there is no one left to fly the plane. I don't want to give away the plot anymore.
