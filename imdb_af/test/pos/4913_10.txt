You must think of these lines of Last Tango in Paris, because the mood and emotion are moving in the same direction and keeping the same heights - the difference being that in this exceptional, intense and dry portrayal of love is done under the ruins of a Dostoyevskyian, the environment a gay subcultural environment - perhaps even one that disappears over time, and not the equally persistent but heterosexual context of Bertolucci's own film. <br /> <br /> The last third of this movie shows a passionate love that has never been seen in gay theaters. To speak of porn or gay self-effacement misses the point and intelligence of this work. This film, although on the first impression of taking us into the well-known and often depicted underworld of gay street life, then goes ahead to distort the rules of this genre by exaggerating it in a super-real way. The result is a hyper-charged emotional boost - an exceptional strategy that elevates the drama to one of the great universal themes and giant gestures. <br /> <br /> This movie snatches the high ground due to the brilliant performances by its actors, especially a young Jean Hugues Anglade and director. A Tour-The-Power of the Theater. Outstanding in ambition and it is unceasingly in the depths of human emotion. As a contribution to gay cinema, this movie conquers this difficult ground and makes it its own triumph.
