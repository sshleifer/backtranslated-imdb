This show was so tiring to watch and there are only two numbers of dried-up world (love substitute) and paradise (not me) where you can sit and just consider it all. The opening of this show goes down in history as the most visually exciting, as Madonna enters the stage through a giant Swarovski crystal ball coming from the ceiling and the big screens from behind show images of horses galloping. Horses play a role in this show because of Madonna falling off one. The infamous Madonna scene on the crucifix is ​​in this show as a large screen figure up to 12 million, the number of Afrikaans children due to Aids orphans. At the end comes a website address for anyone interested in donating. We then go to the theme of the environment and again images of politics and religion are shown. There is an interlude and then the show starts again at the music of I Love New York and Ray of Light. This part of the show is one of my favorites with the dancers doing funny hand movements. By the end there is the music number with the song Disco Inferno mixed with the song and the dancers make more of it known. The end is full of energy again, as the show falls to the songs of Lucky Star and Hung Up and hundreds of golden balloons fall from the ceiling at the end of the message "Do you confess?" Come on. The DVD is worth buying and when it came out, the soundtrack for the show was added as a bonus. Jonas Akerlund did a good job with the footage for this show to keep it in line with the style of the tour.
