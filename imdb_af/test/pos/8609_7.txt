Pretty darn good for a French movie. I did not see any of Catherine Breillat's previous films, and so no opinions on her previous work. French cinema usually stays at the ultimate arty movies and leaves the shooting em-ups and star cars to Hollywood. This is probably a good business strategy, as no other nation's film industry will probably have the resources to compete on such projects. Movie-making movies are often a drill because it has little resonance for people who are not in business. But this one kept my interest much more than I thought. Despite the title, (oddly in English), it's really not much of a comedy, despite a few toll moments. I just watched a few Anne Parillaud's movies, but she shows a lot of talent and series, from the action / psychological drama of "La Femme Nikita" to the cruel comedy of "Innocent Blood". This movie also expands its series if she plays a more or less ordinary woman, but is still compelling on the screen. Kudos also went to Roxane Mesquida, with whom I was unknown. She plays a very unspeakable actress for most of the films, whose talent is eventually pulled out. If you don't have to entertain car hunts and explosions, check this one.
