It's a good German treasure chest, it's often pretty exciting and creative, with a fun story and solid performances. All the characters are cool, and Benno Fürmann is wonderful as the psycho-killer, plus Franka Potente gives a fantastic performance as the lead. It took a while to go, but it was never boring, and it also has good deaths, plus the music is creepy. I was fortunate enough to get the caption version, instead of the baptized, and I thought all the characters were very nice, plus it was also very well made and written. It also has very good plot points, and the effects are very well done, plus the end is great. The final is particularly exciting, and Franka Potente was the perfect deciding choice in my opinion, and I wish Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey (David) didn't kill as soon as he was a very cool character. There were actually a few moments where I felt uncomfortable, but in a good way, and I must say this movie deserves all its praise, and although it has plot holes, it's not enough to obstruct the movie. This is a good German treasurer, who is often very exciting and creative, with a fun story and solid performances, I recommend this one! The direction is wonderful! Stefan Ruzowitzky does a great job! Working with excellent camera work, very good angles, big close-ups (see opening sex scene), do a good job of adding creepy atmosphere and just keeping the movie very fast. <br /> <br /> There is quite a bit of blood and gore. We get cadavers cut out, very many gory surgery scenes, very bloody stabbings, people are dissected while still aware, cut off finger, self mutilation, guts, bloody slit throat, many wicked look frozen bodies, lots of blood and more <br /> <br /> The Acting is very solid! Franka Potente is fantastic as head leader, she was very nice, stayed under pressure, vulnerable, easy to see and we can look after her character. The only time she looked was when she had to spit out some bad dialogue here and there, but it wasn't very often, she was wonderful! Benno Fürmann is excellent as the psycho-killer, he was just cold, and wonderful OTT, he really gave me the ships, and was one effective killer! Anna Loos played her role very well, if the smart slut, I dug her. Sebastian Blomberg was wonderful here as Caspar, he was very likeable, and had a mysterious character, his chemistry with Potente was also on, and there was a big turn on him. Holger Speckhahn was good as the Idiot Phil and did his job well. Traugott Buhre is good as prof. Grombek. Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey was great like David, he had a very cool character, and I wish he didn't kill as soon as possible. The rest of the role plays well. <br /> <br /> Overall I recommend this great German slasher !. *** 1/2 out of 5
