It is a strange powerful and moving experience to see the English Patient again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his work is dedicated to a crushing point. The endless moral struggle of those who consciously run a very thin line. In "The Talented Mr Ripley" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amorous Tom Ripley to give the killer a conscience. In "Breaking And Entering" Minghella, Jude Law's character gives the necessity to confess and the rewards are suddenly moving. Here, in "The English Patient", the beloved characters are never too far away from their moving feelings of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They scatter their characters from every appearance into compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is simple and spectacular and her plays with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a "Minghellian" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were somehow the elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself, but thought of his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and frightening about Minghella's opus. I already miss him, but I am grateful for the reflection of his soul that he has left behind.
