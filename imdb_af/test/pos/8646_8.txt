After two short plays that were initially unrelated to the rest of the movie, we see a dark-haired, naturally rich beauty in the back of a limousine. Her driver stops in a strange place on Mulholland Drive, which is a winding, densely wooded dual carriageway, full of homes overlooking Los Angeles. Just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her, two tow cars come from the opposite direction to the limo. Only the dark-haired woman survived. She works on the reef up to Sunset Boulevard and hides in a vacation woman's apartment. Shortly afterwards, Betty (Naomi Watts), the holiday woman's cousin, appeared at the apartment and walked in the dark, haired woman, who now has amnesia. Most of the first part of the movie is Betty and the dark-haired woman is trying to figure out who she is, why people are trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her wallet. It is used with strangely surreal threads on Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional toays in a hoodlums and prostitutes country. <br /> <br /> The above may be a bit complicated and unpleasant, but it's not half that. The film is set up so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation. It is basically guaranteed that you will not understand this movie and you will not have much confidence in coming to your own interpretation for the first time. Even if you have a lot of experience with equal films, such as Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), The I Inside (2003) and The Butterfly Effect (2004) - you don't understand it on a second viewing, either. . The studio was aware of this to the extent that their director David Lynch wrote "10 clues to unlock this thriller" and they put it in the background of the chapter featured in the DVD. Lynch is of a particular mindset, these clues are almost as cryptic as the movie itself. It doesn't help if you try to find out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex. It takes a long time to find out which parts are supposed to be "real," and in some sections there is a complex healing of flashbacks. Only contextual clues are that they are flashbacks. <br /> <br /> But is The Movie Worth Looking To Find Out Worth? Of course it depends on your taste. At surface level, the movie is definitely attractive if you are a fan of surrealism, although it will be a little slow and overly disobedient to some viewers. But these features, and many other surrealistic aspects of the movie, are typical of Lynch. A premier Lynchian moment is the old couple in the beginning bitterly smiling almost as if they were alien people trying to put up. If you are familiar with the style and likes it, you will love it here, but in many ways Mulholland Drive is pretty much understated for Lynch. It is also noteworthy that viewers who are primarily interested in it, or who enjoy as much as other aspects, the Mulholland drive has a rather steamy lesbian scene. It's not free, but I have no problem with gratuitousness, but rather an important hinge in the movie. <br /> <br /> Like all Lynch's movies, it's easy to get into its unique approach to every aspect of cinematic art and its attention to detail. Any serious film student (including "armchair students" / "cinephiles") must study the Mulholland Drive; many will love it. Lynch doesn't move anything. It contains brilliant color schemes (such as the abundance of red and pink) with important symbolism. He makes unusual use of sound, such as the lazy phone that switches to the portion of the score that follows (when Betty arrives first at the airport). He directed his actors to deliver their lines in a variety of bizarre ways, such as his distinctive pauses. He makes his strange and surprising sense of humor penetrate, such as the name "Winkie's" and the "Hot Dogs-made for Pinks" that give some indication of some of the color symbolism. <br /> <br /> Lynch's attention to detail in product design offers important, subtle cues throughout the film to help unlock meaning. It is interesting to note that Lynch equally demands that the DVD programming is unusual - there are no chapters on the disk; you have to either watch the movie in real time or fast forward or rewind to return to specific points. <br /> <br /> If the surrealism and veil of the movie are attractive to you, or if you just love "puzzles," Mulholland Drive is worth looking at that aspect. There is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad, general level. I won't tell the standard interpretation here - it's worth exploring, but only after you've seen the movie a few times and reached your own conclusions. Many articles and monographs were written on film and interpretations; there are even websites dedicated to it. <br /> <br /> For my money, although I generally like Lynch and find many things attractive on Mulholland Drive, it's not quite a 10 for me, at least not yet I have a feeling that my score can still go up and down). For me, however, the "twist" aspect of the movie is much better in other works such as The I Inside and The Butterfly Effect. Mulholland Drive is for me more attractive to its surface surreal touch, but the plot does not carry them as well as Lynch's other movies. <br /> <br /> Still, Mulholland Drive is definitely recommended for the right crowd. If you're serious about film and don't mind thinking about what you're looking at (as if the two don't necessarily coincide), don't miss this one.
