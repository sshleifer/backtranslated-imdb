Five years after working with James Cagney in "The Public Enemy", Mae Clarke makes another appearance, this time as his fiancee with Cagney's character on the other side of the law. She seems to be calling even more of their shots and trying to get Johnny Cave a little more practical with his money and his career. You had to realize that they would come together again after she got him the shoe to challenge her crooked boss; those things have a way of working out in pictures. <br /> <br /> I got a kick to watch Cagney in this one. I usually do, and here he seemed to be able to exchange the distinctive shoulder-shoulder he used to have a good effect in "Angels With Dirty Faces" depicting Rocky Sullivan. It was immediately after he threw Cavanaugh (Robert Gleckler) out of his office during the first attempt to master the new weights and measures. He turned to the camera and held him as if he were completely satisfied with his reaction to the rogue - very cool. <br /> <br /> It is my understanding that it was not one of Cagney's Warner movies, but it might as well be. Warner often adopted the case for the common man and the bare traders and the politicians who protected them would be upright. You also have those great New York City street scenes depicting cars and shops of the era, with homemade signs that price flour at eighteen cents per pound. Hey, how about the furniture store selling the living room for a hundred and eighty dollars, then you might get a single stick chair for that price. <br /> <br /> Best part of the picture is maybe just that meat scene when Cagney, James Burke (Aloysius) and the butchers catch a underweight chicken. One of the movie's lighter moments, but you get an idea of ​​how tense people can get when caught. Same with the truck driver pressured by Johnny for an accurate delivery; He just wasn't used to it. <br /> <br /> All in all, a nice distraction from Cagney's more typical gangster presence, though not the standard of his films. It's easy enough to get one of a handful of public domain Cagney photos there, and is often found in relatively inexpensive combinations.
