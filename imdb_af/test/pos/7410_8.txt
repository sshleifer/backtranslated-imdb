Thought provocative, humble depiction of the human tragedies of war. A small but altruistic view of one family's interaction with the enemy during the Kentucky Civil War. This movie reduces the "glare" of war; Many of today's movies show war as an opportunity to highlight the "hero's" and other glamorous features of the war, but very few attempts to show the true war of war that actually takes on a community. This movie attempts it through a reminder of a person's memory of those days. This movie is declared as a loose translation of an actual event. In fact, this movie is probably a factual reality of hundreds, perhaps thousands of "real events" during the civil war. I recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie.
