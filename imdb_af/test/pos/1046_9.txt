I accidentally discovered this movie and it was really a nice surprise. A Christmas Classic, it's also one of the 40's comedies. The story line is simple: Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) makes her life by writing cooking columns for a magazine. At Christmas, her boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet), asks her to invite a young frail sailor into the Connecticut farm she's writing about. The only problem is: She doesn't have a farm and she can't cook. To get out of the jam, Elisabeth agrees to marry a rich friend (Reginald Gardiner, who has a farm) and flies with her wonderful cook, Uncle Felix, for Connecticut. <br /> <br /> There is a good direction by Peter Godfrey and the role is really great: Stanwyck has never been better than this witty and yet romantic woman. Green Street, Gardiner and Sakall make hilarious and human supporting characters. The only weak point is the leading man, Dennis Morgan. He starts well, but if the movie goes on, it really becomes a drill. One almost feels sorry for Elisabeht Lane to end with him rather than with Gary Cooper or David Niven who would both be more suited to the part. Anyway, this is a joyous Christmas time movie with a refreshing score and I recommend it to anyone who wants to spend fun and lovely holidays in Connecticut.
