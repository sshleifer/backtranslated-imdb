I was lucky to watch this movie in the recently concluded international film festival here. I was actually able to watch another South Korean movie (The Power of Kangwon Province), but Christmas in August caught my attention more. The story is simple enough, the ordinary boy-meeting girl (or will our girl-boy meet?). What made it special to me was how it was delivered. We can say that the film was quiet and engaging. We don't have flashy and confronted romance here, just two ordinary creatures made great fun by their friendship and love expressed to each other. I also loved how the film used pictures as expressions of past and present relationships. I wish it was shown here as a regular movie. I'm sure it will cry out to a bigger audience.
