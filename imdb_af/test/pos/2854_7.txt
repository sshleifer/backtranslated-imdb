Follow fewer spoilers, but nothing you haven't learned to read the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Compiled by a wonderful central performance by Ren√©e Zellweger, nurse Betty is a dark but deceptive, good book. <br /> <br /> Betty is convinced of an emotional and spiritual collapse after she's convinced her messy man's murder, troubled and desperate unfortunate waitress, that a character on her favorite day is soaping her long-lost fiance. Kansas to Hollywood to find him. <br /> <br /> Instead of joking at the expense of Betty's mental state, author John C. Richards is very sympathetic. Zellweger presents her as a lost innocent, not quite helpless but tragically vulnerable yet. Criticism she is never really a victim and although she is undoubtedly horrible, the motives of the characters who treat her poorly are understandable. Even Greg Kinnear as the object of her deceptive feelings can be an egoistic, shiny, arrogant pig, but he truly believes she is just a weird wannabe actress with pockets of talent rather than an insane stalker. <br /> <br /> The passing end where all the main characters in the same place (in this case Betty's home) descended at the same time It is as old as the cinema itself, but it works very well here, even if it is shift in tone unhappy. <br /> <br /> Zellweger is greatly supported by Kinnear and Morgan Freeman, who both do solid work. It's especially enjoyable to see Chris Rock's self-control in his earlier scenes. <br /> <br /> Not as cruel as you would expect, and not at all, nurse Betty fixed entertainment was elevated to someth much more by the main actress.
