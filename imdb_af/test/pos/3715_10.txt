Two soldiers are an excellent example of fine movie-making. The director and producer took a heart-warming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated film, excellent cinematography and lots of creative art. <br /> <br /> The relaxed brisk lifestyle of the brothers was portrayed with great detail, and sharply opposed to the military lifestyle they were using. The interaction between the brothers laughed and brought tears because they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the back trees of North Carolina and an even harder war life. <br /> <br /> The play was great, especially from the younger brother who was new to the big screen (played by Jonathan Furr), the older brother (played by Ben Allison) and the powerful perfomrance by the colonel (played by Ron Perlman). The show was very well thrown. <br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of Two Soldiers, and I warmly recommend it to audiences of all ages.
