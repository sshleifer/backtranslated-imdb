This movie is mainly based on people's emotions and interactions. There are only three places (the school, the shop and the coach's house) that are really used. However, it is especially at the coach's home. A movie does not have to be special effects or incredible views in itself. <br /> <br /> Meet four friends who have been bound during their basketball life. One is rich, important, and has no true love outside of money. One wants to be mayor again, but his competition makes him sour. One wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family. One is a travel alcoholic. <br /> <br /> First, I love the actors in this movie. They are all household names for me. They proved their worth here. <br /> <br /> One of the key moments is when Tom, played by Gary Sinise, arrives at the coach. He yelled and shouted about how the coach was cheating in the winning game. She blew the coach's whistle and shouted his catches: "Forgive my Father, for I have sinned!" It's great to watch, with energy just chewing you. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotions and does not need bright effects to interest them.
