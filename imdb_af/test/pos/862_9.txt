Wow, Stella Shorts is great! Many customers of The State and Stella, the TV show. I never knew Stella could have gotten better, then they were on the TV show Stella or even Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I also never knew short comedies could be any good. My loved ones were Pizza, Racking Leaves, The Woods and David arranging for a meeting with his long-lost cousin Greg. I think about everything that David was the funniest. It's funny if he doesn't make sense. I like the music in the shorts. That's something I pay close attention to. They always had good music taste. I wish they had even made shorts, or come back sitcom. I hope they still make good and funny comedy.
