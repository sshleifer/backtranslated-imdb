"Fame" has been one of my favorite movies for years! It's not just an 80-year-old music movie from "that" high school in NYC, it's LEGENDARY - people no longer refer to the High School of Performing Arts, but "the Fame School" !! <br /> <br /> The characters are actually, they're not "Hollywood" and their stories are real. The film follows them through the four years of school, starting with a powerful monologue by one student at auditions and finishing with a spectacular graduation program. <br /> <br /> Apparently some find the Broadway show better, but it is my opinion that you should definitely see this movie and then have your own view. For anyone who is watching a movie and wants the "classic", it is certainly one of them. It's an example of one of those movies that was really good, with actors we loved for the 2 hours, and they never saw them again ... they are classic "Fame students". <br /> <br /> Make FAME live forever.
