Canthony is correct that this little short is just an excuse to hear a very young Judy Garland (fourteen years old) singing with a slightly older (by one year) Deanna Durbin. But I don't have to agree with everything he or she said, including the running time - it's just about ten minutes, not twenty (a single player). <br /> <br /> The song isn't her best, of course; but it's nice and definitely worth the ten minutes to watch Turner. The duet with Durbin is very interesting: two conflicting styles that are still pretty good. <br /> <br /> The short is just a throw away, but it is nowhere as bad as the other reviewer does. Honestly, I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Dafydd ab Hugh
