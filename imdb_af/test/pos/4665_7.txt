As a movie, the Italian work is fine; good (not big) acting, <br /> <br /> nice visual and pacing, a mediocre plot, but nothing bad enough <br /> <br /> to walk out. But as a car commercial for the new MINI <br /> <br /> Coopers, this movie is spectacular! <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Ok, it's a typical shock movie with the strange twist (the underwater safe was nice, if not unlikely) and the screw was pretty solid. /> <br /> (with the exception of a bad Wahlberg) but when it all comes <<br /> <br /> In addition, the right "stars" of this photo were the three MINI <br /> <br /> Coopers, in all their high-speed crash disasters, ramp-up, <br /> <br /> bullet-taking, gold-lugging, shiny new glory. The audience I was <br /> <br /> actually puts under "oed" and "aahed" when Theron's small <br /> <br /> red number hit the screen first (oddly enough, neither she nor /> <br /> <br /> Wahlberg got the same reaction). <br /> <br /> The movie starts to look promising. Mos Def, Seth Green, Donald <br /> <br /> Sutherland, Edward Norton and Jason Statham all start out as an <br /> <br /> interesting and humorous band of characters, with the only thing <br /> Uninspired performance is that of the usually good Mark <br /> <br /> Wahlberg. Why he claims it's his best movie I can't imagine; his <br /> <br /> character is quite one-note, and he plays so badly as if he was <br /> <br /> Rogers returned from death and was inhabiting <br /> <his body. Charlize is good as Sutherland's daughter, though <br /> <br /> nothing magical. Seth Green's character is perfect and <br /> <br /> running Napster jokes (including a cameo by the founder of Napster, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> is hilarious, he and some of Mos Def's early <br /> <br /> lines add some needed sparks of humor. Unfortunately, <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland don't get enough <br /> <br /> screen time. <br /> <br /> You can get the most of the plot away from miles, and the <br / > <br /> dialogue is full of bad one-liners and give-aways, but I doubt the <br /> <br /> filmmakers would find the wheel here again, taken as <br /> <br /> typical action / suspense flick it looks good. Worth looking at <br /> <br /> cheap night, I would recommend. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Not worth it it is weight in gold, but makes good fillings.
