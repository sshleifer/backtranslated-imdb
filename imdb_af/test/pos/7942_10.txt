Alexander Nevsky (1938) is a brilliant piece of film propaganda. The people of Russia are threatened by two great enemies, the Mongols and the Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. In order to unite the warring, competitive princess in the Russian empire, Nevsky assumes the minority of two evils (The Teutonics). This influential film has been copied many times and it still holds to this day. The soundtrack through composer Prokiev and Eisentstein's direction is a face and sound to watch. Many years later, John Milius used many of the movie scenes, made pieces and costumes of this film and included in Conan. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Conan lines was taken from this movie. "It's not the power of the iron in a weapon, but the power of the person using it is what matters." The comparisons are unmistakable. The armor worn by James Earl Jones and the leader of the Teutonic Knights is virtually identical. A true tribute paid from one director to another. <br /> <br /> I give Alexander Nevsky one of my highest recommendations. The film plays like Richard III's final law. The presence of Prince Alexander on the screen is truly wonderful.
