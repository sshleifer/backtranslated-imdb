The actors in this dark film are truly credible and well-cast. The quality of the camera work makes you feel like you are there. The script is intense and does not wander. The plot is one that lets you see it a second time from the new perspective that has reached the end. We showed this movie to a small group of customers at Gadsden's Center for Cultural Arts. After the film, the patron was ever eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say they were still "bothered". As we set an 18-year-old on the film, I will see the movie with a youth group as it is a very real portrayal of an ugly situation and the stage for a good conversation.
