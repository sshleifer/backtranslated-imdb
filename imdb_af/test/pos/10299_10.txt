It's an astonishing movie: a romantic thriller with a complicated but perfectly constructed and devastating symmetrical plot, brilliantly emphasized by the use of repetitive visual motifs. Everything in it is beautifully filmed: the women, the apartments; But more surprising is the devastating juxtaposition of images, almost every scene has a different echo. It is a story that is told in light, in color, in many almost parallel. Every time I see it, it fills me with joy. <br /> <br /> The play is also good. Romane Bohringer is stunning as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown: everything about her changes with her mood. Vincent Cassel plays a very different role in his role in La Haine; but not less excellent: Shifty and sympathetic at the same time. And Monica Bellucci - ah !, Monica Bellucci, well, simple, she's playing (is?) The world's most perfect woman. There is a small scene about three-quarters of the way through which she does nothing but smile; But in that moment, say more than hours of Hollywood junk. <br /> <br /> One can't really do this movie without mentioning the wonderful, sequential climax: sad, shocking, ironic and subtle. But if a moment captures the brilliance of this work, it is the beginning of this wonderful unbundling, the prospect previously laid before us throughout the story. But when the moment comes, it is treated so fine, so short, so fine, that it leaves you with reflection. Only a director of staggering confidence would dare to underline this important point. But trust is justified. Cinema doesn't get much better than that.
