If I could only watch one program throughout my life, I would definitely choose "The Chaser's War on Everything". Of all the satirical shows that were on Australian television, I found that "Chaser" is the funniest of all. It's just as wonderful, the boys aren't afraid to do anything. <br /> <br /> Whether it's like Hitler getting into a Polish club, or pushing a MASSIVE ball of rope around Melbourne is the Tourism ad or rocking to the Coke factory naked in a bath with $ 2.40 to buy water. The Chaser boys go there. <br /> <br /> In accordance with the comments above (and / or below), "The Chaser's War on Everything" is more popular than their previous program "CNNNN". But CNNNN was just as funny. Some unforgettable moments of the show ... Clean Cambodia! Classic. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to stop me from Ranting, at least I advise you to give Chaser a chance, you will probably find it more than likely!
