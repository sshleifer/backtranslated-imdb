I saw this movie when I was very young. It's my favorite time. Until recently I couldn't get a copy and it brought back so many good memories. I loved Sidney Poiter's portrayal of Porgy, he has his character with so much power and courage. Pearl Bailey's share, though small, was no different from many of our own relatives. My favorite songs were and still are "Bess You Are My Women," "Porgy, don't handle him" and of course "Summertime." According to the guidelines, if I interpret them correctly, I can't place where I could get my copy, Sorry. That's why I registered so I can share this information. Prior to registration, the guidelines are not posted. <br /> <br /> Phone numbers, postal addresses, URLs. Availability, price, or order / shipping information.
