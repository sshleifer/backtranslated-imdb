It's an amazing movie and is very clever to use the few actors and sets. It's also very shocking. The physical and psychological torture (both explicit and implied) is mixed with peaceful and even humorous regions. So the horror is always unexpected and brutal. I'm not soft, but it will be the most shocking movie I've ever seen. The message of this movie is definitely delivered with a sledge hammer. This is the movie I will always remember for both actors.
