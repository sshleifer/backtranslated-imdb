Here we left the tireless Charlie Chaplin's bad past to tackle the serious issue of anti-Semitism, and intolerance in general. He portrays two characters - the lovely, innocent Jewish barber - a war veteran, and the rogue and relentless dictator, Adenoid Hynkel. The Jewish ghetto in this country has not been safe for a long time, due to the whims of Hynkel and his armed boyfriends, who often snatch or release his inhabitants, depending on his mood that day or week. The hairdresser is among them, but is befriended by his former commander, Schultz (Reginald Gardner), who looks silent for a while until Hynkel condemns him to a concentration camp. He seeks refuge with the Jews in the ghetto, especially the hairdresser, and the feathery young woman, Hannah (Paulette Goddard). The point of departure will be - who will be the one among these Jews to put their lives at risk to get rid of Hynkel and his cronies? We should not be too hard to know the answer; The hairdresser is a dead ring for the dictator, and he is exhibited in his image, along with Schultz, also in full military equipment. Hannah escapes several of her ghetto friends to the land of Osterlich, where Mr. Jaeckel's cousin (a cousin) has a farm, and they can live quietly for a while. At this stage, Hynkel himself was arrested by his armed forces and thought to be the notorious hairdresser. The latter has been accompanied with Schultz on a podium to make a speech announcing the conquest of Osterlich. The next ten minutes are pure Chaplin himself, speaking from his heart of tolerance, love and freedom and denial of greed and hatred. Although Chaplin started the movie in 1937, it can be naively forgiven. He was allegedly unaware of the seriousness of this persecution and hatred and said he knew the full extent. He would never have made the movie because he probably believed it would trivialize the situation. He has a wonderful supporting role player: Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell as Garbitsch, his aide-de-camp, the always wonderful Billy Gilbert as the grumpy herring, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie as dictator Napaloni, his contender for conquest, veteran European actors David Gorcey (Leo's father), Maurice Moscovich, among others. The scene he choreographed with the world, with just a musical accompaniment, is mere, light inspiration, and light. Paulette Goddard is also at the end of the film and smiles through her tears. I've seen this movie before, but there's always something new to me. Last night, when I was done, I sat in tears. I am telling anyone not to move through it.
