The A team is still repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, about 1800hrs) and I still watch it! I don't like the A team ... I absolutely love them !! It's just nice to chase Justin's former A-Team members. Bringing back memories of the old days, when I was young, a sweet. I would have given you a 10 for excellent, but Justin seems to be chasing the former A-Team members all by himself. Of course, this is the only bad thing about this documentary version. Bad Justin doesn't look at Melinda Culea ("Amy A. Allen"). But it is wonderful to see Mr. T. see again in action. Too bad for him, he didn't appear at the party at the end. But the party is too short to laugh again and see everyone in action again.
