>>> Big news there is a BBC DVD release scheduled for July 31, 2006, UK - there's also a scheduled release in the states - don't know the date - can't wait! ! <<<<< br /> <br /> >>>> Below is my original comment <<<<<< br /> <br /> I agree with all the other reviewers - it's just amazing that one of The biggest TV dramas have never been released on DVD <br /> <br /> The story line is alluring - the acting is excellent and character development is encouraging! <br /> <br /> Here in the UK we have quite a history of getting TV drama series and movies on DVD through popular campaigns. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to see why the real-estate owners are not in a DVD production? I'm going to see e-mail one of the leading players in this grass roots movement and see what happens. Who did the production? was it the BBC? RW
