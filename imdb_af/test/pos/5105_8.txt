Trapped this 1969 movie on the cable TCM one night. I remember when I first saw in Hong Kong, I really enjoyed the songs and performances of Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. I like Clark the best in Francis Ford Coppola's "Finian's Rainbow" (1968) versus Fred Astaire, Don Francks and Tommy Steele. Simply ecstasy to finally get to know this, this beautiful Irish-flavored pot of gold is released on DVD! Oh, that's the old devil's moon (in your eyes). <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as Mr. Chips - yes, he sang - quite a liberation. He may not be a veteran of musical like Rex Harrison, but he has miraculously occupied the role. The scene of him flying over the lawn in his monkey reminds me of the PBS series, "To serve them all my days" - a lovely schoolmaster and loving man, he is, sir. Chipey. "Clark and O'Toole just gave us the right mix of spunk and circumstances. Leslie Bricusse's songs and lyrics are as usual. The songs of" you and I "and" walk through the world (with me) " stayed with me for most of the years, and there is "What a lot of flowers", "And the air smiled," "Fill the world with love" - ​​not at all streaky. songs and words are immersed, we will overcome all contention on earth and "wonderful" will be all our days! Yes, "Talk to the animals," too. ("Doctor Doolittle" 1967) <br /> <br /> Musicals is a blessing to the world of filmmakers, they are somehow greater than life, such as the music and lyrics of the Sherman Brothers (Richard M. and Robert B.) that our "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" (1968 ) and "Mary Poppins" (1964) - who would not be completely satisfied with the statement "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"? I was ripped off by just one li edgy and dance number in the Spanish film "Km.0 - Kilometer Zero" (2000). My favorite is French film maker Jacques Demy's "Young Girls of Rochefort" (1967) with colorful film Catherine Deneuve and (late sister) Francoise Dorleac, Jacques Perrin, Michel Piccoli, Danielle Darrieux, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris singing, dancing to Michel Legrand's music. Long live musical.
