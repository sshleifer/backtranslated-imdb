In December 1945, a train leaves the central station of Stockholm to Berlin. There is not much left when it arrives. Not from the train and not from some passengers. <br /> <br /> It is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used in the 40's and also photographed (as they used to) during that time. The actors had a lot of fun doing it. They aren't many characters, as they weren't in the 40's, but the story is well told and everyone has timing. <br /> <br /> A deadly black and deadly funny movie. See it if you didn't think Sweden could give humor.
