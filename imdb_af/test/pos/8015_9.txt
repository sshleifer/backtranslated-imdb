It was two video shot movies that Troama decided, was terribly so in a desperate move in this one movie. Perhaps the bitterness on Troama's side helped spark the comedy, but for whatever reason, it's very funny with an inspired bit with Oliver Stone to comment on the movie. Many cameos, much like the Lesbian Cannibal HoeDown song adds to the fun. Trey Parker, Ted Raimi, Julie Strain, etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> One of the best of recent Troama releases. Yes, it's all over the road, knowing it is going, the quality of production, or the lack, is becoming one of the many running jokes. Go along and you'll be on time. <br /> <br /> The behind-the-scenes, often the best things about Troama versions are also average this time around. I think they really helped the rage they felt about these two separate movies, but they didn't drive them, but drove them to "fix" this movie in a way that is better than one of those movies they originally planned.
