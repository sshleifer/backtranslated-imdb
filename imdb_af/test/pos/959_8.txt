Well, it might be a kid's movie ... maybe, but I won't show my kids 9! So the one who says it's a kid's movie. Hmm? It's teen movie, I agree. but back to the movie it's about a boy who can lie very well. So good that nobody ultimately lies the truth or lies. It's a nice movie to watch beautiful screenplay, and I agree a 8 for screenplay and story. ... I think their writers are making a small lesson that is ... "" The truth is never overhauled ".
