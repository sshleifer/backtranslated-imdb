This movie is where the Batman franchise had to stop. Although I would admit that the ideas behind Batman Forever were excellent and could easily be realized by a competent director, as it turned out that was not the case. <br /> <br /> Apparently Warner Brothers' drivers were disappointed with how dark this second Batman movie from Tim Burton pointed out. Apart from the idiot to expect something different from Burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to change the franchise in the sixties' TV series, I do not understand how Batman Returns can be considered in all disappointments . True, it is not quite the same as the first movie, although it restores all the minor shortcomings of the style found in "Batman", a weaker writing that divides the antagonism between not only two, but three characters invite comparisons with the masterful mating of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Still, it remains a wonderful dark film, where Batman was always meant to be highly satisfying. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton returns as Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, who along with Nouveau Riche magnate Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honor of the German silent actor of the 1920s), Oswald Cobblepot , the penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's "Richard III") and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), who romances Wayne as himself and as the Batman. The four principals turn into excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the dark side of dual identities. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting concepts in this movie. About the only weakness I can really point out, in some places there is a certain limpness on the script, which I think mostly about the way this movie is a quadrilateral. There simply isn't enough time to explore properly. <br /> <br /> Still, it's a damn good movie. I strongly recommend watching it with the first and crying for how well the series could have been if it continued under Burton and Keaton.
