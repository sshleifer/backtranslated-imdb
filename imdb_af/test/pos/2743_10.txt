This is a spectacular and enjoyable adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's best and well-earned academy award. Special mention should be made of the excellent music score and sound effects, which is an integral element in making this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon. Later episodes in the series (of which a total of four were) were not actually based on the original Dr Seuss material, although everything except the latter used its familiar rhyme style. The three successors were: Gerald McBoing Boing's Symphony (1953); How now Boing Boing (1954); Gerald McBoing Boing On Planet Moo (1956) - although in a later episode of Mr. Magoo appeared.
