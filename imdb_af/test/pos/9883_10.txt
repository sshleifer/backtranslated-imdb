This film shows dear irony, rough dogs roundabout story lines woven with subtle cultural references, classic parallel, masterful use of rich saturated color and fabulous display of keystone scenes from Keystone Cops. <br /> <br /> The cast of the cast and the whole crew is charming. Literally. How else can I proceed like this? <br /> <br /> This movie talks to everyone. The sophisticated and gripping use of so many universal archetypes: This makes this film so deeply satisfying. <br /> <br /> As a mature student of the movie, I find Checking Out contains all the key elements. Certainly and Bergorra, this is not the Godfather, but will perfectly serve as a successor; Tragedy's mandatory Satir game that binds your collective Catholic wounds. <br /> <br /> Come to a theater and watch this movie, you'll be treated to a unique masterpiece.
