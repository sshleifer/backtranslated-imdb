This photo was released in May 1979 with the lead roles of Playboy Playmate Susan Kiger as Honey Shayne, Playboy Playmate Lisa London as O'Hara and Playboy Playmate Pamela Jean Bryant as Terri Lynn. In one of the nicest neck comedies in the enrollment history, a whole host of young delights come together in a story of struggling compassionate girls who will do nothing to shed everything. So, what does H.O.T.S really stand for? You're going to have to watch the movie to get the answer. You see, the girls have problems with society girls on campus, which they make up to be nothing but sex that has found ways. That is why the girls set out to discredit society girls, no matter what they need to do to get the job done. In addition, the dean of the college is breaking into the mess, who wants to break down the group of girls before they get out of control. I really love this movie for Lisa London. I thought her acting was fantastic and I was disappointed that she didn't get other acting work. Based on the three playmates alone, I give this movie 10 wheel stars.
