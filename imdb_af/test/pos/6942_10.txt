In nineteen twenty-two when it was announced that the disinfection would be made, there was a storm of controversy. It was an event that left open wounds in the hearts and minds of Australian people. After a few changes (listening to the well-timed phones that listened to disguised names), the dismissal went up. It was nothing short of brilliant. The guide was perfect. Max Phipps as Gough Whitlam leads the way, now followed by John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and the evergreen John Mellion as Sir John Kerr. The time was well created, the feelings of the people were well done and the political elements were not two dimensionally made in melodrama as in so many American series. The Dismissal was a faithful re-creation of a time in Australia, some of which would rather forget and we cannot forget. It didn't take sides and it pointed out the mistakes and lies of both sides. This allows one to maintain the anger and change the constitution that makes it possible. The Dismissal is now available on DVD in Australia. Look at it, learn from it and learn about our modern history.
