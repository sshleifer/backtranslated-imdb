After a very long time, the Marathi theater came with a good movie. This movie is one of the best Marathi movies ever made. It shows how a grandfather tries to save his grandson's eye. He tries everything that is possible in his hands to save the child's eye. Doctor and family member of his efforts to help him in his attempt. <br /> <br /> The behavior of the grandfather, the boy and the doctor is simply excellent. They have shown true picture of a typical Marathi life. Every bit of action has a measure in it. I would recommend watching this movie because initially I thought this one would be of a documentary nature, but it was beyond my expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie will touch your heart. I would expect more Marathi movies to perform with such representations.
