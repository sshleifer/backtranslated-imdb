Seriously engaging, intelligent and thought-provoking drama at its best. Meaningful, gripping, moody and engaging. Every house must have a copy! Don't use my word because it sees yourself. One Life makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive acting make one of the best biographical graphical experiences of the year. John Kielty's debut is a delight and adds a true touch of truth and realism to this deep and eager movie. This is a caring movie and has an honesty that has been unprecedented in recent years. No car racing, but a movie full of hum and our emotion. I only played this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2000 and am now delighted to have a copy on DVD.
