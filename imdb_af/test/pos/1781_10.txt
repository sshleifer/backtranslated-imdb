Decalog Five was an interesting viewing experience for me, due to the question that Kieslowski subtly predicted to the audience. Three men are the focus of this chapter, and Kieslowski offers the two involved in killing with both attributes as well as bad (in the case, almost overwhelmingly). With such dirty characters, I almost found myself receiving a kind of punishment. But when the time comes for the murder (And this is the subsequent impact on the murderer), Kieslowski takes an interesting angle and looks to those of us who shared my view, "Are you not as guilty as this man?" " This kind of indirect address of the audience makes the final of Decalog Five as much deeper as Kieslowski (As usual) does not remain within the literal limitations of his theme. Just as the other parts of the Decalogue do not accept their commandments in the literal sense, neither do decalogues. It asks us what is murder, who is more guilty of murder and what should be the appropriate punishment, if any? It's a fantastic movie and typical of Kieslowski, absolutely stunning.
