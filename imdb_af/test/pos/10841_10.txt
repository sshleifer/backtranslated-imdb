The Andrew Davies adaptation of the Sarah Waters novel was excellent. The characters from Nan and Kitty are beautifully portrayed by Rachael Stirling and Kelley Hawes respectively. The whole series was a total joy to watch. It caught the imagination of everyone across the board, either straight or gay. I wish there could be a sequel!
