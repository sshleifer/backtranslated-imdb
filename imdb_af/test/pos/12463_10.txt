There is absolutely no doubt that this version of Tarzan is closest to Burroughs' vision. While compiling his royalties from the films produced during his lifetime, he often made it clear that they were little more than the bastards of his stories. The movie studios' ridiculous obsession with the harvest of Olympic swimmers like Tarzan was over. I think we should be happy that they didn't put their images on shooters. <br /> <br /> For this movie, the most faithful adaptations were in cartoons and comics. As good as some of this, we had to wait seven decades for a filmmaker with the integrity to respect the character as he was created.
