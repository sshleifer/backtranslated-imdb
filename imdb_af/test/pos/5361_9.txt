I saw it at a German press screen. Without giving away too much: Most critics really liked it. There was even applause after that, which is quite unusual for that species. From my point of view, and so far, it was the funniest movie of the year. It keeps the charms and whites of the three W + G shorts and is enlarged with many references to these and other movies. Of course, there are obvious talk of monster and werewolf movies, especially for an American werewolf in London, Jaws, King Kong and even Peter Jackson's Braindead / Dead Dead. Other genres. <br /> <br /> Characterization was better done in "Chicken Run", but the movie had a complete new cast where introduction was needed. Here you can know all the two main characters. So, the new "Wallace and Gromit" movie is best enjoyed if you have watched the shorts (and likes it), but it also works on its own. "Chicken Run" had the more convenient, but also more "storytelling" plot. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece holds those crazy and somehow more 'isolated' feel to the W + G shorts. Children should also enjoy it, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love cute bunnies, it's a must see for you !!!) and because Gromit does a lot and really steals the show (kids are too love dogs ... :-)). But many jokes are thought of for a more mature audience (there are even soft sexual cues in it). The movie manages, like "Shrek 1 + 2" and "The Incredibles", to perform high-level entertainment for the whole family, with a British and at least a little darker edge in the humor of American animation films. <Br /> <br /> The animation is ?? as expected ?? beautiful, and they kept true to the Aardman style because they didn't have too many digital effects - I just realized a few when it came to Wallace's inventions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the score works well in the movie, although one of the main themes is definitely lent by Randy Edelman's "Dragonheart" count. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is: It will probably take another six years before we get a new animated jewel from Nick Park & ​​Co.
