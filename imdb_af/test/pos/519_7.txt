"Witchery" is a decent little Euro-Trash horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and unfortunately he is one of the better actors. Linda Blair is actually awful and the woman Hoff's wife plays ... she's hilariously bathed! The plot of this movie is also ridiculous. It has a few holes that you can't help but it still keeps entertaining. <br /> <br /> The gore in "Witchery" is freaking outstanding. I loved the part where the old bag "sucked" into the trash and ends up in the chimney to fry! And the part where the woman "made use of the devil" was fairly indignant. I want to say this one is a must for ghore. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an overproduction, well-directed movie, look elsewhere. But if you like the old school style Italian sleaze and over the top gore, "Witchery" belongs to your shelf. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised at the low rating here! What did you expect from people, "The Exorcist?" 7 out of 10, kids.
