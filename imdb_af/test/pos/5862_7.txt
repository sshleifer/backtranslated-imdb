Barbet Schroeder's "Murder by Numbers" with Sandra Bullock is solid work, though not particularly compelling. I am a great Sandra Bullock fan, and she is effective here as forensic detective Cassie Mayweather, who is not very nice and also a broken person. However, there is a sense of debauchery inherent in the story structure. It's about the perfect murder performed by two spoiled sociopath teenagers, Richard (Ryan Gusling), who is the cool one, and Justin (Michael Pitt) is the sympathetic geek. In fact, Richard and Justin murder a young woman because they have nothing better to do on a school night. They are very clever and very arrogant, which is usually not a bad thing, but it doesn't work here. Tony Gayton's screenplay does a good job describing the investigation of a mysterious murder, and it's really by the numbers. We've got these two punk kids convinced they are superior and we just want them to fall. <br /> <br /> It's not a good exploration in the dark, like Schroeder's "Reversal of Fortune" about Claus von Bulow. There are interesting turns in "Numbers". The movie is not so much a thrill, but rather a Cassie character study. Sandra Bullock balances Cassie's bravado, her fear of getting people in with her and her secret past. Bullock brings courage and strength to a suffering character. Her partner and kind of love, Sam (played by Ben Chaplin), is more of a plot than a true character. Although Chaplin makes the admiration thing very wonderful. The other nice touch is that Richard and Justin involved a strange sexual attraction. The most interesting thing about "Numbers" is Pitt and Gusling. <br /> <br /> There are many entertaining twists and turns throughout the movie. Everything is done very skillfully. I saw the movie a week ago, and in retrospect I keep it a little more than I did when I saw it. However, it is just not inspired work. Sandra Bullock and Barbet Schroeder deserve much better, and so do we.
