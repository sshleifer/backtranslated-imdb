Overall, I enjoyed the movie Scarlett. I'm a big fan of Gone with the Wind. I read the book and saw the classic movie many times. I even have a small collection of Scarlett O'Hara ornaments and other things. I must admit that Gone with the Wind is my favorite book and movie. Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable are remarkable actors and two of my favorites. Unfortunately I couldn't read the Scarlett book, but I was excited to see the movie. Truth is being told, the movie is not near the caliber of Gone with the Wind nor the actors. Joan Whalley Kilmer and Timothy Dalton, however, were pleasant actors in the roles and Joan sounded much like Vivian Leigh in her portrayal of Scarlett. Dalton also depicted Rhett well. It took time for the different actors, but overall I really enjoyed it, the fan of Gone with the Wind like me. One big disappointment was that Joan didn't have green eyes and Scarlett O'Hara and Vivian Leigh both did. I also found the Lord Fenton absolutely terrible and I didn't have his character. If you are a Gone with the Wind fan and / or enjoy romantic stories, see the movie Scarlett. Don't expect it to be remarkable like Gone with the Wind. It's far from it, although it's interesting with the new characters and so on. I'm happy it's not a remake and some of the events in the story I thought were the continuation of being the Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler love story. If you haven't seen it today, will it get it tomorrow? Tomorrow is another day tomorrow. :)
