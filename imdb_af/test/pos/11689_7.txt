Wow. First I thought who wrote these things! How difficult is the choice between a man who gives you and your children wealth, respect and security as opposed to a man who only offers you oppression, abuse, decline and poverty. But our choices are not always so clearly cut as one would think. In fact, the rich man was all that a woman could pursue and yet ... pulling her husband, her sexual desire for him was almost overwhelming. What to do, what to do ?? As a viewer you have become so confused and wrong as she was. Anyway, what I really did come to this site was my admiration for the English voice, I thought, though it's actually the voice of an Irish singer in the movie. When he looked up, I found him to be Glen Hansard, whom I had never heard before. What a find. I'm so grateful. Wow, what a voice! What a day! Thanks BIFF!
