Jimmy Stewart brings Charles Lindbergh's story to life when he almost tells the film as he crosses the Atlantic Ocean. It was well worked out with flashbacks on Lindebergh's life. Franz Waxman score is scarcely brilliant and really gives the picture a heroic feel. One of Stewart's best roles and this movie can deliver time and time again. Search for performances by Murray Hamilton (Mayor of the JAWS Movie) as Bud Gurney. Get out on DVD 8-15-06 with the release of some more Stewarts classic movies. I see Jimmy Stewart as America's greatest actor and never get tired of seeing him in any movie I see, watching this photo and you will agree.
