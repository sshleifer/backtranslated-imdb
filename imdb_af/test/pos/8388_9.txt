Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy, glorious. Built on the framework of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds closed the oblong training series of The Dirty Dozen to dive into action immediately. In the process, Tarantino repaired one of the biggest flaws of the dirty box by giving the bad guys the time to remind us just how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis with the most screen time eventually become the most complete human characters in the film, which ironically makes them even worse monsters. <br /> <br /> Besides the training series, Tarantino can also give us a photo. of the whole war, which not only shows us British, American and German soldiers, but also us in the world of French and German civilians, both co-workers and resistance. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that any Tarantino movie will have fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino decided to speak French characters French and speak the Germans German, beyond the level of authenticity, Tarantino also has some way to ensure that his dialogue in French was so sharp and funny and clever. as his English dialogue. <br /> <br /> The Nazi Jew Hunter SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) questioned the French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet) during the opening hours. Landa suspects that LaPadite hides a family of Jews. As he subtly presses LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. After he eagerly rescued it, Landa complimented LaPadite with his daughters and his cows, a good family and a man, you are bravo. The thing is, in French, "vache" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If he was reprimanded for this vulgar pun, Landa was actually able to claim convincingly that he did not understand French well enough to mean that, but Landa meant it and that meant it as a threat. And LaPadite understands his meaning too well. <br /> <br /> It is a very subtle piece of acting and word game that many audiences will never catch, or at least they can understand the subtext without the exact nature of the threat. The movie is rich in that kind of detail. All the French and English dialogues are chosen with the same attention to detail and while I cannot swear to the German, I would suspect that this is a similar level of craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> Inglorious Basterds opens with the phrase "Once Upon a Time ... in Nazi-Occupied France." Personally, it reminds me of opening every Asterix book and movie, another comic fantasy in a war-torn occupied France. Like Asterix, Inglorious Basterds are shockingly funny in places, although the movie also gets dark. <br /> <br /> In his more serious moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first victims of war compassion and the ability to relax, like almost every oblong order of the movie, Tarantino finds a new way of cruel tension to build at almost unbearable levels. <br /> <br /> Tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous, even flammable, and that its power deserves respect. <br /> <br /> If you can see this movie as I did in a packed theater filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke, you will see this masterful movie as it was meant to be seen. If you are not that happy, all you will see is a wonderful, fantastic movie that delivers a dark funny punch.
