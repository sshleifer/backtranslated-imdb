I saw this movie as a child and fell in love with it. It has a lovely sensitive story. Something that children can appreciate. I was as sweet as a child I had to get my daughter. This is definitely a movie I will watch with children. It reminds me of many stories of a Disney nature such as Pete's Dragon and Mary Poppins. Both because of the live action and cartoon functions, but on its forefront. It is also a good story to show children that if they tell the truth, they can be trusted and adults will listen to them. I think all children should see it and enjoy it. It's such a break from the violent movies of bad taste, so many kids are watching these days. It has all the beautiful features so much of today's movies.
