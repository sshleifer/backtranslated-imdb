This movie is not supposed to be funny, but it made me laugh. <br /> <br /> It's not designed to be sad, but my heart feels heavy with a number of vignettes. <br /> <It's not written as an action adventure, but my wrist picked more than once. <br /> <br /> Like life, this movie does not manipulate your emotions and tell you how to feel. It's simple and you respond. <br /> <br /> If you're not funny or sad or moving, I suspect there's more to you than the movie. <br /> <br /> Seeing a director is amazing and refreshing, celebrating so much that we are all human and embracing that we are all trapped here, doing this "life" thing over and over again as long as we must. <br /> <br /> Tomorrow is another day.
