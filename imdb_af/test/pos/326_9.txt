I saw this movie when it was released and it is undoubtedly touching the heart. I like the point of view of a child who realized that what she was thinking of her was not really true. It's a piece for that little kid. And her quest to find out who she is. And before and after she knows her, the relationship between her and her foster mother. It's a nice view. A R Rahman adds his stress to good re-recording and songs. Do not exaggerate in this movie or give advice (as in Vuyire), but just tell the characters as it is. And as a result, the film hits the audience. The swimming pool of chakkarvarthy and nandhitadas didn't convey perfectly what it meant. Mani Ratnam has improved incredibly.
