In a time of predictable films, in which violence, cheap romance and melodrama are abundant, it's amazing to find such a strange movie. the plot itself is compelling, and the actors are excellent, especially Alan Rickman. If you want to see a movie that does not provide all the answers before asking the questions, a movie that will surprise you (good or bad), Dark Harbor's for you. And if you're not convinced, believe me that Alan Rickman's performance is worth it ... especially at the end, ladies ....
