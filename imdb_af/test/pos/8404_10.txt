away with the wind and scarlett are two different films they never intended to be compared. The original gwtw actors are all dead and deserve their own separate award and praise. I loved gwtw and never really expected a successor to be made or ever live. up to half the praise of gwtw, but for my shock scarlett was just as well directed and acted as gwtw scarlett in his own right deserves just as much awards i can honestly say i don't know what i like better, i think writing for Scarlett was a perfect number 1 as a successor. Bravo! author director producer and all actors Bravo! As successors, their name seldom lives, this one is equal to its predecessor. For those who do not like it, you miss the point and a great end to phenomenal beginnings
