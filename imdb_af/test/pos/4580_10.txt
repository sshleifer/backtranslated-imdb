I accidentally stumbled upon this movie. I mean, how else can I find out? It has not been hyped at all by the studios, nor have I heard that it is free from my normally plugged in friends. After throwing my money away on so many bad movies this year, I wish I could see this one in theaters as opposed to DVD. Mike Judge is the master of the beautification of wonderfully intelligent humor in a low prevention package. Just look 'King of the Hill' for a while ... it seems to be redneck humor, but it's a very subtle jab at Rednecks while at the same time being very sympathetic. I read the tagline for this movie, and immediately I ordered it from the internet. I really don't understand where these negative reviews come from, except perhaps Carl's Jr. This movie is not just hilarious, but it is also balanced. Moments of rule are being thrown between the hilarious sight gags and jabs at our current superstar / corporate culture. Sure, there is some humor, but it's just there to laugh right away. The premise is only semi-plausible, but since when did it even matter? I don't see people joking at 'Futurama' because the point of departure is very similar. Just look at this movie. If you don't laugh, something is really wrong with you. Maybe your dad is working for Gatorade or something, and he was really offensive by the movie. Maybe you're an idiot. Probably the latter.
