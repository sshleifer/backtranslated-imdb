Maybe I was just in a very good mood when I watched this movie. but for whatever reason, I really liked this movie. Was it terribly original? No. Was it a bit predictable? Yes. And so what? It was still a very nice movie. I always loved Bruce Willis. Well, almost always there was Hudson Hawk and The Fifth Element, and he portrayed an egoistic, sarcastic b *** ard. Perhaps this movie is not an Oscar award, but it is definitely good material. Go hire it.
