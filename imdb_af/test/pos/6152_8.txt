It feels like it's a Czech version of Pearl Harbor. It has the same story, both guys fall in love with the same woman. And add to the twist, the woman is actually a married one whose husband has been missing for a year. I don't think the story line is too strong. The younger man is rather naughty, it's cute. It watched me because of the emotional music and the pleasant plays one by one. It also has some strong visual special effects. Best of all, the love stories are seamlessly integrated with the story. <br /> <br /> I think if it was in English, it would be such a big shot across the states. It's too bad that not many people are open to foreign films.
