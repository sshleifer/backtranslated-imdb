The One And The Only! <br /> <br /> The only very good description of the LA punk movement in the early 80's. Also the definitive documentary about legendary bands such as the Black Flag and the X. Mainstream Americans' disgusting views on this film are absolutely hilaries! How can music be so diverse in a country of suspected freedom ... even 20 years later ... find out! <br /> <br />
