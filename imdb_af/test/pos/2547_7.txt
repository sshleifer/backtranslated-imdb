Some critics compared Chop Shop with City of God and Pixote theatrical releases. I saw both of them as well as Chop Shop and, as in many cases, I don't feel the comparison is justified. City of God and Pixote certainly had a much higher budget. Chop Shop is a low budget independent film about survival and hope, disappointment, and continuing life. One of the scenes was allegedly filmed during the US Open and either the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time and the American footage was added. I say this because I live in the area where this movie is filmed and security is insane while the tennis games are underway. It is also noteworthy that the actors 'real names were their characters' names in the movie. Back to the movie. It's a pleasant story about survival. But it eventually became a 7 because ... Sometimes the actors did very well. At other times, they apparently only recite their lines. If the actors were less capable (as they were, for example, in the low budget "The Big Dis"), I'd be more forgiving. But in several scenes, each of these actors gave exemplary performances. At other times they got bored. The director can be guilty of this. I also had problems with the end. This is one of those movies that "just ends". Maybe there will be a part 2? Definitely worth the DVD. I won't sum up the story because the information is already available on IMDb.
