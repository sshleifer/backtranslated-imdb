Let's be fair: there are no rules for writing, so I won't say the movie should be anything but that. I will only express my opinion. OK, I really had the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. However, I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it may suit this other media. Since this film by João Falcão, the same man who directed the play, it is not too surprising that the movie has become a little theater. It's the man's first movie, because he's extremely hard! What I say is that there are parts in the movie - like the city of Nordestina, which looks a bit like the Hoje e Dia de Maria - it feels like we are not at a cinema. We're at the theater! Lines are formally spoken, characters move choreographically and light is clearly meant for a stage. Sure, maybe it was the intention, but it was done. On stage. Wonderful things are made when a play is adapted to a movie - the beautiful "Closer", for example. However, when I wanted to see this one, I didn't feel like I was watching a movie. But overall, it was a good one that was worth looking at. It's a nice love story, sometimes funny and sad to others. My voice is a 7.
