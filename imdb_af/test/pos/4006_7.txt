I can't hate the show. When the old (and better) technology TV had to hit the bricks, the channel was reformed and new performances rushed in. "Attack of the show" is the replacement of screen savers, with 3 comedians in the beginning. They were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran also became a co-host, but he mostly made prescribed pieces for the show. Kevin Rose decided to leave the show, and finally there was a game to see who would be the third host, but for some reason it didn't fall out. <br /> <br /> Eventually I learned from this. many IMDb message board) Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran moved because (the two I'm reading) the two are married. It was a great secret to me! Now there's a new female co-host, the not-so-hot (my opinion) Olivia Munn. She hid something in the tops she wore while Sarah Lane had a perfect body and she wasn't afraid to show it. <br /> <br /> AHEM! Sorry. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the show" deals with everything young people want to know. These are music, movies, comics, internet and television. It's good with the show. If you don't want to grind the net or waste time watching MTV, you get everything you want at AOTS. Some segments and bits they do are funny. They have regular guests and contributors in the industry, as well as guests ranging from insignificant internet stars to real big names. <br /> <br /> Although hosts are not as geek as I want them to be, I still found "Attack of the Show" to be entertaining, even with its latest set-up.
