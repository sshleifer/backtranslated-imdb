Governments are elected for three years, as Reg Whithers said in 1973, the Liberals were determined to force Labor to the Polls until they were defeated. If you ask me, it is portrayed in the docudrama, but anyone who says that Kerr has acted properly acknowledges the self-service and expensive strategy of the Liberal Party of Australia. On the series itself I was Max Phipps a poor Whitlam, his voice was too haunting. In addition, more of the main political players had to be used on both sides, although this might have been a reflection of the budget constraints at that time. Nevertheless, I recommend it with caution.
