"In Love and War" is a simple feel-good TV movie and should be regarded as such. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoiler) <br /> <br /> This is the story of a World War II British soldier, Newby, captured with his orders by the Italians and imprisoned in a former orphanage. As the Italians surrendered to the Allies, the commando is freed, and attempts to flee. However, the Germans arrive and the commando is captured again. Just Newby, injured, stay big. The rest of the film tells how he is hidden and protected by the parties. <br /> <br /> (End of spoiler) <br /> <br /> Based on a real story, "In Love and War" is a refreshing straight film. Half-comedy, half-romance, the story is simple and unambiguous. The atmosfera is warm and sunny, and the different stereotypes (the desperate-disorganized or romantic Italians, the serious, exuberant Germans and the phlegmatic and pragmatic British), though inextricably, are still humorous. Nicola Piovani's musical score also adds to the Mediterranean flavor. <br /> <br /> Though far from a Tea with Mussolini or 'La Vita E Bella', 'In Love and War' is a sweet simple movie that has a smile, and maybe even a little brown , put on your face.
