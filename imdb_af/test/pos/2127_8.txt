I thought this movie was ideal for little girls. It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted most when they wanted to. Most little girls love this story, even though there is the thought of death in it. Although no one dies, the king almost does, but little daughters will not understand, so it makes a perfect story. All the events add up, create a big plot that can have a meaning if you dig deep enough. This story is great for little girls, and as it is a barbie movie, kids can have more fun, especially if they have their own barbies. Anyone can enjoy it because it's so cute and understandable. Overall, I think this movie is a good movie for everyone, especially little girls, and gives someone a smile at least once.
