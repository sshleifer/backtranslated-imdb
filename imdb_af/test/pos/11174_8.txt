Lucasarts drew another beauty from a seemingly bottomless bag of great games. If further evidence was needed to rule this game series, then this is the case. Before the game actually played, there was some concern about how the authors wanted to keep the pace of gags after the first two games. Fears were great that it would wear a little thin. <br /> <br /> Play the game and see how fast those fears are rejected. From the introductory video with Guybrush in the dodgem boat (!) Until the last stages of the fun fair, jokes remain. I was a big fan of the first two games and the other Lucasarts works (Day Of The Tentacle, Sam & Max, etc.) And this one fails to deliver the quality. You won't be disappointed. (Well, I wasn't.)
