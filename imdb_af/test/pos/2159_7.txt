Hunter is a sold B-style action movie. Get a life and grow up people. Don "the dragon" Wilson is a kicking boxer, and not an actor. If you are looking for an Oscar, this is not a brother here. Looking for kick ass action movie with lower than low budget, that's it. The plot line may have been a bit thin, but which B movie is not. I understand everyone is a critic and how one man's mess is another man's treasure. Get real people, judge every movie as it is an Oscar contender, just stupid. Awesome battle scenes, mixed with a new twist on vampire moves. Seeing it as your fan, hire something other than your hate.
