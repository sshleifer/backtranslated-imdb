This movie is a fascinating drama about making a movie. The actor and actress cannot really stand each other, but we are building up a scene in which they should have sex - for the first time, by writing. The actress shows little emotion on or off the camera in the plot, except that she freezes on a beach in the early stages. The actor is absorbed and touches the direction of the director, Jeanne. I couldn't help getting to the drama: "How could these two act through a sex scene?" The drama in itself becomes more exciting than the real nudity and predictions that are being made for the cameras. Not that Roxane Mesquida isn't beautiful and worth seeing naked! However, there is a pretty young stage hand that goes through a few scenes as an extra. I think it's her in the far left of one of the pictures (2 of 9) here in IMDb. I don't even know if this girl is credited, but when she wakes up (fully dressed) in confident indifference with her short blonde hair - HIS is Sexy! WHO IS THE GIRL ???
