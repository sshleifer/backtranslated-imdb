This is one of Peter Sellers' best movies. Why is it never shown on television or movie theaters? Will it ever be released as a home movie? Is it also deviating to the medical field? I'd love to see this movie again. I'd like my son, who's a doctor, to see it. Laughter is the best medicine and Peter Sellers is the best doctor for this.
