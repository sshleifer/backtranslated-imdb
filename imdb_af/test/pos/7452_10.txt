I don't have much to say because it is a wonderful finish on the story. Most people said there was not enough plot and it was just eye candy. But all this is explained in FFVII. You can no longer add a plot to such a great story that will ruin it. They did the best they could and I think it should be taken more than a final FMV. The last battle. <br /> <br /> Graphics - 10/10, Absolutely wonderful <br /> <br /> Story 8.5 / 10 - don't think they can expand that much more. And the stuff they could put there was clever enough that I thought. <br /> <br /> Characters 9/10 - Well, most of them were already explained during the game, but could not fit in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10 as I am a metal fan. I love the fighting music. And keyboard reaches right there. It's a big ST and I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br /> Tilt / Replay 10/10 - Enjoy every time. <br /> <br /> Overall- 9/10 (FF Fan View 10/10) <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that's what was needed, a fight to end it all. The plot was already in place. The action was needed as much as people complained. I loved this movie every second. It was a pleasure just to visit the world of FFVII the last time. <br /> <br /> Just remember this .. Most movies made from a game were directed by movie directors. I think it's pretty good for a team of game directors. Don't think I've seen a better game movie. <br /> <br /> Thanks Square, I think you did it right!
