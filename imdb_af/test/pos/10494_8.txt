I must admit when I first watched the movie, I had no idea what was going on. So the beginning was a little confusing to me. However, this did not reduce my enjoyment of the movie. The characters reveal that they are more complex than they can first appear, making it a memorable movie. Initially I heard it was a real "Hollywood" movie. Although lacking the stereotypical "rifles and fists" element, the convincing performances of talented actors such as Martin Sheen and Sam Neill make it more than that. I'd rather see a movie with more dust than shooting any day.
