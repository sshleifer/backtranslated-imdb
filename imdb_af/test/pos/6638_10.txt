This film offers one of the greatest experiences for filmmakers. It is by no means a pleasant movie, but offers realities and emotions that human mind may never have meant to touch. It opens paths in how an individual thinks, and then the person changes forever. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was in class and immediately after I saw it, I had to hit my next class and walk around on campus to restore my body and mind. I felt devastation and somehow unreal as if I didn't exist. It was only a few months later that I told one of my friends about SHAME, and she asked, "Oh, is that when you got hurt after you saw it and ran into me and was weird?" I didn't even remember how to talk or talk to someone, but I was surprised. <br /> <br /> In plot terms, this is the simple story of a couple torn apart. There is suffering greater than that of the dead and at the end ... there is no word to complete the image that Bergman creates. It's like a terrible dream that makes you wake up and change your own reality forever. This movie should be seen.
