If you are even slightly interested in the war between the states, this movie is worth watching. This is a wonderful storytelling story. No flickering sabers, no cavalry charges, no carnage - just the story of a sorry group of Union soldiers bumping into the farm of a Confederate woman and her son and taking as much as their captain's conscience. This amount of moves up and down as events unfold that affect his sense of humanity contrary to his sense of service to his men and his cause. Eventually, he reaches a compromise that will make any of us difficult. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the historic treatment of the Kentucky war, a neutral state of slavery, but ultimately decided to stay in the Union under mysterious political conditions in which some legislators are being held. About half of Kentucky soldiers fought for each side, but there has never been much treatment of what it was like to live there. This film makes a great contribution only in the "look and feel" of time and place.
