In World War II, a badly burned amnesia known only as the "English Patient" in the African desert, is transported to Italy, joining a convoy of medical troops and others at a deserted monastery . Among them are Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian nurse whose loves generally encounter unpleasant ends; Chicken (Naveen Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Whately), two explosive experts looking for the monastery for bombs; and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), a Canadian soldier who knows the identity of the English patient and has a score to settle. <br /> <br /> Through flashbacks we learn the story of the patient: he is Laszo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian explorer who in the late 30's with a group of British cartographers, including Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth and his wife, Katharine (Kristen Scott-Thomas), fall and the deserts of North Africa. After leaving Clifton over the government business, Katharine and Clifton fall in love with each other in the desert, leading to a relationship that has, of course, a less successful end. <br /> <br /> If one is able to explore the illogical parts of the storyline (such as, why would a patient be sent to Africa who is primarily the leading rule of war in Italy?) then you can appreciate the English patient as a setback to the intelligent, layered, flowing epics of David Lean in the '60s. Much more than "Titanic" or other late-night epic romance, this movie holds one in mind of "Doctor Zhivago" and "Gone With the Wind" - an epic love story against a great historical background. You shouldn't expect a war movie, although there are a few striking (as all-too-short) scenes of violence that stand out more than the romantic sections, as usual (Caravaggio's questioning by a sadistic SS officer (Jurgen Prochnow) in particular). <br /> <br /> The movie is very ambiguous, regarding almost everything. The central question of the film is: How far are you willing to go for love? As critics of the movie are quick to point out, Almasy is on the surface an outrageous character - he has a relationship with a married woman and betrays his country by giving cards and intelligence to the Germans, causing death from his friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and the torture of Caravaggio, and actually kill a British soldier arresting him at one point. The fact that Almasy is in many ways rejectable is kind of the point. He is in love with Katharine and sees the world closely in terms of his love of being loyal to the country (or anything else for the cause). as Almasy says, he hates "ownership. The two involve a bold love affair (in the remains of hundreds of people at a Christmas party), and it is clear that Katharine is more drawn to the mysterious, exciting Almasy than the relatively boring Geoffrey. <br /> <br /> The 1944 subplot is somewhat shaky and looks redundant; The romance between Chicken and Hannah is never entirely credible, and I feel the movie could have done without it. But those rows add an interesting texture of mystery and complexity to the movie, so I won't complain too much. <br /> <br /> As the e-mails mentioned above, the movie allows time and space through simple devices such as crowds, strategically placed posters and military presence. We don't have to think about being in Cairo in 1938, but it's handy to know. The direction of Anthony Minghella and the desert kinematography by John Seale is absolutely beautiful; The sand dunes, sandstorms and ghostly caves of the desert are captured in beautiful detail. Gabriel Yared's score is haunting and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> The acting is generally solid. Fiennes gives a very low performance as a character who is mysterious, complex and haunting. The difference between the Almasys of 1938 and 1944 is remarkable; one exciting and somewhat carefree, the other haunting and reflective. Kirsten Scott Thomas is effective as Katharine, the adventurous explorer, and Colin Firth gives one of his best performances as Geoffrey, realizing that he has no competition for the exciting Almasy. Willem Dafoe works well as Caravaggio, the hidden, fast-paced thief-twisting spy driven by revenge. Jurgen Prochnow gives a show that reminds Jose Ferrer of "Lawrence of Arabia" (and a similar character): very short, but more memorable than some of the main characters. Some of the 1944 actors are unbeatable: Juliette Binochette is nothing special, while Naveen Andrews is good but unbeatable. Kevin Whately, as Chicken's poorly engaged partner, does what he can with a rather small role. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient" is not a perfect movie in any way, but the perpetual attacks on it by many of the film public are not at all deserving. Perhaps this is an indication of how film feelings have changed since the era of Loon and Crossheads, or perhaps people expected to understand something easily. Flawed complex, brilliantly targeted and shot, "The English Patient" is a wonderful contemporary epic. <br /> <br /> 8/10
