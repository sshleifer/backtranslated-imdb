I tend to watch movies about people who choose to cross the barriers of censorship and express what they really want to express. Eric Bogosian's character from Barry is like Howard Stern, but much more intelligent. The character itself is very fascinating. As a Oliver Stone movie, I think I expected more. The film is a bit in the third act. Plus, it's pretty clear that "Talk Radio" is based on a play, with its long dialogue talks. But in general, the film works. Bogoss is big in the lead, and the fact that he also wrote the movie-based play probably helped him. If you want to watch one of Stone's bigger movies, I recommend you to watch "JFK" or "Salvador". It's not his best job, but a good movie.
