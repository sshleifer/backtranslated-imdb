The movie is really about choices. In the repressed state of affairs as seen in Fire, where good women had to obey and what was right in the eyes of tradition, there were few options for Radha and Sita. But conceded that it was not their only option. What is life without desire, Radha asks Ashok. Yes, it is true that life offers us a number of options, but how much we can take depends on a number of external factors. When your world is confined to a small Indian household, a conscientious son-in-law is for a quiet but striking, ever-powerful matriarch, a 13-year-old dedicated woman to a man who has taken a celibate vow because you was not able to have a child, a man who just wants you to lie next to him to prove his strength in eliminating his desires. I felt the ladies had little choice but to find comfort in each other's company. I think the fact that so many women applauded Ms Meta's work was because it gave them the opportunity to think for themselves. An option to do that might have been unacceptable. The lesbian scenes I felt were just about to convey that point. Every scene in the film from the first at the Taj Mahal to the last at the Mosque, is etched into my mind. How frustrating to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires. To feel that you have to leave human contact to be a conscientious woman just because it is expected of you. To suppress any desire you may have and long for human touch. What then is the meaning of our existence, wondering man. In the scene where Sita cries alone in the room and Radha comes to comfort her, their lips accidentally brush against each other and it awakens a feeling in them. Something they both deprived. <br /> <br /> Bravo Ms Mehta translates her vision so clearly. I especially like the flashbacks of the young Radha trying to see for the sea. It is a metaphor for freedom. Freedom to choose, freedom to transport ourselves to places we cannot normally reach. In those scenes, we are gently told to us that her sense of duty has also been dismissed from her mother, whom I assume to live within the rich Indian traditions of service in marriage. The film is beautifully filmed and enhanced by the musical score by A.R. Rahman. Since the film, I have become fierce fans of the two lead roles and the director. I look forward to seeing more of Ms Deepa's future productions.
