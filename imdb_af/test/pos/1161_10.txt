I love the wind and the lion a lot. It was a good movie. I thought that since I was young and made so long ago, I wouldn't find it so good, but after seeing it, I was surprised at how good it was. My family loves it, my friends like it, everyone I showed it kept it. I liked it because it showed how Arabs and people in Morroco were treated by Germans, French and even Americans in the early 1900s. If I was a High School History teacher, I would definitely show it to my student's view, from a high school's point of view. I give this movie a good 10 out of 10. My grandparents loved it so much they bought it for themselves. My little 3-year-old cousins ​​even sat and watched. <br /> <br /> Systemoffel
