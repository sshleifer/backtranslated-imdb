I have a strong feeling that what you think of this movie depends heavily on your frame of reference. If you've never seen a Miyazaki movie, it'll probably confuse you. If you've previously seen a Miyazaki movie, it will probably confuse you ... but you won't really mind! That's because I first found myself trying to find out what happened and why - and I saw one of his animated films - for the first time, and that affected my enjoyment of the movie. Now that I've seen just about every Miyazaki movie, I see the bizarre scene and apply it all - enjoy its beauty. In many ways these movies (at least for Western audiences) like drugs - very strange and beautiful images that don't always make sense, but it's good to see !! Of all the Miyazaki movies, it can have the most unusual and incomprehensible story line - even more than HAPPY WAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY Near TOTORO. But like this and many other Studio Gibli movies, if you just sit back and watch, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic story. But because it's so difficult to describe (and others have already done so), I won't even go there. <br /> <br /> As far as the artwork is concerned, it is very typical for one of these Japanese films, although there was one noticeable change. There was a very extensive use of what looks like colored pencils for the backgrounds. It was not a bad thing - the beautiful pastel-like appearance was very pleasant and unique. In some ways, a little bit of Bill Plympton's art style seemed to be injected into a typical Miyazaki movie. With a high frame rate, exceptional character animation (which they experienced with a lot of personality) and a great "wow" factor, it is an exceptional movie for all ages. Although clearly more designed for younger audiences (especially the TOTORO fans), it is a little scary here and there (during storm segments), but there are many good things for adults. As an adult (at least chronologically so), I loved the cute things and the other worldliness of the movie. <br /> <br /> A good movie - under Miyazaki's best. I don't give it a 10, because I'm reluctant to do it anyway - and I had a little more (especially TOTORO) like some of the studio's other films. But that doesn't mean you don't have to storm out and see it - do it and do yourself a favor.
