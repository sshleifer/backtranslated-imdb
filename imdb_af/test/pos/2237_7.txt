I watched the movie on TV late night and expect a masterpiece with a low budget camp. I was surprised with a nice, fine movie. Angelina Jolie's unique acting abilities (or shouldn't I say?) Make her perfect as an android, and the other actors, while horrible averages, are at least not terrible. <br /> <br /> There's a plot; a rather complicated plot about it, involving conspiracies and the lengths that some (one person, one android) will go to follow their illegal romance, with a "big brother" type figure and android killer thrown into the mix be. The production and sets were also much better than I expected. I didn't see the original Cyborg, so I can't really compare it; This movie is not a Blade Runner, but as a late-night, futuristic guilty pleasure, it is worth a watch.
