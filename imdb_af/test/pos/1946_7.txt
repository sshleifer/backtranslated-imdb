Although I hope I want it a little more, it was definitely an impressive movie. There were good performances by all the clues, and the story, while not what I want to chill, was still effective and it was of interest to me. For me, the best part of this movie was the look of the picture, as it always looked cold and damp and the movie looked good. I also thought the low budget was suitable for this movie, because I don't think a sharp picture and clear sound worked in a movie that worked grimly. Considering everything, it has a little short of my expectations, but I'm still very happy to finally sit down to watch this movie.
