There is a limited number of fans for movies in the world who will like a particular genre to the depths that this crew has done to bring something that the author of the original movie has never achieved. This is a wonderful exploration of the true dedication and love it needs to reach toward a potentially very successful cult film. <br /> <br /> Originally, with the blessings of Alex Cox, this crew started following one of his films in absolute punk fashion. Their purpose is simply to capture the atmosphere to the full, as it must be a complete tribute to the original "Repo Man" film. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful story of dedication and the betrayal that can take place along the way to great movie making. A truly entertaining story and a guaranteed learning experience for the viewer.
