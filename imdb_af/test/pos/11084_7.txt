I'm not a fan of Sean Penn, but unlike my German colleague whose review appears here, I think he was perfectly cast as the neurotic, dreary character in this movie. He perfected every nuance and reminded me of several acquaintances who had similar tastes in "relaxation chemistry." I saw this movie, but once, 10-15 years ago and it's the only part of the movie that has been indelibly etched on my mind. I'm not saying that very often, but in this case I will: Bravo, Sean Penn! Regarding the storyline, it is based on facts, and as such it is a tragedy that people will sell their country's secrets to the then enemy. Once again Penn has shown what you can do if you disagree with the administration. Use the freedoms you have, pay in blood; do not transgress the law.
