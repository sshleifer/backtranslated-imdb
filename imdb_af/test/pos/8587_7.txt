In the film, Lumumba, we see the faces behind the monumental shift in Congo's history after it was recovered from the Belgians and we see the motives behind the men in whose hands the raped and hungry land fell. <br /> <br /> Lumumba is not a hyper mass movie; It requires the attention of its viewers with a raw, truthful and intricate package. Few of the main plot is shown by action, it is almost exclusively on words, but there is a repetitive string that is just action, and that is the brilliant stroke that makes the film an enlightening and powerful panorama of the tense political struggle that gave birth to Congo's independence. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually. These are raw inis pictures of those in power and those on the streets. This is eye-opening in its contents. And it moves in the passions and emotions of its beautifully depicted characters. <br /> <br /> Whether you're a history fan, a movie buff, or just like good stories, Lumumba is a must-see.
