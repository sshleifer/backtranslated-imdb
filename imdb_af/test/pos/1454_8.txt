I always enjoyed Frank Sinatra's music, and recently I wrote a magazine about his life story. I am fascinated by the life and legend of Ol 'Blue Eyes. However, I have never seen any of his movies. So I wanted to see if his play was as big as his song. Well, it was! I was blown away by his performance in this movie! He's really doing a tremendous job repairing the heroin addict Frankie Machine, trying to reconstruct his life and audition as a drummer for a local group. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger's direction is also good. I didn't see any of his other movies. I read his biography about the IMDB. He looked like one of the very misunderstood directors, and people were confronted with thoughts about him. Looks like the kind of person who addresses most cult enthusiasts. I didn't see enough of his films to make sure he was really brilliant, but now I'm curious. I want to see more of his films because, according to his effort with "The Man with the Golden Arm", he has the talent. I also loved the music for this movie. The score definitely contains the kind of music I will remember when I hear it again. This is when you know you have a good score. <br /> <br /> Supporting performances are also good, including Darren McGavin as the local drug shooter, Eleanor Parker as Frankie's wheelchair-bound wife and Kim Novak as his lover. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how filmmakers dealt with the topic of drug abuse, as opposed to modern efforts in films such as "Trainspotting" and "Requiem for a Dream." Back in 1955, just the word "drugs" called the controversy, and if you watch the movie, they kept the topic at a very strategic level. There is only one scene where Frankie actually injected heroin into his arm, and they showed a close-up view of his face rather than graphically plucking the needle into his veins. But it delivered its message without making it feel. In a powerful drama like this, with powerful performances and direction like this, you don't need graphic representations of drug abuse to keep the audience busy. <br /> <br /> "The man with the golden arm" is a dramatic jewel that all movie buffers have to watch. It's really a wonderful piece of work! <br /> <br /> My Score: 8 (out of 10)
