Robin Williams is a genius. One of the best comedians in the world. He really shows up in this one, cracking jokes left and right like the talk concert comedian Tom Dobbs. From the previous it seemed to be a side-splitting party. And it was funny. But there were very serious parts in the movie I didn't expect. I will describe it as a drama / comedy. But it's still worth seeing the money, and I still found it to be almost everything I expected. Robin Williams is at his best, along with well-known Christopher Walken. They play a very good team in this movie and I was actually shocked to see how well the two were able to work together. I recommend it to anyone looking for a light movie.
