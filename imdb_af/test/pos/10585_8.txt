While some of the things in Haggard are stupid and unnecessary, the overall package is good. <br /> <br /> Haggard follows Ryan Dunn and his friends Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo) for Glauren (Jenn Rivell), Ryan's ex. <br /> <br /> The story follows and develops surprisingly well, it doesn't wonder and becomes an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam, though it does have a side story that didn't hurt the main story. <br /> <br /> And for all the Bam fan boys (and girls) there are several series of Bam skateboarding, perhaps the worst aspect of the movie. Phil makes 2 surprisingly small looks, even Don Vito has a bigger (but meaningless) role. <br /> <br /> If you are hoping to see a comedy and escape Bam's madness, stay away from this movie, otherwise enjoy the time you spend with it if you can find it. There are some really funny scenes in this movie.
