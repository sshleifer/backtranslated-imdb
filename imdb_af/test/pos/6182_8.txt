Gary Cooper (Michael Brandon) played the role of an American millionaire who had seven bad marriages, but always divorced his wives with a lot of money to live on. Michael is on business in Paris and goes to a French department house to buy some pajama tops and the sellers refuse to sell him just the tops, he has to buy the bottom or there is no sale. Nicole DeLoiselle, (Claudette Colbert) listens to this conversation and presents the bottom of these pajamas. Michael is very interested in Nicole and they have the opportunity to meet and enter dates. It's not too long for Michael to make a marriage with Nicole and she is very withdrawn with his marriage request because she doesn't know him very well. But as soon as she finds out she is going to be Michael's eighth wife, she begins to change her mind and this story becomes quite entertaining and funny. Don't miss this movie, it's great entertainment by great veteran actors. Enjoy.
