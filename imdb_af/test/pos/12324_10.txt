The entire movie, an artificial adaptation of one of Joyce's "Dubliners" stories, takes place on January 6 (Epiphany), 1906. Most of the films take place at an annual party hosted by three spinners (two sisters and their cousin), where a group of top class Dubliners gather for an evening of music, reviews and dinner. While there is a very small plot per se, the interaction and conversation among the group shows a lot about Dublin in the early 20th century, when the stir for independence only began. The role players, all talented Irish stage actors, with the exception of Anjelica Huston, are universally wonderful, and one actually feels that he is a guest at the event. The gripping final scene, between me. Huston and the wonderful Donal McCann reveal much about the marriage of the characters. There is poignancy mixed with humor and insight, and for those who like quiet, thoughtful movies, "The Dead" is highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin, we make a ritual to watch this wonderful movie every 6 January. After a lot of views, I never succeeded in moving, and every time I got something I had missed before.
