This movie is one of the funniest things I've seen for years. A movie about death and funerals, without being depressed, or unbeatable. Christopher Walken offers a lot of comedy in this beautiful romance and I can barely catch up to laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie, and when it was over, the audience not only cheered but cheered. I tell all my friends to look for his arrival in the US. I definitely plan to see it again in the theater and buy it on DVD as soon as it is available.
