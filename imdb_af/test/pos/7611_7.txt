Josie is a newspaper reporter, a job to go back to high school because she will be 17 again. . <br /> <br /> While she is there, she remembers some very terrible things that happened to her the first time she was in high school, as we see in flash screens. <br /> <br /> In the jump back they showed that (little destroyer) Josie was a nerd in high school and was very picked up and one day the cool old girl told him to take her to the prom, just on the prom night while leaving her home, she ate through the hole and his bitch. what a horrible thing to do (some will find it difficult to watch, as it is so dirty and it will make you hotter for Josie). <br /> <br /> I didn't find this movie funny, but there were really a few funny things in the office styles that are much more funny than anything that happened at school. <br /> <br /> This movie had the perfect happy ending because it brought tears to my mother and sister's eyes. The play in this movie was not outstanding, it was good for most of the movie. There are a few poor people in some parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie 7 out of 10.
