In the 2nd of his Historical Martial Arts films, Chiba portrays his real life sensei Mas Oyama. The movie even recreates Oyama's incredible achievement of killing an angry bull with its bare hands (Oyama has done this achievement more than 50 times in real life). Dynamic battle choreography with authentic Kyokushinkai techniques. Ironically, it is one of the rare Sonny Chiba films in which he does not tear or rip off the body parts of opponents. A must have for Sonny Chiba fans definitely one of his top 5 movies
