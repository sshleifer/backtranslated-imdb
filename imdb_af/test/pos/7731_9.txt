A very soft revelation of the Shakespeare game (and much more openly about it than the Forbidden Planet). Cassavetes is always a joy to watch, and even more so with Gena Rowlands sharing the spotlight. His intention to fit the Prospero role is suited to the kind of mad omniscient expression he brings to the story. This is especially evident in a scene when, after seeing his estranged wife and her lover in a speedboat, a storm on the scene (accompanied by the soundtrack by appropriately selecting Stomu Yamashta's "Go "). It is just one of the moments in the film where the line between reality and fantasy is blurred, and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more possible than one would believe. Add to this an excellent performance by Raul Julia, plus good work by Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and the movie becomes a nice surprise to occupy the space behind your eyes.
