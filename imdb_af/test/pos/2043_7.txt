I was glad to find out that at least this movie is now beginning to earn the appreciation it deserves (just see the voice). Not a top class action like 'The Hard' or 'Lethal Weapon', but still a sturdy 7 out of 10: good writing, good actors with work chemistry and a director who knows what he wants. Harlin's last good movie. "Deep Blue Sea" has reached an OK roller coaster drive status, but "Cutthroat Island, and especially," Driven "is well-deserved flops!) an action star "theme.

And this movie doesn't focus much on the" female "Instead of good action, buddhism (Jackson as a sidekick is here lots of space, plus its share of action - and about a thousand killers of wisecracks!) and on the plot (from Shane Black, author of "Lethal Weapon" and "The Last Boy Scout". levels much like this are ... the theme, the clever plot, Also as good and as underestimated!) Overall: if you haven't seen this one yet, don't forget to rent it for the next silence on Saturday night!
