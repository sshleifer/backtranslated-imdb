This is a report of events that have been printed several times and I have read two books - a Voyage for Madmen 'and' The Strange Last Voyage or Donald Crowhurst 'before seeing the movie in Sheffield just before Christmas. I have to say it exceeded all expectations in his narrative of the 1968 Sunday Times Golden Globe yacht. These men have decided to do something that has never been done before, without support ships, wooden boats, no satellite phones, no GPS, and just their minds and skills to get them in one piece around the world. Not to mention the months of loneliness, the thundering southern ocean, little sleep, and boats that are often literally falling apart. <br /> <br /> This documentary is excellently compiled in my opinion, edited tightly, with excellent narration. The archive material and the interviews are fascinating and bring the story to life. Clare Crowhurst's interviewing was especially revealing and relocated because she unfolded the events leading up to her husband, Donald Crowhurst's departure from Teignmouth, the doubts and fears in his mind and her response due to subsequent events. <br /> <br /> I was relocated and even shed a tear or two when the credits started rolling and other people heard similar feelings. <br /> <br /> The two books I mentioned above are useful for more detail and storytelling. that could not be in the 90 minutes, and I would also recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is ultimately a true story of human courage and human weakness. A must see for anyone interested in sailing, adventure, human pursuit and real heroes.
