I recently saw House of Wax and have to say I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> It has been one of the better Horror / Thriller movies in recent years, if not one of the best and most entertaining. <Br /> <br /> I heard many people preventing the so-called slow start and character development, which takes the 45 minutes of the movies. <br /> <br /> But if the film went straight into death, audiences and critics would have criticized the film for not having decent characters. They couldn't care less. <br /> <br /> Also for character development, I think it worked extremely well. <br /> <In my own answer and others (from posting message board posts), many people eventually had the characters to live, many of whom I noticed Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton). taking Warner into account. Bros. marketing her death, it is a surprise to stop many audiences finally getting her over to survive. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the hunting / death scenes, they were of the most inventive and exciting I have seen and enjoyed each one for a while. <br /> <br /> The acting in the movie was absolutely good, I couldn't miss either of them, especially Paris Hilton, I thought she was very decent and I was hoping for her that she was more than 25 minutes screen time in a 120-minute movie, but her pursuit scene has created it and believes me when I say Paris can frighten. (Look at the scene where she hides a car from Vincent and he walks past her. The look of terror on her face comes across as VERY real.) <br /> Overall, I give House of Wax maximum stars for entertainment value and excitement and even gore ...... just criticism I wish they did not reveal the deadlock during the marketing for the film and who died and who survived, as it wanted me to be ten times better not to know whether the character being chased is going to live or die and a terrible death. <br /> <br /> Don't wait for the DVD, but watch it at the Cinema while you can, It won't be the same in your own living room, but if you're waiting on the DVD, watch the movie the dark without interruptions, trust me, you will not be disappointed.
