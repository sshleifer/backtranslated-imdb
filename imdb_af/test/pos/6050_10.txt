Semper Fi! I have "The D.I." saw. in 1957. Two and a half years later I joined the Corps. <br /> <br /> The web and company got it as right as they could get in '57. Boat, in '59, was more like, actually just like the Boot Camp in "Full Metal Jacket" - Yes. A black yard, in my practice game, is called "Snowball". I was called Stick because I was slim as a track. Each site had a nickname, a little dirty, which stuck to its service at the Corps. Hit, or knock on your ass, when you were screwed, was SOP. "Leave, and give me fifty," must be ho-hum. Then it turned into: "Drop, and give me two hundred!" <br /> <br /> The DIs were a lot of sadistic bastards, but it was a controlled sadism and with a primary purpose to keep our dumb MoFos alive when we fight. 200 years of experience is embedded in the "sadism" and all that the D.I. had, or said, a goal aimed at his mission. <br /> <br /> A Bad D.I. get grunts killed. A good D.I., although apparently the world's largest asshole, keeps them alive. You can't kill the enemy if you're dead. <br /> <br /> If you didn't know, the Marine Corps has a primary mission: Kill the enemy. PFD. <br /> <br /> All others are pure bravo sierra. <br /> <br /> MstGySgt WHT, USMC
