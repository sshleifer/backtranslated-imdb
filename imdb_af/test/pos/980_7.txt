I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver. The screen was three rows in front of me and about 12 "x 10". So I didn't really look at it. But I love Malcolm in the middle, so I thought I'd just watch a few minutes. Next thing I know I was sucked in, has a good time, and was happy as to how good it was and how fast it was to make time. I agree that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment. As one of the older baby boomers, I was also pleased to see Lee Majors play a role in the movie, as with some other famous actors (Jamiel?) "Yesterday", but today is out of the spotlight themselves . <br /> <br /> It's your basic "child is wrong, the child even gets (and then some), and everyone enjoys the process." No heavy thinking, no great analysis needed. Just a fun way to pass the time. <br /> <br /> 3.5 out of 5.
