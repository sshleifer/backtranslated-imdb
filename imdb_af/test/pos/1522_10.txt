I caught this movie late one night and never knew what hit me. It was one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen, but waited on the edge of my seat to see what would happen next. Alan Rickman is an excellent "bad guy" but this character beats everyone. I've never been so touched by a movie! It's 6 years old and I still can't forget "Closet Land".
