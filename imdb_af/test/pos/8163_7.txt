LATTER DAYS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Problems flashing when an LA party boy (West Ramsey) falls in love with a beautiful Mormon missionary (Steve Sandvoss). <br /> <br /> A great hit on the festival ring and on limited theater release, this nice movie - the debut of scriptwriter C. Jay Cox (SWEET HOME ALABAMA) is an exercise in "opposites attraction", in which Ramsey His incessant character forever changes after being hard on Sandvoss's vulnerable beauty, limited by the thickness of his religious beliefs. Here the path of true love is accompanied by suffering. Not least, is the reaction of Sandvoss's co-mormons to his newly-found sexuality, leading to his excommunication from the church and the wrath of his indignant parents (Mary Kay Place has come a little but devastating as the boy's furious mother ). But Cox's writing focuses mainly on Ramsey's way to salvation, as his hedonistic lifestyle is abandoned by Sandvoss's influence and by the responsibilities arising from his evolving maturity. He is volunteer as outreach and delivers food to AIDS patients living at home, leading to an unexpected friendship with former particle player Erik Palladino (TV's "er"), whose disease Ramsey offers with a much needed wake-up call. <br /> <br /> Cox's writing is sown with juicy one-liners and different pearls of wisdom (on Mormonism: "Your church doesn't like alcohol or homosexuals? Well, I'm definitely not going - I can't the sky without both suggests! ") and the characters are surprisingly complex and well drawn. Ramsey has the cleaner, healthier role (he's the first time something rude to a willing participant has done!), But it's Sandvoss who has become something of a gay icon, with his sensitive portrayal of a lovely innocent whose journey of darkness to light leads to an exciting revelation about his place in the world around him. He and Ramsey are well-adjusted, and their inevitable sex scene (short but memorable) is followed by a compelling sequence in which Ramsey describes a children's drama that defined his life to date. <br /> <br /> Sequence -The video and transferred to 35mm for the theater exhibition, placing the movie's scant budget constraints on the scope and grandeur of Cox's ambitions, although the characters and situations are strong enough for this to survive minor disadvantage. Jacqueline Bisset shines as a worldly restorer at dinner where Ramsey waits for a life table and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Sun's Third Rock) steals everyone's thunder as Sandvoss's co-mormon, unlike his friend's relationship with Ramsey religious principle ... but only in principle. Although there was a little bit in the place, the film has pain with a romantic longing and deserves tribute to its honesty and compassion. Best seen with a crowd of similar viewers, preferably with a loved one on your side.
