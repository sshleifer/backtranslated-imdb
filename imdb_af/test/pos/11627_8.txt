I have to drill Barney every day; Well .. I think there must be reasons. First of all, I am convinced that our children are not stupid, they are just children, but they know (my 1 and a half year old boy "choose" what to see) which is nice or disgusting. Have you seen the news? Do you think your children should know the reality as it is? Maybe. Or maybe not; we (the adults) have the responsibility for what we want for our children and what to teach them. A movie of drug dealers? news about massacre in the Middle East? Of course, the children must know there is a real life, but ... they are children; let us give them mercy. What do you want for them? If you want children to be trained on weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor, then their Lethal Weapon, Kill Bill, any manga's anime, tell them Santa's a pest that enters the chimney to break them. I want illusions to my son (don't misunderstand me, I don't say Barney and friends are the best; in fact, the show has many mistakes, I read other comments and I agree with most); Perhaps the happiness of dreams or illusions has been made. At least I want to teach him how to grow WITHOUT FEEDBACK BUT CAREFUL, who learns to think and believe that everything is not serial killers or hijackers, what their reasons are to grow. It can be at least a little happy with its own dreams. So, parents, don't underestimate your children; they know what they want.
