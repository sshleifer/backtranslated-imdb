I was about 13 years old and was near the McCloud River near Shasta when this film was filmed. My family was paid to leave our lunch when they filmed Vincent. A little trivia ... the scene where they pulled him out was actually where he started his raft in the river. And if the stuntman just misses, there was a 20 foot waterfall about 1/4 mile further. <br /> <br /> Anyway ... I watched it and didn't get it. It was only years later when I saw the movie and actually understood its meaning. It's a pretty powerful movie and definitely a good job by Jan at such a young age. His film career never really looked as expected, but of course he later found success on TV. I wish this movie was available because I would love to see it.
