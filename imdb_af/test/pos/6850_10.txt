Carla Gugino literally melts the screen in these crime hijackers. Her sex appeal, generous assets and sexy southern accent more than make this movie again. But the movie has so many "other" things to make it almost a modern classic. Simon Baker's performance for one thing. Surely a great actor. Til Schweiger was thrown so perfectly. It makes me wonder why he's not a big crossover star. Gil Bellows round out this motel staff and literally hide this show. Other Gugino's easily beat the best performance in the movie. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are so brilliant ... I can't even describe it. Great chemistry. <br /> <br /> The music is so powerful eclectic that it was a character in and of itself. Great to see. People can say it's affected Tarantino ... I disagree. It is clearly unique and clever in its own right. Sebastian Gutierrez does a wonderful job of directing this sturdy woven film and underlining many scenes that have left me. The end is completely sinister and you never see it coming. All in all, a beautiful movie that is the definition of what a good movie should be.
