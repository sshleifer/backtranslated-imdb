It's absolutely the best movie I've ever watched. At age 12 I was late and ran over the movie. It was on the US channel, Gilbert Godfrey's Up All Night. I'll never forget. Then my friends and I really struggled with various problems, some sexual. You know 12 is a very rough and strange age. It looks like you're stuck between a little girl and a young lady. This movie really helped answer many questions for me. I now have a daughter who is 12. Looking for a few years for this movie. If it ever comes to DVD, I'll be the first to buy. Would recommend to any parent to see it with their child when they reach that difficult and difficult age.
