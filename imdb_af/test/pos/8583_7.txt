The English is a bit too angry, the Scots are a bit too <br /> <br /> heroic. The dialogue is sometimes too dramatic, and the <br /> <br /> transitions between screens can be smoother. <br /> <br /> Yet, "The Bruce" has the feel of authentic, as unpolished, <br /> <br /> history ... albeit loose with some important <br /> <br /> facts. <br /> <br /> Sandy Welch is not a Gibson or Branagh, but he makes a stem <br /> <br /> Bruce. And Brian Blessed carries out the painting in a beautiful <br /> <br /> villain as Edward I. <br /> <br /> Although the budget is not needed to really make the final battle, it is impressive, they had another impressive crowd for the <br /> <br /> and English and Scottish armies. According to filmmakers, this is the largest filmed reconstruction of the medieval battle ever in <br /> <br /> the British Isles. <br /> <br /> Allowing for a few mistakes and shortcomings, the movie yet <br /> <br /> is a convincing depiction.
