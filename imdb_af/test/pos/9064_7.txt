This film was originally in an original way. Although many movies addressed the topic of suicide and spiritual institutions, it was always about treating the patients and making them better because of the doctor's help. In this film, however, we follow a depressing guy who falls in love with a suicidal girl and will not stop her from making her happy, though she does not care about happiness, she just wants to die. It was a very interesting cute romance comedy that was nothing more than enjoyable. It's a fun one to check if you ever get the chance, just be open minded about the material. Overall, I give it a 6.4, I just voted 9 to get the score higher :)
