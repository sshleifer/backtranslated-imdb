"Classe tous risques" feels like the grandfather of "The Sopranos" in the blending of the criminals and the domestic and the friend movie to feel as contemporary as "Reservoir Dogs". <br /> <br /> Even as these gangsters are affectionately and lovingly entwined with women, children, lovers and parents, they are coldly ruthless and we are constantly reminded that they do not matter what hot situation we also see. They can contract a child's hair - and then make a threat in cold blood. The key is loyalty, and the male companionship is beautifully transferred, without ethnic or class stereotypes, even if their web of obsolete obligations and repayments in suspicion and paranoia narrows, as the old gang emerges in different stages of parole, retirement, bail or in new , less profitable businesses. An intense charge is to send a stranger to run an old escape conference. It is a high point of emotion when a woman is told she is not the one with whom the gangster is with friends, while almost the only time we hear music on the soundtrack is when he remembers his wife. <br /> <br /> Streetscapes in Italy and France are used wonderfully, in shining daylight on dark water and highways, from the opening of a few brazen robbers - traveling with your wife and two children. Robust, sloppy Lino Ventura immediately catches the screen as the criminal dad. And the second thief is clearly an unconditional presence in their lives, as they easily coordinate the theft and escape, in cars, buses, boats and motorcycles, in tandem. It's not the clich√©-crunchy old guy who softened the big-eye orphan; It's their job and their families and they cut in terrible ways. <br /> <br /> The film does not punch to force unexpected characters, direct and collateral damage, and challenge our sympathy, right through to the unsentimental end, which is probably why there was never a US remake no. <br /> <br /> It looks so cool that it's not until Jean-Paul Belmondo enters almost a third of the way into the movie, as unconsciously looks like a young punk, one realizing it is from 1960 Sultry Sandra Milo has smart and awesome chemistry with him, from an ambulance to an elevator to a hospital bed. <br /> <br /> While the Film Forum showed a new 35mm print with newly translated captions, it was not pristine. The program notes explained that the title refers to a kind of insurance policy and it is a "tourist class".
