Many people flame this movie for the presence of Paris Hilton, but it's not a fair reason to object to the movie. The reality is that Paris has a fairly minimal share and most of the movie is off screen. The film also repeatedly makes fun, usually with a camera and at least once in night vision. For those who enjoy Paris Hiltons stage presence, it can be a movie to see at home when released on video, because at the show I was at, we all laughed at her iniquities through the movie and she became depicted as a "woman of dubious values". <br /> <br /> The movie itself was pretty good (unlike the recent flood of bad horror flicks), it has everything a good horror should be; a creepy villain, excessive violence, acts that the average person cringe ... this movie hit all the bases. It's definitely worth a watch.
