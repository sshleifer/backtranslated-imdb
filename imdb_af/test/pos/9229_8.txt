I was not even born when this series was released in the US. It took about a decade before British TV networks got hold of it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was fortunate enough to see the very first episode, in which the Lone Ranger was one of a mock-up and slaughtered post. TLR was the only survivor. Although badly wounded, he was rescued by an intruder called Tonto. I believe he wore a mask to hide his true identity from fear of retribution. But he made himself more and more recognizable. Dunno if he carried it in his sleep. <br /> <br /> It was Saturday theater. The fanfare cliffs of William Tell's transfer have a dash on the telly, food that was still in hand. Although it has become very repetitive, predictable hokum. No one ever exposed him. Nobody ever landed a punch, no one ever shot him. He was a little too good, and just a little to camp in his dress for most kids. Poor Tonto, on the other hand, she became aunt Sally. He always clipped and tied up and kidnapped and things. <br /> <br /> And what did he call the Lone Ranger? "King Savvy" was the general consensus I lived in. It looked like "the great know-all" was in Indian speaking. But sounds like something else, as if Mr. Silverheels had a lack of speech. 'Kemosabe'; what the hell is that? <br /> <br /> Later, a lesser-made duo called 'The Range Rider' and 'Dick West' eventually won my vote. It had a bare-faced Jock Mahoney, who defeated reasonably well in every episode and was far less camp, less super and more credible. Still; even today I can't hear William Tell's transfer, without expecting hooves of hooves and a warm Hi-Oh Silver. <br /> <br /> Devine folly.
