It's not the kind of movie that deserves critical attention. It won't win Oscars - it's not a very good movie at all. Heck, it's not really a movie - just a string of short, unpleasant, outstretched sketches that are joined together to entertain. And as much as every critical leg in my body calls out to give this movie a failed score, I'll make it much better. The kind of people that will enjoy this movie are not the kind of people who really care what critics have to say, so I'm not going to give a clever criticism of Jackass's quality of surrealistic existentialism that permeates and comments on how our society .... oh forget it. <br /> <br /> What is it to say? There is no plot development, no character development - no real start - there is a semi-enjoyable end that is not nearly as funny as the precursor shit, and everything in the series of improper, bathroom humor with which young higher children laugh. . It's pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Solve through all your preconceptions of a good movie. Jackass: Number Two is just a brutal crap. It's really all it is. However, I give it to the filmmakers: they come up with some pretty imaginative things. You will probably break a few times, want to throw, wrap and move a few times, uncomfortable, as the people on the screen do death and excitement points. Vomit, shit, urine, semen .... virtually every body fluid can be seen in Jackass: Number Two. There are nudity, sexual humor flow, and so on. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining. If you're the kind of person who likes these things, you'll probably find Jackass's number two. I laughed a few times. As I said, it's pretty imaginative things. I never wanted to vomit once - although I have a pretty strong stomach. Just accept the show's movie: a bunch of idiotic guys do strange shit for fun. Once you are over, accept it and go with it, you'll enjoy it. The only mistake in the movie is the sheer surplus of all the strange and disgusting things. There are many very imaginative, very disturbing sketches, but they drag many places as they are less interesting. By the end, things are coming up, but in the middle of the movie, dragging takes the overall movie's quality. In a half-hour TV show, it's not a problem, but with film length celluloid, boredom at one time or another will be inevitable. After a while, the gross shit is desensitizing. <br /> <br /> In general, Number Two is an entertaining, imaginative and, above all, disgusting comedy that will make you feel pain, nausea and hilarious. Go see it if you have to, but hey, if you know you don't like such stuff, don't bother it. You will just be disappointed.
