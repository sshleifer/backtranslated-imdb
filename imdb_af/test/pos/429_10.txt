It seems that Hack is described as unrealistic, but that's what TV is. TV is meant to be an escape from everyday life and I feel Hack is doing a good job in this regard. Add to this the slow process of telling his past and giving interesting / interesting plots; you just can't get enough. Plus, with so many actors like David Morse, Andr√© Braugher, and even little Mathew Borish, what else can you ask for. So, if you're looking for an experienced experience and want an "undercover" character, I suggest Hack gives a chance, especially now that it's finally off his feet.
