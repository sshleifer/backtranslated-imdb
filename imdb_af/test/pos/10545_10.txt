I can honestly say this movie is the most wonderful movie ever !!! If you're in the mood for a comedy, I recommend this movie! So here's the summary. There is this girl (Nikki) who is fourteen and a half and she goes with her father (Andr√©) on a vacation she hasn't seen for about two years. She expects the holiday to be completely boring until she meets this boy (Ben), who is much older than her. So, to impress him, she says she's not on holiday with her dad, but her lover. It's a hysterical movie from start to finish, and I strongly suggest it. So rent it and enjoy!
