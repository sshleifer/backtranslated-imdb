Why was Jessie Matthews, one of Britain's best musical stars, in this movie between her sparkling "The Good Companions" and the classic Evergreen? Is a good question? When I first saw it, I was very disappointed. I wanted to see her singing and dancing - she was like Millie - the non-stop variety girl, but there was more stop than variety. <br /> <br /> Now I see it as a good little drama. br /> <br /> It's about a bus crash and the stories that come from it, from the people on the bus. <br /> <br /> In addition to Jessie Matthews, who's great as Millie - Sir Ralph Richardson plays her fiance (yes that's right). <br /> <br /> Edmund Gwenn - who went to Hollywood to star together in Lassie movies and also with Natalie Wood in Miracle on 34th Street, plays a handsome businessman. Harker is his very annoying partner. <br /> <br /> Emlyn Williams - who wrote "Night Must Fall" was the black-mailing villain and Frank Lawton, who went to Hollywood and in David Copperfield and The Devil Doll "is the young man in trouble. Sonnie Hale, who was married to Jessie Matthews at the time, played the coach.
