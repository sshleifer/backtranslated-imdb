There was a video out in America called "Cartoon Scandals" that appeared banned in an hour. <br /> <br /> Most of them were WWII. This is where I first saw (and from this) heard. <br /> <br /> The cock during the opening news broadcast is in a vulture with an Asian face, and says "cock-a-doodle-doo." Then eight minutes of propaganda was played like a news line. <br /> <br /> Viscously racist, but if you see it as the piece of history, it can (and must) be forgiven. <Br /> <br /> Cut ration cards to make sandwiches. <br /> <br /> Display the ruins of Rome as they call Moussolini 'Ruin # 1'. <br /> <br /> A mining tissue with a broom. /> <br /> A manned bomb with the pilot saying, "RET ME OUT OF LORD." <br /> <br /> And of course the stereotyping. Every Japanese was pulled with big teeth, constantly bent and said 'please' at the end of each broken sentence. <br /> <br /> The funniest bit? The air raid siren that was two bow men stabbing each other with the pins. "oooo-OOOO" <br /> <br /> Hey AOL. Leave this one out. It deserves knowledge. My wife laughed here. And she's 100% Japanese.
