A man is wrongly accused of killing his friend in an aircraft plant, and has to cross to avoid the police and discover the true sinister nature of the situation on hand. A plot later used to burn Hitchcock's classic North at North West, has Saboteur benefits from some very good performances as well as a masterful tension from the Master himself. <br /> <br /> For any Hitchcock fan, the plot is a little too familiar, but he was always able to fill the story with his own memorable supporting characters and charades. Here are the beloved and beautiful Robert Cummings starring and he soon finds many strange and peculiar characters, not a group of circus artists, a rich businessman with hidden motives and a blind one who shows him the best way to judge someone. <br /> <br /> In terms of pure originality and quality, it lacks some areas, especially the motif of the antagonists. However, there's a nice chemistry between Cummings and his main character, the much-undervalued Priscilla Lane, as well as a real-life show as the blind man by Vaughn Glaser. The best part is the final series, which perfectly reflects what Hitchcock would later use in North North through North West, just this time the climax is on top of a New York statue. Certainly not his best, but the master of suspension gives us a few good moments to wait.
