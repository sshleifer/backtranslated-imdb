Many people crap this movie a lot, and it really is undeserved. People find this movie difficult, either because it is such a sick topic or they hone in a technical aspect of the movie that no one else sees when they see it. If you just look at the cover, you think this movie will make you uncomfortable ... DO NOT BE THIS! However, you will miss out on one of the better movie experiences of the late 1990s, despite what someone else says. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider is wonderful here as Captain Howdy, the depth of insanity he launches to play this character must be out of words, and is far beyond what one of us will be willing to go. The acting here is wonderful. The movie itself shot beautifully. The subject may be too much for many to swallow, but it's still worth it. If you haven't seen this movie, it goes out.
