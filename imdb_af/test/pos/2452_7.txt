Not for the adrenaline maniacs, etc. It's a good movie, after the war, psychic problem, from the other point of view. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez is wonderful as a young man, haunted by the demons of Vietnam war, causing problems in the family. <br /> <br /> Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father. <br /> <br /> All this comes down to the problem of how to handle the past, with whom <br /> <br /> Emilion Estevez's character doesn't seem to handle, and Martin Sheen's character doesn't want to handle no. <br /> <br /> Protective mom looks at this problem with warm and open heart, but closed her mind for obvious reasons.
