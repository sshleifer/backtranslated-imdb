Darling Lili is fantastic! It's by far my favorite movies! It certainly did not earn the poor reviews it received. Julie Andrews, who plays the title role of Lili Smith (Schmidt), is the best part of the whole movie. She is alluring and spectacular! Since Julie Andrews is my main actress and singer, I was definitely not surprised at how beautiful she is. This movie is just ... great (I run out of adjectives!), It's wonderful, wonderful, funny, terribly romantic, sad and just a total thrill and thanks to Dame Julie Andrews! And to her husband, director Blake Edwards. Oh yes, Rock Hudson was also ok :) Julie Andrews is the beautiful and beloved singer, Lili Smith. Rock Hudson portrays Big Larabee, who quickly falls to Lili, and she with him. But their relationship was not communities. There was a meeting planned by the German government (I don't know if that's exactly what you would call them, but you get the point), because the warm, happy, singing entertainer Lili is actually a German Spy. Lili is told to seduce Major LArabee to get information about the new Top Secret Opertaion (later known as Crepe Suzette). Although Lili is on a solemn mission, she falls in love with Bill (Major Larabee), to really challenge her original quest. But Lili goes through and completes his job after finding out what's not really about Bill. The end will remain unnoticed by me as it is wonderfully explained. If you do something, you will enjoy this movie thoroughly, I definitely did it! <br /> <br />
