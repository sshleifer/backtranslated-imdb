If you expect this movie to be full of action and grab you from the beginning, you shouldn't see it. But if you like those kind of meditative movies that hold your mind for a while, until you get the details, you'll love it. Don't get me wrong, there's action and there are things going on, just not the usual way. <br /> <br /> Basically, the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone is fighting his (or their) way of survival. In this fight they lose the ability to speak ... I don't want to write anymore to spoil the movie for you, but trust me if you want SF authors like Lem or Capec or even some of Orson Scott cards, you will love this movie.
