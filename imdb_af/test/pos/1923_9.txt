As extreme activities (and I don't mean the Hollywood units like UFC & X-Games) and the people they are interested in, you are looking for this document. <br /> <br /> It's one of those truth-ranger-as-fiction tales of Donald Crowhurts' obsession to prove himself at great odds. The chance has been stacked by Mother Nature, the media and his own thoughts. It's also about a time we've lost - even though it was only 40 years ago. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have done a good job of gathering a wide variety of material to his story and the story of the great race that has consumed him. <br /> <br /> I couldn't help thinking of Timothy Treadwell and the Apollo astronauts in the 2 great doctors GRIZZLY MAN AND IN THE DAMAGE OF THE MOON while they were experiencing - you shouldn't just "look" - - this story. <br /> <br /> If you live in a big city, buy it or rent it. It's worth finding. I had to travel 100 miles to L.A. travel to buy it and I'm glad I did.
