Anyone who criticizes 'Jacqueline Hyde' as anything more than the playful and unmistakable erotic skirt it intends to be does not play with a full deck. Only from the title is it clear that this low budget horror comedy is not meant to be taken seriously. It's like a tongue in the cheek as a nymph's French coast, and just as titillating. The female cast members are all great and fun to watch. Look at this, Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown prince of soft nuclear war. Unlike most soft-core horror flicks, this one is entertained all the way through with charismatic and particularly attractive actresses. The film does not even attempt to follow the story of the Robert Louis Stevenson classics, but attempts to create all possible situations. Blythe Metz, the brunette femme fatale depicting the more sexy, murderous side of Jacqueline, is a real knockout. Watch and enjoy!
