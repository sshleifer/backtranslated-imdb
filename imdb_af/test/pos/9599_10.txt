I'm not a footie fan in any way, but saw it with a friend because there was nothing else on the box. (Thank you). Not only did we laugh from beginning to end, but about a week later in the bar, when we started discussing it, we made a real spectacle of ourselves with uncontrollable laughter. Does the steep slope actually go? I released my email here, so if anyone hears about future availability or a repeat on the telly, please let me know. Definitely the funniest thing I've seen on television !!! King Leek was also good !! another Tim Healy classic
