"The Journey" is a romantic version of the Cold War. It's about an English woman (Deborah Kerr) who tried to smuggle her former love, a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robards, Jr.) from Hungary during the Hungarian uprising in 1956. She is aboard a bus with thirteen other international people trying to get out of Hungary through the Austrian border. <br /> <br /> Of course the Russians are stopping the bus for a security test. The Russian officer (Yul Brynner) is attracted to the English woman (Deborah Kerr) and slows down the journey. Of course, the Russian officer knows the truth about the Hungarian scientist who regards as a British citizen, but he decides not to arrest the scientist because he is waiting for the English woman to come to him. It sounds absurd, of course, but it's a fun movie to watch. Despite the romantic flow of dialogue between Mr. Brynner and me. Kerr, which seems inappropriate in the situation where they are, becomes the film's tension and interest. The good play violates some of the stupid dialogue. Perhaps some of the people involved in the Hungarian Uprising will not appreciate this movie; they will consider it a bit of fluff. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite Yul Brynner role. He speaks with his own, male voice and is very attractive, especially when he becomes vulnerable. This is Deborah Kerr's second time with Yul Brynner as they made "The King and I" in 1956. They make a very attractive couple. Bad, they never worked again. It was the second sexy role Miss Kerr has ever since "From Here to Eternity". Despite being me. Wearing heavy winter clothes throughout the movie, she was very beautiful and sensual. <br /> <br /> The fine supporting film was led by Jason Robards, Jr., in his first film role. Some of the international cast was recognizable, such as Robert Morley from England. But the rest of the actors, which I have never seen before, were just fine in the movie. In the background, it was fun to see Senta Berger, as one of the girls, some Hungarian words. A few years later in 1966, she was in a movie, Cast a Giant Shadow, with Yul Brynner as his leading lady. She still works today.
