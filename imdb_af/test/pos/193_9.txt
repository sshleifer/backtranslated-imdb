As in a circle, the movie returns to its starting point, the image of the cranes that cross a Muscovite air. They represent the freedom to realize your life as you please, to achieve the greatest possible fulfillment. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in excitement. They seem to live by their dreams. <br /> <br /> But man is not a bird. Life sets its own rules, from which no one can escape and what we cannot change - even by making a supreme effort. War breaks out, and without a doubt Boris signs in front to fulfill his patriotic duty. He can't even say goodbye to Veronica, because she comes late at the meeting point from which the soldiers are sent away. Surrounded by a jubilant crowd, all her efforts to attract Boris's attention must inevitably fail. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Boris is killed in the war without Veronica currently learning it. His brother Mark, a powerful musician, who obtained the release of military service through corruption, is eager to accept his place. Veronica initially resists, but in a terrifying night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charm. A marriage takes place, which is never accepted by the family. <br /> <br /> Soon guilty feelings take hold of Veronica and she realizes that Boris's return is the only thing she really wants. So she relieves her bad conscience and despair through self-sacrificing work in a field hospital. <br /> <br /> When the war is over, a crowd of enthusiastic people come together to encourage the victorious soldiers. Again, Veronica is among them, forcing her way through a wall of bodies. In her hand she wore a lot of flowers, until eventually she had to give it away to complete strangers, because one of the home carers had just beaten her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of Boris's death. <br /> <br /> Again the taps penetrate the sky and draw their barriers. But now Veronica looks at it on her own, and the look in her eyes is another. She had to accept the impossibility of living according to her plans, to follow the guidelines of your dreams. For all people, nothing but helpless dolls depend on the inexcusable strings of fate. <br /> <br />
