It is an extraordinary film musical. It made me feel horrible that Rodrigues died in 1999, before I had the chance to see her live. To know that she did a great Lincoln Ctr. concert in 1991 and I could have been there but were not painfully out of words. <br /> <br /> I just bought my first Amalia record. While the music recording is fantastic, in this movie she can see her face and his tremendous expression and passion while singing these songs of terrible sadness, wonderful. Kind of seeing the face of Mary while attending Jesus in her arms in the Pieta. When she watched her on the film, I remind myself of a similar extraordinary concert show by Mercedes Sosa in the mid-1990s at Lincoln Ctr. As I sat on Mercedes singing, I felt I was in the presence of a tremendous spiritual and musical force that might contain immense primaries. Some of the Amalia music segments touch, like Caetano Veloso, a tribute to Amalia and sing one of her solo songs in front of a packed concert hall. The musical segments also carry the incredible international whip of her musical repertoire and the bandages she created w. fans around the world. There is one segment in which she claims to have played in every village in Italy that has a raise! <br /> <br /> In another section, Amalia talks about her bolt w. mouth cancer and how she came to NYC to commit suicide in a hotel. Yet, through the movies of Fred Astaire, she convinced herself that life was worth living and fired to kill herself. Amazing! Later in the film, she was very brave and acknowledged directly to the interviewer that although she could have overcome the world musically, her personal life was one of pure sadness. She admits that she has never been happy. It is unbearably sad to hear, but perfect in a fado singer (which she translates as a bad destination or a bad luck) tradition. You also want to hear more about her personal life: what made her so sad? what were her disappointments? <br /> <br /> "The Art of Amalia" is a bit disappointing in other key areas. My Doubt: to show 20-30 full songs in the film, but to give just one English translation for the last one seems a waste (unless the movie is only meant for a Portuguese speaker I can't imagine not). Seeing the big pain on her face while she is singing and not understanding the lyrics is a deviation. As for the other minuses, there is hardly any biographical material on Amalia's family background. There is a 20 sec. snippet w. her singing w. her mother (it's absolutely big). There is one short reference to her parents who moved fr. the countryside to Lisbon. I would like to see movie films from the town she came from. The interviews as they are are almost exclusively w. Amalia herself (and some good friends). She is a good but not a good subject. There are no maintenance subjects that are experts in the Fado or Portuguese culture and society, so we get no understanding of her musical roots. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a wonderful movie that everyone in Amalia is interested in. see. But this is not a perfect or definite work on the subject.
