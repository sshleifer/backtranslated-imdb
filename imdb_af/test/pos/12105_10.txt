This is a very good film (documentary) about Istanbul and their people and it is music of all kinds. The editing and the success of the director is very impressive. I was interested in Faith Akin since I saw the "Gegen die Wand" ("Duva KarsÄ±") and I admired his work very much, but this one was the most beautiful to me, so I write it here. It's not just about Turks or something, it's a very good biography of a city and how music lives in what we can say. There are many people and so many different ideas about life and love. I loved it very much and I think that anyone and everyone should see it, NOT ONLY, but especially those related to Turkey anyway ...
