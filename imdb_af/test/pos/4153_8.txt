"Nuovomondo" was a good experience. Many filmmakers largely share their stories through dialogue. Emanuele Crials directs his film very visually. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that can stand for themselves. So he understands film as a medium that mainly tells his stories about the pictures on the screen. Especially European films are often very dialogue driven (and many of the young American American directors are strongly influenced by it). Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point that made this film special for me. It also has a very interesting subject that is wrapped up in a particularly unusual story and told with humor. Vincenzo Amato is outstanding as family head Salvatore, as well as the incredible Charlotte Gainsbourg, which I enjoy watching in each of her movies. There are many good rows in this movie. Just to choose one: When the ship leaves Italy and just stays at people. This scene is great, especially if you consider the pop-cultural references that accompany it (Titanic!).
