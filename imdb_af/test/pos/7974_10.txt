Hell to pay is a bit bloody for my taste, even if it's not worse than many movies. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the parade of seasoned stars and the western landscape and all; but the story line was very poor and I couldn't really see it. But the music that accompanies the movie is more than the dark film. <br /> <br /> Where did the guys -Nate & Noah Cryns-who wrote this music? They are awesome !! From the moment the music starts, it's far better than anything I've heard for years. I think it might be the best I ever heard! Although I was not excited about the action taken on the film, the music raised the exact emotion needed for each scene. I was transported to the old west on time during the opening credits and really felt like I was reliving the old days with the music. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth a purchase and a viewing for beautiful music and a journey to see the old western stars again.
