There is a running thread in movie comedy that all the wonderful cartoons just fall short of the law or go into jail. Think of the conman's conman W.C.Fields in the Old ways, or the Marx brothers in a night at the operation, or Chaplin in the Mae West adventurer in she did him wrong. Picking the law is inevitable, and when they end up with the law, the results are still hostile between the forces of law and order and the cartoon. Think of Lloyd in his first talkie, WELCOME FARN, to help the San Francisco police department in the midst of a crime wave, and police sergeant Edgar Kennedy wants to kill him. Think of Laurel and Hardy as bad guys in MIDNIGHT PATROL. I find this kind of hostility so patented in all the giant's (and their peers) comedy that even handles a fake movie title. Think of Jerry Seinfeld in an episode of his series that creates a Three Stooges short, SAPPY PAPERS, where the boys eventually explode for murder. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton regularly pulls the powers of the law and order to be his opponents in his comedies. Look at STEAMBOAT BILL, JR, where he tries to jump his father out of a calaboose. But he actually had more conflict with the police in his shorts. In CONVICT 13, he was withdrawn to prison if found guilty of an escape. In COPS (perfect title - if you see it, you'd understand) the police force of a big city is repeatedly looking for Keaton, wrong for a terrorist. And in the goat he can't avoid the police for most of the film. <br /> <br /> Keaton is a food-only tramp. But he is completely unhappy. When he sees a stranger, throwing a happy horseman (who had previously ignored Keaton) over his shoulder and then getting a wallet full of money, Keaton tries the same thing and strikes a policeman in the head. The policeman rushes, and Keaton (like luck) runs into another policeman, trying to act normally, but ends by throwing the other police in the way of the first. Soon he has three men who are pursuing him. He shakes them briefly through a window at the local jail where the local killer Dead Shot Dan (Malcolm St. Clair *) is photographed. Keaton is in the back of the windows, Keaton, dumb enough to stop and look straight. The desperado calls these and ducks as the photo is taken. When Dead Shot flees the police, it is Keaton's face on all the desired posters. <br /> <br /> (* St. Clair will eventually be a successful director of quiet and early sound comedies, although in his later biography would be a stint at the 20th Century Fox where she was lowered with Laurel & Hardy . <br /> <br /> Keaton flies to another town by train (disconnecting passenger cars containing its locomotive and tender prosecutors). This is the movie (incidentally) that has two famous Keaton jokes. His arrival on the locomotive is done in a distant shot, and it comes closer and closer, and suddenly the audience sees Keaton sitting on the covert catcher. <br /> <br /> The second known series goes later (and can have influenced Chaplin slightly in the beginning of CITY LIGHTS). Keaton accidentally knocked out a man arguing with a beautiful woman with a dog (Virginia Fox). When he saw the poster calling him a killer, he thought he killed the man. He is being driven in this town by a suspected police spokesman (Joe Roberts) and losing Roberts in the park. A statue of 'Man-of-War' is being built and the sculptor reveals a clay model of the horse. Keaton is seen on the clay model and tries to maintain his dignity, as the clay paws of the horse begin to fall under his weight. <br /> <br /> Keaton manages to meet the beautiful Ms Fox, who invited him home for dinner. Only he didn't realize her father was Roberts. The last five minutes of the film, Keaton is fleeing and avoiding Roberts as he and Fox meet. <br /> <br /> It's a funny comedy, and a great example of Keaton's work at its best.
