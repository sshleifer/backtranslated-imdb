I saw 2 hour version of Choker Bali. I can't say it's long. The movie has a certain natural fit and it does not look at any time. The costume and set reminds us of what we would see in old movies. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai did a good job of acting. It is indeed a mature role with enough space to act within the story. The writing also supports the story very well. Aishwarys acts as the unfortunate widow whose husband dies in the first marriage. The film is about the passions and desires of such a character and the conflict that she faces in the difficult condition of widows in those times. <br /> <br /> Her best friend in this movie is played by Raima Sen, too. -handled. Her innocence and her admiration for Aishwarya's ability to speak and act in English are well done. It is indeed the prevailing thinking of those times. We can see how far we have come from such an era! <br /> <br /> The movie speaks of the liberation of women as a subtle line of story. I also wrote the development of the story very similar to Ghare Bahire by Tagore. It makes a rope in some action from the struggle for independence and sets the fight for Indian independence against the silent struggle for women's rights. <br /> <br /> A well-made movie is definitely worth watching. Aishwarya's action: par excellence. Rituparna handled the story with great care. Another classic of Rabindranath Tagore.
