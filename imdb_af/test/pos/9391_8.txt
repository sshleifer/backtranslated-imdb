"Deathbed: The Bed That Is Eating" is an amazingly bizarre horror movie to be seen. There is an old four-poster bed that just likes people to eat and it does so when it can attract someone to lie There is also a long dead artist trapped behind one of his paintings. He gives a vocal story. George Barry's first and only film offers some truly surreal moments like the bed that absorbs its victims in a mysterious secret. sea ​​of ​​yellow foam and liquid.The atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a little gore, unfortunately the premise is quite stupid and the play is amateurish. As a fan of unusual cinema, I enjoy this low budget quarter. Give it a chance.8 out of 10.
