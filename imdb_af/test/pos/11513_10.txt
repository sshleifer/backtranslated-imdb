This is the best movie I've seen in the past 5 years. Certainly, it will be in the same row with such masterpieces as The Platoon, Apocalypse Now, The Doors, The Dog's Heart. Really, the boy's and his parents' drama is so good that you can't even say they "play". No, they live as if they were happening to them. Note the smile that faces when the main hero agrees to go with them. That hate and love in one piece. And the final scene! <br /> <br /> Really, I'm still impressed by that movie. It is very difficult, even impossible, to combine humor and tragedy, but if you succeed (and Frederikson), the impact would be twice as strong. <br /> <br /> I compared it to "ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST". I also like this movie (and the novel itself is also good), but after Frederikson's movie it seems simple. (I noticed the same difference after watching the movie "American History X" and "ROMPER STOMPER" - the latter being deeper). I mean Milos Forman just showed the material point of view of the problem. You look at it, then you say Yes, it's a good movie, I like him, I don't like her, and that's it. But "Angels" leave you with a wide base to think. There are no bad and good boys in the movie. Because each of them has the right to act as they do. Like the girl of one of the patients. Of course she is young and is pregnant and it is a problem for her husband to be in the clinic, but the feelings and emotional experience of her ex-friend is even stronger (the result is his suicide). Why did he ask what he did? Aren't you mad to ask yourself? Why not support him, help him, understand him? Finally, it's even funny when those people talk to each other. They say genius things! There are many things I would like to say about this movie, but I'm not so good at English. But I'm sure those of you who watched the movie understand me. <br /> <br /> Congratulations! <br /> <br />
