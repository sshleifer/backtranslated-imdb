This one is a very solid Randolph Scott Western. He plays Bat Masterson and goes to Liberal, Kansas to clean the town. He became good friends with Robert Ryan who played a very straight role player. It was only after Robert Ryan started playing very dark roles. In fact, in 1947 Randolph Scott made another film that was not western and then made nothing but western until he retired in 1962. This movie has good pacing and slowly builds up to the climax. I can't say anymore because it will give away the plot. Make sure you see this one. 8/10
