The problem with so many people watching this movie is their attitude. People are looking for a B-grade horror movie, or a "So Bad It's Good" movie. Jack Frost 2 is not one of these. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, it's a very good movie that is cleverly hidden in a very bad one. To see it as something other than a screw ball comedy (easier than all three absolutely deserving "Scary Movies" combined) is to misinterpret the movie at a basic level. It would be to watch Shawshank Redemption and then complain that there were no explosions. <br /> <br /> The premise is simple; The characters of the first film, haunted by Jack Frost's memories, take a vacation to a tropical island. A new, improved Jack comes after them, now with chiefly the powers of Hydro-Man of Spider-Man; In essence, he can quickly and rapidly change from water to snow, divide himself, multiply himself, and worst of all, he has managed to gain immunity for his only former weakness ... AntiFreeze. <br /> <br /> What is sad about this movie is that brain killers of the first Jack Frost (a HORRIBLE movie only) cannot appreciate the change of tone for the successor. Just as Alien was a horror movie and Aliens was all about action, Jack Frost was a poor attempt at gimmick horror and Jack Frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre. <br /> <br /> Most of the entertainment comes from the live action actors, who serve great fun. Particularly funny among them is Ray Tooney (a caricature of a retired British colonel of the early 1900s), Christopher Allport (who offers a mad, hilarious spin on his first-film wood performance) and David Allen Brooks role in ways to new, completely bizarre heights.) <br /> <br /> The lack of "memorable quotes" disturbs me. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie, Jack Frost 2: Revenge of The Mutant Killer Snowman, prizes a zero. But you have to understand, it's not a horror movie.
