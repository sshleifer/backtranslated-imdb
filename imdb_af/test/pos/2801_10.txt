This film deals with Xavier, an Erasmus exchange student from Paris who spends one year in Barcelona. During that time, under the influence of all the new impressions, he changed and grew. On return, he has a much clearer view of his life and eventually takes it into his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most moving movies I've ever seen, and the reason is probably that I was in a very similar situation. I come from Germany, not from France, and to me it was Madrid, not Barcelona, ​​but I can assure you that this film is a perfectly accurate representation of what an Erasmus semester in Spain will do for you. From what I hear, the story is autobiographical, and that's probably why it's so realistic. <br /> <br /> Let me give you a few examples (soft SPOILER warning). Xavier shares an apartment with other students from Italy, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Spain and England. The apartment looks exactly like all the Erasmus shared apartments I've seen in Madrid. The main characters are well developed, and some funny scenes come from the usual stereotypes. The Spanish landlord is also 100% accurate. - The story of Xavier and his girlfriend Martine, who stayed in Paris, is also very typical. About 90% of all relationships break out during an Erasmus semester (or shortly thereafter). - There is a wonderful scene in which Xavier tries to convince Wendy, his England record label, which is kind of "uncool" to go with all the others. He eventually succeeds, and Wendy probably has the night of her life. <br /> <br /> Another great thing about this movie is that it is truly trilingual. The students in the apartment speak Spanish or English, and Xavier speaks French with his mother and girlfriend. There are subtitles so everyone can understand what is being said. I hope this movie is never bought anywhere. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that it is just an entertaining comedy for non-Erasmus people, but for all my fellow Erasmus I can only say: It's your movie! If you haven't seen it, do it. But be prepared for some feelings of nostalgia ... <br /> <br /> 10/10
