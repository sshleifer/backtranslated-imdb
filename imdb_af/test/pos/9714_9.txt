Everyone seems to want to jump on the train and say "Maha Go Go Go" .... The word is MACHA ........ Like "Mach" ..... Pronounced maa - ka ".. . <br /> <br /> In the early 70's, I grew up in LA in the early 70's on the late and very complained channel 56. Before that, there were Tetsuwan Atomu (Astro Boy), dating from 1963 at ol 'KHJ TV, Astro Boy was the first TV show of anime we got here in the states, I was in anime as a kid and followed it until the late 80's when it became a series of poorly animated "talkies" a phenomenon that just got worse. "Nuff said. <br /> <br /> As far as Speed ​​Racer is concerned, I really enjoyed the basics there, the POV shots, the animated action movie aspects adapted for animation ... It was pretty typical of most Japanese anime, then ... Graphic graphic graphics! Notice how long the series was inspired by Stanley Kramer's film "Grand Prix" (1966), especially the redesigned American credits .... <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I have the original comics from which the series is based is, so I know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> What did our animation way do except crap like Johnny Quest? ..... These are the same things we've done since the 20's. Ho-hum! <br /> <br /> I think the real problem I had with the way anime was shown on American TV was the slam done on scripts, credits, etc. to "sanitize" them for American audiences. "I'm not going to other programs as we speak. Speed ​​here. <br /> <br /> Look at clowns like Peter Fernandez as one of the culprits here because he was 99% responsible for repeating the series ... Not to mention the voice of Speed, Racer X and others ... Between him and the goofs at Trans / Lux (Think Felix the Cat and the Mighty Hercules - oy vey!) They took a smooth, very sophisticated performance and dropped it to the level of Sesame Street. Think "Cruncher Bloch", The "Forthebird Company", "Skull Duggery" ... If I continue, I'll break out. <br /> <br /> This series dates back to 40 years ago, but I, at the time, was nice enough to be insulted by the obscurity of this and other Japanese programs ... I mean this is obvious lying down when someone is killed, but they remove it or shine it over ........ Pleeeeeze! <br /> Good show - original. Unfortunately, all the recent incarnations of the series that "CRAPPY" made in Korea seem to be, not to mention a "computer" in the content. Even the Japanese are now buying their animation. <br /> <br /> Try the original Japanese opening on YouTube somewhere ... It sends chills on my spine ... Like just ...... Oh yeah good. Robert
