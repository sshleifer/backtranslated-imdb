Quiet historical drama based on the story of Anne Boleyn, newly arrived lady who is waiting for the queen, who catches the lustful eye of Henry VIII, the bad, faithful King of England, who loves the feast, drinking, hunting , is entertained by his court. jester, watch joustes, and chase around young beauty jumping out of cakes and dressing attractive females around the castle. Well, he soon canceled his marriage, married Anne, and told her it was her sacred duty to produce a male heir. She fails at that point and he soon has another eye on another lady waiting. Meanwhile, Anne spends pretty much the whole movie looking for reluctant, disturbed or straightforward tears. She just doesn't come across as a happy camper (or is it just bad acting?!). <br /> <br /> This movie is a solid entertainment, with an absorbing story that kept my interest for two hours. - Plus, I enjoyed seeing the very cute medieval costume that appears on a beautiful sepia tone. Emil Jannings is quite striking and unforgettable in his well-represented representation of King Henry the eighth - he really looked like he was Henry eighth. I'm not so sure about the performance of the actress Anne is playing, had a little over it. The DVD of this movie has an appropriate, well-done piano score that perfectly fits this story. Quite a good movie.
