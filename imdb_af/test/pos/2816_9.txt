"Stripperella" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (pronounced by Pamela Anderson) living a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club, known as "The Tender Loins" and as a sexy crime fighter known as Stripperella, aka Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil like a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a 99-cent stealing criminal, lets his two henchmen share a gun. The creator of the character and the series is Stan Lee of Marvel fame (and the creator of Spider-Man). At the end of June 2003, Spike TV (the new TNN) released three animated shows on Thursday night. Those shows were "Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon"; new adventures of classic children's program characters Ren and Stimpy for adults done by original creator John Kricfalusi, "Gary the Rat"; about a lawyer who turned into a human sized gear, starring Kelsee grammar of "Cheers" and "Fraiser" fame, and "Stripperella"; the adventures of a stripper that doubles as a superhero, pronounced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember all three premiers. I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy as I like the original show. I was a little lowered. It was good, but things seem to be too far away; since the two gay sexes together, was a bit much. Although Gary the Rat was not bad, the best of the three was Stripperella. The animation was really good, it had a great intro song, it had good talent for it, and it was funny like hell! The show was just as stupid, I don't even know how to start explaining it! After four or five weeks (if not a little less) the animation block disappeared, which was strange because I know it got good ratings and it was advertised everywhere. I was disappointed to see Stripperella go, but a few months later I found out about new episodes that are flying like 1:00. I only saw one and even though it was funny like hell and I was happy to see the show back all the time, something came down slightly. <br /> <br /> In the beginning it ran short, "Stripperella" had good animation. It was dark, moody, realistic, and somewhat sexy. The Stripperella bought also looked good, the character is well drawn. After the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of the dark and realistic look it had originally, everything was really colorful and cartoon now. Stripperella, however, received the biggest changes. Before she had normal long hair, she now has hair bigger than Peggy Bundy's (Married to Children) if it was even possible. Also, the eye mask actually shows her eyes; before it was just white, you saw what was cool because it was more super-hearted. The upper part of her costume was also kind of a vest-type thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue; what has changed until her costume is a blue-violet color and her upper costume is really looking for compared. In short, the show was a cartoon beforehand and very upbeat, but the second half became more cartoon-like and still became good-hearted, but it also became more. For example, there was a later episode about a west beaver ... yes, a west beaver. <br /> <br /> Anyway, instead of complaining about the mid-range changes, "Stripperella" only ran one season, but it was a very good performance. Like the stories of the Crypt movie "Bordello of Blood", it can really be campy, but it's really fun. As long as you are not a preacher, you find yourself repeatedly on this show. I didn't see every episode because I didn't get the DVD for two reasons: # 1. Released Paramount and they have this scrambled policy not to block any extras on almost all TV programs, although it's all over show was (I would have liked to see the comments of the commentary about the animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and # 2. The wonderful Kid Rock song during the opening. Now I'm not a fan of her, but that intro sang WAS the theme for the show! If you don't pay to pay any extras, the original intro song pays your jacks. The show also had some interesting gas stars such as John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as the plastic war that models models. Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was also the owner of the strip club in most episodes. Stan Lee also has a comedy in one episode. <br /> <br /> The break: <br /> <br /> PROS: Initially it looked good, FUNNY AS HELL, a very fun show, great voice talent for the most part, Chief Strogenoff (look at the show and see some of the things he does), and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: The middle series animation changes and the crappy DVD describes earlier. Apart from the fact that some of the humor sometimes can be silly, I have nothing really negative to say about this. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: Stripperella is a great guilty pleasure from me and it is a pity it just ran one season. It was a very funny, sexy, activated packaged cult series that one day I see in the air on Adult Swimming, with the original intro intact and possibly another season like Family Guy. Check it even if it's on the common DVD. You will laugh at yourself. <br /> <br /> Rated TV-MA: Rough and Sexual Humor and Nudity, Runtime: About 25 minutes per episode, Score: 9/10
