It's a perfectly viewable adventurous movie to watch, with a good role and a good story, based on true events. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the story of the movie is based on true events. This is especially an adventurous story, with all the usual ingredients you would expect from an adventurous movie in an Arab world. So, many sword fights, good old-fashioned honor, religion and a rich, proud country. But the movie is also full of humor, making the movie a light and pleasant one. <br /> <br /> The constant back and forth between the Morocco plot involving Sean Connery and Candice Berger and the American plot line The role of Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) was not the best possible approach. The two things have completely different steps, completely different characters, these are just completely different worlds! Of course, both story lines are connected and focus on the same thing, but the contrast between the two worlds is just too big to work out. It does not at all times link the film together and twist it a little. The American plot line is mostly more political while the Morrocan plot line is purely adventurous and actionable. Eventually you might wonder what the whole point or Roosevelt was in this movie. Say that John Milius is just a great fan of him. Often, the US plot line will remove most of the pace from the much more interesting and action-filled fast Morrocan plot line. John Millius is always at his best as an action director. <br /> <br /> It's not until halfway that the movie gets fully steamed. The biggest and largest scale action of the movie then kicks in. Especially the large-scale final doesn't disappoint. I wish the whole movie was so. That way, this movie would also have been a better known one. The movie has a good Jerry Goldsmith music score, which may be better known as the real movie itself. The movie is also a beautiful one with excellent production design and beautiful search and battle order in it. The movie only costs $ 4,000,000, but it's really hard to believe, considering the settings and size of the movie. I mean John Milius, his best-known movie, "Conan the Barbarian", costs about $ 20 million to make, but was much more champion and less impressive on his scale. <br /> <br /> Very funny to see an Arabic talk with a big fat Scottish accent but hey, this is Sean Connery, so you just tend to accept it. He fits his role well. So do Candice Bergen. It is always difficult for a female character to come across so credibly and work out in a movie like this one, but she manages. John Huston also plays a big part in this movie! <br /> <br /> A perfect looking movie! <br /> <br /> 7/10
