I don't think I've ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. Every time I see it, I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the last time. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a big and unexpected end that will crack you. Every character is good from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed all the way and would never get tired. Watch it! <br /> <br /> If you like Cary Elwes in this movie, you should definitely see The Princess Bride.
