One of Starevich's earliest films made in France may be his only political satire. The story of the frogs who wanted a king reflects his title as a group of high croakers, feels that democracy has flattened, so they demand a king of Jupiter to rule their country. When he drove a blunt, the frogs asked another king and said the blunt was "political wood." Jupiter this time sends a hungry stork, whose coastal lustful eyes devour the town's inhabitants. As the original "croaker" goes to the end of the stork, he talks about his morale: "Good enough alone." This movie features some beautiful crowds of dozens of puppet frogs. Starewicz adopts the audience to believe that they are all moving immediately by keeping the background in constant motion and just animating about six frogs. Slightly critical dialogue and problems with lighting in some places reduce the quality of recurring views, but its historical significance in Starewicz's life makes it important to look. His feelings towards the government immediately after his flight from Russia are likely to be expressed in this film. In addition, the technical achievements to animate many characters simultaneously in a stop movie are amazing.
