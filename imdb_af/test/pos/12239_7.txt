The early 80's feature has a long abandoned gold mine that some intrepid miners are determined to check out. Of course, they don't find gold there, but a very hungry monster looking for prey. <br /> <br /> Whilst I have to be honest, I have to admit that I have borne it initially (I personally prefer the thematically similar "The Boogens"), it actually grew on me as it went along. Now the characters are not too interesting, even the actors. The closest to an interesting character is Morgan, played by Keith Hurt. Anyway, the female lead Terri Berland is pretty good and Rolf Theison makes his dominant jerk an easy person to hate. The author plays by effects man Mark Sawicki wears thinly fast. <br /> <br /> It starts out in a comfortable predictable way, with a night work piece in which two victims are alleged to get things to an acceptable start. The monster itself is intriguing for its design (as you can imagine, it is released a little at a time until late in the game) and for the product of stop-motion animation when this process is no longer widely used . Director Melanie Anne Phillips (directed by David Michael Hillman's pseudonym) and crew earn some credit for their creation of atmosphere. They manage to make the film really claustrophobic and gloomy, and their use of lighting works well. The film builds in intensity to a fairly good end. Successfully saying, they do the best they can on their low budget. <br /> <br /> A clear little item worth looking at the harsh horror buffs. <br /> <br /> 7/10
