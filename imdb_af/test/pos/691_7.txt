If you are in the midst of a brutal war and it is not yet clear that you are coming up, among the things you are going to do is keep the morals of the citizens ... to demonstrate that our troops are courage, ingenuity and dedication to overcome all chances in a noble cause. And that's exactly what director Anthony Asquith provided the British with the 1943 flood war movie, We Dive at Dawn. After more than 60 years, it is not surprising that some of the movies are dated. It doesn't help that class stereotypes that help define the coveted men's officers can be crushed. Here, as in so many other British war films, the men always accentuate thick regional working class, while the officials speak up with an educated fluency that will place them in England's best government-class institutions. In this movie, Freddie Taylor (John Mills), the captain of the submarine Sea Tiger, is clever, confident, resourceful, aggressive, in control, good with his men, humorous with his friends, quick to make a decision. And it helps him to be happy. His men are very tars, for the most part, competent in their work and always ready with a joke when things become teams. Although we are spending the first third of the movie getting to know these people while on leave, things get strained. <br /> <br /> Taylor and his sub are ordered to destroy the Brandenburg, a new German battleship. They just miss the ship as it enters the Kiel Canal and goes into the Baltic Sea. Taylor assesses the risks and decides that the Sea Tiger will go through minefields, anti-subnets and at a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to the home base. After several tense situations, the confrontation takes place. The Sore Tiger releases six torpedo, but has to dive, not know if it did its job. After a clever subterfuge, Taylor outfoxes a few German destroyers, but then realize there is not enough fuel. He plans to chase his down and surrender when James Hobson (Eric Portman), a man and a lonely man, and only German say there's a small Danish coastal town that was a fuel. depot. He thinks it can still be for the Germans. The last third of the movie is an exciting action sequence as the crew of the sub-attempts to keep the Germans long enough to pump enough fuel to get the Sea Tiger back to Britain. This is a war propaganda movie, so don't expect failure. And did the Sea Tiger actually go down the Brandenburg? Are the men reunited with their wives and loves? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and little boy who made him smile for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have a chance to make use of all the female names in his little black book? You should see the movie. <br /> <br /> There are propaganda war films and there are propaganda war films. Some, such as Powell's and Pressburger's One of Us Aircraft, are missing and the 49th Parallel is still looking today, because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn't use obvious short-handed clips. Others, as we dive at Dawn, were made with enough clich√©s that we should remember how bad the time was when the film was made. Yet, Asquith can build a lot of tension, even with a few clicks. The Sea Tiger forced its way through a subnet. The stalking of the Brandenburg and the plot needed for the torpedo fire was realistic; John Mill's no-nonsense attitude, as he was prepared to attack, was well handled. The fake-out preparations to make the Sore Tiger seem to have been destroyed by in-depth cost, were as realistic, inside and out as you could hope for, and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. Our Dive at Dawn is not a classic war movie, but it is a well-made, well-intentioned example of its type and time. <br /> <br /> It's remarkable that John Mills had a long, long career. Especially in the fifties he played in a number of experienced movies looking back on WWII days. He had the quality to show grit, excitement and perseverance, but to be trustworthy too, a man of England could be proud of the fact that he fought the war. The main roles in this movie were Eric Portman, a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give bricks so cold, you want to put on a jersey. Everyone at the sub is joking, but stiff-headed, but Portman manages a complexity for his character. Mills and Portman did good work together on this movie.
