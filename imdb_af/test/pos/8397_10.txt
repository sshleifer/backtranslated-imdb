Away with the wind is one of the most popular books ever printed. This is by far the movie of all movies. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett dreamed people around the world and changed the lead players into cinematographic icons. One might ask, is it really necessary to make a successor? And ... there are some big shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> Well, there was the book first. "Scarlett" by Alexandra Ripley, we must admit, write well and fully respect the world created by Margaret Mitchell. She counts exactly where we left our heroine before and gently guides us from Mitchell's heritage to her own fantasy. In the book Scarlett, defeated after Melanie's death and Rhett's departure, she travels to Charleston to stay with her mother-in-law in the hope of regaining Rhett's love. Her typical manipulative behavior evokes much criticism from Rhett and drives them apart ... to a certain boat trip that will change everything. Scarlett is now carrying a secret. The series follows the book very accurately until the arrival of Scarlett in Ireland. From then on, book and series of slowly split ways. The real end differs, but of course both Scarlett and Rhett are back together. <br /> <br /> The production of the series was announced with a worldwide quest for the next Scarlett O'Hara. Many countries have made their own television programs with young actresses who audition the partition. Eventually about twelve girls were chosen to participate in the final screen tests and interviews in Atlanta, Georgia. Unfortunately, the producer found no Scarlett among these actresses. Sad to the girls, great publicity for the show (it has already been sold to many television stations worldwide before it even started). Robert Halmi, the producer who bought the rights to 'Scarlett', said he discovered the right actress while watching TV, getting a call and signing the agreement two days later. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer (who played in 'Willow' and 'Scandal', the latest movie Robert Halmi was that faithful evening) is not Vivien Leigh, but she is definitely Scarlett! Her performance is not a copy of Leigh's, she makes the character her own. The big difference between GWTW and Scarlett is the fact that the main character develops and grows as a person. This is the series of prerogatives, why copy something previously done? Considering there is a gap of nearly seventy years between the first and second storyline, it is of course both stressing on different aspects of the characters. While Mitchell works around Scarlett to combat the effects of civil war and fight for Tara, Ripley Scarlett faces her demons. This to me is the most interesting aspect of the series, we get to know Scarlett in a different way, because she learns that not everything can always be the way she wants. I totally agree with the choice of Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler. He portrays him with charm and irony and is less of a carton figure than Clark Gable's performance. The rest of the cast was well chosen. Julie Harris is engaging as Rhett's mother, John Gielgud gives a very amusing performance as Grandpa Robillard and Sean Bean are always at their best a dirty character, his Lord Fenton makes no exception. Poor choices, however, with Stephen Collins as Ashley and Ann-Margret's adaptation of Belle Watling were a waste of money. Costumes, sets and places are comprehensive and convincing. The newly built Tara set looks exactly the same and it is a moving sequence in the series when the house first appears. <br /> <br /> Is there a point to make a successor ... Well, six hours of romance is for me. One to watch!
