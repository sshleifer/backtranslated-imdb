I loved this movie and recommended it to anyone who likes a good spy coil and who thought Johnny English was an embarrassment. This is the movie that YOU should have been. But it's based on an old French movie series, so it's not really Bond-related. <br /> <br /> The production is brilliant, you almost believe the movie was shot back in the 60's. It even had the same pastel color films in those days. Jean Dujardin plays his part with just the right amount of stupidity and naivety, not with ham-fisted pantomime silliness like Rowan Atkinson. And even if you don't like the movie, you'll want to see it for Berenice Bejo. Aitsa! She's the warmth ...
