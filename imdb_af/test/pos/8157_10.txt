Excellent performance by Mary KAY Place, Steve Sandvoss, Jacqueline Bissett and Rebekka Johnson. Wonderful story that makes you emotional, but light-hearted in the movie. I own this movie, and everyone with whom I shared it loves it. Great for mixed company, 18+ crowd. <br /> <br /> Beautiful production, not a cheap budget, well organized, and keep your interest. Use dome newer ideas, for flashbacks, and at one point keep the viewer at the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> No matter which walk a viewer is, they will do one or more shopping. views in this movie. <br /> <br /> Want to see a successor!
