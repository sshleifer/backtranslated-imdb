I found this movie rather brilliant. Initially, I wanted a "when animal attack" flick in the line of "frankenfish" or even "villain", but was a real horrible ordeal that was lacking in humanity. To the areas it was made (including the crocodile at the beginning of the movie, even sharing the same guide!) It added to the fear factor. These crocs are really everywhere, though I don't think they had the "attitude" of this beast. Yes, there were some melodramatic moments, but they rather contributed to the whole atmosphere. I really care about the characters and shaken consider "what will I do?" in their boat. Not knowing where your enemy was listening at night, or the noise of the crocus scaring at night, was really scary. I would argue that this movie is one of the best horrors I've seen in years (near the descent). I give it four alligator handbags.
