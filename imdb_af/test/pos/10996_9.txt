I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a relaxing, fun, thoughtful movie. The absence of sex, vulgarities and violence for a pleasant evening. I especially enjoyed the Buffalo scene, but that's probably because I'm staying from there. Yet this film can be produced in any city; It's the theme that's so important. I'm just grateful that Manna From Heaven has hit us. Try it ... you'll love it!
