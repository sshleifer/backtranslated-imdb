A powerful film that restored much of its meaning in the second half of 2007 to the new desperate movements of the Burmese people against their tyrants. I had a complex mix of feelings about the people there, while at the same time compassion and admiration, along with a bit of anger because I feel that nobody and the countries of the world or themselves are doing nothing effectively. end this shame. I think these feelings came straight out of the movie, and they were meant to be made, so it is a successful movie. The desire for peace, the search for relief, the respect for life sometimes leads to submission. In fact, it is the Buddhist Burmese culture that left the doors wide open for their dictators. But how can you feel angry about these poor people?
