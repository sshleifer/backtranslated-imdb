I feel very sad for some of the people who have reviewed this movie. Obviously their standards are so high that they can never enjoy a movie for enjoyment. Or maybe their enjoyment derives from the role of the movies apart; Looking for any reason not to like it at all? <br /> <br /> The Long Kiss Goodnight is an action movie, in every sense of the word. Sure, there are holes in the plot that are big enough to drive a semi-door, but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the movie itself. I've never been a big fan of Geena Davis, but I was impressed with how she could create two very different characters, Samantha Cain and Charlie Baltimore. In my opinion, it wasn't even necessary to change her physical appearance to distinguish between the two ... her play was more than enough to do the trick. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, this movie was Craig Bierko's. In the other's hands, the character of Timothy could only have been another interchangeable villain. She decided to play with a more casual approach was just the right counter for all the action scenes. It is not often you find an actor who can express himself so well with his facial expressions. In the case: the scene in the freezer with Charlie and her daughter. Where most films would have been the moment of "revelation" with unnecessary dialogue, Bierko's eyes told the whole story. <br /> <br /> The basic plot? Thin, to be truth. A seemingly average memory housewife slowly discovers that she was an assassin. As her memory returns, the people who want to kill the killer also do. Is she really Samantha, the cookie-baker, or Charlie, the cold-blooded killer? Or maybe a little bit of both? For me, The Long Kiss Goodnight was a pleasant journey to find out.
