The main reason for watching this picture is to enjoy the brilliant performance of S. Ephata Merkerson. Mrs. Merkerson dominates this movie with her tremendous presence as Nanny, the woman who believes he is doing well, no matter who has no queues. This actress clearly shows a series that is incredible. <br /> <br /> Thanks to director George Wolf for bringing together these leading role players of some of the best black Americans actors. This ensemble group under its tight direction helps create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place. <br /> <br /> Of course nothing of this would have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson didn't write his wonderful game. Working with Mr. Wolf, perhaps the best theater director of this generation. They opened the play so it's not too far away where a child is under the influence of me. Crosby does not live when his own parents are not around to care for him. Me. Crosby becomes the worshiping mother of little Ruben; In a way, he represents her reward for losing her own daughter. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no time to develop a few characters, as the action only focuses on improving the relationship between Nanny and the younger. Ruben, played with such charm by young Marcus Carl Franklin, who is natural. The only thing that could be done differently was the voice of narration that is sometimes intrusive, as it doesn't explain or justify what you see. Honestly, just by looking at the interaction of the players, it is self-explanatory. <br /> <br /> In the background there is always music. No matter how difficult these people go, Nanny's house is full of laughter and that glorious music that brings us back to the era. <br /> <br /> Apart from me. Merkerson, other notable performances are given by Terrence Dashon Howard, one of the emerging stars of the moment. Mos Def, Jeffrey Wright, Marcy Gray, Louis Gossett Jr., Delroy Lindo, Rosie Perez, Carmen Ejogo, Jimmy Smits and the rest. <br /> <br /> Mrs. S.
