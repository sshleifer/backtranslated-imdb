One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wish it had told us more. I read many biographies and saw other things about the carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the limitations it placed on the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job of bringing Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was no more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I did about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, starvation for attention), anorexia appears to be a control disease. Karen saw her weight as one thing in her life that she could control. She felt that she was being controlled in every other aspect of her life. Don't get me wrong, I believed she really loved the music, but she felt she had little control over her career. She loved her family very much, but they didn't speak well, and she didn't know how to understand her family. The movie could have touched so much more. I estimate the music I have of the Carpenters and wish she still lives to contribute more to music today.
