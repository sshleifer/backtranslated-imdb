Some people might call "Cooley High" the same kind of thing as "American Graffiti" but I won't. For starters, in "AG" everyone was white, but in "CH" they were all black. In addition, this one has a Motown soundtrack. Specifically, the film focuses on several working class African-American students in Chicago in 1964 and their antics. The movie is mainly about home life and relationships. In their apartments we see that there is never a father. But these young men always know how to live life to the full. <br /> <br /> One thing that really makes this movie stand out from most other black people's portrayals is that the teens in this movie are portrayed as very responsible, worrying. about the missing school. Two very funny scenes are the gorilla scene, and the one white man in the movie. But the star is the soundtrack. It's really one of the best soundtracks in movie history (we even have it on vinyl here at home). A classic in the true sense of the word.
