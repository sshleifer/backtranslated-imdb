I absolutely loved this movie. For me, the best reason to see this is how strong is the contrast of legal drama like "Boston Legal" or "Ally McBeal" or even "LA Law." This is REALITY. The law is not BS, won in a single slot argument or through a ridiculous defense that puts you out of your buttocks, like the "Chewbacca defense" on the South Park. This is a true travesty of justice, legal system went awry and The work of GOOD lawyers - not the shyster stereotype, which uses all their skills to rectify it. It will do more to restore your faith in humanity than any Frank Capra movie or to make a MOCKINGBIRD. And most importantly, I cried. During the movie, during the feature sets included at the end of the DVD, it's great. Wonderful movie; made wonderful. Thanks, the filmmakers made it.
