It's one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It is a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts, but mostly the music makes me happy. Gary Busey did a good job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly even continued with his minister, his parents and the Nashville record producer said no. Buddy Holly didn't give up on what he wanted. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie. I was at the Surf Ballroom where he last played, but didn't pay much attention to it until I watched this movie. It's an amazing movie with lots of fun, get on your feet and see this movie.
