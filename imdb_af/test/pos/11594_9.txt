Director and co-author Alejandro Amenabar did not make it easy for viewers of his naughty, a bit over long but very disturbing story, accurately based on a Spanish man's struggle to get suicide. "Mar Adentro" ("The Sea Inside") is gripping and its impact far surpasses the time spent in the theater. <br /> <br /> With the award-winning Canadian film The Barbarian Invasions, people saw a family with a coterie of dedicated friends, expressing the wish of a beloved, though irascible, man to end his life . In that movie the center suffered attention from progressive, incurable cancer and its descent into a terminal stage was rapid. Emotional as the scenes were, death was inevitable. The question was how soft it could be through sought-after intervention. <br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro (brilliantly played by Javier Bardem) is another story. For more than two decades, he was a quadriplegic for a dive accident. (Many keen viewers can find a terrible irony about why he ended up in that state because of his improvising dive.) Once a world traveler and lover of beautiful women, he is now trapped in an immovable body. His need is met by a truly dedicated family who voluntarily surrendered much of their privacy and time to maintain their beloved relationship. <br /> <br /> Rosa (Lola Duenas), a single mother of two little boys, enters the Sampedro household that may have been mere curiosity to learn about the paralyzed man's fate, but she both becomes " an emotional support center for Ramon, as well as an amusing but occasional aggravating presence. A good performance by Duenas. <br /> <br /> The problem, of course, is that Sampedro is not sick in the normal sense. He can also live with proper care for decades. His gentle but persistent desire to end his life with "dignity" creates a moral dilemma for friends and family who do not respond surprisingly from different ethical and religious perspectives. <br /> <br /> Ramon is the poster quad of a group dedicated to changing Spain's laws on assisted suicide. "Death with dignity" is their word. Gene (Clara Segura) is a sensitive activist who supports the help of pro bono publico council, Julia (Belen Rueda). Julia has her own health issues that carry an indeterminate but catastrophic prediction. Luckily married to a dedicated spouse, she is emotionally committed to her client. <br /> <br /> What follows is a very sensitive interaction of values ​​and emotions. Ramon lives with his brother and wife, their technologist teenage son, not the intellectual Ramon, and his older father who cannot stop grieving for his son's cataclysmic descent in absolute helplessness. <br /> <br /> The moral and legal issues are voiced by excellent acting and short vignettes, including a courtroom scene in which formalism over any judicial interpretation triumphs that might take Ramon's feelings and views into account. It may be Spain, but the issues live in most countries, including the US. Particularly amusing is a shout, first floor to the bedroom, debate between Ramon with a walk-in, reading of the Jesuit priest, also a quadriplegic but one whose hidden dogma comfortably weakens the absence of a soul. <br /> <br /> Special kudos to Mabel Rivera, Ramon's son-in-law Manuela, for a wrenchingly authentic depiction of a strong family-owned woman. And the same compliment goes out well to Belen Rueda, Julia, who makes an objective advocate win a woman to a woman after a dark fate. <br /> <br /> The director does not allow any value judgments by which each character expresses full extent his or her feelings effectively and, occasionally, movably. Like Dead Man Walking, this movie can support any view on its deadly topic. <br /> <br /> No one can stop a person from committing suicide if he / she is determined, but the universal tragedy of the world's Ramons is that without help life in a body in which only the heart beats And just moving the head is a sentence that no court can pronounce on the most depraved criminals. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is well-matched with the story and the beautiful Galician screens are a contrasted with the limited view that Ramon once experiences around his special bed worldwide. <br /> <br /> 9/10
