This movie makes an excellent job of taking us completely through the dark tunnel of espionage, from the very beginning through the ultimate reckoning. The film's impact is even deepened with the realization that it is based on a true story. Timothy Hutton offers us a quality, understated performance and Sean Penn demonstrates why he is one of America's best live actors. As with "Midnight Express", this movie must make us all think twice about doing something we shouldn't do in a foreign country.
