Horses on Mars are a wonderful journey through very small creatures. It doesn't have to work hard to keep your attention and the characters are truly memorable. Most of the credit should go to Eric Anderson for his choice of visual style and writing an interesting story, but credit is also earned by Anuj Majumdar for the narrative and the great music party. Of course, these choices were not an accident. If you can, see it in 35mm range for the most impact. This is quite a beautiful movie!
