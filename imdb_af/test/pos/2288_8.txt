It has always been a favorite movie of mine. I owned a VHS copy, and a few months ago I found a DVD edition that is also part of my video collection. I was also a great baseball fan, and as part of my season reading, I bought a copy of Robert Whiting's excellent book "You Gotta Have WA", featuring the input of Japanese baseball and the challenges faced by foreign players in Japan. to play. As I read yesterday, it made me think of this movie, because it looks like the script is based almost literally on this book. The parallels are rude. The Jack Elliot character looks much like Bob Horner, an aging MLB slugger whose best days were behind him. Horner's teammate, Leon Lee, is also portrayed in the character Max "Hammer" Dubois, a veteran in the Japanese league who struggled with the frustrations of the Japanese game and helps to keep his team-mates healthy. The Elliot character goes through the same series of encounters as Horner, of great fanfare signing, early success that fuels an already noisy sports media, and the subsequent slump that brings frustration, alienation of teammates, supporters and media and the resulting disillusionment a desire to return home to the USA. The only difference is that the movie adds such Hollywood touches as a love affair and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> To speak of love interests, I'm sure many viewers came to this site (as I did) to watch the actress "Hiroko" (the beautiful Aya Takanashi) played and what other work she did. It only lists this movie. It turns out, based on an article I read, that the short love scene she has with Tom Selleck (a stranger) in this movie (generously according to our standards - basically kissing them while in the bath and a towel wears an outcry on the part of the Japanese public (especially men) that she has never been offered any other role of any kind in films or television - mainly blackball by the Japanese film industry. It's a real shame because she's (was) quite a talented actress in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie for the baseball elements and cultural differences I did - look for a copy of "You Gotta Have WA" by Robert Whiting. A good read and a good companion book for this movie.
