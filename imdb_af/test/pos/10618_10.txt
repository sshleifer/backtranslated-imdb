This movie is absolutely amazing. Of the performances of Huppert, Girardot and Magimel, after Haneke's script and direction, there is no single mistake. The movie may turn off some hard-hitting people at a slower pace, but it's really a masterful piece of cinema ... so don't let it be challenging ways to keep you away! <br /> <br /> Powerful and earn every award it won in Cannes!
