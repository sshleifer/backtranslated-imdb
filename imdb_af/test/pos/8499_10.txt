My wife wanted to see this movie and I was furious. I have never been a big fan of the biopsy - believe that cinema is more exciting if it is not structured in non-fiction. In addition, although I like Ray Charles's music just fine, I don't consider myself a fan of him or his music. <br /> <br /> I expected to either suffer or suffer from this movie. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting story told in a classic movie style. Realism is in the nuances - tilting a character's head to a dramatic moment or appearance in their eyes as they sing. I literally discovered myself in this movie while reading it. <br /> <br /> Many said Jaime Foxx not only plays a role in impeccable re-makers but an ERA, a LIFE that never really existed for those of us below. forty not. This movie sinks the audience in time without the gimmicks and grand sweep panoramas of Titanic or other period pieces of that ilk. This movie does not suit you with the music scene of the 50's and 60's, it takes you there. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about Ray Charles, but your appreciation should not be limited to the story of his life. It's the kind of movie, like Private Ryan or Schindler's List, that does what a movie should do - bring you to another place, another time.
