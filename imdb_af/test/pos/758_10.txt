I wasn't sure what to expect from "management lessons" - unsure whether Rupert Grint could play such a role, but within the first few minutes I was totally addicted. All the way through, the music, acting and scenery were absolutely stunning. Julie Walters, as always, delivered an excellent performance as the eccentric old actress Evie, and Rupert Grint, as well, had a fantastic performance as the romantic Ben. <br /> <br /> From the beginning I was forced into involuntary circles, outbursts of happiness and swells of joy as Ben broke out of his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend, Evie. A very controversial story, probably rather exaggerated, yet one of the best movies I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> Recommend anyone looking for a good British movie and an evening to kick back and just enjoy yourself.
