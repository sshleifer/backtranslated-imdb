I grew up in New York and this show came about when I was four years old. I had a half-day toddler and it was in the afternoon on WPIX Channel 11. I just loved the music and stories and remembered to let the house hummer when I was playing. <br /> <br /> I just saw part of an episode on YouTube and for a moment I remembered how it felt to look at the performances as a small child. Of course I stopped watching when I got 1st grade because it was before the school came out (no videos or DVRs). I grew up, didn't realize that the show was still on until I was in the 11th grade! <br /> <br /> I also didn't think there were DVDs and wish my cousins ​​and cousins ​​were young enough to enjoy this show, but now they are all past the demographic, or I'll buy all of their DVDs . sets. It was so much better than many of the children today.
