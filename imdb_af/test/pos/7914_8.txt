When Patricia Newell is attacked after testing her cousin's murder, Carrella is looking for the city for her killer. After investigating the killer after an intensive male dog, Patricia was sent to live with family in the country. For Carrella, the case was closed ... or blood-related is a judged masterpiece. Donald Sutherland plays a policeman and it is nice to see Donald Pleasance in a small role as a child molester. The conclusion is quite disturbing. Another relative is more of a mystery than a horror movie, so fans of Gore will be disappointed. A must-see for fans of old-fashioned secret films.9 out of 10.
