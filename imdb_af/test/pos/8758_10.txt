Four stories about drug trafficking in Europe are intertwined over the course of these six minor ministries. In Germany, a businessman is arrested on drug trafficking costs, and his wife tries to save her family by continuing her husband's illegal trafficking. Meanwhile, the British Interior Minister is traveling to Pakistan to negotiate a relief package, which he hopes to stop the drug flow from that country. Even as he does, his own daughter hits heroin addiction, tearing his family apart. It is the miniseries on which the American film and miniseries were based. The original is much better than its two prosecutors. The poverty and despair of the third world is portrayed very well. It is sharp, uncompromising and brutal.
