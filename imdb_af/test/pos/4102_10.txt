I saw this movie a few years ago and quickly bought the soundtrack because it was simply excellent. Bacharach's music is engaging and must enjoy the richness it deserves. The cinematography is wonderful. Critics hated it, but they also hated HOME ONLY. I didn't get it on video, but welcome to anyone who can find a copy.
