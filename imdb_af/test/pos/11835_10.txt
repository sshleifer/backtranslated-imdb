This beautiful, well-written film is based on a play in New York with the same title where Sir Aubrey (Sir Charles Aubrey Smith in 1944) played the role he played in the film. Here in 1931 we saw him in the early part of his acting Renaissance in the early era of "talkies" and in the character role he would make until his death in 1948 after completing his last performance in Little Women. released in 1949. <br /> <br /> This engaging play is about an elderly British aristocrat who places his illegitimate children and introduces himself to them and brought them to his home in England. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies plays his daughter-by-mistake and it's a tour for her. She is immediately engaging, impatient, level, enchanting, wise and compassionate, creating an indelible and seductive character that remains in memory. <br /> <br /> The 26-year-old Ray Milland appears here in a small but a prominent role that has already appeared in seven other pictures, is only in films for more than two years. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film should be enjoyed as a representative of the Hollywood factory production in 1931 and as such it is not flawless. However, this is a beautiful pleasure from the first scene to the last.
