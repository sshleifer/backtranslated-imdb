"Tourist Trap" is a strange thriller that came out in the 70's. These are about 5 friends. Molly (Jocelyn Jones), Jerry (Jon Van Hess), Eileen (Robin Sherwood), Becky (Tanya Roberts) and Woody (Kevin McDermott) who stumble upon a battle camp museum SLAUSEN'S LOST OASIS, a strange and ominous road complex. This gold mine of dilapidated but oddly vibrant mannequins is managed by Slausen (Chuck Conners), an eccentric but seemingly harmless. Slausen has one warning for the youngsters: Stay away from Davey, Slausen's retired and disturbed brother. <br /> <br /> The youths curiosity gets the best of them and they are going to explore. The fall has jumped! In the midst of flying objects, sleeping doors, scarves on their own strangles, hampered by a hidden force, the trap slowly enters the group. The "Creature" Davey and his army of murderous mannequins make quick and brutal work of the friends, to just one. <br /> <br /> Although not a Slasher movie "Tourist Trap" still contains elements of slasher movies such as chase scenes and stalking and the fact that the killer is wearing a mask. <br /> <br /> The seemingly telekinetic abilities of the killer to lock bolts and wash mummies are used for great effect. Perhaps the frightening thing about this movie is the mannequins, which are scary enough to start with, but are haunting here. The film succeeds in spite of, or perhaps because of, a clear small budget. These wax figures are blatant plastic shop dummies-but it just goes to serve as even more honest than their eyes move with an incredible person. The play is actually pretty good, Chuck Conners gives a well-rounded and creepy performance like Mr Slausen, Jocelyn Jones is great as the female head.
