Valued TV-14 for sexual content and language. <br /> <br /> I remembered hearing about this show in 1998 when it worked on the Teletoon channel. I didn't watch it, but now it's playing on the channel, Razer. I saw about four episodes of this show and I have to say, it's pretty intelligent and funny. <br /> <br /> The show stars Jason Alexander of Seinfeld boast and also Tim Curry or Rocky Horror Picture Show and It fame. The show is about a duck that is a police officer. He basically does his job as a policeman while dealing with personal problems. This show is sometimes pretty funny and fans of animated comedy will like it.
