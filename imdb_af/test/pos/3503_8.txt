Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the movie does not reach the quality of the television program, it is still very funny and has some bad moments! I saw Ali G for the first time when I saw the material of the show. I think he is one of the best comedy characters of all time. In addition, Peter Dragon ("Action") and The Blues Brothers said. Biggest surprise with this movie was that they actually had some serious actors to do this (Dance and Gambon). Then I will respect them even more, because they have the good sense to take this opportunity. I have nothing really bad to say about this movie, it's very funny. Very young, but hey, so what? <br /> <br /> One more thing Mr. G: SEQUEL, PLEASE! <br /> <br /> **** / *****
