I really have no complaints about this movie, except for the disturbing scenes with the body. I thought about it while sitting around the TV one night. Actually, the acting was wonderful, I didn't expect it to be better than it appeared! I thought Keanu's (being the same since 1986, which is a very good thing) acting really was * big *, and Crispin played his character perfectly! This movie is a hidden gem! This is a fresh awakening of reality to the 80's, compared to the other teenage movies done by the brat pack (though I do a lot like them). All in all, I give it a thumb!
