The movie Classe tous risques directed by Claude Sautet was not a movie, honestly I have ever heard of until the Film Forum in NYC said they would have a 2-week show of the movie, with new English subtitles. When I read that it was in line with the classic French crime films, Jean Pierre Melville jumped, got the chance to test it out (at best it would be his big works popcorn in a big theater). It was worth the admission, as Classe tous risques is one of those French movies just waiting to be discovered again (or first discovered). Sautet keeps the tension in a tight spot for the first forty minutes of the movie, with a good (if not large) middle section, ending with what is always expected of these movies, but with fascinating motivations through the characters. With a movie of this kind, you know how it will end, but it's the cool, eye-catching journey that counts. <br /> <br /> The movie features a true truth and honesty amid the "old-school" criminal code, by Lino Ventura and Aldo, at the start of the film ( one of the best start of a movie in this genre and country) steals a lot of money with his partner in crime. When there is a sudden ugly twist on a beach on a beach, Aldo is back on track with two small children. He gets help from Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo, a role in keeping with Le Doulos alone with a smithy more humanity and charisma), who is also a thief and runs him in Paris. But there are problems with some of Aldo's old business partners, and one old score can only be the right ticket. A few times the plot may seem quiet, but it is not. Like Melville, Sautet does not allow fat into his story, and it is a very tightly-structured movie, with some good doses of humor here and there (sometimes I grabbed the criminals in the beginning and also with a specific woman who had a nice thing with her cat and a fish. <br /> <br /> Along with a fine score by the great George Delerue, exceptional cinematography and a rarely met state of mind are left alone, now Adays, Classe tous risques is a reminder of the bridge between the real old-school movie noir, and the latter day is crime movies. Gangsters in this new kind of "thug-life" movie have a 1000th class and honor the thieves in this movie, and are a second banana for the works of Melville and Jules Dassin (a compliment I assure you ). That it has a good realistic, moral edge also helps.
