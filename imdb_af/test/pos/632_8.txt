I don't know how this movie went unnoticed so long ago. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on TV, I drove through the channels and got this unexpectedly well-made movie. I missed the first, probably 10 minutes, but it doesn't matter. This film literally grabbed me, it's a true backbone. <br /> <br /> The absence of well-known film actors adds The Effect, you don't know what to expect from the actors, because they are new. You never know when they will be killed or what they belong to. so it's all the more tense. Although there are many new faces, their top awards were. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers play with your mind, revealing just enough gore to imagine the rest. The shock, fear, horror and helplessness are also well documented by characters in the film. <br /> <br /> The well-written situations of turning, fast camera movements, smooth editing and excellent direction make it an excellent voltage player. This movie actually ranges between the genres - horror and suspense thriller - that keep the viewer undisturbed and tense. Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> I couldn't even get off the TV even during commercial breaks. I was the helpless MUTE WITNESS on this beautiful movie.
