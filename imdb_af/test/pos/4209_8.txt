A beautiful movie. John Garfield's character is a distant relative of Jean Valjean of Les Miserables, while Detective Rains recalls Victor Hugo's Javert, the relentless arm of the law. <br /> <br /> As in many movies noirs, the city is personalized evil, while the land and nature represent sanctuary, salvation and a second chance for those whose lives are forever damned. But even in the light of day, danger can suddenly appear as the excellent scene at the reservoir shows. John Garfield and an actor who, as Leonard Maltin points out, must be rediscovered: I have never been disappointed with any of his films, except for his supportive role in "gentleman's agreement", but it was not his fault - give " a sad sensitive show and the audience's sides with him as soon as he is unfairly accused (the first order shows a rather unreliable hypocrite, but all his trials loose him and how do we feel for him during the last scenes with detective Rains.Colorful characters (grandmother and the kids) add the joie de vivre that is needed. Humor is also present in the striker game, as the Dead End Brats Fleece is a rich kid. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
