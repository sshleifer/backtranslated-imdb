A blaxploitation classic, this film was terribly influential in rap music for the toasts that Rudy Ray Moore performs. Toast is a long-running story that is funny and a point, and you can see how they would naturally develop in rap. For more on toast, Rudy Ray Moore, and why this movie is important, go to Dolemite.com. <br /> <br /> What we just want to tell about the movie itself. This movie packs in a lot of "laugh-on-the-funny outfits and hairstyles" for the money because almost every shot has some riotous element or dialogue. It begins when Dolemite is released from prison to find out who has shot him and brought him to justice. I was not aware that prisons release people so they can prove their own innocence, but I am, I'm a neophyte in jail. He is assisted by Queen Bee, who is Dolemite's main prostitute and runs his brothel while he is away. She also posted all his prostitutes through karate school, so now he has an army of female karate fighters. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in two parts, which is usually a mistake, but in this case it provides an interesting contrast. The first part I watched on my lunch while I was exercising and not enjoying much. It struck me as a particularly bad blow, with a ridiculous story, scary craftsmanship? Well, I think it sounds like it had some craftsmanship and a lot of indifferent places, outfits and dialogue. But I didn't enjoy it? Indeed, it made me feel dirty. Let's look at a white man looking at something like that at the outfits and the things the characters say are basically a pleasure that is racist: how ridiculous those black people are, what stupid things they say. I didn't really enjoy it, didn't laugh and wasn't looking for the rest. <br /> <br /> Later that night, when I was in a "more relaxed state," I watched the rest ?? and really loved it. Like Disco Godfather, which I watched a few days before, it has a warmth and sweetness at its core, whatever it is when it's stupid or violent. The character of Dolemite has an element of self-esteem about him that makes the whole thing fun and the appearance of various actors who were also in Disco Godfather implies that we watch the grouping of a lot of friends who just want to make something fun together. Even the poor doubles, karate fights, and everything just makes it so charming. <br /> <br /> What I find interesting about the Dolemite movies is that they have some moral ambiguity that I don't see in other blaze operations. movies, and definitely in very few mainstream films. In this one, there is an African American woman who gives a speech on the (white) mayor and said, "He did more for the black community than anyone." We later find that the mayor is surprised, corrupt, but I like the movie to represent this woman as essentially misleading and not "redeem" her in any other way. There is also the figure of the Hamburger Pimp, which is presented as a useless junkie, and no one tries to find a redeeming, socially positive angle that he is. He's not. In Disco Godfather the religious character Lady Reed plays is presented as just nuts because they want to pray for her child, hopelessly lost to the dust of the angel. I like the films to represent such critical critical depictions of people in their own community without sugar cover or trying to save them to make them more palatable. <br /> <br /> There are many prime elements, such as when Dolemite says, "Move over and let me pass, or I'll pull these Hush Puppies out of your muthatf ** a **." There is Queen Bee who reaches the phone and answers: "Dolemite's total experience." And you won't be able to miss (though you may want to cover your eyes), the extensive nude scene by the REPULSIVE Mayor. I'm all for a beautiful older man, but I even have boundaries. And my boundaries are usually a few miles past most people, so be warned. The DVD I had was clearly modified, which is visible in certain dialogs and, in the end, as Dolemite's death of a large character with its bare hands excludes the main event naturally. <br /> <br /> If you get the DVD, watch all three trailers for the Dolemite movies, as they are a hoot. I wasn't going to watch The Human Tornado, but after seeing that trailer, you'd better believe that I was. There is also a scene in the Dolemite trailer that I don't remember from the movie when Dolemite swings at a Mexican shoulder, of course, and the man hits him in a nearby car. <br /> <br /> After looking at the first half, I said to skip it and watch Disco Godfather, as the movie production and story improved marginally, but after I enjoyed the second half, I recommend watching this one about Disco Godfather. This one is even more exuberant fun, shameful and benevolent ?? and has that toast that, even if you don't understand the roots and nuances of the shape, still has something to see. <br /> <br /> --- See other reviews on my website for bad and cheese movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
