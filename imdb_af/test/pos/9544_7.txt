It covers just about every area of ​​the creative process, and goes chronologically through the three phases, with the main focus on production. There are documentary articles that go into more detail and better cover the other two groups. It consists of artwork, background screens, movie clips and lots of interviews. With a running time coming in just two hours, the audience is entitled to much information, as it is about the same length as the movie itself. It can be argued that much of the time is spent on the people, with the craft and the result of their joint efforts to come second. It's done well, with strict editing. It gets a bit in technology and reveals how certain effects were achieved. It spends a lot of time on physical training, preparing for the battles and so on. You get really good shots of people, crew and actors. The Ultimate Matrix 10 CD set also holds nearly three hours of music in a simple system, with individual track selection and a Play All feature, about 38 minutes of BTS material, in addition to the title itself, in various feature sets. The original release, however, has several very short extras, including the sequel-making tracks, a preview of The Animatrix and Yuen Wo Ping's Block Tapes (a full run of some of the greatest martial arts series, with stunt artists and almost the exact cinematography, with the same shots and angles of those bits in the finished silver screen effort). The language is fairly strong, but rarely, almost non-existent. I recommend this version to anyone who enjoys the concept and / or wants to know how to bring them first. 10/07
