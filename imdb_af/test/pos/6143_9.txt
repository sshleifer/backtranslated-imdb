I was surprised to read the comments of the person who did not like this movie. It's really funny. There are definitely a few lips that my boyfriend and I call to each other. Some of the situations can be disturbing (bisexuality, drugs, a particularly strange child's view of sexuality), but credible at the same time. It's about communication and miscommunication between men and women.
