A very exciting giallo from the director of L'Anticristo (1974) started this with a brilliant handling of a priest, a little girl and a broken doll. But the main story is about the maniac (David Warbeck) marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money. The plot, though not original, is very exciting, the acting is good and there are several skilled and greedy murders. The score by Francesco de Massi is fairly effective, some of which are also heard in Lucio Fulci's "The New York Ripper" (1982). Highly recommended for fans of Italian theater!
