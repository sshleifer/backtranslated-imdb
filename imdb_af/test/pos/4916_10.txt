L'Homme Blesse is not for an impatient, adventurous audience. There are no explosions or the drama is straight. Like the movie by Lynne Ramsey, the director works more deeply with mood than with storytelling in a way that is effective and incredible. Because it does not depend on free nudity or superficial pop culture. story lines, it's honestly one of the best gay foreign movies I've seen (see Francois Ozon, Pedro Almodovar). Nicolas Roeg's "Do Not Look Now" is getting really bad because it is sold as a horror movie. The movie, like L'Homme, is more than the box can make you believe. If you're in the mood to sit back and be absorbed by the subtle, transformed powers of the theater, you'll love this movie.
