It was a good movie and the successor needs to know our socks! The action will be uninterrupted and I just bought the special edition DVD with the animated background story similar to the Animatrix. This will bring Vin Diesel back into the spotlight and hopefully get him the coveted role in Spider Man 3 as a poison. He would be the most logical choice for the role. Back to PB this movie, though it's an indie thriller, it has a wonderful story and characters with backgrounds screaming for you to learn more. If they were to do books or cartoons, it would be a good read. There was one thing I felt was a little under finished. The ending needs some work, but not every movie will have the best end.
