This video was my first introduction to the residents, and I couldn't stop playing it for the past three days. The footage is dynamic and more resourceful and technically complex than I've ever seen on the big screen or small. <br /> <br /> However, the DVD loses points for the useless addition of new music. The original resident music is different from anything else you've ever heard, and will really change your brain in the best way. However, the new music is uniformly uninteresting and in most cases it is bad compared to some of the classic songs. Also, the unfinished Vileness Fats video feels VERY incomplete, and I just learned the story of the story of the extensive reading of the notes on the disk. <br /> <br /> With the notes on the disk, this DVD contains lots of cool Easter eggs that will probably appeal to long-term fans of the residents. Hint: look at icons on the notepad pages. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the disk is one of the best DVD transfers available. There is virtually no noticeable pixelization, and only a little edginess in strong contrasts. <br /> <br /> Kudos for a top performance. This disk really deserves your attention.
