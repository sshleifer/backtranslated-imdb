This movie is a wonderful remake of the original with the same title. The movie was cool, despite the fact that I hate the new ones! All the cast was awesome. It has a great role and a wonderful plot !! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder, neat? Dennis Quaid is the man who is "DOA". In other words, Dead On Arrival. He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect! Dennis's character has a few hours to figure out who poisoned him. The movie is pretty fast and full of action. You can see two other big stars in Meg Ryan (City Of Angels, Courage Under Fire) and Daniel Stern (Home Alone, Very Bad Things, Bushwhacked) in supporting roles in this wonderful, cool remake of a classic movie !!
