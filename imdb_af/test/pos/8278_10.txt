If you're a child of the 80's and haven't seen this movie, you have failed to be a true child of the 80's. How can you not love those big chipmunks (don't forget the chippettes), lines and songs. Years later I can still sing every word for every song. The story line is huge and much better than the movies for kids today. It's just pure fun and worth the rent, even if you've all grown up.
