I agree with the man above. It's so funny. I understand it all, but my friends don't get it. Go to Japan and you'll see another movie after you were there. When I met my friend's dad at his home in Kanagawa. I swear I had the same feeling as Jack. scared, but by the end of the day it was all right, so I give this movie a 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I watched it at least 30 times, taken it with me to hit the plane to fly to Japan next month. One thing that is really good is the ball games. Let me feel like I'm back there. It's a must see if you have any interest in Japan and Baseball. They don't make them a successor. Does anyone know where the temple scenes were filmed and the argument with hirko in the walkway with a roof on it ???? should know so I can win an argument with my Japanese ex-wife. thank you
