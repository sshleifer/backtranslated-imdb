If you look at Distant, you know you're not watching a French movie, there is little sex and it's mostly elliptical and people don't talk so much here, there are a few lines scattered here and there and a some important conversations, just to make you sense what is going on. It doesn't look American either, there is no car hunt or shooting or violence unless you consider the death of a mouse as an act of blood or the daily stress of getting a subdued catastrophe. Sometimes the relatively long medium shots remind you of 'contemplative' Asian theater, but you just remember, the director does not push the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmakers, but it's not a Taiwanese movie again, it's a Turkish movie. I don't know what that means, I don't even know if it's meant to mean anything. <br /> <br /> The movie does not have a plot proper, but the few lines, those somewhat long-held shots and which often soften tension gradually build a sense of something happening, a sense of "plot" , for the lack of a better word, growing on you. By the end of the movie you can feel that you will miss the two cousins ​​who have many things in common, but are worlds apart.
