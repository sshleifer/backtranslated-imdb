How many of us have read a book or seen a play, and when the movie version came out, we were terribly disappointed? Well, maybe it's one of those movies for those who have seen the scene, but as someone who never had the opportunity to see it on stage, I was very entertained by this movie. The characters were funny, the music was great, and the story was interesting and made you feel real empathy for the characters, mistakes and everyone. Jonathan Silverman has such a good comic timing, and his lines are particularly hilarious. I'm not going to spoil, it's just a nice, funny movie showing the inner workings of a middle-class family during World War II. So if you've never seen the scene, and if you've enjoyed other Neil Simon movies, don't be held back by the few negative reviews seen here. On its own, Brighton Beach Memoirs is a HUGE movie. I guarantee it (no money back).
