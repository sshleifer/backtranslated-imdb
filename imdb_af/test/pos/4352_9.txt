Warning: Herzog is a filmmaker, and as such it is a bit too dramatic. So obsessions about closing doors may or may not be a real part of the character's life, but a dramatist's dramatic decoration - or so both agreed at the premiere in San Francisco. But Herzog's ordinary fascination with character, dreams and perseverance fits this story, first published in Soldier of Fortuin, and now a full-fledged autobiographical book. (The Fortune commentary has brought aloud out of the politically correct SF audience, and both the filmmaker and the main character had to ensure the audience who just saw the movie was misplaced by the SOF's interest - so warning, it's not Rambo , just survival.)
