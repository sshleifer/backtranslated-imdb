I saw the previews everywhere before I decided to see it. And what do you know, I really liked it! It has a new twist from the 18th century England. Although the music in the dance scene has, of course, been modernized and also the colors of Liv Tyler's clothing (though beautiful!), Fit it perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you just want a good time, be sure to check this out. Very different from other 18th century detailed films.
