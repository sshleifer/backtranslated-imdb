This outstanding movie has about the best acting you will ever see, and it alone makes it a must-see. The whole team is excellent, but it had to be again to keep up with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. It didn't take me long to attack this movie, and apart from a courtroom scene that's just fine, it's top-notch entertainment. It's a rare movie that has actually earned the Oscar recognition. See it for yourself and you certainly won't be disappointed.
