What can I say? I couldn't sleep and I got this movie on MTV. I started to look at it with the intention of changing the channel if it started to cripple as so many anti-drug movies do, but I sucked into this movie and I couldn't stop watching. Nick Stahl did a wonderful job with his character, and I think he really made the movie worth watching. I was interested in buying the soundtrack to the movie (or even the movie itself) and MTV.com wasn't at all helpful, but believing it or not. Amazon.com takes pre-orders for the 5th version of the movie on DVD on DVD. . I know I had a hard time finding it, and I'm sure other people might have the same problem. I buy my own copy so that I can crunch Nick Stahl while simultaneously blowing my eyes out of the emotional storyline!
