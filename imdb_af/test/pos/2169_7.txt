This movie will not be considered for an academic award, but if you enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and just want the viewer to enjoy ninety minutes, it's not a disappointment. You'll enjoy Darth Vader's villain (breathing) upload, a female Batman heroine (but much better with fewer costumes) and a joke that includes cigarettes and the very funny police chief. Not in any way a great movie performance. But if you're having fun, it was worth watching. God helps me, I like it.
