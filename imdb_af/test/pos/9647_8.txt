I don't have a very solid thesis here, so I'm just going to pour out a few observations. <br /> <br /> First, the movie is absolutely beautiful. It is shot in high contrast black and white, and some of the screens are so well constructed that they are almost distracting. <br /> <br /> There is a series of intense protests early on, and some of the shots were incredible. - Three guys start with tear gas at the protesters, etc. <br /> Secondly, I think one of the biggest signs that it's a recent movie looking back at the 60's is that it's really about how the idealism of the revolution has morphed and shifted to something else . The shift is very interesting. I think both the political phase of things as well as the artistic and more self-reliant phase have strengths and weaknesses. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, I think the romance works very well. <br /> <br /> Finally, I finally hated the end. . This was too melodramatic. You can even say the end is unworthy of the movie that preceded it.
