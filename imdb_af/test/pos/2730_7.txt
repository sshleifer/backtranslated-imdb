I must say it was a slack one. In general, it is wonderful to see how Aparna Sen has dealt with the problem of schizophrenia. I am not very knowledgeable about this and have everything it depicted in a Beautiful Spirit, and here also its interesting portrayal. <br /> <br /> But the thing that dropped me was the artificial dialogues and about the use of English. It is true that a new class is being formed / was formed in India that even speaks English in English, but I'm sure it's not as formal as in the movie. Furthermore, Waheeda Rehmaan does not seem very comfortable talking everything in English. Charu's dialogue in Bihari was apparently much more realistic and digestible. <br /> <br /> The second thing is about the abstract taste she's been trying to give to the movie. I usually like open-ended movies, but here were many loose points. Its like slices are merged to make the movie. There was also no central theme for the movie. Skisofernie was probably the main line, but intermittent sister-sister, mother-daughter, doctor-azmi relationship, no real use of brother, Bose-Bose's wife relations ..... everything was not needed and detached the audience from what she actually tried to portray. <br /> <br /> Generally, a watch for people who enjoy discount movies should be avoided for those who just watch movies as an entertainment tool.
