I never dreamed when I started watching this DVD, but I will be completely mistaken within minutes. The story was completely absorbing and entertaining. The acting was excellent. The biggest surprise of all was how I would be so enchanted by the love these two young women radiated across the screen. Their initial physical encounter for me was by far the most beautiful, romantic, beautiful, vicariously enthralling love scene I've ever seen on film. I literally stopped breathing. I couldn't believe the chemistry between the two actresses. With no nudity or graphic sex, they have conveyed more passion and titulation than any American production ever wanted to live. Bravo to the author, scriptwriter, director and cast.
