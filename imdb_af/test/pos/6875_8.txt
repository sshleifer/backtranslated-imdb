Matthau is a widow hospital doctor enjoys his single status and the footloose and available nurses on staff while colleague and friend Richard Benjamin looks with entertainment and amazement. Their boss is hearing hard at the senile head of staff Art Carney who is in the post for re-election. <br /> <br /> Matthau is happy to play the field without commitment until he meets single mother Glenda Jackson. who insists on being the only woman in his life while in his life. At the same time, he is under pressure to respond to the strange progress of a potential litigant in a malfunctioning package and to support the Shambolic and incompetent Carney in his attempt to be re-elected. Staff. <br /> <br /> This is a superior old-fashioned romantic comedy that is won by four Grade A actors and an excellent supporting piece that works with leading dry, biblical and sarcastic writing. Carney steals every scene he is in, and on the floor he rolls out aloud as he appears on the screen. We are entertained differently by the on-and-off ratio of the two clues and various sub-plots. <br /> <br /> The ambition is to be a good movie, but stay one of the best of its kind and viewable and again -watchable for its comical value alone. Earn more attention than it seems to have been and worth the cost of the DVD or video cassette.
