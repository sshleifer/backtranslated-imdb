What is he supposed to be? He was a child in the past ... and the future? This movie had many problems. Is he a ghost, or just a strong child. Man, ... what a piece of shit. I'm still confused. Also, is he supposed to be an abortion? Strange. Very strange. This movie will be messed up with your thoughts ... and it's not very scary, but just confusing. Why was he ... Where did, ... What was that, ... o, who cares, ... Milo is not worth it, ... <br /> <br /> My score: 10
