One of the biggest French success of the year 2002, "l'auberge espagnole", was also very well received abroad, which is quite exceptional for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons for this success. This film, made by one of the most interesting French filmmakers of these past years, Cedric Klapisch, offers students from all over Europe and all met under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described as the one you think or see in everyday life: either sloppy or serious or with a sense of humor. I think if the film worked so well, it was because many students had to recognize themselves in the main characters' portraits and especially Xavier's. <br /> <br /> We follow the movie and so his experience abroad as an Erasmus student through his eyes. Xavier is really an ordinary student with his attributes, his mistakes. Making an intelligent with many ingenious ideas speaks to its lost mind and its anxiety around the world and is an Erasmus student. The best examples in two rows can be found on the subject. The first is when Xavier asks a woman at the university for the papers he has to send to prepare his DEA. When the same woman informs about the various procedures required, all the question papers appear on the screen when she calls them! In the following order, Xavier's voice call relies on the viewer of the modern world. Now, where do you find the second example? Well, the scene where Xavier undergoes a thorough medical examination in which Klapisch filmed his visions is wide enough to speak of himself. <br /> <br /> Also, the director wasn't really interested in his main character. He left this point. Rather, he puts a lot of effort into Xavier's private life, of course, in his love relationship with Anne Sophie, but also in his relationship with his fellow tenants. It is a true friendship story that Klapisch shows us with his moments of happiness, but also his arguments and his tension. Through Xavier's adventure and at the end of his stay, he will be initiated into life, which will make him more mature. The message the author wanted to convey is not difficult to guess. You believe naively that you live in a messy and complicated world. You don't have to give up, but look intensely to get what you want, even if it's difficult. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, we also fear that Cedric Klapisch will not fall into the subject: the clichés. Let's be honest: they are included in the screenplay, but the director does his best not to spread too much in his movie. Then the script contains convenient and predictable moments: at the airport and before entering, we see that Xavier gives up a tear after leaving his family. But luckily the shortcomings of the script stop here. Many funny dialogues and cool young actors who make them completely comfortable in their roles make up the whole. <br /> <br /> Despite its weaknesses, 'l'auberge espagnole' is being taken for a success in the film of young people. Besides, the whole atmosphere that brings it out, let us think that this movie is mainly aimed at a young audience. Eventually, the end of the film and its great success let us know that Klapisch has succumbed to a fashion that is right for American cinema: building up persecutors. And indeed, the filmmaker is currently working on a sequel entitled "les poupées russes". Let's hope it will be as good as "l'auberge espagnole".
