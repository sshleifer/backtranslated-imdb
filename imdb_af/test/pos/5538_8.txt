I just wanted to write a quick response to all the people who give this movie a bad review because they think it's not funny or boring. <br /> <br /> Here's the trick --- the movie isn't meant to be just a comedy. It has some depth. Like many Demme movies, it's about people living in some of the strange corners of our society, trying to figure out how to create a fulfilling life for themselves. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie and home video industries are not doing well with subtlety and falling into the "COMEDY" bin. It's funny, but lots of humor is discount. However, the heart of the movie is not about humor, but about the people in it. <br /> <br /> It may not be one of the greatest films in the world, but it is solid and entertaining. <br /> <br /> And the role play is one of those that shows why decisive art is for itself. Michelle Pfieffer is wonderful and it can be the movie that has shown her a few plays to add to her beauty. Mercedes Ruehl is a big boon and gets the landscape the way she can, in a role it needs, chewing. Throw Oliver Platt, Joan Cusack into smaller roles and the talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaak and you have a great scroll that makes a big difference everywhere. <br /> <br /> Matthew Modine is fun, but more importantly, he's a big hottie in this movie. Warm, cute and sexy. Sit back, expect the unexpected and let the movie take you where it's going, and you'll have a good time.
