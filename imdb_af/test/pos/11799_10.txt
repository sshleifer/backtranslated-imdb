I'm so glad I now have HBO. I didn't plan to watch a movie today, but when I got home and saw the next movie on HBO, I decided (based on the description) to give it at least. I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie! Perhaps this movie just caught me at a vulnerable moment (I'm a little tense, has a great test to study), but it certainly gave me the perspective of friendship not to be a valuable lesson on empathy. do not learn. I am currently one year away from the doctoral school and the whole scene where the doctor was involved and the nurse was definitely a learning point for me! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I just wanted to upload to let the world know it's an incredible movie and shouldn't be missed. There is definitely something for everyone in this movie!
