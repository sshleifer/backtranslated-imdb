I absolutely loved this movie! Since I don't want to give up much, it's basically about a mother and a daughter and the life they have together. It's a very heartwarming story, between the struggle they have. I also think Natalie and Susan have perfect chemistry throughout the film! It's definitely worth seeing! Two thumbs up, up!
