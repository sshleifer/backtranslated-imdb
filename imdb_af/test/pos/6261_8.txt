It's a beautiful, funny, lively movie. It's even better than "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" - which is parallel, but not repeated. The story completed a full circle and played the theater as the credited credits. A hundred years after this story takes place, we are just as inspired by flashing images in a dark theater.
