The Women is a cute movie about women of all ages (but mostly 30+) and their problems in life. Not only men and infidelity, but also relationships with friends and family, to make time for others, image problems, transgressing your values, making life events and finding what will really make you. <br /> <br /> It's also about truth to yourself. Many people will give you advice but do not follow it yourself. Sometimes they made a mistake for themselves, and should you really follow the same path or respond to your feelings, now? I really like this movie. Granted, it was a bit like Sex and the City, but it probably helped me. The difference here is the kind of discoveries after the stage in life that the Sex & City stars were in. Here is the most married or beyond the point of trying to find a man. Now they are trying to find happiness in their marriages and lives. <br /> <br /> Obviously it's not an Oscar contender, but it is entertaining and serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> And for the men there was an equal share of men and women in the movie (most were with their wives / girls), and the men were actually laughing. :)
