If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively vengeance on the treasure of a woman who has left him, this movie has it. You've heard all the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music, a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech that transforms the film. Look for a final scene that is an unexpected evidence of a wounded health. Perhaps we who wonder why we are in the abundant wicked will learn that love can be located above the loins in the heart. Follow the rhythm to the place where love is holy.
