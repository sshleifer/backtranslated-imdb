THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> The Cell, like Antz, has to be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was mediocre, but the movie had such a lasting impression on me after I watched it. I decided to rent it again. I did, and I found the movie to be much more enjoyable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories with quality and is a visually-intelligent movie that dreams of images and ideas that do not match. The movie's script can sometimes be temporary, just like the acting, but the visuals are ingenious and bring the interesting story to an exotic and intriguing life. The Oscar nominated makeup is also constant and cautious, while the beautiful costumes and completely brilliant decorated decoration have become unnoticed. Tarsem Singh who also directed music videos goes crazy with his direction and that is good. He has great talent and this film has a lot of potential if you give it a chance. Overall, The Cell is a powerful, disturbing and avoidable one that makes it a great, enjoyable watch.
