Written, produced and directed by Charlie Chaplin, this is the great actor's anti-Nazi propaganda piece, which hides Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynckel, the dictator of Tomania, as well as a Jewish hairdresser who portrays Hynckel's spit. His parody of Hitler is brilliant. Anyone who has ever seen Hitler's magazine rules will recognize the ominous deal with the caricature. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie started with a slow start with a typical Chaplin flapper that focuses on World War I adventures of the Jewish barber. Having never seen it before, I have to admit that I was wondering about the fuss after the first 20 minutes or so. But the movie is quickly steaming up. There are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of "Hynckel-ism" to make the propaganda point. The climax of the film is a brilliant anti-Nazi speech given by Chaplin at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> As good as Chaplin is in this movie, I thought the whole thing was stolen by Jack. Oakie, playing the dictator of "Bacteria" - "Benzino Napaloni." Our first glance at Oakie shows how well he studied his subject - he had Mussolini's arrogant precipitation pattern. The scenes in which Hynckel and Napaloni were negotiating the fate of "Osterlich" had me in stitches. <br /> <br /> It was a great movie, and worth watching.
