I saw "Heaven Ship" ("Himmelskibet") at the 2006 Cinema Muto Festival in Sacile, Italy. What a great movie! This Danish Steampunk saga is the moving story of the first trip to Mars, in an era where wireless telegraphy has not been perfected. The spaceship does not have a radio and the heroes are returned by landing map of the landing field. Even the intertitles are beautiful ... some of them are written in rhymes in the original Danish. <br /> <br /> Actors' performances are laughing, mostly hand-to-brow histrionics. But the sets are amazing, and it's easier to do something that Georges Melies did a decade earlier (or a decade later in "Die Frau im Mond"). Of course, the plot is simplistic. The spaceship's crew consists of seven thin guys and one skier. Guess which cracks. Interestingly, everyone in this movie (except the dubious professor Dubius) believes in God God. Even the Martians. <br /> <br /> Impressively, the scenarios have the feeling of acknowledging that a trip to Mars is not over: the title cards state that it takes scientists two years to build their spacecraft (which is an air screw ) and six months to reach Mars. During the construction sequence, there is an extremely impressive set-up that needs to be choreographed: dozens of workers go through the workplace in different directions, without hesitation and no collisions. The Danish scientists dipped their ship "Excelsior" ("packaging material") and set course for Mars, even though the Moon and Venus are approaching. When the ship (which does not fly vertically horizontally) is on Mars, it is greeted by Martians - Martians - which appear to be Nordic blondes, all highly developed pacifists and vegetarians. (As a highly developed carnivore, I distorted that part.) <br /> <br /> Conveniently, Mars seems to have an atmosphere, just like Earth's as well as equal gravity. In an outer shot of the Marsse landscape, the Sun's apparent size when seen from Mars is the same as seen from Earth. I also couldn't help seeing that all the wise older Martians are masculine. In fact, female elders are thin on the ground here: both the Earthly hero and the Martian girl are motherless. The Martians speak a universal language, carry ankh's on their clothes and greet the Earth visitors with a globe of Earth ... which of course keeps them up with the North Pole. <br /> <br /> The Martian virgin is Marya, played by an ethereally beautiful Danish actress. (Waiter, I'll have some of those Danish!) We see a Martian dance of chastity that might be two or ridiculous, but is actually quite touching and beautiful. The Mars funeral scene also features one shot that reminds me of a sequence in "The Seventh Seal". I wonder if Ingmar Bergman saw this movie. <br /> <br /> "Himmelsibet" has some flaws, but its production design and its other merits outweigh its disadvantages. The Ole Olsen mentioned in the credits (and appearing in a short prologue) is not related to Chic Johnson's vaudeville partner of "Hellzapoppin". I'll give "Himmelsibet" a 12, but the scale at 10 ... so a full 10 out of 10 for this beautiful trip to Mars, the blonde planet!
