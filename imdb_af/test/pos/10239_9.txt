I was witnessing the best makeup academy award to Dick Tracy, a horrible movie with a terrible makeup. The Nightbreed (based on the better-titled "Cabal" novella) looks fantastic, the play is excellent and David Chroneburg makes for a truly creepy and awesome antagonist. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on Aaron Boone, who is repetitive. nightmares about a society of monsters living under a cemetery. Is he drafting it or are they really and calling him? His Pyschologist (Chroneburg) convinced him that he was a murderer, a murderer. <br /> <br /> Troubled and suicidal, Boone seeks refuge in Midian, but the monsters don't even want him. He is also found by his girlfriend, Lori, who refuses to give up even after being killed and returning cold and monstrous. <br /> <br /> But Decker won't continue Boone. He puts the inhabitants on a total attack on the Midian, like a holy war in the name of God led by the devil. <br /> <br /> Barker themes from hidden samples can come from his experiences as a gay man, but they are always strong and honest. Nightbreed changes the genre on its head. The monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone, but the man is hunting them. <br /> <br /> A 20+ minute longer track was originally submitted by Barker, but the studio hacked it into this broken masterpiece. Barker is working hard to find the missing footage for a director's cut. Until then, this version will have to do.
