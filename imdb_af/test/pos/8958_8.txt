Very good movie story of gay, bitter old teenage girl, now waiting tables. The sexual ambiguities are being investigated realistically, and with a real human face. This, and throw a serial killer on the loose, and you have LOVE AND THE PEOPLE. A good drama, a strange sense of humor and a mystery. The script is fluid and credible. The performances are well above average, and the twists in the story are sharp. <br /> <br /> It is definitely not everyone's ideal idea of ​​a movie, but for those who have written something different and smooth, it is very worthy of your time. Highly recommended.
