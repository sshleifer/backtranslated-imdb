This movie was a surprise. The plot synopsis sounds kinky, and stars Clint Eastwood and the great Geraldine Page. I didn't know what to expect. There is the opening scene where the wounded soldier says the age of 12 is enough to kiss and continues to give a child an urgent, and very mature, mouth to mouth. The child takes him to the girls residence where she lives. He takes advantage of the situation by trying to deceive the principal, who is played by Page, her assistant and another student. Jealousy, sexual tension, incest, intrigue, and macabre all enumerate in this wonderful original story. <br /> <br /> I read the other comments here and found little to disagree. However, I would rather declare a point that there are no sympathetic characters in the film. I think there is one. The handsome female slave successfully resists the success of the soldier in a well-functioning scene, as it affects the common history of black women slaves used by white men. Although her power and lack of illusion is the sum total of her experience, that is what I consider a sympathetic character. She, more than any of the other women and girls at school, has a legitimate reason to participate in what eventually happens.
