Obsession !!!!! I have every season from Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so is because it's so clever, it's not your average comedy show, there's no break to a joke that just keeps on missing you . missed it. And it's not like a soap drama drama, because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never look that stupid cheesy surprise. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the best shows on TV shows of his time. It's fun because they talk so fast, you can't get it all the first time, it's nice to go back and laugh at the other jokes. Also they have so many references, it's great, how smart it is. <br /> <br /> And you can also relate to the characters so much and there are actors excellent from the spiritual Lorelai to the recluse Luke after the immature Kirk the show is just amazing. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a good time and sometimes spends with the family, it's definitely the show for them. There is only one word Gilmore Girls can describe .... CLASSIC !!!!!!
