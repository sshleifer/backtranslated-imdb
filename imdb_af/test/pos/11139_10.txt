Good work! Was very exciting and had good stunts. A show that really shook. Was a good work by all who worked on this one; and especially the action on Bobbie Phillips' part. It would have been big on the big screen. Want to see more of these movies of the week or maybe a weekly series. It was wonderful entertainment and I'm glad I watched! By far the best of the three. Stop the good work UPN and Bobbie Phillips. I'll look for the next one.
