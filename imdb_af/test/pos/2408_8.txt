I've seen this movie more than once and it's worth it. For those of you who love martial arts and conquer internal conflict, this is a worthy choice. After I watched this movie, I wanted to be a more productive member of society, because I could relate to the inner turmoil of a girl who was looking for acceptance and needed a path to follow. Of course, Mr. Miyagi always gives his wise advice. 2 inches up!
