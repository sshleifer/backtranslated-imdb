The man with a golden arm was one of thirty big films around the same time dealing with drug addiction. The other two were Monkey On My Back and A Hatful of Rain. But I think the three this one is the best. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if Otto Preminger shot the thing in real Chicago instead of that obvious studio, the movie might have been even better. Who knows, Preminger might not get enough money to pay for the place. This is the only mistake I find in the movie. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is a heroin-addicted card dealer who was covered for his boss, Robert Strauss, when he caught the match. He took the cure in jail and wanted a new life as a jazz drummer. But many people conspire against him. <br /> <br /> First Bob Strauss, who wants to go back, especially because some heavyweight players are in town. He uses some handy methods to get Sinatra's services back. Secondly, Darren McGavin is the local dope dealer who wants to make Sinatra good and addicted again. And finally, Eleanor Parker, his clinging wife playing a game to beat everything, just to keep him. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra received a nomination for best actor for this film, but lost to Ernest Borgnine in Marty. Sinatra may have won for this one if he did not win from Van here until eternity in the supporting actor category and that Marty was such a well-known film that year. His scenes that go into withdrawal from Kim Novak's apartment will make you shake. <br /> <br /> She doesn't get enough credit for her. She is really something like the crazy scheming woman who wants to connect Sinatra to her, no matter what the cost. If she was not selected for Interrupted Melody the same year, she may be nominated for this. 1955 was the highlight of her career. <br /> <br /> Darren McGavin has his first real notice as the very slanging drug beater. His performance is guaranteed to crawl your flesh. <br /> <br /> Elmer Bernstein has contributed a great jazz score to accentuate the common thirst of the dark Chicago environment in which the characters live. Not a place you want to train. your family.
