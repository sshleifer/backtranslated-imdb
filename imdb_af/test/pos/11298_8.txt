WONDERBIRD, definitely an incredibly refined cartoon, formulated in a fun old way and formed sensationally old in almost any respect, takes place in a kingdom governed by a mean and horrific monarch; Consequently, the kingdom or at least what we see in the vicinity of the king's palace seems immobile uninhabited. <br /> <br /> A few residents are away from the sun in the distressed underground city. <br /> <br /> An opinion calls it an allegory, call it a parable, don't call it a fable. <br /> <br /> Because IMDb encourages proliferation, and perhaps for other reasons, I'll add that this cartoon is the work of the great Paul Grimault.
