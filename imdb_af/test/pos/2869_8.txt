See no evil with Kane. The movie has a great story, but it just wasn't a hidden eye, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it would be to watch the WWE Superstars on Monday Night Rouge when the movie first came to theaters. I enjoyed the movie, although I enjoyed the story, it played out. <br /> <br /> BIG MOVIE EXCELLENT WILL SEE A PART 2 <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter if Kane is killed. The End <br /> <br /> Or they also killed other horror stars in every movie <br /> <br /> They've got out and they're still coming back for more. Such a part 2 will be <br /> <br /> very interesting.
