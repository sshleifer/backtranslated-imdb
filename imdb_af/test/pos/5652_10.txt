The main achievement of this film is that although the racist is unipolar, the film can still work out a tabletop of war depictions that endure a lasting identification with anyone who can see it and who was present. Although good films have the ability to universalize their subjects, which is often a difficult thing to do; large films have the ability to universalize their unipolar subjects. This is what this movie does. <br /> <br /> Instead of cutting out a context of unity, the film shows the Japanese in the ill end of the Phillipines war front in February 1945, signs signs of pacifism or war, but rather signs of the feelings, death, destruction, victory and war of war with the bloody hands of the defeat. Different and better than movies like Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, both of which needed a satirical methodology to personalize and depersonalize US troops and to use all races as one fight. It's good, but not as big as a movie that uses one race and view. America, to convey the horror of war and show how it really is. <br /> <br /> The only way the main character makes it to the end through this movie is to be sick, hence inedible; therefore, through his character, through his illness, his saving face, we see the end of World War II in the Philippines in February 1945, and the way the Americans, Japanese, and Philippians gathered in bloody warfare where you die . <br /> <br /> The film is continuously influenced by a neo-realistic way of cinematic representation, which is original and beneficial to a viewer, whether it is or now, because the neo-realistic techniques it employs all the horrors of war form in the picture, or a showcase for pacifism or 'militaristic responsibility'. Like Germania Anno Zero, by Roberto Rossellini, a story comes from the environment and the conditions attached to it. <br /> <br /> The film's opening, with the two-way discussion between the two Japanese soldiers, prefigures and reechoes the events. Through this opening, we feel that the struggle is human against man and man with man; It appears that they relied on each other to confront the enemy in the past, but now, in this opening or 'pivoting' of Japanese experiences in the Philippines, new information is being conveyed to the main character Tamura, which is an Offer from a cannibal dependence on each other if they want to survive. <br /> <br /> The jungle is eager, wet and thick, and the air is not rarely cloudy and pouring. We waded with the stragglers, though pools and swamps, as sick as the land around them. Anonymous carcasses are scattered everywhere. Sometimes one cannot know whether they are bodies, rocks or wheat. Apparently there is no difference here, everything is dead and sick. Everyone is dead. All they should not feed is scarce monkeys and bodies of fallen comrades and / or nameless enemies. <br /> <br /> Often, Tamura meets a few others near death. Although he was crushed and crushed in spirit, some offered their bodies to eat, but he refused; he will still, like Hiroshi Kawaguchi and Nishi in Giant and Toys, not die of dignity and Japanese morals; for that is all he really has to keep for his survival, a dignity of self. So, when Nagamatsu analyzes a soldier for consumption, he shoots him through it. Tamura can be used for the murder, but he cannot decipher for the disease of murder and looting. He is not a good man or a bad man. He wants to survive, but will not go the extra mile as the straight war murder. She herself was killed on the battlefield, he is not happy here to survive and survive the swakes. <br /> <br /> The disease he carries, he sees everywhere, in everyone; and unfortunately he lacks the ethical rationale to think about whether he is completely thinking about others, since he cannot stop his body for them since his infectious illness, or think completely of himself, as he sees the disease in everyone, but they still still kill even if they do no harm. Seen in his attack on the two Philippians in the hut. He can't see anyone. Nobody can see anyone. The only one sees an aversion to malice and a health difference, the heart of survival instincts. <br /> <br /> Often, an arm appears to the left of the screen, after which there must be hope, because, in so far Thule lies their freedom. Yet it is blocked by American soldiers so Japanese stragglers die slowly in this inconspicuous dirt. Even a church tower appears, reflecting the light of an invisible sun. But on closer inspection the beads flutter wildly over it; Religion is also an air of poison. <br /> <br /> Nobi, the Japanese title of the film, gives more evidence to the themes, or feelings of the movie: the servitude to fate, the hardship of existence among leaders and lives controlled by others . The correct Anglophone translation has been a subject of heavy debate among historians, as non-Koreans translate it as slaves and slaves, while many Korean arguments that nobi were not a slave system, but a service class system that did not meet the criteria for slavery. A way to typically escape massive poverty. It improves on the war theme and symbolism of soldier. Isn't it important to ask ourselves what the purpose of our popular history will be during the period? Should we be comfortable leaving it alone without being aware of change? Isn't that who we are fighting, that age question, but rather, why are we fighting? Fires on the Plains are with Eiji Funakoshi, Osamu Takizawa and Mickey Curtis; based on a novel by Shohei Ooka. In Japanese with subtitles.
