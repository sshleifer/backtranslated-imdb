Big party movie, following the adventures of Bill & Tom, two high school friends on the opposite end of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live straight while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) doesn't take anything seriously, except to party all the time. When Bill goes out of his mother's house to live alone, he faces a lot of trouble, from his girlfriend, to his brother, to his landlord. Meanwhile, his friend Tom is moving in to keep the rent, but continues to turn Bill's life upside down. This movie is non-stop comedy from start to finish and is a personal favorite of mine. Soundtrack features guitar virtioso Edward Van Halen throughout the film, also features rockers Lee Ving and Ron Wood. 70s Pornstar legend Kitten Navidad also makes a look! Classic 80's movie is worth several looks. Now all that needs to be done is a very anticipated DVD release! If you enjoy this movie, check out "The Last American Virgin" which is similar to "Wild Life". I judge both highly.
