The beauty. The Terror. The Poetry. The Horror. The innocence. The Debt. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is about everything I should write in this comment for a TWO SISTER LANGUAGES. The best thing is to watch this movie without knowing it. I didn't even know one thing about the history of the two girls when I went into this movie. I just looked at the beautiful cover art, didn't even read the synopsis on the back and put it in a DVD player. I just knew it won several prizes at festivals around the world and it was highly recommended. <br /> <br /> The DVD cover reads "The Most Scary Film Since THE RING, THE GRUDGE and DARK WATER". Although the frightening part may be right, you can forget about the rest, because the only thing a TALK OF TWO HIS SINCE has in that movie is ... a ghostly performance with long black hair. It is even a little unfair to compare it to this well-known Japanese movie, because this Korean film has much more to offer and is actually a bit more complicated and intelligent than the other. <br /> <br /> This movie is simply a small masterpiece, and here are some reasons (without telling anything about the plot): The movie itself woke me up at least twice with clever surprise performances. And just when you think you've come to the conclusion (whether or not you get it, it's irrelevant for the moment) and you think the movie will end ... this movie goes a little longer. The cinematography is wonderful, with bright colors during the day and dark shades at night. The camera work is excellent with the director who sometimes chooses impressive, if not, innovative angles. Some shots are pure poetry (eg, the upper shot with the two sisters at the lake). Everything looks very stylish. There are only four main characters, but the plot around them is intense. The story itself starts a bit slow, but there is a lot of variation in tone and emotion to keep it interesting. There was even one play (when the girls pulled out to the lake) who suddenly reminded me of Peter Jackson's SECRET CREATORS. But when the horror comes in, it's pretty effective. There are also some successful surprises. Damn, I jumped straight out of my couch. The musical score is wonderful, and at times when it's not scary, I can't help but I notice it's an Italian feel. A bit strange for a Korean movie. But still, a good score. So much care has been taken in every detail of this movie, including a perfectly balanced surround sound. <br /> <br /> I also think calling a TWO SISTER LANGUAGES, just a horror movie, doesn't give it enough credit. It is more of a mysterious horror drama that works psychologically and supernaturally. No matter how you look at it, it is Asian horror that stands out among the best. It may not be a pity, but it sometimes gets scary and the subject is pretty disturbed. If you haven't seen it yet, find a copy, print it in your DVD player, go with the flow and make sure you give this movie your full attention for the 110 minute run. <br /> <br /> There, I hope I did a good job of praising it without spoiling anything.
