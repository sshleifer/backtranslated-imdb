i am an avid ff7 fan, for example, i have the game and then sell it (bad mistake) but buy it again (good mistake ... erm) <br /> <br /> anyways, yes, this movie is Very well, the battles are very cool, music is very good and the cgi you can't fall for. <br /> <br /> Anything that is disappointing with the movie, I feel was the lack of other character engagement, it was almost all the cloud though a big character, you can't beat a cid and barret. <br /> <br /> But in spite of that, the movie was in my opinion and a must see. <br /> <br /> Overall give a good movie and give it 9/10 <br /> <br /> square, make more movies like this and you'll be more worshiped than you already are !!
