A long-awaited concert release, Rush-in-Rio DVD, is compelling and disappointing. This smooth two-disc set puts Rush at their best. After 30 years of their unique sound, it's great to have this record of one of the most talented rock bands ever. <br /> <br /> The concert features over two dozen songs, a documentary and three multi-function songs. -hoekkyk. Packed in a two-folded sleeve with a sleeve and a small insert, it is very well-priced for the amount of material it contains. <br /> <br /> I'm a Rush fan from the late seventies to early eighties, and this DVD comes through big, with half the show emphasizing songs from the era. I won't list the songs if you want to be surprised. If you have attended the Dampspore tour, you will know what they will be playing. <br /> <br /> Rush is a big crowd here in Rio. In fact, this was one of the first things I noticed that was special about this show. During most of this two hour concert, you hear and see the crowd, actively chanting and dancing wildly to the music. Initially, it's fun to see the fans, giving Rush a well-deserved answer. But after several songs I was ready to hear and see more of the group and less of the crowd. It is by no means a void of the crowd of Rio. More power for them! This is a criticism of the final editing of the DVD. <br /> <br /> What brings me to my second and main reason, "I hate it". The video editing is terrible in my opinion. Store for multi-angle view bonus cuts, the whole show is a madness of visual chaos. It's like the director wanted to see how spicy he could. I regularly count changing camera angles between every one and four seconds. After about three or four songs, my head and eyes were ready for a break. It's too bad, because I would have sat down through the entire show, as I could at the concert last year. Perhaps this fast-paced editing is the latest craze for concert DVDs, but I really think it's a nuisance and distraction from the overall experience. As mentioned before, I won't keep that in mind for a song or two, but the whole visual aspect of this disc is in a hurry, or RUSHed. It's really ironic, because all the previous concert clips I've seen from Rush, mainly from Moving Pictures, are filmed tightly, with little conversion back and forth. It's almost boring, visually speaking. This DVD took it to the other extreme. I know many colored-in-the-wool Rush fans will disagree completely with my statements, but that's just my impression. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: If you are a Rush fan, you will buy this DVD, regardless of my review or any other. I would still have bought it after reading my review. Don't expect a "normal" concert. Who knows, the things mentioned above may not bother you.
