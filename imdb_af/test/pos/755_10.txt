Charlotte Beal arrives at an isolated country hospital to become a full-time nurse there. She is confronted with a common group of crazies and an apparently crazy supervisor. Is dr. Masters everything she looks like? <br /> <br /> DO NOT VIEW IN THE BASIS, is one of the best low-budget movies in the genre and why people always lay it down is beyond me. The acting is excellent, my favorite show is by Betty Chandler and Allyson the nimfomania. The chills just jump right off the screen. You probably shouldn't say, "It's just a movie, it's just a movie", it's not that scary, but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre, which I do. It is very difficult to make a creepy movie on a low budget and little really successful. AX is another cheap movie that is being watched. Perhaps people are so spoiled by the huge budgets of recent films that any movie that does not have excellent effects and / or is not considered a classic does not have a chance with an audience. But I think after people see this movie, they'll see how important the low-budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other junk.
