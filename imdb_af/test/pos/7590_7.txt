This one runner made by MGM in 1936 shows the talents of two of his young stars under contract, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin. In this way, these short films were promotional trailers containing new talent in front of or behind the camera. Felix Feist directed this one which was a way to promote the two talented stars to the public. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. The orchestra entertaining in a public park every Sunday does not get the attention it deserves. Give two music aficionados, Judy and Edna, who like to hear the band game that was filmed by one of their grandparents. Two of the parents of the town to whom it is felt are no public for this kind of entertainment, have decided to cancel their Sunday concerts in favor of a more popular band that will attract a wider audience. <br /> <br /> The two girls start a promotional tour of their own doing they just know, call and run and help with their neighbors in exchange for a promise that they will attend the park concert next Sunday. Well, that day comes, and to their surprise, almost no one comes to the music. The two girls decide to take matters into their own and ask the conductor to play a song so they can sing. The result is clear, people across the park swarm to hear the talented young singers, ensuring the band's existence. <br /> <br /> Of course, the only attraction of the short film is the inspired song by the two stars. Ms Durbin's operative voice blends well with Mrs. Garland's natural one that creates a beautiful duet. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it when shown on TCM!
