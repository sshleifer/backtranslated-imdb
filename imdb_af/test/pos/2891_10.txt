I recently bought this DVD and I was totally surprised that Rush's songs looked the same as they did when I first listened to them in 1980. The series of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart are so talented that I want to list them Songs I remember are Tom Sawyer, XYZ, The Big Money, The Trees, Freewill, Closer to the Heart, 2112, Limelight and The Spirit or Radio, playing and singing the 40000 fans there and with a good time and I swear more than half of the audience was under 25! <br /> <br /> Writers who worry Rush as far as Rush fans like me are a bunch of jealous thunderheads that blend like rice sour cream with oranges in a taco. <br /> <br /> Rush does not put on makeup, wear nails, lip sync, wear lipstick, get into trouble with the law, and keep a band member about how long they are unmarried. All they do is entertainment! <br /> <br /> I give this DVD a 100 out of 100.
