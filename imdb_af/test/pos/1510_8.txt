Un Gatto nel Cervello, or Nightmare Concert as it is more commonly known by English-speaking audiences, begins as horror film director Lucio Fulci (played by the man Lucio Fulci himself) lunches after filming a very greedy and violent scene, but he orders steak & has a terrible vision regarding cannibalism. The grotesque visions, hallucinations and dreams continue and begin to influence his state of mind. Fulci decides to seek help and contacts, Professor Egon Schwarz (Dvid L. Thompson) for psychiatric help. Schwarz claims Fulci cannot divorce fantasy and agrees to help him, but Schwarz has a more sinister background than a serial killer starting to make prostitutes cruel. Fulci believes he can be responsible. <br /> <br /> This Italian production was co-authored and directed by Lucio Fulci, who is also in the movie as a horror movie director called Lucio Fulci, who doesn't really feel that much effort has been made. Anyway, Un Gatto Nel Cervello, is gory than nothing else and for that alone I liked it. The script by Fulci, John Fitzsimmons, Giovanni Simonelli and Antonio Tentori is nothing more than a foolish excuse to change many other gory material from other Italian films together. It serves its purpose well enough. I think and seeing Fulci on the screen has a certain fascination if you are a fan of his or her films, the end is almost hastily rushed as if they run out of money, as it only has a policeman. Fulci tells them they killed the killer and that's it. Another thing about ending when the two police put the white sheet over the killer in the field and then walk away without having any other police's presence. I think the police in Italy just need a dead body in the middle of a field on its own? It moves at a good pace and if you like you, you should see it, but if you don't like Gore, you will hate it with passion. It all depends on your disposal so that the choice of your people is. <br /> <br /> Director Fulci has never been the most artistically-skilled filmmaker, and it shows here, as his footage is slim, flat and looks like it was shot for TV, the footage of the other films (7 in total) T adapts the stuff to the Fulci shot and it is clear that it is made up of different movies. If you are looking for something, you hit the jackpot, people are broken by chain saws, placed by meat cutters, faces are melted, there are a few decapitations, there are a few dots, someone's body falls under a car. , a tongue bruised. someone has bruised their throat if a wheelchair is running over it, there are many stumps, someone has removed their intestines with a hook, there is a rotten look with maggots, someone's hand is cut off, someone has trapped their head In their eye falling out, a miserable death by piano thread as it slits through someone's throat, there are many cut limbs, canter blood splashes, and a scene of some cats eating brain. There is also more. With a so-called budget of about $ 100,000, it seems that it's very cheap, it has no visual style or artistic merit, but then it's a bit fake and looks stocking. <br /> <br /> Why would you want to see a Nazi orgy series and wall-to-wall gore? The acting in this is terribly including Fulci. <br /> <br /> Un Gatto nel Cervello is a top film if you are a gore dog like me, but if you are looking for something with a little more dust or indeed any substance then it is not for you. This is the kind of movie that people divide straight into the middle, you will either love it or hate it.
