I must take all the terrible comments into account. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it when I need to pick me up. Granted it's not like the Sound of Music, but it's so much fun when you choose movies, is not your thing. I worshiped the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta always has and will always be a favorite. I saw it when it first appeared in the theaters. I'm a great musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in "The Boyfriend". It is a modern musical and should not be judged by anyone who has gone before. It's just the best for dreamers like me who wish they could find this place - no disease, no wars, no drugs, all the bad things in life are gone. It's nothing more than a good movie. That's what all movies are about. Shaun Phillips title song is wonderful and explains the whole feeling of the movie. If the play is not the greatest, who cares. I love the idea of ​​the movie. Peter Finch, a very tight actor, Liv Ullmann, wonderful as always, Sally Kellerman, surprisingly good voice, Michael York, typical, and Olivia Hussey, convinced me that they were the normal people of the mill. None of them acted like actors in a movie. They acted like real people, just as I would if I found this place. Torn between going home and staying there, in awe of everything. Yes, there are mistakes in this movie, but come on, it's not Citizen Kane, it's a good music!
