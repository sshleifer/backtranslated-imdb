<br /> <br /> After reading the unemployed critic's review, I went to a radio show and didn't know what to expect. Fortunately, the unemployed critic, in any case, appears to me a frustrated film director / film critic. It's a movie that makes you laugh, it will make you cry and in the end it will give you a break! <br /> <To paraphrase a line made by writer Ed Harris in the final Barbershop scene ... ... and all this time we thought we were Radio, the truth is ... He taught us. He treats us all the time, As we wish we had treated each other, some of the time! "<br /> Yes, the movie is dragging on. Yes, it is emotionally manipulative and yes, Cuba Gooding Jr. (In an Oscar-worthy performance) is sometimes a bit over the top (See the Christmas Day dance dance scene), but you know what? SO WHAT! Every time in a while the American community needs to be reminded of what tolerance can do for our big country. br /> <br /> It's a solid role. I was especially pleased to see S. Epatha Merkerson, who portrays Radio's mother, doing something out of law and order. a good actor or is it the quality of the writing that is produced, buy a strong role on law and order. After watching this movie, it is easy to see that she is indeed a very good actor. /> <br /> Also in the role in small but important and powerful roles are Alfre Woodard as head, Debra Winger in a career-restoring role of Coach Jones's wife and Ch take Mulkey as protagonist, Frank Clay. <br /> <br /> We can't consider Ed Harris's performance as coach Harold Jones. After reflecting on this movie and growing up in the Deep South myself, it is difficult to truly appreciate Mr Harris and his contribution to this film. As coach, Jones, Ed delivers a quiet, solid performance, that of a man on a mission. Coach Harris will not allow the village or circumstances to divert him from what he knows in his heart. It is the right thing to do. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie, make sure you look around for the end credits. You will be a surprise if the true James Robert 'Radio' Kennedy, now in his mid 50's, is still leading the T.L. Hanna soccer team is on the field every Friday night. <br /> <br /> A final note. If you were a teenager in the middle to late 70's, this movie is the price of admission, for the soundtrack alone!
