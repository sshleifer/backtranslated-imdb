Some movies want to make us think, some want to wake us up, some want to excite us. But sometimes a movie just wants to make us laugh, and 'In & Out' definitely succeeds in this department. <br /> <br /> Indiana Teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) will be married to other teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) in three days, but the whole town is more excited about the Oscar nomination of the former resident Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon). But if Cameron wins an Oscar for playing a gay soldier, he thanks his gay teacher, Howard, for inspiration. What follows is Howard denies it in a hilarious set of accidents in a real screwball mode. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline is great, exuberant gay stereotypes. Joan Cusack really has a head start for screwball antics. Debbie Reynolds is completely hilarious as Howard's mother. And Bob Newhart is also a hoot as the homophobic principal. <br /> <br /> Gay screenwriter Paul Rudnick really achieves a delicate balance here. He knows the stereotypes and exploits them in a way that is mostly acceptable to conservative Midwestern and yet mostly relentless to the gay audience. It's not really progressive, but it's funny and unofficial, and definitely a step from the previous year's "The Birdcage."
