I have never read Sarah Water's book. Although I didn't read the book, the 3 hour movie is very interesting. It starts with an interesting story with a distorted end. I must say these 2 actresses are wonderful. Sally Hawkins is stunningly depicted in love with her mistress and betrayed by her love. Their romance is flourishing slowly, as they spend more and more time together. The love making scene is very soft and emotional, well done. The end is quite interesting and these two finally came together, and that's a blessing. Overall, it's a good movie to watch, a very interesting plot with excellent performances.
