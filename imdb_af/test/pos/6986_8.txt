It opens with your cliche too long to move through space. All I could think of was "Spaceballs" and hope there will be a sticker on the back saying "We are not breaking for anyone." The movie then shows some cryogenic freezers with Vin Diesel's narration. I've always thought his voice has sounded since I saw it quickly and furiously. From when I found out he was as criminal, I thought the movie would be clich√©. It was. It was a lot of cliche in turn and the lot was against them. Black every 22 years. Fortunately, their country on that day. Aliens can only be in the dark, hey this is a solar eclipse. As much as I thought it was too easy and just a cliche, the movie went through and kicked big @ss. I even went out and bought a copy of Pitch Black after I saw it. I really can't wait for Riddick's chronicles.
