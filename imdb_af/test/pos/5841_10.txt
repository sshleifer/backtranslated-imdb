I have never seen a show with so much story, mystery, tension, and stubborn excitement before. I watch TV more, but I own this show every season and it's incredible. every episode was performed extremely well, written and recorded. By the end of the show, I felt the stories too far-fetched because they were in a prison, but the actors pulled it off. Soprano sucks large compared to OZ. In fact, any show on a cable network, HBO, or not just a candle for OZ. I wish it would return for one season. if that happened, they would probably kill every character on the show, but hey, we all have to go one day. As far as the characters, I want to say O'Reily and Alverez were my favorites. Both were hardley in a scene together, but their individual stories I thought were the strongest of anyone except of course Beechers of course, but still ... anyway, best performance ever, best network ever, some of the best actors ever, PERIOD!
