It was one of the few shows my wife and I agreed to watch. I was appalled to hear that it was canceled, especially since I didn't realize the ratings were so poor. As far as I know, many viewers did very well. Almost all my friends and most of the people I spoke to looked at the show. Now we can see if it is not for crappy shows or DVDs. How bad was the performance? does anyone know the real results of the shows? I know it was harder to catch for Thursdays. Thanks G * d for DVRs! <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was a great surprise to know that there will be no more "The War At Home". If any other network sees it, PLEASE CHOOSE THE TICKET !!!! PLEASE!
