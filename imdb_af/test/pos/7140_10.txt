It's more than a Saturday. noon special. Very well written as very low key there is a lot here if you are looking for it. Catch the cat companion / scout for example. It couldn't just be a cartoon, it had to be a cartoon. The comic industry (as well as the film's publishers) missed the boat. One of the least knows very good movies. A great writing by John Sayles is a strong point, but the acting is also good. Probably the best "super hero" movie I've ever seen. Short on special effects, but long on credibility. This one is a custodian. I have never seen a DVD of this movie, but I previously owned a VHS version. Good hunting
