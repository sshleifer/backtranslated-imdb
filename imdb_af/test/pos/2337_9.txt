I would like to thank you for the opportunity to be one of the first to see the movie really. It really keeps you going. John Paul eventually finds the light and makes a living for himself away from his mother's apron strings. <br /> <br /> I think there should be so many families in the same position (especially with children leaving older but I don't want to be wiser) with many sad parents who don't really have lives of their own and what their lives are miserable. <br /> <br /> I think this movie should definitely be a wider audience. I would also say that the other actors also played brilliant parts. It's such a deep film and a lot of moves.
