We open in a doctor's room of some sort. A girl is accompanied to the doctor's seat. He asked her questions. Silence follows. He continues to ask questions, ignoring the girls' obviously traumatized atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The story is about two girls being taken home, after spending some time in a spiritual home after an incident happened. They are greeted at their arrival by their trouble-too-hard-to-pretty-but-so-utterly ominous Stepmother, who obviously resents the girls. As time goes home, the evil stepmother finds new ways to worry the girls. And to take it all off, there's a fiery ghost that helps far from the girls' recovery ... <br /> <br /> This movie is great. It turns, turns and definitely leaves you much to think about without making sense. The relationship between the two girls is so heart-warming, it makes you cry a few points (I know I had a nasty moment of two, specifically "the cupboard scene"). But what I love most about this movie is the total sense of fear all the way to the running credits. The soundtrack is flawless, the furniture in the house, and the use of color is fantastic. A pure joy to the eyes. This is a definite must-see for all Asian Movie Fanatics. Or any kind of movie! An easy 10/10.
