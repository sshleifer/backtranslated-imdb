I thought this movie was pretty good. It was once on TCM (Turner Classic Movies) at three o'clock, and its horrible humor kept me up to five. Kelly performs beautifully in this role, especially with the grandmother (whose khaki almost made me laugh from my seat). The main actress was good, but the father ended his character of the marriage conflict and kept the humor. If you want a good horrible, older movie, I would recommend it. Unlike the other comments, I like Gene Kelly. He was the perfect leading actor for many early musicals and I think in this role, he picks up his charisma. One drawback is that the dance screens get a little long turn, but if you can get it, you're clear.
