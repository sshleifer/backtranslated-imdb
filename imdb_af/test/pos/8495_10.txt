This movie inspired me to be a better person. In life you do not know who will overcome you and sometimes our bias will enable us to prepare a person wrongly. I learned to give a person the benefit of the doubt as a result of this movie. I also learned that difficult love can build a stronger person. Now I want to know where the movie soundtrack is. There are songs in this soundtrack that I've been trying to find for years. May I comment on the acting for a moment. Jamie Fox was excellent. The man rose to be actor actor. The performance of Regina King was also wonderful. If I can find a woman to watch me watch Ray, I can only dream. I picked $ 18.00 for this movie and I don't have much money, but I'm willing to see this movie again and again. This movie touched me.
