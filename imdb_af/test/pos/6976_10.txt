In some scenes in the Rainmen, Francis Ford Coppola's forerunner to his hey-day of the seventies, there is a similar situation for 1969's Easy Rider, but not exactly in the same frame of reference. Here we have a drama about disconnected people from society, alienated in some ways by choices or imposed by limits by some means. It is one of those rare original plays where some scenes stand alone as total knockouts. Even with such a low-string budget and a lot of voluntary, so-called, attitude about filming the film, Coppola is able to do everything through these clearly defined characters and the curved, unexpected degrees of one character. towards the helplessness of another, or vice versa, or both. And, as one would tend to see how much about the vantage points of the suburban life of the 1960s, it has the escape of the film previously mentioned, but of a more concrete, nearly timeless quality with the drama and the underlying issues. In a way, if Bergman was on the trail as a quasi-guerrilla 20-something movie maker to get the strange truths of everyday outsiders, it could be. <br /> <br /> But along with all the very direct and sometimes self-conscious photography (although with a more documentary approach at times, related to his indefinite characters), the actors all fit into place. Shirley Knight, an actor I am not too familiar with, has a complex, diverse role as a pregnant woman who is in a kind of existentialist confrontation of what life is like. There are moments of some awesome action by her, and one of my favorites (if not my favorite) is when she first calls on her phone. Such a tense scene on both sides, and in every little gesture and word so much about her, is spoken so little. It is extraordinary in ways that reflect others in Coppola's films. Then comes the character of "killer" played by James Caan. It is also a dangerous character to tackle, as it is a mixture of childish confusion and scarring entertainment. Think Forrest Gump if he didn't make it past the football and white. It's one of its best, actually, by being the most minimalist - for a guy who usually plays hard movies in movies, here is one that is also part of the core of the story and of Knight's character. Also very good in a supporting role is Robert Duvall as a cop with a rough side and rather checkered past; kind of an early sample of other broken characters he would play later in his career. <br /> <br /> So the characters, and what Coppola dares to run into them, is really what the film does, as any story is there, it is certainly not solved in the usual way you may think or expect. The last ten or so minutes are like others in Coppola's work, where the specific tragedies on all sides are suppressed by the emotional and psychological implications it will leave, the principles are strengthened to the sublime and sad. It is brave for his time on the side of trying to be represented (in both freedom and error and ambiguity) in the subject. And the style of the picture adds a fragmented view to it with quick flashbacks that are graphic and independent in contrast to the longer shots in some critical scenes. This is a road movie of his time, but it also has a lot more work than it would be with another movie maker, with fewer chances to tackle the nature of these extinct characters. One of the best films in 1969.
