Sri Lanka ... not a country I have ever thought of, I must admit. I didn't even know it was near India, let alone a bloody civil war since 1983. The Tamil minority rebels seem to be in constant conflict with the country's military regime Mani Ratman's latest film, A PECK ON THE CHEEK, telling the story of a young girl named Amudha, her Sri Lanka is divorced. parents in the war and educated by a young Indian couple. Amudha is a bright and naughty girl, whose life turns upside down when her parents tell her she has been adopted as a child. Although her adopted parents love her as it can be and raised her without prejudice with their biological children, Amudha can't help but learn more about her biological family. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film DIL SE, which hides a story about terrorism and politics in a love story (or is it the other way around?). A PECK ON THE CHEEK resides on similar territory, but may be more ambitious in the land it covers. The central theme that binds the film is love between all the different members of a family, and especially between a child and her adopted parents. It is a fairly honest and open look to feelings, sometimes sometimes very sad and heartwarming and very painful to others. It is an emotionally complex film, with characters that are somewhat idealized but still behave in a very human way. <br /> <br /> The film turns to 9-year-old Amudha, played with charming and vivaciousness by young actress P.S. Keerthana in her first and only role. She is a princess and a monster who is always in trouble, but such a disturbing charm that no one can be angry with her for a long time. The young actress is perfectly cast for the role and has a tremendous work in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of her. <br /> <br /> A PECK ON THE CHEEK has such an innocent name, I was quite unprepared for the intensity of the experience. Never have such a small act come with such an enormous emotional impact, I dare say. The film is a brave and artistic effort to investigate matters that are not often covered on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratman's direction is wonderful, very confident and mature - the most sophisticated work I've ever seen. director still. The film is visually stylish, with some excellent camera work and images. A.R. Rahman offers the film's soundtrack, which is not as good as its classic DIL SE or BOMBAY music (based on first impressions at least), but still shows its great musical talent. <br /> <br /> I'm not aware of a DVD release for the movie yet - I saw it in Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival, whose film was undoubtedly the highlight. The production is a real world class, and I'm sure it will be popular with Western audiences as it starts to increase exposure. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
