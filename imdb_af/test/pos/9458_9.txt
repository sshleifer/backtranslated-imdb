When I watched this movie, I thought it would just be another movie I had to endure with my sister. And also Amanda Baynes's last movie wasn't that hot, and I doubt the movie because she's the main actress. But within 5 minutes I laughed so hard, I had tears in my eyes. The jokes were not out there. then a second to understand it, but very funny. The writing was not too complex that I could not understand the love triangle, but was very faithful to the original play by Shakepeare. I loved every minute so much that I shot a man two seats away from me in a nice fun! very embarrassing! I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie especially girls, as the guys in this movie are hot! (lol) so much that I can only get it on DVD.
