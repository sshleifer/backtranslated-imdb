"The Journey" is a very good movie. Produced in the spring of 1958, in Vienna, and released in 1959, this movie was quite popular in its early years. Despite the political problems that affected the success of the movie (because the story happened during the Hungarian Revolution, the Cold War), "The Journey" is a very good movie, but not known. I think it should be released on DVD right away, because most people who have seen it so far want to get it home. One of the key features of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, their intense relationship. All their screens together are very important, but they also reveal the strong feelings, the great passion and love between the characters (Major Surv and Diana Ashmore). Another quality is the writing, which is very well written. It's even published as a novel by screen saver George Tabori. The film keeps its tension from start to finish. Initially, we didn't know if Diana and the other travelers would leave Hungary, because the Communist Major discovered that Princess's friend, Paul Kedes, was Hungarian and he couldn't leave the country. The Major falls in love with Diana and that is actually the reason why he doesn't want to let her go. But after embracing her and kissing her one of the most memorable ones ever seen on the screen, she kissed him, and let her go. And the end of the movie is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed. The Majesty and Diana say goodbye! She comes to the border with all the travelers, including Paul, while some of the Hungarians shot Surov a few times, so he died. Yul Brynner is very, very beautiful and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful, charming, refined, just like an English woman. Yul and Debora are perfect together. They are one of the biggest couples of the Golden Hollywood. A real filmmaker must see this movie. "The Journey" has everything a good movie should have - a great, fascinating story, interesting characters, a wonderful direction (Anatole Litvak is, in my opinion, at its best). Finally, I would like to send a message to Warner Bros. Studios or those who restore and release classic films: Please, please leave the "Journey" on DVD as soon as possible.
