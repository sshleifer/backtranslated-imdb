which is a great movie, very good roles of some random stars. Actually, there are these pottery who are caught in a comic adventure. On the movie, the movie makes you believe everyone is going to die! Which contributes to the comedy. When the character of John Lithgow (3rd Rock) reappears - it is impossible not to imagine the journey, it may have caused, like a total paradox. The movie is full of twists and turns that make you guess the end. Billy Bob Thornton astronaut farmer is brilliant, in fact looking back, the character is fairly similar in the fact that he holds the family of potters together. Everyone involved in this movie needs to get a big thumb. <br /> <br /> As I say, the final scene is a dream; but a nightmare at the same time. I love it when Hank Azaria (carter) says in the end do you think we should do it every year? I felt like I wanted it myself. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to say this movie is good for everyone, but as a fan of Stoner movies I give it 10/10. - My council has a joint ready; kick back and enjoy!
