Shazam was okay, but Hero High was my favorite when I was a kid, I meant before Sky High (2005) and Zoom (2006) were. There was hero High, a school of super hero in training. Teenage boys with superpowers would help the police catch bad guys, and other times they would be embarrassed like the Greatest American Hero (1981). It was a fun cartoon to watch, which was also fun, was the live action stage program, The Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam. The actors who pronounced the characters, also dressed, have characters in the show. Rex Ruthless (John Berwick), Misty Magic (Jere Fields), Weather Man (Jim Greenleaf), Captain California (Chris Hensel, who also sang the theme song), Dirty Trixie (Maylo Mccaslin), Glorious Gal the love child of Superman and Wonder Woman, and Punk Rock (Johnny Venocour). The whole role just went with anything when it came to jokes. The cartoon was a fun superhero comedy. I'll get it back in lively action like Fat Albert (2004)
