Famous and mysterious escape Raymar, who is a kind of deadly telekinetic psychic vampire, suddenly dies under bizarre circumstances. Nice Wells High School student Julie Wells (a warm and sympathetic performance by sweet Meg Tilly) desperately wants to be accepted by the sneaky click of the Sisters (played to sublime bitchy perfection by Leslie Speights, Robin Evans and everyday Elizabeth Daily), so his voice together to spend a night in a Greek mausoleum, where Raymar's body was considered part of an initiative ride. Of course, Raymar still has his extraordinary powers, so it's going to be a very long and disturbing night of pure nervous terror for poor Julie. <br /> <br /> Director / author, Mr. Tom McLoughlin (who later gave us The Enjoyable Tongue-in-the-cheek "Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives") evades graphic gore in favor of creating a sprawling and ominous atmosphere, but fails to accomplish this particular achievement to pull off, because the first hour is too slow, talk and inevitable to be distracted or exciting. However, I still found that this flawed fright spot was strangely attractive and entertaining. The big poofy hairdos, a dumb music assembly sequence, bad timely fake rare (including the ubiquitous hand on the shoulder gag!), A scene on a glittering video game arcade, kids nice smoking pot and the hilarious dumb teen snake ( "nerdle brain"!?) gives this picture a particularly sweet 80-year-old charm. Hal Trussell's beautiful, polished cinematography (I particularly dug the smooth slip Steadicam tracking shot), Bob Summers haunting but funky hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, and Tom Burman's amazing ghoulish makeup f / x is all on the sniff. The eternal Adam West of TV's Batman fame only takes up space in nothing secondary. The mausoleum allows for an impressive and disturbing main location. The great final with a bunch of scary bodies that pop out of their coffins and float over, qualifies as a wonderful macabre shock set. Certainly, this baby is definitely not an unfair unhealthy jewel, but it still delivers very pleasant and varied cheesy fun.
