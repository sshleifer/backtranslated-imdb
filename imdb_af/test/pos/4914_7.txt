A good performance by Vittorio Mezzogiorno and a masterful by Jean-Hugues Anglade decorate this strange story of lust, desire and alienation in France. The work of the two main artists is striking - subtle, intense and passionate. Unfortunately, the writing is deliberately turgid and sordid, and the overall effect leaves one with a dead spirit. However, those who value good quality can appreciate appreciating the courageous work of the leaders in this often difficult movie tour of the Gaul, low life. <br /> <br />
