Captured this movie as one of a five-for-$ 5 deal from a local video store, and that was a pleasant surprise. It's a collection of four related stories built around four kids who just had a car wreck and are waiting for someone to pick them up. They tell each other these stories to kill time, and are sometimes frightened by flashing light and funny noises that all come in an O. Henry esque end that delighted me. A real discovery. Blood (and much of it), breasts and cattle all pull it all out ... Jacinda Barrett is the price of admission alone. This one is a custodian - Jim Bob says it's going out. <br /> <br /> Strangely, "Pumpkinhead" was also one of our five choices, and IMDB recommends it to anyone who likes "Campfire Tales". I'll follow up as soon as I get the chance to sit and watch. Joyeux Samhain!
