In a movie that is so successful, it is difficult to exclude one factor. All departments work in a perfect trade union to create the most moving human drama ever put on film. <br /> <br /> Production is a tribute to the ensemble efforts of writers, manufacturers, role players and crew members. To name but a few, the wonderful score of Hugo Friedhofer is a subliminal wonder, the subtle but striking photography by Greg Toland. William Wyler's amazingly effective direction combines all with an ideal role to create American classics. <br /> <br /> The DVD format version is a special surprise to view. What a pleasure to see "The best years of our lives" so beautifully preserved for generations to enjoy.
