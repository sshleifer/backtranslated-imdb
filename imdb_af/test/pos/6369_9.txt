As a fan of Dan Aykroyd I watched this movie when it was recently shown on TV in the middle of the night. I didn't expect much, so it came as a great surprise that I loved so much. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie Dan Aykroyd likes to love. An opportunity for him to "ham up" and not take things too seriously. If you loved him in The Blues Brothers or Ghostbusters, you'll know what I mean, and you'll be wise to give up the Couch Trip. <br /> <br /> Aykroyd's Avid fans will also have fun getting all the little links to his other movies into the script! <br /> <br /> I can't describe this movie without spoiling you, so all I can do is read it out. I can't afford this movie high enough, and it should be time for a DVD release !!
