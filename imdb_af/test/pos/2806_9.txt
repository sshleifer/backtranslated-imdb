I have to say that this film is excellently crafted and holds the ratings as a typical science film! I enjoyed it. It's a sci fi movie, if you want a thrill, watch another channel. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellently manufactured by one of Sci-Fi's best producers, Scot Vandiver! OK, the special effects weren't great, but what a great role! Even more money could be used for bonds, but again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these movies. Movies like Mission Impossible and Braveheart are great, but they are not Sci fi movies. Sci fi produces excellent movies such as Sabretooth, Alien Hunters, etc. Well. done .. watch them out!
