George Hilton doesn't really cut me like Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood, but it's a wonderful outing for him. Basically, the Django / Man rips with No Names and does a damn good job. The opening order of this gem is a classic, and cat n mouse games that follow is a pleasure to watch. Fans of the genre will be in heaven.
