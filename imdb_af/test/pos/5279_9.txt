Miyazaki has been doing his mojo since the 70's and it's just recently that his films made it through Disney and American fans about his great talent. Ponyo is no exception. Although some of his other movies are a little more accessible to American audiences, some may find this one a bit on the fence similar to "Japanese" in his presentation. For the same reason, Pom Poko is VERY "Japanese" and doesn't make much sense to American audiences, as well as * some * elements of Ponyo. This should not detract from reading this fun movie of growth, hope and friendship. <br /> <br /> What is good is Miyazaki's very comprehensive and magical animation and story that contains elements of wonder and fantasy. Along with its distinctive use of character development, it often uses girls and women as main characters. He pushes a little out of Ponyo from his zone, because the main character is a little boy living with his mother in a small town near the sea, while his father is on the high seas. Although not lonely, Sosuke is just like any other curious boy who loves adventure and allure of the sea. Similar to Spirited Away, we see the different worlds of man and sea life and I feel that Miyazaki is trying to draw the viewers attention to the great and undiscovered nature of things that live under the sea and our acceptance of them and things. is different. <br /> <br /> I managed to see the caption version of this past year and was happy with the story and plot. Miyazaki claimed that "this is my last movie" for many years, but shortly after Spirited Away he gave us Howl's Moving Castle. Ponyo is definitely proving that Miyazaki has not kept his tracks and remains the most creative, animated movies of all time entertaining, innovating and pioneered. Watch Ponyo with an open mind and a hint of the fantasy and imagination of children and you'll be transported back when fireflies and secret jars are more important than boring adult stuff and eating your vegetables.
