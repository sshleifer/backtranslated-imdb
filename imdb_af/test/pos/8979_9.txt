I love Tom Hanks and he is one of the few actors who will draw me into the theater, regardless of any reservations I may have regarding the film. I'm worried that Mr. Hanks return to "light comedy" as it is the arena where he made the transition from TV to movie - remember "Big"? Well, "Charlie Wilson's War" is not light comedy. It is political satire, and highly written political satire on it. The script is the star of this film, and the word record by Aaron Sorkin is the best this year. <br /> <br /> Mike Nicols keeps the whole escapade together and delivers a very fast 90-minute movie (timing is all in the comedy, and nothing is ever funny when dragging it). Nicols's choice of sets and lighting is also reminiscent of the '70s and' 80s TVs, a move that deliberately used the piece over time. <br /> <br /> Returning to the use of modeling and stock photography on Digital Special Effects also increases the retro look and credibility. Note the production designers in your choice of stock footage: I know the difference between an F-16 and a MiG, and a Bell and a Hind. But it can also be part of the joke. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in Philadelphia. It was interesting to watch and listen to the audience. NO historical references to their own history. History tends to repeat because the repeaters have forgotten what happened the first time. <br /> <br /> Kudos to both mr. Hanks and that chameleon Phillip Seymore Hoffman. Sorkin's script is created by these actors, and the entire production team is at the top of their game. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
