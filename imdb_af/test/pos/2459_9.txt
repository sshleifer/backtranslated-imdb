<br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez takes the wonderful play HOMEFRONT and makes it an engaging movie. <br /> <br /> The Home War has a particularly strong roll - everything looks deep in their characters. The acting here is TOP NOTCH! <br /> <br /> Credit should also go to director Emilio Estevez. The visual transitions between past and present were ultra smooth. The noise effects during the combat scene were chilling and effective at the voltage. <br /> <br /> Remove all the Vietnam elements from the story, and still there will be interesting characters with the good and bad of the full range of family dynamics. (A viewer can see this point more clearly by remembering from the beginning the "pictures of the old photo" when the rest of the movie is watched.) <br /> <br /> As a movie I have the WAR found AT HOME to be more direct and up-to-date than BIRTHED ON 4 JULY. A good effort - almost a 10. <br /> <br />
