This review contains MILD SPOILERS, but not enough to spoil the story. <br /> <br /> Watched Nihon Chinbotsu (Sink or Japan or Japan Zinc, depending on where you live), recently a remake of the 1970s movie of the same name, which was itself based on Sakyo Komatsu's best-selling novel. This movie is a jewel of Japanese movie-making. It appears that Japan is sinking due to the subduction of a tectonic plate to the west. The Americans predict it will happen in the 40-year period, but Dr. Tatokoro (a seemingly 'crazy' scientist) will happen in less than a year. The Japanese government is not so convinced, but draws up a disaster evacuation plan and forms a new D1 team to deal with the crisis. While on a trip to China to negotiate evacuation plans, the Japanese prime minister was murdered and the cabinet was panicked. The D1 team is handed over to deal with most issues, led by the newly elected Minister of Crisis Management, Saoro Takamori (Dr Tokokoro's ex-wife). Instead of dr. Tatokoro advises and he plans to blow astronomically large holes under Japan to prevent the zinc process. Japan will soon have to negotiate with different countries and persuade them to accept Japanese refugees. Soon it appears that many countries are reluctant to accept more because of the sudden influx of Japanese in their country and the chaos that follows (if ever it happens, I hope ito Misaki will be safe ... she can always stay me ... hey). The scenes of evacuation are really well done, showing the devastation, suffering and desperation that civilians have to face in such disastrous times. And the many faces of man's surface, arrogance, selfishness, bribery, bravery, cowardice ... <br /> <br /> It's a very well made movie. The storytelling is solid, with an engaging story and wonderful play. Dr. Tadokoro (played by Toyokawa Etsushi) is really well done, depicting a divorced and often mad scientist. His frustration and worries were very visible and that is a very good thing. Reiko (played by beautiful Shibasaki Kou) is also well-played, and has the most memorable line-up in the whole movie (watch it out) and I want her to have a nice play. She plays the love interest of Toshio Onodera (played by Tsuyoshi Kusanagi of SMAP). Oh, I almost forgot ... she really has very long hair ~ And there is also a subtle but background love story that is well written and if there is anything that the Japanese do well, it is love stories ... <br / > <br /> One thing that makes this movie interesting is the technical explanation of the events that occur, and if you are interested in geography, you will have a very good time (I know I have ... hehe). I can see that they have largely gone to make this film's theory credible, and the first few graphical representations and explanations are quite well done (although you have to excuse the Japanese famous Engrish. <br /> <br /> OK, Now about the consequences (it's all about the effects, isn't it?). After seeing the movie with awe, I have to say that this movie has special effects that are on some (or even better) with some Hollywood productions The volcanic eruptions ... the massive earthquakes ... destruction ... tsunamis ... explosions ... everything is done wonderfully .. The opening scene is so cool, the 1st earthquake gets you surprised, mountains fall, the destruction because of volcanic eruptions you make a bit ... to actually see Mount Fuji heated is a wonder ... then you see Shibuya fall to the ground ... it's so sad! But what I felt was one of the best scenes was the giant tsunami scene, which sees that scared operations have failed and people have gone nowhere and no hope of holding on ... the end scene also deserves a lot of money. If you like effects, you'll love this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... every good movie has a good song behind it. The seriously addictive "Keep Holding U" sung by the super-cute and adorable SunMin is a duet with Kubota, and it's just nice. I really like the movie and it shows that whatever disasters we hit, our love and strength will keep us. The ramptonies are treated with orchestral music and sometimes silence (a Japanese specialty) and really give a sense of chaos to the destruction on the screen. Oh, and did I mention it's a really, really, VERY WIDE screen? Okla, go on and on about this movie. Yes, I loved it and hope to look again ... It has plots, but it's all excusable because it was just a wonderful popcorn movie. Not perfect, but really good. I give it a 9 out of 10. I'm happy to say that the most expensive film in Japanese history is also one of their best. If you haven't watched it, you really should ... today it's a MUST WATK!
