In 1858 Tolstoy wrote it in his diary: "The political is not compatible with the artistic, because the former must be one-sided." This idea of ​​a great thought applies to the USA The Movie. The film can be read by those with a close focus as a 90-minute grind by Bush, Cheney et. al. as well as a rip of America as an out-of-control imperialist force that will eventually be destroyed by its own folly and thirst for power. The more overt viewer will take note of the repetitive images and themes that make this DVD a will for postmodernist thinking, as the main character is enclosed in pieces and pieces by repetitive footage of the natural world as opposed to man-made constructions; towers, roads, video monitors, radio, vehicles. Above all, the ominous threat of wars that will already be confused. War and rumors of the war are created, destroyed and recreated on the screen, in our conscious world and in our unconscious mind.
