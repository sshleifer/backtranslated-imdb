I have never read about (or even seen the silence of) six-man British comedy group The Crazy Bende, but my positive experiences with their contemporaries Will Hay and Arthur Askey - and especially Graham Greene's high praise of the FROZEN LIMITS himself The Funniest English picture still produced ... can compare it to SAFETY LOADS AND THE GENERAL ") - featured me with the bony R2 DVDs of this and their subsequent movie GASBAGS (1941, below), both released earlier this year is with virtually no fanfare. <br /> <br /> A British Western is a rarity, but a British West ghost is still rare (CARRY ON COWBOY [1965] was still about 25 years away). Incidentally, after the Silent classics mentioned by Greene, it seems that the film was more clearly convicted of the GOLD RUSH (1925) and WAY OUT WEST (1937). Moreover, it also plays like a variation on the "Sprook White" And The Seven Dwarfs' fairy tale (which has just been revealed on the screen via Walt D isney's animated masterpiece) and where the seventh member is played by ancient comic and regular Will Hay foil Moore Marriott; the gang actually calls a pretty heroine Eileen Bell through that name and there is even an amusing sequence with the six of them preparing to go to bed and whistle the dwarf song from the Disney movie! <br /> <br /> Six comedians (three sets of comedy duos: Flanagan & Allen, Nervo & Knox and Naughton & Gold) can be the largest group of films on film. Although not all of their personalities appear here: my favorites were big Bud Flanagan (look a bit like Jim Backus), straight man Chesney Allen and moustached, wheezing Teddy Knox; Bald Charlie Naughton, however, often took the spotlight - as he is the one the other one always seems to be. Yet, it is Marriott who steals the film from its very first scene - where he strives to personalize every official in the fake theater of a ghost town! A very young Bernard Lee is also known as the villain of the piece. <br /> <br /> The Ore routine between Flanagan and Allen actually expects Abbott and Costello's well-known "Who's On First?" (The film is actually hinged on a lot of wordplay for his humor - which doesn't necessarily travel, especially at this stage). Nevertheless, there are several hilarious empires throughout - some of them even brought tears to my eyes: the opening scene where the gang is driven by a group of malicious creditors; dress up as Indians after hitting the Yukon; the gang's rage to make everyone rich with the same piece of gold; they all embody the Sleepwalking Marriott to confuse the villains (a gag that may have originated in the Marx Bros' hilarious mirror order in DUCK SOUP [1933]); the spot-on theater sketch that picks up fun on high melodramas; The surrealistic moment when the villains are pursued, one of the gang climbs a staircase that is part of the painted scenery in the theater; and especially at the end when a band of singer-made police gallop was ever so slow at the gang's salvation (despite the fact that they were being eaten by the increasingly impatient Ranger hero). <br /> <br /> The thin soundtrack and the delusional nature of The gags made it difficult for me to sometimes get all the jokes - subtitles would have been welcome in this case. The Crazy Gang has made only five films - the first two are also well regarded, OKAY FOR SOUND (1937) and ALF'S BUTTON AFLOAT (1938), and a much later reunion (though Allen has bowed at this time due to poor health) and was replaced by Eddie Gray, LIFE IS A CIRCUS (1960, led by Val Guest, who also bought both gang films I bought, as well as some of the previously mentioned Hay and Askey vehicles!).
