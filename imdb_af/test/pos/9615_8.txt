The skeleton of the story is that the main character has to win a public high-stakes kungfu tournament. The flesh of the story consists of many battles, a love triangle, betrayal, rivalry and revenge. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to this story. The main character is very attractive as a leveled, lighted and very difficult country boy. A good versus bad movie is just as good as the villains and the main villains are tough and clever, not to be ugly, boring and annoying. <br /> <br /> If there is one weakness, it is the scene where the fianc√© of the main character imagines her and the lead actor running towards a flower field and hugging each other when they meet. I thought I watched The Sound of Music for a second and almost lost hope for the movie. Fortunately, the movie recovered quickly with a battle scene.
