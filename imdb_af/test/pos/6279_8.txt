It's like something I've never seen before. It cracked me all the time, I don't think there was one scene I didn't laugh at. It's about a girl from the country in the south going to a big town for college. At school she was friends with the RA over the hall. When she realizes that he has no family to go to Thanksgiving, she invites him to come home with her. Rabecca and her family and her serious boyfriend all come out one night and Becca realizes what her boyfriend is going to do ... Suppose. She encourages Cral to do something so he gets up and shouts something ... Sorry, but you're too late. I already asked Becca to marry me a few weeks ago and she said yes. All this changes into Chaos. Please look at these classics, it's totally worth it. I swear.
