It doesn't matter whether the lion is totally babies, but there are many girls who are so beautiful and warm, but they seem to be so naughty. This movie is not Oscar-type movie, but at least it has a good view of how life is for young people or for 'real' people. It made us laugh and learn to accept others who they really are. This film represents the real world and what really matters.
