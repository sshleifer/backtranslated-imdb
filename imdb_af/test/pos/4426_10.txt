I just came back from the view of this academy-nominated doctor, and I was thoroughly touched and interested in exploring the works of these fellows I have never heard before. Of course, I am someone who is enchanted with beautiful architecture, so I realize others won't mind. <br /> <br /> We can only think of a few more visionaries in Philadelphia in the late 60's, when Kahn plans were a possibility, which would be a wonderful city center. If you are wondering if you will see more of the Bangladesh building at the beginning of the film, be patient because there will be the climax of the film at the end. <br /> <br /> His son's personal discoveries in the process of making this movie are very interesting, sometimes touching, and even funny. There is one of the most crazy anti-visionary rations ever trapped on the camera. <br /> <br /> To round off the good points of this document is a touch with musical score with some excellent, expressive string music. And expressiveness is an important point in Kahn's architecture. The points made by other architects about the spiritual nature of matter, and how Kahn's buildings brought it out, tie the overall experience of this movie together.
