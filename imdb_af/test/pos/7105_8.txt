The last of the successors, who do not count Abbott and Costello, meet Frankenstein, who was more or less a ghost. This time count Dracula (John Carridine) takes the middle stage to a cure for his vampirism from a friendly doctor (Onslow Stevens). Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) also appears in search of a cure. The good doc succeeds in healing Larry's werewolfism, but Dracula pushes the doctor and ends up polluting his blood and makes the good doctor a mad lunatic.oh and all this time, great Franky (Glenn funny) lies on a table in anticipation of its electricity solution so that it can cause some devastation. It was kind of a short movie, about 70 minutes and a little change, but the action is there and the big actors are there too. Lionel Atwill appears as a police inspector. Here are some trivia's. Lionel will appear in Frankenstein's son, Frankenstein's ghost, Frankenstein meets the wolfman and Frankenstein's house. and then this one. If there was another in the series, they added the creature of the black lagoon to the rule. I give home from Dracula 8 out of 10.
