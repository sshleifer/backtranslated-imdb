Of course, for those who are unfamiliar with Alisdair Sims, he is definitely the Scrooge of all their Christmas Carol movies. (Me? I think I'm really bad. I didn't actually see the darn thing). I think those who have seen Christmas Carol and are so accustomed to his character can be The Bells of St. Trinians rather surprising find. You see, in this movie, Sims has two roles. One, he is playing a much better, and in the other, he is dragging as a chief for a private girl school! Once you get it through your thick skull, this movie offers great pleasure. The plot deals with the way the school deserves money through a horse race. It's actually a little more complicated for the little kids to handle, but I think they'll be busy with their fianc√©, and with the horses it really should be noticed. The adults can also get rid of all the thick accents thrown around. But again, the story is pretty light, the action is crazy and frenetic, because one is really noticed. PS, the kids look like they come from the Eloise school of gift.
