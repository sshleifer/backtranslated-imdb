I only saw this movie in the mid-80's and thought it was a funny movie. As I grew older, I watch this movie for various reasons. I like to watch it when I feel sad / nostalgic for my "lost youth". I was a teenager (14) at the time of the release of this movie, so I can identify with many of the same problems / dilemmas the campers / CITs have in this movie. I enjoy seeing the clothes worn at this time and hearing the same old urban legends as they were told on the overnight canoe trip. The film is also full of funny one linen. I recommend this movie to anyone who was a teenager in the late 70's to early 80's.
