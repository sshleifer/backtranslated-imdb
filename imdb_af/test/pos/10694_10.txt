It's an active movie that feels very relaxed and relaxed every time I see it. The film (short of its conclusion) shows that in the light of extreme chances it is still possible to overcome. <br /> <br /> This movie is very refreshing and may be banned at any moment. Get a copy of it before the thought police burn every copy they can get. They don't want you to have hope for the future, or to think you have a chance. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Political Correctness should not suppress it, it will be an excellent movie to release on DVD. Such a release may include interviews with the author and director, and related goodies. I'm sure it'll sell copies, and I'll be one of the first to buy it. <br /> <br /> - Decrease
