I saw this movie again, I believe for the sixth time. I will undoubtedly see it many more times. It is one of the most brilliant French films ever made. Although the film is mysterious, it is even more mysterious that happened to writer and director Gilles Mimouni. For ten years he hasn't made a movie yet, and that was his only one. The story and performance of this ingenious film is perfect, and it is clear to pay tribute to both Hitchcock and Buster Keaton. The split-second timing of the movements is just as carefully controlled as the scene where the side of a house on Keaton falls into 'Steamboat Bill Junior', and he is not just killed by the thumb. In this movie, people are pushing and turning each other and leaving each other indifferent, and if they were one second off, they would have collided. So, the storyline runs a coincidence of accidental events to such an extent that you can't even turn off a millisecond of the screen, or you'll miss something critical. The haunting, deliberate repetitive music of Peter Chase recalls Hitchcock's Vertigo, and the whole movie has the same ominous quality, but while Hitchcock had one wife, two women, Mimouni had two women one woman and reversed plot structure. There are references to other Hitchcock movies, but it is 'Vertigo' which is central to the inspiration of this movie. The theme seems superficial to be obsessive love, but the film really is about the magic of everyday accidental events, the invisible threads behind the tapestry, the unspeakable. Everything is hyper-charged with passionate love and desire, but the desire spans its object and strives for something behind and beyond the object. Therefore, it is so easily transferable from Lisa to Alice, when it is realized that it is Alice that is more mysterious than Lisa, and that is Alice who truly embodies the Eternal Mystery. The film was finally made by Romane Bohringer. She is so fascinating that she shoots out Monica Bellucci, which is actually something to pull off, as Bellucci is a knockout beauty, while Bohringer calls the English plain. However, even at this early stage, Romane Bohringer has mastered more than the art of "personality rule", by which beautiful girls fall by the way and are not noticed, because Romane is so fascinating that you cannot look her long enough even to watch the beautiful girls and you just end up thinking of her. Most of us remember, I'm sure, her father, Richard Bohringer, is lying in a bath that listened to the opera in the movie "Diva" many years ago. I want Romans rather than Richard to lie in a bath, but it looks like there is a genetic secret to being fascinating, because Richard Bohringer is also spell binding, and he is not even a woman. Romane seems to be able to become Anna Magnani when she is much older, which means she'll get an Oscar if someone can just write another 'Rose Tattoo' to her. The girl has so much passion in her, she can ignite the signals. Wouldn't it be great if she and Julie Delpy had teamed up? This film made wonderful use of Paris locations. But where is this 'square in Luxembourg'? It looks like a Square Furstenburg to me. Maybe I missed something. I have to watch the movie six more times, just to study the accuracy of the timing and beyond who brushes, and make sure I have it right. The whole thing is like ten giant simultaneous chess games blindfolded by a grandmaster. How exciting this is all! Romane, you can look through my window anytime! Mimouni, come over, let's discuss impossibilities, unlikely things, coincidence, synchronicity, everything that's going on is invisible and how it affects the visible effects. And again, here we embody the spirit of Breton's novel 'Nadja' in a wonderful French artwork. More! More! More!
