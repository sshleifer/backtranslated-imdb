This weekend I watched Cold Mountain and the English Patient again. The former is a civil war melodrama about Inman (Jude Law), a Confederate soldier who leaves the army to return to Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), a girl he almost knows. Both films are lovingly directed by Anthony Minghella who does an exceptional job. Although Cold Mountain is very good, it could be a good movie with the right decisive and less perfect backwoods dialogue. <br /> <br /> Romantic epics need a convincing heroine. The English Patient had Kristin Scott Thomas who was perfectly thrown to the clever, attractive and beautiful Katherine Clifton. The biggest problem with Cold Mountain is Ada, who looks foolish and foolish and lacks quality, believing that Inman can be obsessed with one kiss. As an actress, Kidman, has a limited range, she usually plays strict women facing conflict with stoism. Kidman was also too old to play the general and love's interest in love. The film needs a young actress who could play fun, warm and vulnerable. For someone suspected of suffering and near famine, she was ridiculously well fed and over-dressed. Kidman was so impeccably cared for she had made every scene for three hours. Michele Pfieffer could have played the part perfectly in her younger days. Even Natalie Portman would have been an improvement. <br /> <br /> Renee Zelleweger was more appropriate, but her animated performance chewed the scenery, but perhaps she was trying to compensate Kidman. Jude Law was in his own silent film in the Odysseus role, but played his part well. Ray Winstone was excellent as the London / Southern villain. <br /> <br /> During the Civil War, people were probably not very well-trained according to today's standards and perhaps they were talking in monosyllabies. But if you look at BBC adjustments to Dickens, Austen or Mrs. Gaskill, everyone is worded. Maybe it's unrealistic, but it will improve my entertainment.
