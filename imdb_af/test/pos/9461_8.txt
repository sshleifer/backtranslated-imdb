I think a person will be well advised to read or see (I prefer to read) "Twelfth Night" before she sees if she sees "The Man's". The movie is good on its own, but comparing the two, and looking for jokes, makes it much nicer. Shakespeare was inspired by others. I think he will give an inch. <br /> <br /> Harld Bloom said in "Shakespeare, The Invention of the Human" that most people should be locked up in "Twelfth Night". Malvolio, the person Malcolm is based on, is for no good reason. People in "She is the man" are in contrast healthy. For example, Duke Orsino is much more leval than the Duke of Orsino. He also shows that a man can have feelings without being gay. He shows a lot of self-control. <br /> <br /> It's a teenage comedy (a clean one), so it doesn't have the dark edges of the play. For example, in the play, Olivia grieved the death of her brother. In the movie she was dumped. <br /> <br /> If you like Sir Andrew and Sir Toby in the play, they don't have the same attention in the movie. <br /> <br /> The in-jokes are very fast. The hairdresser Pauls's name was given once. This is Antonio. Many people who have read the play say that Antonio has more love for a man than just friendship. Deep love between men was recorded in those days. Some see a sexual side out of it. Homosexuality was illegal. <br /> <br /> The only line of the play I caught is where Duke Orsino appreciates the coach greatly during the soccer game. In the play it is said by Malvolio, stating Mary).
