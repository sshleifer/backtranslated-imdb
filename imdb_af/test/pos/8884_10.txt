Had it with the one who raised you since you were young? You just want to get her out of your life? That woman is your mother. You must respect her, you must honor her, whether she is ill or good. But it can get worse in times. Especially when she gets very offensive. So Owen (Danny DeVito) had to handle "Gooi Momma Fron The Train". His mom (Anne Ramsey, 1929-88) is one of the worst. He tries his best to be a writer, and she is all grateful. Call him a "clumsy poop", a "larda $$", and "fat" and "stupid". For his friend, Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), he has his own wife, his former wife. She tried to discredit him. So what did Owen do? Press her overboard. What does he do? Help the favor back, get rid of Mrs. Lift! In the kitchen scene I liked where Owen Larry, "Cousin Patty", called. And Momma said, "You don't have a cousin Patty!" and Owen shouts: "You lied to me!" and El Cabongs Larry with the frying pan. Then come the fun part when they come on the train and try to kill Momma Lift. It is thwarted, and she kicks Larry off the train. Well, everything back to normal, the ex-wife lives, but Momma kicked the bucket on her own. Perhaps she should have seen the mistakes of her dominant ways. A fun movie this is, and the throw is great. A classic! 5 stars!
