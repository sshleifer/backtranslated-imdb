Take a subject I didn't know much about and make it exciting, why not? It happens that director Robert Altman said back in 1979 he did not believe he had ever made a real film and that he expected one of these kids to ride on skateboards - if he did not break his neck the first movie. Well, I won't be expecting Stacy Peralta, but he's a skateboarder who made a good movie. Of course, he was forced by the nature of the film he made to use existing footage, and it is certainly a good thing that so much archive material exists. Peralta gave it up well with non-ordinary talking photos of his former colleagues as they are today. The whole effect is modern, in the best sense, but it is done. Altman's prediction is not entirely true. What Peralta has already done, however, is enough of the energy of those heavy days that we can appreciate how modern skateboarding has been invented by the Z-Boys. This is all right. I recommend "Dogtown."
