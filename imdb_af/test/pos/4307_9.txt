Do you like "Dead Man Don't Wear Plaid"? What about "Top Secret" and "A Chorus Line"? Well, Müllers Büro is a fantastic blend of all three, so unlikely. Very Funny "Tongue in Cheek" Movie Noir Homage With Beautiful Songs And Great Dancing. You should have some strange humor for this movie, but it's worth seeing. I voted nine. If the end were a little more logic, it would have got a ten. That's how good that movie is.
