This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in the history of the theater. Seeing this movie, we can only notice in retrospect that the world cinema in the 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgy, such a strong and adequate use of sound-image mounting and almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life. Cinema wasn't just one form of art then. It was much higher than ordinary life, and many people were hoping to live the tragic war. It is said that even Picasso shifts and shouts is that such an artwork can only appear once in 100 years! Public at that time was also different. I read that after seeing Kurosawa's "Ikiru (Live)" in his first edition, the young couple quietly told each other, "This is a good movie, isn't it?". I think the contemporary theater, though technically developed and has opened a new narrative perspective, has lost the most important dependence on the audience. Cienma once was the most popular art of and, unlike modern visual arts and contemporary music, millions of people have hope and ideals. In this regard, "Letyat zhuravli" must always be in the pantheon of classical artists, such as "City Light", "Ikiru" and "La Strada".
