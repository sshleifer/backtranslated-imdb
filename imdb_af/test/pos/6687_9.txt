Usually I don't like movies with / about strangers, but K-PAX is different. The actors are big in the movie - especially Kevin Spacey has played his character breathtakingly! The movie never falls at a lower level - the tension is always in the movie and you absolutely want to know how it ends, what about Prot ... You have to think very much about the movie about the movie, because there is " some open questions ... Is Robert Porter Prot or Prot only used by Robert Porters' body as a means of transportation. How can he see UV light and how can he know so much about astrology. But everyone can make their own end and decide what he wants to believe. Very good movie with excellent Kevin Spacey!
