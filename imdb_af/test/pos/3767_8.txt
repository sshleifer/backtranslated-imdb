Who are the people staring at this thing? Never heard of them !! But this is one of the funniest comedies I run. This must win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd starts with dr. Jeykl, his powder sniff and is in a sex enemy. Early in the movie, he is being pursued by a libido-driven nurse in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde, who accepted the award, laughed for years. Oh yes ... and the "Busty Nurse" is Cassandra Peterson, who has become Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. <br /> <br /> If you like the Mel Brooks classic movies (Blazing Saddles, etc.), I suspect you want this one. <br /> <br /> Damn, you can't get it. DVD everywhere. <br /> <br /> It's now available on DVD !!!!! Good thing DVDs don't wear out !!!!!
