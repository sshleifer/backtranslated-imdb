Hysterically painful; Maybe the kind of movie Chekhov would have made if he made movies. What is really funny is that the two cousins ​​have so much in common (many descriptions of their relationship on this site are dead wrong). <br /> <br /> What is really funny and uncomfortable about these characters is that they just "don't talk to each other - or anyone else! It's awful. If you're ever too embarrassed, worried, self-centered or just scared to talk to someone (and who doesn't?), You will definitely see yourself in this movie. And it won't be nice. <br /> <br /> It holds a mirror to the audience and says, "If you don't like what you see, change it".
