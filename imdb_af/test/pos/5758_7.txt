I searched this movie for so long, I saw it, I saw it when I was younger and loved it. After my second show I still loved it and I still do. <br /> <br /> It's a love / hate movie, if you like the bottom, the little ones, the comic book, then you'll find this funny. If you don't like that kind of humor, don't bother it. I love this movie and grew up with these comedy programs. For me, this movie is simply their comic genius on the big screen. It's not an award winner in any way, but if you just want a good, healthy stick, that's it! <br /> <br /> The movie does not have the quality of the TV series, and this is usually the case with movies, but it still has enough material to make you laugh, even though many of the jokes are similar to their previous work. . <br /> <br /> Yes, humor is a little childish and not for everyone's taste, but sometimes you just need it in a movie.
