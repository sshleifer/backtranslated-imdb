I only saw APOCALYPSE in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time. I was shocked to see this masterpiece and despite a close competition like FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, this movie is still my best time almost 20 years after I first saw it. <br /> <br /> This leads to the problem of how I can even comment on the movie. I can praise the technical aspects, especially the sound, editing and cinematography, but all have praised these achievements to heaven, while the performances in general and especially Robert Duvall have also been noticed, and all have the sharp images of the Dou Long bridge and mounting the boat moving to the border. <br /> <br /> What about the script? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director, but anyway, he is a genius as writer, as he was a director, I said it was in the past, as if he was in every creative brain his head burned out, but his offering was worth it. In John Milius's original solo concept, we have a script that is as insane and disturbing as the one on the screen, but Coppola's involvement in the screenplay injected a story that reflects exactly the war. See how the script starts with all the jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who would not look in the GREEN TALKS, but the more the story progresses, the more shocking and insane everything becomes, so much so that the time reaches Kurtz outpost while the audience watches another movie the same way the characters were in a different dimension. When Coppola says, "This movie isn't about Vietnam - it's Vietnam" he's right. What began as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid-1960s, led by the film's institution (the Manson trial it is 1970), saw America's view of both the world and itself and of the world view of America. <br /> <This is the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterpiece of theater and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians (What do you have in the Vietnam War, President, done?) if Michael Moore can hope to say in a lifetime. I didn't see the REDUX version, but watch the original print I didn't feel. There was something missing from the story. Like all really good movies, it's very basic. In fact, the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western one where an army officer must locate and kill an apostate colonel leading a advocate war party or a scientific film where a UN killer is a fellow UN soldier leading a resistance movement on Mars, but it is probably Joseph Conrad's original source story <br /> <br /> My favorite movie all the time and it is very fitting that I have chosen this movie to be one thousandth overview at the IMDb
