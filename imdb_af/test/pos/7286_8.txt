It is extremely hard to find a good horror movie anymore, thought this movie was a good thriller. <br /> <br /> Could have had better production values, but what kept me going was the tension and the twists and turns. I had real discussions before I saw this movie (because of the cover). I was afraid it would be excessively bloody and greedy. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Although there are many scary parts, there is also a lot of tension and drama. <br /> <br /> The play in Dead Line was better than you would expect from a micro-budget horror flick. The characters were credible <br /> <br /> The movie is really exciting and pretty scary at moments so it grabs your seat until the end of the credit. <br /> <br /> Due to its production values ​​(the sound is not very good, for example) 8/10.
