this movie has a good background, if you listen to the soundtrack when the cars are driving each other, it sounds like the soundtrack of the movie, you will hear a 4 speed shift and they will call the brake pedal in Roy Schneider car, it's an automatic brake pedal !, I think one of the funniest moments in the movie is when the bad guy Richard Lynch looks at the driver of the car in which they are, as the man is. ....... the rogue man driving the garage is also the man in the first rock movie, rocky's boss. good movie! even when the door is torn from you, the man sitting in the car can only fold the door, the man who helps him out of the car looks like Mr. Brady from the Brady cluster?
