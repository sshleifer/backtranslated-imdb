This low budget crocodile film really delivers the goods. The fact that it was inspired by true events would mean little if you were using a fake crocodile, bad C.G.I. Fortunately, none of the above is involved in this awesome, very realistic movie. The crocodile is real, there is no C.G.I., and the on-location filming takes place in a real Australian swamp. Of course, the actors were inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performances, and they succeed. You can put yourself in trouble, which testifies to how realistic "Black Water" is translated as entertainment. Highly recommended. - NOTE
