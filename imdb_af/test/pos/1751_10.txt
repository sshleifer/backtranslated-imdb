Well, I can be biased if I grew up watching a VHS copy of this movie that is ready to snap and spent the last few hours attending a DVD copy as a birthday party for me father. The movie is so innocent and unrelenting, it suits all ages .... much better than anything Disney ever made (and I worked in the Disney store!). The characters are enjoyable and the award for the best scene is a tie between the disrupted wedding (especially the musical talents of Swat, the fly and Smack the mosquito) and the wonderful nightclub scene. The musical numbers took me another 20 years after I first watched. There is no other movie that I can recommend better while I am a baby, and actually every child I know (thanks to my Hoppity-loving parents) knows this movie many times. It will always get top marks for its wonderful love story, brilliant bad and all originality.
