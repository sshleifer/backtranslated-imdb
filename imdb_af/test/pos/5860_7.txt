This one is about a killer detective who fights some young rich children who can do nothing better than planning and covering a complicated murder. They seem to overshoot the police's seemingly at random. They mock the detective by planting clues and deriving them on a wild goose hunt. this one has a decent plot with some good twists at the end of the movie, Sandra Bullock does a good job in this one as a woman on the edge, not sure of herself and struggling with her inner demons, she doesn't seem to like a man in her life, especially partners, they seem to leave her for some reason. All in all it's not a bad movie, it keeps you guessing the very shocking end.
