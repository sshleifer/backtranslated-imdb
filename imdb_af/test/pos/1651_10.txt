Rififi, directed by Jules Dassin, is in line with the Melville crime photographs (especially Bob le Flameur and to a point Le Cercle Rouge) to be totally focused on story and character and to make sure no word is spoken who did not need, and was before his time. Ionic, it still has some kind of professionalism among its characters, a kind of respect (if not for yourself as for others, a kind of duty) that falls well after World War II in France. His actors are wearing faces for these characters who say, "We know what these guys are about," and from there the story goes off. Maybe it's because I have a bad spot for lift photos, especially where we only see the nuts and bolts (bugs, real physical side) of how a lift is pulled. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with how the actual lift is filmed in today's movies, it's all very fast (ie Snatch), or done in ways we've seen too often. Dassin, like Melville years later, decided to create virtually a silent movie of a heist, sound effects. The tension that builds up in this scene cannot exceed what Melville had in 'Rouge', but at its own level it reaches its own greatness and momentum, and just as important originality as has been done before. There are some close-ups, for example, because the safe is cracked, which marks some of the best I saw in France at the time. An added plus for the film, apart from the larval stage new wave touch on the film, which ultimately makes a bit more modern, is that the story works so well and differently. It gets completely over character at points, and then holds up the tension. The last ten to fifteen minutes is truly miraculous; As with another classic lift photograph of the Asphalt Forest, it's not even the last stop that matters, but all about how much one goes beyond calling, to put humanism on greed. <br /> <br /> You almost wonder in all the excitement of the camera moving at the speed of the trees with the car, that it can only make it. Dassin has a very entertaining and intuitive movie of his genre, with a fine little musical number.
