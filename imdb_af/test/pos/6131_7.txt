It's an amazing story and the most amazing part is that it really happens! If you haven't noticed: it's based on a real story. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoiler) <br /> <br /> Imagine the shock and horror to discover that your own dad once was an SS officer in WW II. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting story and I'm really surprised that the movie is a common 5.3 here on imdb.com. <br /> <br /> my rate: 7
