Susan Fletcher (Hopkins) and her rich father, Simon Fletcher (Henry Stephenson), are worried that their young cousins ​​Joan (Betty Philson) and Katie (Marianna Strelby) are living a bohemian lifestyle in Greenwich Village with their artist John (Milland) the death of their parents (Susan's sister and John's brother). Simon gave up trying to persuade John to take care of him and Susan, and dedicated to private detectives to catch him in unwanted behavior or unemployed people and therefore not care for the children. Susan finally decides to take matters into her own hands and goes to Greenwich Village, which acts as an actress, to obtain and / or persuade information. However, what she discovers is that she doesn't just love the free and artistic lifestyle. John and his friends live and the girls are well excavated, but soon fall in love with John. She is inevitably discovered, and she is faced with the task of persuading everyone on both sides of the conservation debate who belongs to who. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be very short. Current time (70 minutes) was the perfect length to turn this simple yet engaging story. Miriam Hopkins, one of the 1930's 1940 actresses, is delighted with this movie. Her energy, style and healthy beauty really lend him an engaging character, even though you know she's a fast one to the people she quickly befriends. This is the earliest movie I saw, Ray Milland, and he was actually young and non-patrician. (And apparently three years younger than his fellow star) His energy and carefree way in "Wise Girl" was a refreshing change in the performance he touches in his ordinary, darker films. Honestly, although I am not usually a fan of child actors, I really enjoyed the two young girls who played Susan's cousins. They were extremely premature, and were really the gems of the movie. Unfortunately, I can't dig up other movies that one of them was later on, which is a pity because both of them exhibited very natural talent. <br /> <br /> "Wise Girl" was a movie made three years after the Hollywood Code was set, and to some extent it was very clear by the fast, happy ending and the pie in the air pride and ease with which the characters lived. The alleged Bohemian co-operative was actually a terrific runway where the artists lived for free or for trade, and everything is very nicely tied. Luckily it was a light film and the characters were enough to make tours for its fluffiness and short-comings and I could only take "Wise Girl" for what it was; A good old-fashioned love story that was as entertaining as it was. Unfortunately, movies of the romantic comedy / drama genre today are significantly less intelligent and entertaining, or I don't find myself constantly returning to the classics. 10/07
