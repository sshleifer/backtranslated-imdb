After watching the Fingersmith, the characters were just as good in both performances, though Rachael Stirling missed Fingersmith's adaptation. <br /> <br /> The story line was a good thing. choice, the twist and the unraveling of the characters were wonderful! Excellent watch only misses Rachael Stirling! <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the romance of two girls, it's not one of the best movies to watch. <br /> <br /> Tipping The Velvet takes another turn, but just as well. <br /> <br /> Recommend it to everyone!
