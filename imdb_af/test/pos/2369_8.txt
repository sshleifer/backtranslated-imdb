I pasted it to Sundance and had no idea it was a Miike movie. I thought it was just another kung fu movie. <br /> <br /> Then I saw things like the dancing sax player <br /> <br /> that sounded like an Oriental Gato Barbieri, and I knew it had to be Miike. <br /> <br /> I missed the opening opening credits and had to wait until the end of the closing credits to see Miike's credits. <br /> <br /> So far he hasn't disappointed me yet. Audition, City of Lost Souls, Ichi the Killer and the Happiness of the Katakuries were all good movies, and now I found out that it was the third in a trilogy. <br /> <br /> Unlike Miike and Todd Solendz there is no one currently making interesting movies.
