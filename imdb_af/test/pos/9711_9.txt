Where do I start? I sat down, ready to laugh and I was blown away! This movie is just perfect, it is indescribable. Jackass Number Two in all honesty was coarser, more obscene, more beautiful and more entertaining than the first. It was just what I needed tonight. <br /> <br /> There are so many scenes in this movie that will let you say, "Oh me! No!" or "Ouch!" Perfectly mastered and set up, every event and scene was pre-coordinated and made it even more perfect. I loved it every minute! I'm just going to say there was even a scene where it was necessary to censor certain footage to prevent an NC-17 rating! It was so hilarious that they had to put it anyway! Surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> 9/10. Incredibly funny, don't be sorry!
