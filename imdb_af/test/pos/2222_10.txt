One of the funniest movies I've ever seen in theater in the early 70's is unfortunately just a few times on TV. This movie must be released on video. These are sellers at its slimmest, slimiest best as a cricket hospital administrator. Great role, fantastic movie. If someone has a good VHS copy, I'd like to buy it.
