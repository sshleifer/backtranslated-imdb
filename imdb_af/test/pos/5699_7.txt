This exploration of a unique decade in the American cinema begins with the fall of one sick, out-of-touch rich and ends with the unstoppable emergence of another, also related to escapism and cash receipts. Meet the new boss, the same as the old boss. Or, as Peter Fonda observed in Easy Rider, "We blew it." In between, from Bonnie and Clyde to Star Wars, the young Turks (some under the guerrilla supervision of Roger Corman) crawled to produce some of the greatest artworks of the 20th century. While the story is already known to Peter Biskind's easy riders, the Demande and LaGravenese drivers, Raging Bulls, are less worried than providing a platform for the filmmakers and stars themselves. <br /> <br /> All of Martin Scorsese to Francis Ford Coppola and Julie Christie are interviewed and a timetable of well-edited cuts puts the decade in a socio-cultural and economic context. If their responses are self-explanatory, they are also highly quotable, funny and revealing, making it a cinephile's wet dream. Director William Friedkin reveals how the original The Exorcist poster should contain a little girl's hand with a bloody crucifix and the legend "For God's sake, help her" before complaining. Former Warner Bros. chief John Calley recalled that when he first saw Robert De Niro in Mean Streets, he believed that Scorsese received a psychopath's day release for the shooting. Fortunately, a certain amount of harsh perspective crept into the mix, as expected from a politically motivated, conscious-extended generation; Hopper emphasizes "there is also a lot of real crap in." Julie Christie notes that the 1970 American cinema was not a good time for women. But if Demme responds with a spoonful of soup for women's movies - short cuts by Alice Do not live here, they shoot horses, they do not and Klute - we are quickly withdrawn back to the usual male wall-to-wall competition. <br /> <br /> Moving tough, socially-conscious movies to non-risking people like Jaws for 'Nam-tiredy, fantasy-craving audiences is also documented, though a little rushed. But kudos too, for the inclusion of lesser singing, but equally appropriate films such as Panic In Needle Park and Joe. "We weren't attractive," mice Bruce Dern said. "But we were f ****** interesting."
