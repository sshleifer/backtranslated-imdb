This is the first movie I've ever owned on video, and 14 years later I still have the same copy. Elizabeth Taylor was like twelve shining as ever later in life, Mickey Rooney gave Mi Taylor real dimension, and Donald Crisp was as Brown as ever. The wonderful Anne Revere, like Mrs. Brown, was the wisest woman in the world. After nearly 60 years, the warmth, humor and excitement of this film still affect the viewer; We are still laughing at the jokes, root for The Pie, and love Velvet for the spirit and capacity for love she displays. I love it as an adult, just as I loved it as a child. A must have for every family video collection.
