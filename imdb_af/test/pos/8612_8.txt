It is especially difficult for a director to capture movies without becoming precious, innate, dramatic or all three. Breillat demonstrates the instinctive, lizard-brain methods of a female author to exploit a love scene of tearing intimacy from two "cattle" (such as actors called Hitchcock). Her main struggle is with her leading man ("an actor is really a woman"). Although it is of course the leading woman to steal the show. I disagree that it is Breillat's first comedy. "Romance" was hilarious at various points, but I accept that the French sense of humor for foreigners can be elusive; Indeed, decades of IMDb reviewers have not discovered a comedy in Romance. In contrast, Sex Is Comedy, is laughed a lot, mainly by using an actor's prop that goes back thousands of years to Plautus and the ancient Greeks. We wondered, leaving the theater, or Roxane's "beard" was a wig. A beautiful show by Anne Parillaud as Breillat wrestles with her own script, which looks ten years younger than her age.
