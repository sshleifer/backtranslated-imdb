This is a movie that should be considered as an artwork. It is an unaware of love by the Schrader brothers about the life of Yukio Mishima, which is full of true artistic elements. The movie jumps from color to black and white, past to present, fictitious works by Mishima to him. Everyone without having to confuse the least. The only thing that gets me is that the whole movie, with the exception of the narrator's spoken parts, is in Japanese. Another masterpiece that deserves an audience but has not won. Criterion, if you read it, it is a movie that should be released with you as many extras as possible. This movie truley deserves more. 10/10
