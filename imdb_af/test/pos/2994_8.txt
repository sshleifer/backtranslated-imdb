First love. Teen love. We all experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the main players. "Friends" can be regarded as an adaptation of the classic "The Blue Lagoon", originally from 1949, and its remakes of 1980 (the most popular, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While "The Blue Lagoon" places the two young lovers in a desert island, without contact with civilization, "Friends" goes the opposite way and it is sure to be much more true and a harder movie with contemporary audiences . Paul and Michelle, who, for various reasons, try to back their family and the adult world to live together in a small cottage in southern France. If they only have one another and their innocence of children, their friendship develops slowly in much more than they struggle to support themselves in this nice story. This film to this day is controversial as the actors are teenagers and they certainly watch the ages mentioned in the film (15 and 14 1/2). The movie does, however, contain a hint of child molestation, nudity, teen sex depiction and teenage pregnancy. But the real controversy is not the subject, but the fact that Paul and Michelle's love is presented as a natural and healthy relationship. While working well for stranded lovers in a different time and in a desert island, it offers a modern environment many difficult moral issues. Laws that prohibit joint sex between minors are in virtually all countries and the lack of sexual education among teenagers is seen as one of the causes of the increase in unwanted teenage pregnancies and abortions. Is a movie like this one just child pornography or a slap in the face of our own hypocrisy about a modern society that does not cater for teenage parents and laws that are clear against human nature and hormonal development don't go, but is it necessary to prevent child abuse? Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth? These are not easy questions and most of us will feel uncomfortable. As an artistic piece, this movie is really a forgotten and rough gem. The writing progresses with utmost simplicity, although it is juicy, but never punching to set its message, although according to today's standards, it is somewhat slow. Photography is beautiful and it has scenes of great beauty. The actions of the two protagonists range from very terrible in some scenes to wonderfully innocent and credible in others. Pop music, unlike most productions, is now used tastefully and sometimes the lyrics speak the thoughts of the protagonists. Overall, this is a beautiful piece, even if the moral values ​​are not in line with your own.
