A political satire from a comedian (Williams) forced after the discipline of the political campaigns and presidents in the run. But shockingly we win and make a mockery of the office. "Man of the Year" is not the funniest movie or the best, but in small doses it works. Williams again joins Levinson to a hit with 'Good Morning, Vietnam'. The two seem to have a good chemistry and work apart. I don't compare them to Scorsese and DeNiro, but you can get the picture. Although I would not really say chasing and watching the movie in theaters, I would recommend renting it. This movie is a comedy, but also has a good satire. If you want movies like 'Scary Movie 4', it's not for you, make your brain with you to see it. - ***
