Great 1980's Comic Strip comedy in the South West of England. It is a story of sex, drugs, cream tea and sea killing. Adrian Edmondson, French and Saunders, Nigel Planer (hilarious in suit) and Robbie Coltrane play a role. Dennis (Edmondson) tries to impress a girlfriend by boasting that he is involved in a drug deal with over Â£ million. This leads to complications with hilarious results. I'm trying to find the original aspect ratio for this movie, but it doesn't appear under 'Technical Aspects' of the IMDb site. I saw the DVD in the store and it looks like it is in 1.33: 1 (full screen) format. Was the movie shot in this relationship or was it originally a widescreen movie with a pan and scan DVD? It will be helpful to know if I scan pan hate and movies. So come on IMDb. Can you find out for us?
