Naruto's Anime TV series has so far grown into 2 feature-length movie theaters, and a third comes in the summer. <br /> <br /> The first one released in the summer of '04 was a fun adventure with the main characters of Naruto in an exciting adventure. But one has to be blind, deaf and one leg chicken to deny the film's mistakes. While the first was definitely enjoyable, there were many things that could be improved. However, Naruto Movie 2 takes all these aspects and performs on them. <br /> <br /> The action was, in the first place, incredibly cinematic. The lighting, setting and style were three fold as effective as the first film. In the first, we gave basic action, well-animated and choreographed animation, but nothing eyebrows, but this movie's cinematography was exceptional, the use of shadows and lighting that work together to make the action is increasingly intense, many effective and added. power of battle. <br /> <br /> The animation was very good. It's against Disney, but as it is a movie about TV characters, there was nothing exceptional about the character design or detail of the real characters. However, the animation was incredibly humid and realistic. I think they even used twice the number of cells for every second, because there was absolutely nothing jitter about the animation. It was incredibly humid. <br /> <br /> The music ... I think that's where this movie fails. The original composer / conductor for the TV show was used for the film, and I really didn't feel like he was doing such a good job. The music mostly reminded me of many pieces used in old SNES games. The composer is very good, but the synthesizers used for the film could not convey the song very well. However, they did not fail the film at all and added as a good accompaniment to the action. But, except for a few violin and rope pieces at the end and a few choral work, the music did not shine any boundaries or anything special. <br /> <br /> The story was fun. It was a fairly typical storyline for Naruto and was very similar to the first movies, except that it was all that was wrong with the first movie's story and improved. The characters were much more interesting and the way the story progressed was what kept me throughout the film. It made you think that the movie will end in seconds, but then it will continue, but instead of dragging it out, the action and characters still feel fresh and exciting. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a good thing, but however good it may be, it's definitely one for the fans. I enjoyed the movie, but that's because ... I'm a fan! But I can see, as with Final Fantasy's Advent Children, it doesn't look like a movie, but only serves as a fantastic service for the service for half an hour. Although I think this movie serves as a good introduction to the series for current non-viewers, it won't give a full effect to anyone other than those glued to Naruto screens. In spite of all this, it was a fun movie to enjoy disturbing fillers during this depressing period.
