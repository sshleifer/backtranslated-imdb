It's funny because I've read all the reviews on this page after I get this movie and it's either a love or hate it reaction. You will probably also like or hate it too. I think the best movies are those that divide people because of course they have an impact. I'm in the five-star camp because this movie made me a real number and made me come back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was well-tuned when all that happened. Especially Afghanistan and I feel guilty of it. The music by the movie was beautiful. I lost it especially in some of the historical flashbacks. Personally, I thought the sound was wonderful. It seems to me that the soundtrack is composed with speeches, music and the radio so you feel like you're in the RV with Jim, the main character, or in his head. Everything that wasn't on the radio was very clear and everything on the radio sounded like it was really on the radio. Anyway, it's a great DVD that makes me cry.
