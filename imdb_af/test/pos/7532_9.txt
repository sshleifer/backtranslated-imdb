Writing something so wonderful is quite difficult. Actually, it's almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this movie. It's a wonderful story about sex and gender, and it's almost incredible that we don't have to deal with obscene sexual scenes. Feel, this movie is made for people who feel beautifully simple, and just to feel, life in all its complexity. We look at it, and something begins to grow in our minds, even our hearts: it's a pure poem. I watched a few gay movies, and I almost always became very dissatisfied with unnecessary sexual scenes, not because I didn't like scenes of sex, but in general they are so pornographic that I'm forced to think that the director or the producer or author of the script think homosexuality means perversion. Nagisa no Shindobaddo is completely different from that. Three are the main characters. We have Ito, Yoshida and Aihara, two boys and a girl in a strange love triangle. Ito likes his best friend Yoshida, Yoshida likes Aihara and Aihara likes it. Imagine what it can change in unprepared hands? But on the other hand, Hashiguchi makes a wonderful story that goes deep into the philosophy of life, and adds a question to our minds that made me wonder, at the end of the movie: Why? And that's why expanded into several questions inside my brain and inside my heart. The scenes, which are actually sometimes boring, are moments of the most beautiful poem that we can feel, but can't write down completely in words. And maybe we can't understand the question at the end of the movie. I'm sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every piece of it ?? Some people want to understand a movie that is almost dissecting. Others are so accustomed to ordinary American gay movies that can't appreciate the real value of this masterpiece. Look, make your eyes the credit and feel, feel everything, feel yourself, feel the wonderful song. For all this and more, I give a nine. And I just don't give ten, because ten out of ten are perfection. But I confess I almost did it.
