This movie didn't stay exactly in the minds of movie buffs, and it's a crying shame. His spectacular script adaptation had to be Oscar nominations for the great screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond's adaptation, and Ingrid Bergman's flawless performance. It must have been an honor for Goldie Hawn at such a young age to work with Bergman, and look more than a decade younger than her 54 years - fifty-four! When it is on the screen, it flashes positively. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that only looks dated but it actually made me wish I was in the swingin'60s. Hawn's fashions are as tough as Bergman's is chic. (This is a slight mistake - is her character not a bit too much for a gal who still lives with her sister? But then we'll have Ingrid again?) And who doesn't want to go to a nightclub called The Slipped disc? <br /> <br /> The best compliments I can pay for this movie are that it made me somehow nostalgic for a decade I've never seen before, and that made me want more . Speaking of more wants, am I wondering what ever became sexy sexy actor Rick Lenz? (He looks like Griffin Dunne in this movie.) It was his movie debut, and I see no other important roles in his filmography. As far as Goldie Hawn is concerned, she has done so much since then, it's not easy to be impressed, but I can't suggest any other actor in the role. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is based on a play, line delivery may be a bit stale - y but it didn't stop my enjoyment at all. In fact, I'm surprised at how funny it is after more than thirty years. Because this film represents an outdated era, it has unfairly slipped into the consciousness of movie buffs. It is more linked to the era of movies that came before it than the one that followed. But don't stop enjoying the delicacies. Degree: A
