This film embodies the soul of the modern "elite" food culture, even though the film is 17 years old. The standing principle in the movie is: Food is more than just nourishing. It is also a powerful symbol and a medium for culture itself. The main characters literally get drunk on the best wine and food, are inspired by idealistic thoughts and cultures, abandoning their puritanism and passion-denying table manners. Karen Blixens short story uses the difference between Northern Europe and Southern Europe to show their inherently different approaches to food. Since the rigorous and rather boring Scandinavians are fed with "Eros" from the south, the party is getting under way. What are you waiting for? Go see it again .....!
