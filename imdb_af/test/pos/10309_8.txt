I saw Bandit Queen in 2005, more than a decade after it was widespread in India. The language, the harsh treatment and the natural play (by a relatively unknown role for that time) could have been even more shocking at that time for an Indian population who was more familiar with fantasy theater. The film, the film, and Shekhar Kapoor receive a breakthrough award. <br /> <br /> The plot is not quite different from a typical revenge drama made in various forms in India. In fact, there are several fictitious accounts of this particular story itself. The reason it stands out is that it is supposed to be a first person account of someone who has actually gone through all these things, and many others who do not appear on the screen and have survived to tell the story. Survive long enough to see her story at least in a movie. Phoolan Devi didn't live very long after being released from prison in 1994. <br /> <br /> The movie shows on various scores. The cinematography is brilliant. The music is suitable. The throw, many of which became famous names later, is very good. But the script is porridge. Things are moving too fast and in jerks. However, this is understandable, because there are just too many strings to be tied together to make it all coherent. Or maybe I felt it because I read Mala Sen's book, which is a more detailed and better, but of course not as shocking as the visual version of Phoolan Devi's jobs, and allegedly one of the main sources of the film is. . <br /> <br /> There are also factual ambiguities. According to Phoolan Devi, she was not present when the Behmai massacre occurred, and despite claiming that she was Phoolan's dictator account, it was shown that they were taking the mass murder. Then the last scene where Phoolan comes down shows her at the feet of the Chief Minister, while actually surrendering to a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. Only symbolic value, but showing that Phoolan did not want to show servitude to a living, ordinary person. It would have been nice to show the Chief Minister that he has a deal with Arjun Singh, who has remembered a lot, was the CM of Madhya Pradesh. <br /> <br /> But this is little kinky in this exceptionally well-made movie, a scarce jewel to get out of the mainstream Indian film industry, made by a man who was best known for the ultimate masala movie of the late 80's - Mr. India.
