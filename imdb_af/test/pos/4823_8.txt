I honestly found that Wicked Little Things is a very cool and fun horror movie. My friend gave it to me and I really saw it as nothing but a crappy low class gory horror movie. When I watched it, I was wrong it was very cool and very good and while I say it was sometimes unnecessary, and although it may not be the best horror movie ever, it's still good. I thought the acting was very good, especially the girl who plays the mother very credibly and very nice to me). And while it's a little clich√© and over its good. Generally, I have to say if the Afterdark Horror Fest movies aren't your style, then you shouldn't see it, but if you like horror movies or an evil little time than watching Wicked Little Things. 8.0 out of 10 stars
