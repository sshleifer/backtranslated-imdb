James Aaron, a chubby actor living in Chicago, is a man who likes to eat things that are not good for him. It is noticed early, as Dick, a friendly shopping clerk, ordered him to stay away from junk food. Aaron, an actor working in Chicago's second city, is a loving man with no luck in the love department. He still lives with his mother, a thin lady who encourages him to go out and enjoy himself. James has another work in some kind of brutal "Candidate Camera" where people are set up for unusual situations, such as surpriseing a mechanic and telling him he is the father of a daughter he never knew. <br /> <br /> On the day he met his friend Larry, he learned about the casting call for the remake of "Marty," his favorite movie. Being a great man, he clearly identifies with the character in the movie. In many ways, James's own life agrees with that of Paddy Chayefsky's creation in the picture. He wants to try the part because he knows he can justify the role. <br /> <br /> One day he meets Beth in a cool drink fountain. James loves the woman, who one day invites him to go shopping with her for intimate clothes. He ends up having sex with her and thinks they have a good thing to do, but Beth has another surprise when she's the reason she's going to sleep because she never did it with a fat man. After being disappointed, James bumps into an attractive primary school teacher who seems to share his love for jazz. In the end, we look at James who fulfills his long dream of starring in a theater production by Marty in a nursing home. <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin, a lovely character, shows a talent for the type of comedy related to his friend Larry David. Although both men differ in acting styles, James Aaron is right on the money. As a director, he has done so before, although it is an original concept he must follow. <br /> <br /> One of the assets of the movie is the people involved in the project. Sarah Silverman impresses her taking Beth. Bonnie Hunt endorses her role as a school teacher for good results. Mina Kolb, seen as his mother, played a role in "Promoting Your Enthusiasm" with excellent results. Director Paul Mazursky is also in the less important role. Joey Slotnick, Tim Kazurinsky, Richard Kind, David Pasquesi, Larry Neumann Jr., Gina Gershon, and the rest of the role player make valuable contributions. <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin is a talented man whose next efforts will be welcomed by his fans.
