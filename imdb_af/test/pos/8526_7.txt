When I first saw it on tape, about 10 years after it was released, I thought it was one of the better James Bond movies. But after seeing it around the turn of the century, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think it's a little overstated because critics were so happy to see Sean Connery end his 12-year-old slope to play Bond. that they did not criticize the film. I think what disappointed me was the end. After investing two hours in the movie, you expect a less-hokey, more satisfying end. And it may be, but I was disappointed not to have the regular actors in supporting roles like Miss Moneypenny, Q, Felix Leiter, etc. Not to see. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there were lots of unique action scenes, especially early on, and the two villains were interesting. I thought Klaus Maria Brandauer was the more intriguing of the two because he was so low and watched the "nice man next door." He wasn't your normal Bond villain. <br /> <br /> It had a lot of "skin" for a PG movie, especially with Kim Basinger's lead, and was never an actress known to hide her figure. The language was very tame, but most Bond movies are pretty good in the department. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a "fair" bond and nothing else. Just because Connery is in it doesn't mean it's automatically good. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan have proven that they can play the role well.
