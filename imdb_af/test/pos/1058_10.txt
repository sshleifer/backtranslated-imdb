I've always loved old movies, but it's one of my top ten favorites ... it has all the charm, the senses of 1940 and a good old-fashioned romance and it's hilarious to start! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking for life articles for a renowned magazine ... assuming she is a married homemade man. Even the president of the magazine is under this error. Give an attractive GI (played by the talented Dennis Morgan), just with his partner, rescued from a raft. His simple wish is to stay home. She writes so eloquently and relaxes with her well-known home-made meals. She now has to find a way to save her job and reputation ... adding that her fiance is in a hurry to tie the knot, not helping. The humor is wonderful and the chemistry between the leading characters is very nice. Throw the character actor with the nickname "Cuddles" (which perfectly fits this name), it becomes even more worship. It has become my movie that I have to see with a cup of cocoa every Christmas season. A wonderful, enjoyable movie to enjoy during Christian times or anytime!
