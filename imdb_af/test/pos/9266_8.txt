This movie is so different from what you've seen before. It is an honest and diverse report of a whole family's struggle with a terminal illness. <br /> <br /> 'The Closer She Gets' is shot in a very unique style. Craig Oulette movies in a very different way .... with different angles and views, in what I find is a very striking way (perhaps because of his experience with photographic works). <br /> <br /> His style gives such a clear picture of not only what the patient is facing, but who also needs to treat loved ones close to her. <br /> <br /> A very sad but very interesting and unique movie. One I will definitely suggest to watch.
