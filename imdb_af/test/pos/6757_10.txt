A brilliant animated piece that was far ahead of its time, and certainly far ahead of anything released in mass production at the same time. The influence of this work on Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas is clear. One can only imagine how Starewicz slept over every beautifully detailed frame of this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> There were very few animation films of this caliber. It is a pity that more people have not seen this jewelery. <br /> <br /> Apparently IMdB now requires at least ten lines of comment so it's the tenth line. It must be something new - but I really have nothing else to say!
