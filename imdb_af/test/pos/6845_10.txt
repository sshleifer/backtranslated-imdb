What's the matter with your people? John Dahl? From "Rounders" and "Unforgettable"? Also cute? Does Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman beat fun to play against? And someone loves the Gingerbread man? <br /> <br /> I hired it to know nothing about it and found it about a video you can get. Never insulting, well thought out, funny, anything. I disagree with the naysayers. I thought the story itself was relentless, but the great role that probably the director's attention probably lifted in a super cool state. Good sound design too (much more appreciated in the area, but I don't scream). And yes, I'm a girl, so maybe it has a little bit of feminine (the guys in the gang are worth it). All in all, a 9 and a cordial RECOMMENDATION.
