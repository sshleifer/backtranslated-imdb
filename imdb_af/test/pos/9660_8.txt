This is probably the best film of 2002 about the Romanian theater. I recommend that it be an intense drama with no lack of action and excitement. The film focuses on the teen life in the Bucharest suburbs by the main character, not so much focused on the character's form or definition, but more on the anger he and other characters feel. The title "Furia" means anger rather than anger, but can be seen in the film in both senses due to the behavior of actors. The strange love story (not a typical romantic, but rather a modern suburban conception) is well formed at the end. It's a fascinating picture, and cinematography is pretty good at capturing suburban nightlife, making it a great movie to watch and watch. You won't get bored, I promise!
