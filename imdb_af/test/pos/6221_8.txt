All the films by Risto Jarva are worth seeing. Some such as "Jäniksen vuosi" and "Loma" are the best films in their genre and have reached the status of classical artists in Finnish theater history. <br /> <br /> Most people made an impression of the actor Antti Litja by Jarva's films. Litja has played a leading role in three of Jarva's films, all of which have been successful in cash and movie reviews. <br /> <br /> It is nice to see that the idea of ​​"Jäniksen Vuosi" remains in advertising (I think it was tele-operator Sonera's TV added where Litja in the mountain in Lapland with hair in his Everibody who watched the movie knows what I'm talking about.) "Jäniksen Vuosi" is a beautiful film with great actors and good filming stations - like the well-known small town in Lapland, Sodankylä, where the best film festival in the world took place - The Midnight Sun Film Festival. I recommend it for everyone to go there in June - but remember warm clothes and raincoat :)
