This movie is pretty good, it's actually like a good wine, it gets better the more you see it. The pace is fairly slow for such a high octane, but cinematography is beautiful and surreal. There is a cool blue tint that rides the whole movie. There is also one big show in Gabriel Casseus's performance of the "Midget" character. He's great. Why doesn't this guy work anymore? If the movie supports better, he will probably have.
