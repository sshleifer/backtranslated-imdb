If you like dim comedies like a plane, you'll love this movie! It's definitely in the style of Airplane and Scary Movie. A fun movie! It has the strangest role players all in the same movie. Michael Jackson, Evan Marriott, Joyce Giraurd, Stuart Pankin, Charlie Schlater and Eric Roberts. The special effects are hokey, but I think they're supposed to be because it's a stupid comedy. There are apparently two versions of the movie, one at Blockbuster and one on the official website: MissCastaway.com. The one on the site appears to be a preview version signed by the director. There are some fun behind the scenes that are also filmed at Neverland with Michael Jackson. The movie was filmed in 2003 and says it is PG rated fun on the box.
