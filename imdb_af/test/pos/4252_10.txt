1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to gain recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much larger release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and unpleasant. These two films were significant to the point that they got hold of the Prince's feature film for a few years. <br /> <br /> The subject is Putney Swop. And it's a crazy farce / satire to be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here. Which plot ?? People looking for a plot are going to scratch their heads. Keep scraping! This movie is not about PLOT! One can compare it to a Mel Brooks movie; just without the Hollywood parody party that always throws Mel. I also see some Monty Python in it. By the way: This movie was shot before Monty made his debut on the BBC !!! <br /> <br /> I see the deadly deadly Gags and Lines do not convey well through oral words. You should see it within the context of the movie. There are some bugs in the movie; but even the errors are unique. For example: Actors often repeat the same line over and over; and somehow it works. How Many Sillables Mario? Putney Says the Borman Six Girl Has Soul! etc. <br /> <br /> The B / W photography is outstanding. The sound / score is even better! The editing is just so. The acting is above average. The writing is invaluable. The jokes are like un-PC as you can get: MR. Bad News says: "Sonny Williams has just been caught in a motel with a 13-year-old girl." Putney says, "Well, he's not superstitious." Uptight conservatives beware. The anti-setting attitude of this movie will drive you straight out of the room. Nothing is sacred. <br /> <br /> There are many things in this movie today that relate to: NO SMOKING! Reverse Racism; with African Americans who treat Caucasians as waste. The manipulation of mass media across the masses; Madison Avenue, Deroit, Hollywood planning to tell something any 8-year-old can tell is pure garbage; The internet, I'm talking about "the drum"; Interracial dating; I can go on and on .... <br /> <br /> I also have to mention that about 8 minutes of this film is shot in 16 mm Color. These are the ads shot by Putney's agency. The places work pretty well the first time. They get tired, though repeated. The real magic here is within the B / W sections of the movie. It's the non-spectacular lines that they stay with you: "Hire yourself a CHORT Schmuck". "I love you, I love you, I love you ... have you taken your pill?" "Anything I have to say will only be superfluous." And an army of others. I also really like the bit with the mounted on the wall: "The ranger wanted me to throw it back ... I put such a fight, I decided to let it sit!" <br /> <br /> Movie standouts include Buddy Buttler as Putney's bodyguard # 1. He had to be a much bigger star. Antonio Fargas as the Arab. He went on TV and in Flieks on the stars. Arnold Johnson has the right look as Putney Swop. Robert Downey used his own voice because Arnold couldn't remember his lines. Downey also realized that he could later enter any further dialogue / jokes if he called his Lead actor. <br /> <br /> The movie does have shortcomings. The short term is one. I wish the start when the White Board members would extend. Stan Gotlieb and Allen Garfield are outstanding. The end of the seams was thrown together as if he just couldn't think anymore. All in all, this is one of the best low-budget independent movies of his time. A time when very little was playing outside of New York, Chicago, San Francisco and L.A. Anyone who loves satire and comedy should see it at least twice. Downey's Putney Swing is ahead and beyond when it's time.
