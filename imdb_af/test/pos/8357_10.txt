Hilarious movie, I had a good time watching it. The star (Cuneyt Arkin, sometimes credited as Steve Arkin) is a popular actor from Turkey. He played in very tough-old roles, epic-sword movies and romance. It was nice to see him with an international role and some equally good looking gloves. If I remember, it was also mentioned in English which made things even more beautiful. (as John Wayne speaks Turkish).
