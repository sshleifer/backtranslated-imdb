John Huston was seriously ill when he achieved his final performance, and this is his testament: uncompromising, difficult, a thousand miles away from crazes and fashions; screenplay, no action, no real hero, but a group of people who handle the vanity of life, the fleeting years and death. The party has long not seduced people. In addition, warmth and love comes from the songs and the meal, complete with turkey and pudding. But over time, Julia's voice was partly devastated, first crack in the mirror. Then the camera left the room where the guests were collected and searched for the old woman's bedroom. Certainly, her appearance seems to be a happy life, but it is a life that comes to an end inexorably. A shot shows at the end of the film Julia on her future deathbed. May be an unfulfilled life, because she has remained a spider, without children to continue. Just a few poor things, yellowish pictures, bibelotte and trinklet s .... But is one's hope and dreams fulfilled all? Look at Gretta. She is a married woman, about thirty-five, she is still beautiful and healthy, but she knows something is broken. What Julia is today, she will be tomorrow, so in her consciousness stream, she goes back to her past, just to find out how recovering her memories are: a young man committed suicide for her, a symbol of her youth now decreasing. The final monologue, if we listen to it now, we all involve in this eternal tragedy, the doomed to fail the human condition, John Huston's masterful lesson.
