I really looked forward to this documentary looking at what I consider to be one of the most entertaining films ever made. Growing up in L.A. During the 60's, many of these old black and white films were shown at local stations. I even remember a Friday night show called "Strange Tales of Science Fiction" which featured another Sci Fi movie every week. However, this documentary spent too much time on the opinions of the four famous filmmakers and how they felt about the classic films of that genre and how they used it as inspiration in their movie. <br /> <br /> That's not what I hoped for in this documentary. It could really be a comprehensive investigation of the decade instead of a brief emphasis on the best-known films of the era. Anyone who is studying or interested in these films is fairly familiar with views such as World War, Forbidden Planet, Thing, Day on Earth, etc. I would like to see some excerpts from lesser-known films and maybe some interviews with people involved in making these movies. I have to agree that the documentary was too much focused on Spielberg's views and was a kind of commercial for his new release of the World War.
