Exactly examining this film is a bit sad. It is detailed enough to address many real problems, children growing up in poor, dysfunctional environments. Yet it retains its comic value, with spirit performances by Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones. The sadness lies in the struggle and dysfunction of the mother (Carroll), who can't really help her children, not because she doesn't want to or tries, but because it's clear she doesn't know. Remember, it's a comedy, but if you've never seen it before, or if you see this movie and see humanity, in the characters. Good movie.
