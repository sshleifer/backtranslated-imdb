Who would have thought that a non-disabled actor could act as realistically and immensely as a disabled person in a movie? Probably someone. But no one, truly no one, can ever compare their expectations to the incredible emotional and powerful performance of the two actors in this movie. <br /> <br /> Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as we are right, he has great problems communicating. So this is really a lifeline when fellow disabled Rory (James McAvoy) who can speak normally understands him. So start a friendship that relies mainly on (ironically) communication. <br /> <br /> In a hilarious scene, they succeed in moving away from home. After Rory was rejected, good hearted Michael made an application to move to his own home. Rory, who already had a bad name with the "judges", had to be his interpreter. <br /> <br /> But problems soon arise. They started heartily with a girl they met in a pub for a while, and wanted them to be their assistant to do the little things. She is hesitant at first; she does not know these men, but seems to be harmless; So another friendship comes up, but not necessarily a good one. <br /> <br /> Apart from being interesting, however, this film really relies on the actors. But this is not a bad thing. For a non-disabled actor, you see Rory, although he can properly communicate, is frustrated by the way he is completely dependent on others, and he has no own life. But the right star for me is Steven Robertson. He acts with such emotions, longing to fit in and sadness / happiness, which really sees him win over the entire film. <br /> <br /> Excellent. <br /> <br /> Overall: 5 out of 5
