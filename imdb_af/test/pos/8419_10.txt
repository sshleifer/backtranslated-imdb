Shwaas is awesome! as the producers had a low budget, they did an excellent job. It's a must see. The little child did an excellent job with many emotions flowing through his eyes. Grandpa is at his best. That photography is excellent. Technically correct and very creative. It helps to add many emotions to the mainstream content. The movie will be a surprise to you and don't be surprised if you are shaken to the movie and delay the story for a few days. I sincerely hope they make it to the final Oscar nomination <br /> <br /> Enjoy it and don't miss it
