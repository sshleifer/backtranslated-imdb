This is the first Pepe Le Pew cartoon and in some ways very similar to the later, but in some other strange ways it is not. While the object of Pepe's love is a cat, it's strange it's a BOY cat! This whole problem occurs because a cat is tired of being abused by others and dressing like a skunk and trying to smell like a skunk so it can be left alone. Unfortunately, it attracts our hero, Pepe. Most of the action is pretty typical to the very funny and unexpected end - and this makes this one of the best of all cartoons in the series. Excellent animation (although the style is different from later examples), excellent writing and a good sense of humor make this one a custodian.
