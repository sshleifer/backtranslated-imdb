Just released a six-month drug rehabilitation program and had its time to handle cards in illegal gambling games, Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) has great hope to clean and find a new life as a big-band drummer. However, when he returns to his old Chicago neighborhood, he soon returned the pressure of the people around him, including his wheelchair-married wife, Zosch (Eleanor Parker), to the old money-waving "Dealer" style that first came out. He started on the path of self-destruction that is a heroin addict. <br /> <br /> It is very rare for a movie to have so much character performance as it does. Frank Sinatra is wonderful like Frankie Machine, and realistically, the symptoms of a drug addict probably withdraw better than ever before. Sinatra looks a sharp understanding and awareness of his character here and possesses the ongoing struggle for control over his own life that goes on forever in the heart of the man, Frankie Machine. Parker as his cripple, Zosch, wants to own Frankie forever, to help him make good money to care for her and pay her ever-rising medical bills. She seems terrified of anything she sees as a threat to her control over him, such as the freedom a drummer's life can offer, or something that can change the status quo between them. <br /> <br /> Onlooker Molly (Kim Novak), a girl living in the same building and having real feelings for Frankie, who has no desire to control him, but to help him prove the best thing what Frankie will do for him in the world if he can stay just long enough to wake up and realize it. Darren McGavin as the heroin drug peddler Louie, however, is always there just waiting in the wings to know just the right buttons to push, just the thing to say, to get a former addict back to the old habit, one profitable for Louie, but deadly to the addict. <br /> <br /> The environment also seems like it's a life of its own, constantly dark, eager, seedy and crime-ridden with nowhere near enough positive things to look out into life, a place where it too easy to escape through a bottle or drug, a quick "solution" that is not at all right, but just works to keep one in the dark away from the daylight and all the bright prospects the world can offer. It's a neat touch that when Frankie is on the right track, the environment always looks bright when on the wrong track. While some argue it is a bit dated, to me it is a zealous film with a realistic inner war within a man of control over his own destiny, one that contains very strong character achievements of all concerned. With that, the man with the golden arm gets my highest possible recommendation.
