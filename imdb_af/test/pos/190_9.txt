Fabulous cinematography by Sergei Urusevsky helps make it a beautiful piece of work. The opening scenes are as if one is browsing the album of a master photographer and if the story begins to unfold, we are swept away with the events depicted and the beautiful appearance. Everybody is well shot, but there are several full ranges that are simply breathtaking. Difficult to describe without 'spoiling' but enough to say one is a very intense scene during an air raid and the lady left behind and her lover's brother is in danger if the sirens shine and the windows are shattered. Another farm overflows a revolving staircase and a revolving tree and even develops in a fantasy direction. Soviet film makes the highest order.
