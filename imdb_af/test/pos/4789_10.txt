Every time this movie is used in the late-night television in the late 70's and early 80's, I will always have time to sit and watch TV. To see the lovely Kate Jackson, pretty Richard Long, the "big" Polly Bergen I've never seen anywhere else, except for this TV movie, the engaging Tom Bosley and another "big" I've never seen do not have. , Celeste Holme. It is truly the love boat on a cruise to kill and chaos and boy was it ever good !! And every time I see it, I'll always forget who the real killer was. <br /> <br /> As expected, someone here is already critical of the movie as if it really is a great help to anyone. It's a good TV movie and every time to watch. I can't say about half the movies I've seen this month. <br /> <br /> If you ever get the chance to watch it one day, it's probably not, watch it. In light of "The Girl Most Likely To" finally released this year on DVD, perhaps there is hope for a DVD release of "Death Cruise."
