Well, to start with Rajkumar Santoshi is not a comedy film maker, and it's really unfortunate because the only comedy movie he made is a masterpiece. This movie is really funny. Listen in pieces, overworked in a few screens, but still the dialogues r really laugh at riots and characters are really fun. Story line in simple A billionaire daughter comes to India for marriage and Two young chaps are behind her, the story also has a twist as a gangster connection. Alman plays a street smart old Amar played his role with brilliance and Salman played the role of an innocent stupid to perfection. Raveena did well, but Karshima is really annoying in some rows. But Real Shows Stealer r Paresh Rawal and Shakti Kapoor, they enter the frame and automatically start laughing. Overall such a nice movie that you can see, no. of times without getting bored.
