This movie is great. Best play I've ever seen in my life. Ingvar E Sigurðsson is the best Icelandic actor, and of course Hilmir Snær and Bjorn Jörundur. Great music and sound. Cold hard reality about a man's struggle that has many problems and the people in his life. Black humor mixed with great acting and this European art film style, it works, brings it together in a best Icelandic film ever made. I tell you. "See this movie, you won't regret it." I gave it 9 stars. If you see one Icelandic movie in your life ... See this one
