This movie was recently renamed subtitles, on Australia's special broadcasting service. I thought I read here that there is sometimes an assumption that * Revenge of the Rats * is a successor. In fact, the rats are revenge for something done in this movie or in human history. There is no prequel as far as I know. <br /> <br /> Now let's get the Pied Piper from Hamelin out of the way. Maybe this story crossed when I watched the movie, but that's all. There was the word "suitcases" at the end of the film. A Dazed Mayor tried to justify her actions by saying, "The suitcases were empty." "Coffers" is not a word you hear much today, unless you read human stories to your children, like me. Since I saw Revenge of the Rats, I have read two versions of The Pied Piper by Hamelin. Now I see the comparison. A metaphorical fat, but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford to get rid of the rats. It's about as far as I can follow the analogy. The children are not led to a door in a mountain, left with a lame boy to tell of a land of winged horses and fountains, where it is always spring and everyone is always happy. <br /> <br /> There is a lot that is very much about this movie. The romance and the resolution especially. The female characters have potentially powerful roles in society, but are really impotent. Where this movie is fairly rebellious (compared to American cinema) it is anti-authoritarian. The helicopter pilot is dismissed by the mayor because he did well. The mayor and local government are portrayed as corrupt and pledged for big money. Finally, one doctor in Frankfurt is left to resolve an epidemic of fatal and contagious disease. Apparently, there are no national infectious diseases to coordinate or return things. <br /> <br /> I'm not a horrible aficionado, so any horror I see is usually mixed with humor. From the mess in the blood bank you can see that it will have the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers; The huge number of rats are impressive and the horror fans also seem to be happy.
