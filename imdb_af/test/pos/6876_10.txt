when I know Walter will never get a set again. I was in my 30's when I saw this lovely, engaging and unashamed romantic movie. I loved it from the first scene and to the end. Carney was his usual daft himself; Glenda passed Walter for steps in the whites, and Richard Benjamin gave the sarcastic voice of reason he did so well. Along the way there were many actors who recognize us all and do their usual brilliance. There are a few lines in the movie that I've used SO and I throughout, but I won't say anything about this. I'm pretty sure you'll know which two I'm talking about. Just get this movie. Make some popcorn, grab your pinch (if it's as juicy as mine, for which I'm grateful), and enjoy this romantic comedy from the 70's. You won't be disappointed. However, I have the feeling that I am preaching here to the choir because everyone who loves Walter will already own it. I'm very happy it's finally on the DVD.
