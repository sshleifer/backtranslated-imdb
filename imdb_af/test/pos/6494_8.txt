Thank you, not all Dutch are so relentless. I think Jason is so judged by most people simply because he has a famous father. Maybe he's not as big as some of the actors, but he's definitely not as bad as suggested. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie a few years ago, and I actually loved it. I know Jason of other movies and of course Robin of Sherwood. But I have to say I really liked performing his play. It was really good! <br /> <br /> During the movie I actually forgot he was the son of. Sean ... who? <br /> <br /> And if you're a Shakespeare lover, I can recommend this movie. I'm sure you'll enjoy it!
