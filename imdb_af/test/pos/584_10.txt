The Muppet movie is a direct classic. I remember the opening scene with the bird's eye view of the swamp and Kermit, which I believe is the most beloved song in the history of songs. At this point my mother will always sing with Kermit. <br /> <br /> Watching this title as a young adult makes me smile. I can still sing to my heart's desire. Like many Muppet films, there are jokes for adults who (in my opinion) are still funny. My favorite line of all time is actually this movie, it's the last line that my green, brilliant-hearted hero Kermit says. "Life is like a movie, Write your own end." This is what I intend to do! Thanks Jim Henson.
