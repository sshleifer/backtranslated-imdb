I saw the movie, not looking in the basement to be very good, with some great characters in it. It's about a young psychiatric nurse, called Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik), who will start with an isolated spiritual asylum. While she is there, she meets different kinds of characters, including dr. Geraldine Masters who becomes the owner of the hospital in charge of the asylum. Dr. Stephens is killed by one of the patients by hitting an ax. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters in the movie are Mrs. Challingham (Reah MacAdams), a very funny little old lady, Allison, who is a nymphomania, and Sam (Bill McGhee) a young black man running all day. a world of its own all the time. The film was a very low budget movie, but was still a very good movie. I know it was back on the 'Video Nasties' list back in the 80's, but one didn't think it had much in it. Alothough had bad senses in it. GREAT MOVIE RECOMMENDED !!!
