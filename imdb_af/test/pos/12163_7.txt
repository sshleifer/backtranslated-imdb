After throwing out of their last work and finding scarce work in the UK, the six members of the Wonder Boys, better known as The Crazy Gang, see an employment advertisement in the golden strike town of Red Gulch in the Yukon Territory. It is from a newspaper cut and on the back there is a story about Chamberlain that says the country is better prepared for war. Some of them go to the Yukon and the Frozen Limits. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is the case of misplaced Chamberlains. The cutout is forty years old and it refers to Joe Chamberlain and the Boer War rather than Neville in the current crisis. But that's typical of how things go for this crew. I can see Stan Laurel making the same mistake. <br /> <br /> Of course, when they get there, it's a ghost town inhabited only by young Jean Kent and her grandfather Moore Marriott. He is going on for years and is a little touched in the head. Marriott has a gold mine that he has misplaced somewhere where he goes to sleep, that is when he sleeps. The gang helps him better the mine or otherwise beautiful, Mrs. To see Kent will not marry stalwart stairs Anthony Hulme, but rather saloon owner Bernard Lee, a lot worse than death. <br /> <br /> This was my first exposure to the Crazy Gang and I can both see why they were so in the UK and why they never made an impact on the dam. The jokes come fast and furious and then there are a number of things that the Code in the US just won't allow. The jokes are also very active in Britain and many will not get passed here. <br /> <br /> The eyeballs are universal, the final pursuit scene is something the Marx brothers did in America. My suggestion is that if you look at the Frozen Limits, paste it if you have a familiar familiarity with British history and run it two or three times to make sure you pick everything up. It will be worth it.
