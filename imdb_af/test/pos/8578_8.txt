I love this movie. There is something for everyone. It's funny, sad, passionate and dramatic. The mix of two completely different cultures creates a whole new world that the viewer cannot help but wants to be part of. I have to admit that I am a little biased, since Colin Firth is my favorite actor and nothing he does is wrong in my eyes! beautiful acting of his co-star Nia Long. The problems their love affair causes make it more credible ironically and the simple features such as the contrast between the colors of Matthew and Nimi's clothing alone make this movie more and more enchanting. I cheat anyone who can't be moved by this story. I find it fascinating and have watched it at least ten times since I bought the movie a week ago!
