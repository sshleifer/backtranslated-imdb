The brainchild of comic strip pioneer, Alex Raymond, "Flash Gordon" was the great dad of all science epics. This series is the first time Flash has been brought to the celluloid life. Despite the low budget, it's a great space opera. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the Earth condemned to apparent destruction when the Planet Mongo travels through space on a collision course. Maverick scientist dr. Zarkov is heading for the approaching planet in a self-made rocket ship, convinced he can do something to stop the runaway heavenly body. He gets some recent recruits in the form of resourceful athlete Flash Gordon and beautiful Dale Arden. Once they reach Mongo, their problems really start. They run off brave Emperor Ming the Merciless, victor of his world, who has some ambitious plans for Earth. <br /> <br /> The rest of the series turns to Flash's desperate efforts to save the earth; the variety of alien cultures he meets; the allies he makes; space ships he flies; the battles he is fighting, and the monsters he defeats. <br /> <br /> Brilliant design by Raymond, "Flash Gordon" features classic archetypes of legendary myths and ancient fables. Echos of well-known stories, such as Troy and Camelot's saga and Sherwood Forrest, are seen here. You have the dashing, handsome hero, on a quest to save the kingdom (Flash); The evil king (Ming); The old wise man (Zarkov); The beautiful girl in distress (Dale); the seductive siren (Aura); loyal allies (Thun, Barin, Vultan); Plus monsters, dragons and various beasts. <br /> <br /> Flash is a modern Robin Hood, Jason or Beowulf. Ming is Prince John or Aggamemnon. Dale is Helen or Troy or Gwenevere or Maid Marion. Zarkov is Merlin or Odysseus. (Or Gandalf) Thun / Barin / Vultan are the Merry Men or the Knights of the Round Table. <br /> <br /> You get the idea. <br /> <br /> You can't help but see how many "Flash Gordon" ideas will appear later in STAR WARS. The cloud city; The ice world; The crescent moon; The blowing opening text (From the second series); There are others, but you get the core. The whole sci-fi genre is a great debt to these timeless classics. Buster Crabb is the perfect action hero and I personally think he is better at this kind of role than any of the current action action stars. He also played Buck Rogers and Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton is the embodiment of diabolic nastiness as Ming. Sure, he looks a bit melodramatic today, but that was what audiences of the bad guys expected in the 30's. <br /> <br /> Jean Rogers is our hero's love interest Dale Arden, and I had such a loved one when I first saw it as a boy. I can easily understand why Flash always rushed to her rescue. She is the peculiar good girl to contravene the seductive manipulations of Aura, the really bad girl. <br /> <br /> The supporting slip looks perfectly chosen to imitate their cartoon counterparts, and despite the curious FX's, it was a very exciting action in this groundbreaking series. <br /> <br /> An overall fun skirt and the beginning of the sci-fi genre in the theater.
