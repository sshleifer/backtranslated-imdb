It is a very enjoyable, well-directed film. It's funny and sometimes hilaries. The final is a bit disappointing as it all tries to make a package too neat. The film is better remembered for its priceless vignettes: the Jane Austen staging, the camping example. B&H does not attempt to reflect the dominant attitudes towards homosexuality and bisexuality. Most characters accept the sexual diversity. In that sense, it is a joyous holiday from the homophobic society. And it is a celebration of flexibility, a redemption of rigid sexual categories - perhaps a happy man of things to come.
