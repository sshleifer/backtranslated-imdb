One day I came to a video store at The Last Stop and they sold it for only $ 2. I decided to try and buy it. It was pretty good, I enjoyed it. The story is about several people caught somewhere in a hut due to an angry snow bath. There is a police officer, Nancy, his ex girlfriend, two brothers who just came out of jail, an older man and his lover, a black man and the couple who own the huts and their delayed son who never speaks. Suddenly someone is killed and a bag of cash is found. Everyone is a suspect. The last stop is a pretty good thriller, I'll give it 8/10
