It's my favorite movie easily. A tragic romance intertwined with a complex mystery whose threads are all but invisible until they all unravel in one fantastic rush in the end. Sharp brilliance. <br /> <br /> I would like to see Gilles Mimouni's work, but imdb did not make any other features. Made the high quality of this work to make another difficult? Did he move (back) to another sphere of creative pursuit? I certainly hope it won't be his last feature, but I can't really blame him if he decides to quit this gem as his only contribution to the world of feature films.
