I captured this movie in an OutFest show in Los Angeles in July 2006. It's rough around the edges (especially sound recording is wobble) and often very funny. The script is hardly episodic and ends suddenly, but Ash Christian adds the film with real heart. It is also a refreshing change of pace to have a gay movie that does not occupy star underwear models with the party and the straight guys chasing. Props for a warm, sympathetic Jonathan Caouette as mr. Cox, a spirit of Rodney (Ash Christian), the vibrant and spirited Ashley Finke as Rodney's best friend, and Deborah Theaker as Rodney's mother, writing the best one-liners and stealing her every scene. The movie is like his writer / director / star? Beat and a little weird, but also very sweet.
