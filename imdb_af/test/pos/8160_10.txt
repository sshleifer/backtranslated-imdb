Back in 1982, a small film called MAKING LOVE shocked audiences with his honest and open presentation of a romantic love story that was just about two men. <br /> <br /> For years I have been waiting for a good old-fashioned romance between two men; LATTER DAYS is everything and more. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is soapy, melodramatic, clich√©-driven, and quite wheat-like. It makes it so wonderful. There is nothing like a good romantic movie, and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word. <br /> <br /> About the issue of religion, sorry people, but these things happen and happen to gay people even now. It is not just the Mormon church that rejects its gay members. Gay people in every religion confronted hard judgment and rejection. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It has a perfect combination of a fantasy romance based on the reality of the daily life of the characters. If I could give it more than ten stars, I would have liked it. Good love stories never go out of style; Great love stories like LATTER DAYS are memorable. <br /> <br /> It's about time!
