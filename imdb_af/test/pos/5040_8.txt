Possibly the best John Travolta role ever. Saturday Night Fever was a good movie, but a long time ago. I can't think of many of my films or roles that I even liked, and it's easy to think of rots. He can do meanically as in pulp fiction, but he makes the perfect funky angel, and it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better (equally slobby) work with it. Plot listings are available everywhere, but the plot is not the point. Just go for the ride and enjoy the smartness of the little funnies along the way. There is nothing to keep from this movie, unless someone is looking for something profound. I wish there were more movies like this. We need a break of deep or incredible or creepy or complex or hysterical.
