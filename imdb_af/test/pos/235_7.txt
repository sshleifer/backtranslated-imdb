Although I strongly feel that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie, but it's a good one. I like the music and the dance and the end of how Gene had the girl. My favorite part, no doubt, is Gene's dance with his alter ego. I like to watch two Gene Kelly's for the price of one. It shows what talent Mr. Kelly really was. It's a movie I think everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime. So you haven't seen it going and find it today! I'm sure everyone out there has a Gene Kelly friend who has this movie in their collection. So go to their home and pop popcorn and enjoy!
