I had a good time looking back at Femina Ridens a few mornings, somewhat hungry. For most of the movie, it's almost a two-handed, showing the games and strange relationship of mad doctor Philipe Leroy and the beautiful Dagmar Lassander. I've seen her before in a few Fulci movies that kill horrible deaths, but here she is young hip and beautiful. The movie is pretty predictable and definitely mild on the exploitation side, but is constantly entertaining its wonderful colorful kitsch feel. The set of design, music, lighting and cinematography are all classic late sixty Italian style, a surrealistic feast for the eyes and ears and although the general thread of the plot is not too difficult to provide, there are more than enough unusual events and memorably bizarre sights. and sounds to keep things quite interesting. Both leads are pretty good, and Dagmar Lassander seems to be really good. The music, by Stelvo Cipriani, is also very well suited to the images. Director Pierro Schivazappa got a bit of a crack here, but it's not perfect. Although it is very attractive, there is little dust here and the exploitation components are about as mild as it can be. I think it gives it some kind of charm and innocence, but I can't help thinking that the subject could have done with more sleazy, more threatening, that kind of thing, especially since it's pretty easy to determine what's going to happen . It seems to me that it is a bit useless for stronger exploitation supporters and certainly not for people who want sex or much nudity. It's more of a light, fun pop art relationship, lovely but insignificant, like a whirlpool. Recommended mainly for those who love the 60's, Dagmar Lassander, or lovely designs.
