Under the direction of F. Gary Gray, "Italian Job", he never loses the trouble of being cool and fun. Although the material is recreated and average, the film itself is masterfully executed and is satisfactorily good. The tone can easily have been much heavier, seeing the murder revenge plotline, but F. Gary Gray keeps pace with good humor, funny dialogues and pulsating music. It is a pleasure to see that these bad guys form a great bond and stay together through fraud and murder, while never forgetting to have fun. This one is 7/10.
