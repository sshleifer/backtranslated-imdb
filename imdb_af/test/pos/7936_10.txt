I've loved this movie since the first time I've seen it many years ago. I'm not sure how many times I've seen it, maybe 10, maybe 20. That was the last time I looked at it. I was struck by a detail I haven't noticed yet. <br /> <br /> Opposite the End of the photo, the slaughtered heroes are transferred back to the village via the sled. There are some close-ups of the dead. The one who hit me the most was a shot of blonde youth. All you see on the screen is its profile from head to hand. His hands hold a flickering candle. The wind blows and its thick blonde hair dances in the wind, in keeping with the flicker of the candle flame. The contrast between death and the life he lost is incredibly powerful. The moving hair and candle flame reminds us of the vitality that once resided in his body. <br /> <br /> Every time I see this movie again, I see something new.
