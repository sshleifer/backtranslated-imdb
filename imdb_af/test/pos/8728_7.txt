Anyone who has ever doubted Ingrid Bergman's ability to play comedy, should just look at "The Bells of St. Mary's". OK, so she's a nun with TB, which is probably in love with Fr. O'Malley, (thinking of what Luis Bunuel could do about it), but she also has a wonderful, ugly sense of fun that lets you know that directors dropped her more in comedies. In the "Cactus Flower" she is a disabled dentist's nurse, (Walter Matthau is the dentist), in love with her boss, but holds it. When she is forced to act as his "wife" to chop his mistress (don't ask), let her go and pop the buttons. And she is a joy to see. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is a harder than ordinary translation to the screen of a Broadway hit (you can see it is three acts). It is a French Farce (it was originally; it was taken from the play 'Fleur de Cactas' by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Gredy) and it hits all the right places. Matthau uses his wonderful expression with great effect and a clutzy blonde newcomer, as she was called Goldie Hawn at the time, steals the movie as the thousand mistress who decides to give up her meal card because she feels sorry for the woman although the woman is a ball. Hawn made such an impression on the role she did, the Oscar for best supporting actress.
