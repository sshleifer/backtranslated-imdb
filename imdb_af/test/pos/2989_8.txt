I can hardly remember what DECADE I saw this movie. That was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm now 37). I began to look it early in the early 80's as a late-night movie, and so many of them have stayed with me ever since. If I see other comments, I had no idea that it was shown to theaters, or that someone else was new. I don't think I even mentioned the movie to anyone else. <br /> <br /> But half the time later, I still remember much of the movie I watched this evening. I think the innocence of the charactors, their situation, their mutual love over a long period of time, has left a long-term imprint for reasons I don't quite understand. Maybe it's because I was a teenager when I saw it, and it somehow touched me ..... I really don't know! I also really wanted to know what would happen if the end of the movie happened. Oh, the fear! <br /> <br /> I haven't seen it before, or since, but I'd love it. I have a coincidental look for it, but now I doubt it will be shown and it seems to have faded into oblivion. But I wouldn't miss it in the TV guide, even if it didn't show up. Pssttt !!! <br /> <br /> Read reviews here revived my interest. If anyone knows about his availability in Australia, send me an email and let me know. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Sean Bury ... nice to see you appear here on the comment. I took a look at your movie history and noticed your last appearance in a James Bond movie. How about this day? Oh, and did you have a copy of the movie? CHEERS !!!
