I am firmly convinced that a movie, TV series or any form of art should be fully appreciated, when the time factor - when it is written, produced or fertilized - must be taken into account. <br /> <br /> Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi is one such series. I remember watching TV in the mid-80's and repeating the re-runs in the early 90's via the video cassette libraries. and laughed aloud and addicted to it. It made me buy with the full range of DVD sets and surprises of surprises. The comedy and the moments of the good days just became flat for me. Even the very popular "30 years of experience" "GULAAAAB JAMUN!" and "Sofa cum bed" didn't use the kind of joy I thought. The time factor: for the 80's it was the show stopper. The main event. The mother of all TV comedies. And it worked over time and age! Maybe it can't be said at the moment, but the DVD has watched. Enjoy the seasons with Shafi Inamdar and Swarup Sampat longer. Satish Shah was incredibly good at the heart of the show, with equally effective support from Farida Jalal, Tiku Talsania and the Bengal neighbors. Rakesh Bedi is always in the hands. <br /> <br /> All in all, an experience that will bring memories to those who have seen it in the early days may not appeal to younger viewers or first-time viewers!
