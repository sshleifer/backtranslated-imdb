I'll be brief: I normally hate movies like this ... but there's just something about this one that just involves me and won't let me go. Admittedly, there are some big flaws in it (some of the plays are at best in the best case and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny), but there are plenty of redeeming features to watch it to the end. <br /> <br /> But what are they? Well, it has a cool little plot - it's not original, but it's better presented than other movies of its kind. The three main stars (Whalin, Johnson, Long) have created fairly decent performances that play more than the difference in the quality of the supporting role (the fat man and Coach Quinn really bothered me) and the writing is smooth and greasy (even though it poor in places). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is, but this movie is so CUT: I've smiled completely and it has a place in my video collection because it can generate someone. You really have to be a kind of humorous drill not to like this (I DARE someone to go through without grinning!). <br /> <br /> I recommend this one if you have a simple, fun, and - above all - pleasant watch. You won't regret it! <br /> <br /> ~ Top $ ~
