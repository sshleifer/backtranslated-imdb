GREAT MOVIE! Chucky is by far the funniest character in a movie. Jennifer Tilly (Tiffany) makes this movie even better! Well, before Chucky died of Tiffany and he was together. But like ten years later, Tiffany gets back to Chucky (like a doll) and brings him back to life. It was a good movie! Scary and definitely funny (just because Chucky!) 10/10
