Exciting, action-packed and interesting film tells the story of a group of men stationed on a naval base in Italy and their adventures aboard a marine submarine during WWI. Tommy and Brick (played by Robert Montgomery and Robert Young) are two pals, and make for some very nice officials, I say. A new captain comes aboard, who is already known by some as "Dead Pan" Tolerant (Walter Huston) and he is a true sticker for the follow-up to the rule book and "honor gods". Soon, Tommy and Brick are looking for an attractive blonde at an official's dance, Tommy insults the Captain - and of course the blonde is the Captain's daughter. But Tommy wins anyway, as he and the daughter sneak away from the dance to a street carnival outside, and soon bound up during an air raid. Unfortunately, it is known to him that she is married. Later, Tommy gets himself into real trouble when he manages his orders in an attempt, except his friend. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite entertaining with an absorbing plot line that keeps me interested and top performing. A climatic horror scene with Sterling Holloway is indeed haunting - the most memorable scene in this movie, I thought. Eugene Palette and Jimmy Durante add a little humor here and play a few goofballs. Durante's character actually studies a dentist by mail order and constantly has a British man who enjoys his nose. Good - if you're looking for a movie that shows a man packing a kangaroo, it'll be the one.
