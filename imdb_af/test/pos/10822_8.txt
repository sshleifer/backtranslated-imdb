Even if it doesn't matter more than previous posts (like Ruby Liang's very good one), I wanted to share my own point of view. Hope my English is understandable. <br /> <br /> Bon voyage is a rhythmic, light but deep presentation of the French disorganized descent, but also courage and charm. Already in a brilliant redesign of 1940 France with much detail (from Bordeaux luxury hotel occupied by government headquarters and attacked by useless high class French, to Parisian coffee near Le Pantheon / rue Mouffetard and 1930s) Gerard Depardieu and Yvan Attal give them second roles a brilliant taste;) Isabelle Adjani and Virgnie Ledoyen are very credible in their drastically different roles, and Grégori Derangère makes an enchanting performance :) <br /> <br /> Much lighter than average (eg US) war times movies and focused On the civilians, Bon Voyage shows a lot of things about French issues (even for a French man like me), some of them are very deep.
