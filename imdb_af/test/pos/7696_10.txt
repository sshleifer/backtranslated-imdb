"Porgy and Bess" is an excellent production of George Gershwin's masterpiece. It is tasteful in damp colors. The votes are outstanding. Although Sidney Portier's voice is dubbed for his singing part, he gives a very pleasant performance. There is a remarkable performance by Sammy Davis Jr. as Sportin Life. There is still no DVD available to watch, and this piece asks for one. All the intelligent filmmakers who enjoyed it in 1959 will appreciate the release of this masterpiece on the new medium. The screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that includes all other music, including the outstanding of Rodgers and Hammerstein. Make sure you ask it for a video provider. Like "Songs of the South" by Walt Disney, it can be the assumption of racial overtones that prevent the marketing of this theater.
