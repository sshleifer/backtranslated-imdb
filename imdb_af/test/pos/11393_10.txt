Everything you need to know about the late 70's and early 80's pornography is all included in Paul Thomas Anderson's BOOGIE NIGHTS. Although the film is completely fictitious, it's actually supposed to be based on the story of porn queen John Holmes. <br /> <br /> In 1977, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) worked as a bus boy in a nightclub in South California. One of the regular customers is Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and two of his stars, Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham). Jack and Eddie meet and Jack realizes that Eddie is good ... a little ... gifted. <br /> <br /> So Eddie stars in Jack's films under the pseudonym of Dirk Diggler. He becomes a "big" porn star (no pun intended) and apparently above all. Then comes the 80s when the video is replaced and Jack's porn empire starts collapsing, with Dirk Diggler and everyone in the field working. <br /> <br /> BOOGIE NIGHTS is a very well-filmed drama. There is some violence, but P.T. Anderson makes it stylized. And this is a traceable approach to the decline of pornography, especially when VHS has become the standard medium for pornography. <br /> <br /> Many bizarre and unique characters are introduced. William H. Macy has an interesting role as someone who works on the movies, whose wife still loves sex with everyone. I especially liked Don Cheadle's role as Buck's stereo salesman. The best performance is BOOGIE NIGHTS was definitely Burt Reynolds. A 90's classic!
