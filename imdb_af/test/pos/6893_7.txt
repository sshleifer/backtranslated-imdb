I saw that I smell the dead - sorry, "I'm selling the dead" - at a press screen. Movie director-director Glenn McQuaid is a dear Irish man who introduced the show by announcing that - while it was going - he was going to be "a pint". I didn't cheat him for a drink, but by telling it, he felt he needed to certify his cowardice or his Irish, or both. When the opening credits rolled, there were - as usual at press shows - loud ovations for the names of every actor or crew member who had friends in the audience, and silence for those who did not. McQuaid then returned for a cheerful Q&A. <br /> <br /> This horror movie doesn't take him seriously, which is good because his humor is considerably stronger than his horror. Only one scene is even frightening, and most of the 'horror' is just brutal, but I laughed throughout the film. <br /> <br /> This movie appears to be in Ireland around 1850 (through which time the grave robbed mostly uncovered). The story is told in flashback: we get flashbacks inside flashbacks, and the narrator character accelerates material he couldn't know because sometimes he wasn't present or in one case because the action unfolded behind his back. br /> <br /> The story begins with a prisoner being taken to the guillotine. Guillotines were not used in the 19th century Ireland, but we actually see a probable guillotine sequence. The prisoner struggles to get on the road, the rope beats are accurate, and the prisoner beats looking at the blade. (And later there is a payout to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself.) <br /> <br /> The characters are apparently Irish, but one main character speaks in Cockney snake: use phrases like a cup game and "take a butcher" (for a look). For once, actors in the 19th century show the 19th-century dental hygiene, but almost all the clothes and hairstyles (and the women's make-ups) are resolutely 21st century. I do not complain in the case of Heather Bullock, who wears a very black black cozie apparently PVC. Phworr! <br /> <br /> The lead actors (except Ron Perlman) are excellent, but most supporting role players have no sense in the Victorian era. The worst offender is Joel Garland as the tax collector, whose characterization is firmly rooted in the twenty-first century. Just when I thought Garland's performance could not get less Victorian, he used his fingers to make 'ironic' air quotes. <br /> <br /> The sets (especially Angus Scrimm's laboratory) are detailed and impressive not to convince me that people actually lived and worked in these places. Almost every interior contains burning candles, but I have never seen what happened when it was real Victorian homes or workplaces: remnants of previous candles. <br /> <br /> One scene has an extraterrestrial: I was annoyed that McQuaid had shed a stereotypical "gray" Schwa alien rather than something original. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful montage sequences, but McQuaid opt for flashy effects - divider screens, overhead shots don't serve the story. I was impressed by a repeating blue screen device that overloaded the main characters' heads over other backgrounds. Less effective was a recurring 'Creepshow' style motif of camera shots featuring moral actors' faces in drawings that resemble panel art from the 1950's EC horror comics. I am a fan of EC Comics, but they are not in the 19th century Ireland. The money McQuaid spent on flashy photo F / X - showing his editing skills without serving the story - had to be spent on accurate costumes. <br /> <br /> LARGE SPOILERS NOW. Ron Perlman gives an "Oirish" show full of acting games. He plays a 19th-century Irish priest. He writes with his left hand. (In Victorian Ireland, left-handed children were punished for using "the devil's hand" and were violently guided to become rights.) But Perlman's character seems to have a reason to hide his right hand. Elsewhere a character is bitten by a zombie, but has no bad effects, so I knew there would be a payout later. Several scenes that are more logical at night are shot in the daylight, apparently just because it was easier and cheaper. (Since McQuaid is a skilled director and editor, he can easily shoot 'day by night' ... but using a process photography effect to tell the story, he seems less interested than his pointing editing techniques.) <br /> <br /> McQuaid seems to pay tribute to the big old Hammer horror flicks. But the Hammers were so good because the actors and production designers worked hard to convince us that we actually had Whitechapel in 1888, or wherever. Glenn McQuaid shows talent as a director, writer and editor, but in all three abilities here he makes strange choices ... then largely. failure to justify those choices. But I enjoyed 'I Sell the Dead'. I'll rate it 7 out of 10, and I'm looking forward to his next movie.
