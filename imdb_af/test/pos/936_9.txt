This is the last film by Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of the theater. He wanted to retire to this movie, so in a way it is his artistic will. He died a few years after making the film, and although it was said that he was planning to return, Destiny decided it was his last. And what a movie! <br /> <br /> 'Rouge' the last movie in the three-color French trilogy is actually a very Swiss movie. In Geneva, one of the two main characters is a Swiss retired judge, and Durenmatt appears immediately. But there is more Switzerland in the cool atmosphere, in the lack of communication of the characters, in the courtesy that embraces cruelty to life. Several characters starting with a small relationship will eventually come together in a moving and human finale, which could only have been performed by a great artist. <br /> <br /> Little can be said about not a hundred times. Yes, the movie starts slowly, and fans of the American style of action movies or melodramas will only be discouraged and lost as viewers. They deserve it. The film gets quality as it progresses, and one of the not-so-hidden messages is that real life and real people are more interesting than the Hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters. Movie quality is very original, the image is a 'Study in Red', as the title shows. Acting is fantastic, with Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant - the later it will probably remain the best role of his age. <br /> <br /> A great movie. To see it again, probably adds, and I'm happy to record it on tape. 9/10 on my personal scale.
