This jewel captures life brilliantly in the early 80's. As a Grade '83 boy <br /> <br /> I must say that Valley Girl (along with Fast Times at <br /> <br /> Ridgemont High) stands out as the teen sex movie class < br /> <br /> genre. The characters are accurate representatives of the era; the <br /> <br /> vapid mall chicks, pseudo punk rebels, preppy jocks are all <br /> <br /> represented here. <br /> <br /> I've seen it already ten times. The music in the movie was <br /> <br />. Unfortunately, these songs have never been so popular in <br /> <br /> their era like that of arena skaters like Journey, Styx or <br /> <br /> Loverboy. Before the soundtrack existed, I searched records <br /> <br /> and ties (that was the 80's!) From Josie Cotton, Sparks, <br /> <br /> Plimsouls and Modern English. <Br /> <br /> This movie deserves respect. It's not just a good 80's teen movie. This is <br /> <br /> a great movie. Period.
