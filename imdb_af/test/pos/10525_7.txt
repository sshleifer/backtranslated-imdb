This interesting lost movie (written by Terence Malick) stars Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest as two wacky, Southern brothers looking for a seafood restaurant. Margot Kidder was never more beautiful and Forrest had to be nominated. Originally titled The Dion Brothers, this light movie with a violent ending is a pure joy! <br /> <br /> Where's this movie? I've been looking for it for 30 years. Keach has always been great and I'm surprised it doesn't follow a cult anymore (maybe). These guys are cracking with more ambition than brain, but totally sweet dudes! A 7 out of 10. If you can dig it somewhere, you'll have fun.
