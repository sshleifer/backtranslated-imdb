One of the best movies I've ever seen - a classic "Matrix" movie. For many years I've been trying to get it on VHS or DVD - to no avail. The German film and television industry still prefers to give valuable cultural contributions (and that is Fassbinder!), Rot and collects dust in an archive rather than distributing it commercially (and makes a lot of money if it stimulates them instead of promoting creative thinking). Although the WDR once told me I paid DM 200.00 to check the copyright (non-reimbursable) and then DM 8 per minute of copying, plus the cost of the material, they would consider a ( single!) Copy for me. Somehow to sell something! The same problem we have with many other TV movies or series like "So weit die Füße tragen", "Sonntagseltern", "Kellerkinder" and others. Excellent TV series - never heard again. Germany, wake up! <br /> <br /> UPDATE from March 2007: Last year I could finally get a DVD copy of the Mittschnittservice from the WDR for about 50+ Euros. Great!
