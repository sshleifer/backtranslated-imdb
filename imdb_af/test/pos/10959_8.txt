Shadow breathes the smell of New York's streets like no movie before it. This kick-off of Cassavetes's legal services is as atmospheric as the political and initial spark for a renewal in the American cinema. Maybe it's asking Cassavetes' first job in a dual function with another debut, Godard's bout the souffle. Both films have formed the film production of their countries for decades, and both particular light and enthusiasm have rarely reached them by the filmmakers in their career. <br /> <br /> Shadows tell of three African-American brothers and sisters, Ben (Ben Carruthers), Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) and Hugh (Hugh Hurd). The story is in the New York jazz environment and the rhythm on the soundtrack plays an important role in the feverish, sometimes almost dreamlike, atmosphere of the entire film. There is not much happening in the plot. The daily lives of the three brothers and sisters are defined by problems in love affair or in their work, but on both levels the normality is deceived. Without moral disability, Cassavetes merely describes the mechanism of racial exclusion, in public and private life. This was a breakthrough film in the US regarding the film image of racism. <br /> <br /> This film is also very much due to the performances of the three leading actors who were all almost completely unknown. Ben Carruthers in particular, with his energetic depiction, established the image of a new self-image of young urban blacks in America, an image that distinguishes Spike Lee's 80s and 90s films. By the way, none of the three undoubtedly extremely talented actors could start a great career afterwards. Hollywood was not and is not ready to expand its star system ethnically. Therefore, Goldoni, Hurd and Carruthers first found small artistic niches in television and independent films later. <br /> <br /> Perhaps shadows are one of the less "beautiful" films ever shot, and one of the most beautiful at the same time; a film of shades and spaces, with a camera just watching the stream of life in busy street corners, bars, hotel lobbies, apartments, an intriguing walk through the vibrant streets of New York.
