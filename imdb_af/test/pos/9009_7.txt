Spin-offs, for someone who doesn't know, are usually not successful because most original characters are absent. <br /> <br /> Here they are and you can't ask for a better ensemble that is essentially. a crazy cartoon, not meant to do anything, but to entertain. <br /> <br /> JP Manoux, who replaces David Spade, does an admirable job of retaining Kuzco's ego and doesn't look as annoying as Spade's character (a character Spade has been doing for decades and after came to his nerves for a while). He has a softer voice, but it fits in some way. <br /> <br /> Eartha Kitt, who portrays her as Yzma, is brilliant. She has not been given much awards since being Batwoman for centuries, except perhaps for her dirty part in Boomerang. It's funny how big the character looks like her. <br /> <br /> And Patrick Warburton. There is no way he can't be funny, unless he is thoroughly messed up in men in black 2. I was a fan of her since Seinfeld, but unlike that character, he plays a really nice man who doesn't suck do not become. so nice things. <br /> <br /> The animation is really nice as all Disney is usually, but sometimes the character design is a bit too sugar-covered. Oh, well. Two out of three is not bad.
