especially since I can count on the romantic comedy movies I've ever enjoyed on one hand. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver is very much like the heart transplant patient, who has a mysterious relationship with Duchovny's newly-died wife. (I can think of several horrible movies that used this story line. I think there was an LMN movie with Jane Seymour). However, this film is a custodian. Duchovny is sympathetic and the scenes With his dog is cute and sad - the dog misses his late wife. All his friends want him to find a replacement, and there is an amusing scene where he is on a blind day and the driver is the waitress. His date is terrible, and he finds himself busy with Minnie Driver. <br /> <br /> Caroll O'Connor is also good at one of his last roles, such as the ancient grandfather. Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi (it's the only movie I liked about him) to finish off the comedy aspect of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie because the story works, it's not excessively romantic, and doesn't insult the audience's intelligence. Highly recommended 9/10.
