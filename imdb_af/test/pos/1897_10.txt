The best so-bad-good movie ever made. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether it's the daily life or pimping hooves in the block, I can always look at him for inspiration and guidance. When it comes to blaxploitation, Rudy is the man. Nobody is congregation. Look at Dolemite as he and his army of all female kungfu killers mr. Big and Willie Green decline. Awesome plot, huh? There are so many one-liners that several views are needed to improve your vocabulary. If you say a few lines of Dolemite, you're instantly cool. If you're in the mood for a lazy riot, rent this movie. Also check out The Human Tornado, Disco Godfather, and Petey Wheatstraw, the Devil's son-in-law. Now you can dig it? <br /> <br /> "You have no business interruption, uncertain, gear soup-eating, motha !!"
