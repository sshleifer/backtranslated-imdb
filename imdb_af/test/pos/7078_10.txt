Meryl Streep can be the biggest actor today. Her chameleonic depictions never fail to surprise; she actually looks the characters she brings to the screen. In a real thing, "she gives life to a fraudulent, extremely complex woman who does her best to play the hand that gave her life. Survival with cancer is not an easy task, and not only survives, but actually the life of your life remains even more difficult - and that is exactly what Kate Gulden (Streep) means to do. Renee Zellweger ("Jerry Maguire") not only holds her own in this lofty company, but shines like Stripe's daughter who learns to see her parents' lives in her own life. Streep is a power station and deserves an Oscar nomination for her work here; her "I'll just say it once." The dialogue with Zellweger will ruin you. Zellweger, however, is the true revelation - her face carries every emotion, every conflict as she begins to learn the many truths about her parents' strengths and weaknesses. Director Carl Franklin ("devil in a blue dress") handles the extremely difficult story material with certainty and delicacy.
