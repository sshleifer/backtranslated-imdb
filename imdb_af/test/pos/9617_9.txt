I was first introduced to this movie while in San Antonio, Tx. This movie was the 2nd. in a dual function. Unfortunately, the theater where I saw it broke down. Anyways, Five Fingers of Death (also known as King Boxer), was released in 1972 and launched in the US the following year. Like a lot of other "Kung-Fu" movies released while on the "dress-tails" of Enter the Dragon, this particular movie was actually pretty good. This is the story of a country boy sent to a martial artist to improve himself and his fighting skills. Meanwhile, the "opponent" martial arts school plans and scheme to weaken our hero, using dirty tactics to try and kick him off and try to prevent him from participating in the tournament. Surprisingly, I thought since Warner Bros. spread this movie in the US, Warner Bros. will issue a DVD. It never happened. As far as I know, this movie is released in both English and Cantonise, w / sub titles ..... the latter is a more "cleaner & clearer" version. Although the battle order is a little funny to look at (ie: flying in the air and hitting, jumping on buildings, a fighter using his head .... literally .... hitting his opponent, etc.) , But it's classic kung-fu action wonderfully planned and executed. If you come from the Dragon, Five Fingers of Death will be an excellent addition to any movie collection ... if you can find it.
