This late 50-year-old French study of undivided youths (in their early 20s, actually - "grown up" but not yet established in the adult world) probably missed the point by a mile in terms of an accurate portrayal of 1958 French youth. (Don't do almost ALL youth films made by adults)? Those who do not keep the river's edge in mind are hardly indeed, but director writer Marcel Carne, of Les Enfants du Paradis fame, is also an accurate observer of mankind to NOT an insightful view of the essence of this give characters. In that sense, the details are not important - you can change the details and set this film today and it will work just as well - but the loneliness and insecurity and superficial passion and self-righteous anger of the characters are well captured. Young Pierre Brice and Jean-Paul Belmondo play roles, but lead Jacques Charrier, Laurent Terzieff, Pascale Petit and Andrea Parisy play the roles with subtlety and depth. There is also a good jazz score, which you can get on the CD JAZZ IN PARIS - JAZZ & CINEMA VOL. 2. Unlike some who commented on the film, I don't really see director-writer Carne as a judgment on these characters. He seems to be an objective observer to me. Of course, these middle-class characters may look like people who are spoiled and don't look at the film's workers, and I think Carne is aware of that. For this American viewer (I have seen a baptized, fairly literally, I want to say, version of this title THE CHEATERS), the film offers an interesting window in the France of the 1950s. It is also self-consciously poetic (the scene on the list, which saves the cat is but one example of this) and has intellectual aspirations in the beautiful way that only French movies can get away - I can imagine the hard-hearted, melodramatic, level way of this type of material would be handled by an American studio production and the sensational, moral, suggestive way this type of material would be handled by American intrusion and exploitation makers. I feel that Marcel Carne caught the essence of that period between, for example, high school graduation and when people got used to a routine early in the 30's, regardless of the routine. Those who are willing to watch the film with an open mind and not flee away with the very easy targets it offers should find a serious and valuable study of people in their early twenties. And even if you don't want to do that, you can go in the other room while the movie plays and just enjoys the fine soundtrack, with a great 50-year-old jazz and instrumental doll, including the amazing original American American score. Jazz at the Philharmonic group, including Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz (spelled goetz in credits), Roy Eldridge and Ray Brown.
