The characters of Ma & Pa Kettle were very popular and controversial. The movies portrayed by their brothers paved the way for television sets that came after and tried to imitate his winning formula. One clear reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies', where the new house with oil money was bought, not won in a game. You can even say that the so-called Newhart soccer tournament lends its idea of ​​backward rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder whether Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based writer who created these characters, has done no more harm than good. Her portrayal of mountain billy characters makes them the buttocks of many jokes in terms of their alleged messiness and laziness. (The real life family that Macdonald's Kettles based has sued successfully ... claiming they were ridiculous and humiliated with these less-flattering references). Certainly, it is comedy and the situations bring us lots of laughter and fun people ... and political correctness as we know it today did not exist in the 1940s and 1950s. But I think Macdonald could have written these characters even more meaningfully and Universal International could show his screenwriters on the screen with more dignity (there is something like good taste). The more realistic moments are when the eldest son Tom is ashamed of his rural heritage, but learns to accept his parents and brothers and sisters for whom they are. For them, the Boilers must realize that they are not exactly fit in a modern world. It's not a joke ... it's a sober truth.
