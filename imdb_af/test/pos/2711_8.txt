There is a clever play in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to sing Karen for the studio owner. <br /> <br /> Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing, so Karen sings over her natural range. You can see a glimpse of enthusiasm on the owner's face; He figures she can't really sing. Richard soon realized his mistake and tried another key. The next thing you hear is Karen's wonderful, beautiful voice, and the owner does a valuable double task. Well done! For some reason I never forgot that scene. <br /> <br /> The Karen Carpenter Story chronicles the meteoric rise of carpenters and Karen's struggle to overcome anorexia. There are many things left over. It's not a documentary, and the movie left me with many questions. Very little is mentioned about Karen's solo business (the CD was released just a few years ago. If you buy it, you will wonder why they were waiting. It's Karen's best work. The songs aren't as timeless as her work with brother Richard, but it was a good recording, in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I heard it said you could listen to a cheap and timely little radio in the middle of the Third World, it looks more static than anything else. But when a Carpenter song comes on the radio, you'll think you're listening to a $ 1000 Hi-Fidelity unit. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie!
