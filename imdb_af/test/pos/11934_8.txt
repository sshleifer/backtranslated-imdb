I saw this movie a year and a half ago and I loved it. I decided to get the DVD for my birthday last year. It has the right amount of tension, action and drama. This movie is about prep school The Regis School and its full of rebellious children, in which one child William Tepper (Sean Astin) hardly adjusts due to previous rejections from other schools because they could not control his rebellious act and now at The Regis School commits more acts Of a rebellion, the school is taken over by the terrorists on a random day and the real reason for this is that Luis Cali's father (Andrew Divoff )'s father was sent to prison. The leader will do everything to kill the students, set bombs and so on to get his father back. <br /> <br /> Alongside William Tepper are his rebellious friends at Regis School. One is especially Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton), in which this man has a turbulent past to stay in a Mafia family and to be sent o The Regis school because he hates his dad for who he is and what he should now deal with these terrorists who take over the school, so that William, Joey, and there friends should gather to stop these terrorists from violent acts and dangerous tactics. /> <br /> This movie was really great and I believe people should notice it more, because when people think of a good hostage movie, they will say "Die Hard" and although I have to agree with them, they must admit that Toy Soldiers were a good thriller. It certainly struck my heart because the students are my age and I will be afraid to confront terrorists like those if they took over our school ... But overall, this movie is really worth the effort 112 minutes of your time and if I decided to rent or buy it, I will buy it! I recommend it with lots of hype! 8/10
