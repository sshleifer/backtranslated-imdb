A very interesting documentary - certainly much more than Sideways, a pseudo-wino drama - where capitalist conspiracy is revealed in all its greed. According to the documentary documentation - and confirmed by the recent publication of a biography on Parker - only two men dictate the wines in the world: Robert Parker of Massachetsets and Michel Rolland, a French wine industry expert in Bordeaux and also known as a "flying winemaker ". The director is smart enough to raise interviews with local wine producers in many different regions of France, from Sicily to Argentina and interviewing the biggest players in the industry, such as the Mondavi family, about the globalization of winemaking and marketing to uncover. A must see for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry. Drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial act if you have looked at this well-made documentary tray.
