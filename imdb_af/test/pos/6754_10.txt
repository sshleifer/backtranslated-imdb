I still can't believe Starevich made this film in 1934. Animation is simply perfect, and what's incredible about it. With all the advanced technology we have today, there are few animation studios that are capable of producing a jewel like this. a. It has everything: a wonderful story, beautiful trekkers (though in some cases it is a morbid beauty), special effects. Well, it's definitely not a children's movie, but it's a must-see for anyone who is seriously interested in animation.
