It's a nice movie with good performances by Paz Vega and Leonardo Sbaraglia. Of course, Vicente Aranda is a legend in the Spanish cinema and certainly one of the great directors in the Spanish cinema, but I don't think it's one of his best movies, even if it's good. The script plays with the introduction of Merime√© as a character, it's a good touch, but it's incredible. The music was compiled by Jose Nieto, National Spanish Prize in the cinema. I mean this movie is very good in all technical aspects. There are many good actors in supporting roles like Antonio Dechent, Maria Botto and others. I give it 7 out of 10 because I think it can be a better movie, but as it is, it is not boring at all.
