I don't usually like romantic movies, but I love this movie very much. The story is really touching, and the end is very appropriate. I feel that I am giving many characters in this movie. I feel that I can feel their feelings. While most romantic films always let me loose and feel bored, this one makes me totally involved, from the scene of Capshaw running with Scott to the end of the scene. I want to rate this movie 11 out of 10 because I want to give an extra one point for the end. The acting part is very strong. Kate Capshaw has a great opportunity to show her talent. Although I'm not impressed with Scott in Dead Man on Campus, this movie completely changes my point of view to him. He is so irresistibly charming here. Geraldine McEwan is as fantastic as ever. <br /> <br /> This movie cannot be as good, complex, deep or credible as other films that deal a bit with the same kind of relationship, like 'L' ecole de la chair 'or' Post coitum, animal sad, but 'The Love Letter' can still be proud of itself, as it casts a rare other light on that kind of relationship. And the difference makes this movie extremely enjoyable. By being relentless and relying on great charms of small stars, Dreamworks, you truly make my dream come true.
