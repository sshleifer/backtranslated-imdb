If I just saw it, I find it hard to believe it's not better known. These and the slightly better known, but almost shamefully neglected KOME AND SEE (Klimov, 1986) must be two of the greatest war films. They are significant, powerful, offensive. The ASCENT is also gifted with a sparse but brilliant messy score by Schnittke.
