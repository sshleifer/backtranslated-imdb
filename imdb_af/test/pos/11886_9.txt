If you are looking for a kung-fu action movie, look elsewhere. While fighting scenes, the film revolves around its provincial protagonist, struggling to find its way into the US canton. In contrast to most "kung-fu comedies", the action is used to enhance the comedy, rather than the other way around. <br /> <br /> Cheung Booi is a statement about the fake nature of kung-fu movies, where the stars always seem a reason to fight. Instead of a big drama about honor and respect, minor misunderstandings cause the characters to scream and start beating each other. <br /> <br /> My aunt, as it is known in the West, is the story of Cheng Tai-nun, played by Kara Hui, who is a young woman who marries an owner of land for his possessions dropped into the hands of his greedy and corrupt brother. After he died, she moved to Canton to live with her cousin, played by director Lau Kar Leung, and his son Ah Tao, who was played by Hsiao Ho. <br /> <br /> The basis of the irony is that although Cheng is the same age as Ah Tao, her way is more akin to her status than his step-aunt. While Ah Tao speaks English (extremely weak), plays the guitar and goes to costume parties, Cheng is completely missing as she tries to adapt to her lifestyle in the Canton, complete with makeup, stylish gowns, high heels and dance screens. <br /> <br /> This makes this movie wonderful, it realizes. Lau Kar Leung may be one of the biggest, if not the greatest, director of his generation in Hong Kong, and Kara Hui won the best film award in Hong Kong in 1982. It's probably also Hsiao Ho's best performance. His chemistry with Hui is remarkable, and while still having a great career in kung-fu comedies, which often works alongside Sammo Hung, he has the perfect combination of athletics and comedy. As the romantic tension and plot build in the second half of the movie, his whole face changes. He no longer makes him easy through life without care in the world. He becomes the straight man and his cohorts, the Kramer, Elaine and George. <br /> <br /> My one complaint is how suddenly the comic aspects of the movie disappear during the conclusion. The film is transmitted from direct farce to dramatic plot with little but a change in casual music. But there is some symmetry in it. The movie starts with the intrigue, focuses more on Lau Kar Leung's character, and it also ends. But the final scene returns to the movie's comic roots, resulting in both aspects of the film.
