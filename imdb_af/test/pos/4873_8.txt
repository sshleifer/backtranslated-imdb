Remember, a friend in college who always insisted on renting the weirdest movie possible? This is the movie he would have made if he had the chance. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell you exactly what Sea of ​​Dust is about. It seems to be the story of a doctor sucked into the "Black Forest" in strange creatures. He goes there to help, but is eventually caught between two young women, both of whom he apparently has something to do. But it just scratched the surface. This is the kind of movie where things just happen randomly ... and not nice stuff. People are constantly beaten and stabbed. There are some creepy little girls who apparently walked out of The Shining. Tom Savini is a kind of imaginary religious figure who decides he doesn't want to be imaginary anymore. He has a plan to take over the world by sharing Jesus' suffering. <br /> <br /> At some level, it's a movie about sex. It is one without nudity, which was a disappointment, but the intention is not wrong. On another level, it's a stoner paradise. Unexpected things happen so often that it ceases to be unexpected. By the time the doctor moves through his girl's birth canal to be born again, you will only make it into the crazy nature of the movie. <br /> <br /> At the bottom, the movie is beautiful. Some of the points are hammered over and over. If you look at it with a lot of stoned friends, it can be an asset.
