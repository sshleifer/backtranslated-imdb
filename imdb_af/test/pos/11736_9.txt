I always loved that scratchy man in all the westerns. He was the sidekick (Jingles) in the Wild Bill Hickock show in the fifties. In it he has the perfect vehicle for his wonderful bragging character. He is harmless and nobody believes him, but he is unashamed and goes anyway. If you have such a man, there is no challenge, because the details are not there to cut. Of course, in this episode he is aboard a spacecraft through a group of strangers who have no sense of humor and believe everything they hear. They do not have the word in their vocabulary. As it turns out, he is so unbearable that he cannot handle him; And then of course there is the secret weapon. Just look at Andy.
