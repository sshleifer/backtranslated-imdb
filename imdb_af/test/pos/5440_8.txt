The film is more of a mockumentary of corruption throughout the American system. The correlations of those who don't matter are so proven in the machines that cease to vote for a comedian at the oval office. Politicians are such a joke that we almost need a cartoon to represent us if we have been laughing over the world for years. Bushism has become a way of life for the Americans and will be the only thing left after not leaving the office soon. Oddly enough, the only person of honesty is someone who is not even chosen in the position and ultimately tells the truth. The story is very subtle and if you go to the laugh, it doesn't happen. Leaves a lot for thoughts. Overall I enjoyed it.
