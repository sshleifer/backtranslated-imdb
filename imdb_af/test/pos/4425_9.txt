Then again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. I just have to change just about everything she makes when I'm a vegetarian ... but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still seems to be on earth. The studio seems to be small, but it just makes for a pleasant environment. Some people have posted that the show sucks. I think it depends on your own interpretation of it and of her. If you see the early 30-minute meal episodes, you'll see a completely different personality than in the past few years. I'm sure she will also find her comfort zone with this show. Good luck, Rachael!
