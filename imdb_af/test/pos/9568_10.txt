It must be the funniest movie I've ever seen. Chritopher Guest is truly talented. He has a gift for humor. I almost died and laughed. Actually, when I watched it in theaters, I was considering going out because the movie was so stupid. But it is stupid in a good way. It's funny-stupid. And it's a very good combination. You will laugh from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> This mock-documentary movie follows a variety of characters who all compete at the Kennel Club Dogshow. The film includes Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, John Michael Higgens, Michael McKean, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge and more. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny movie that will all laugh. Someone who is born without a personality will laugh at this movie. It is widescreened to give the impression that you are viewing a real documentary document and that is probably what adds to the hilarity. BEST IN SHOW: 5/5.
