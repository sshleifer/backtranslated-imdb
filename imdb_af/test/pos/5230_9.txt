Best cinematography I've ever seen? Considering the year the movie was made, I was absolutely amazed and thoroughly impressed with the amount of attention paid to the screen and the authenticity. Although I am not a Western movie buffer in particular, every single scene is given the greatest detail, and it is haunting. There is a genuine connection with nature. Sometimes I am overwhelmed with the amount of action going through the screens, but I never get bored. I feel like I'm really peering into a time machine and looking back at the old west. I recommend this movie to anyone studying set design, location planning, and of course photography in general. It can be a humiliating film to experience with the footage that this era of digital touch takes into consideration that we are experiencing now.
