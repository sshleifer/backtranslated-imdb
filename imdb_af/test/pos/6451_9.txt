If it was made 2 years later, it would have been BANNED! The number one MUST see a recommendation of the day! The best Rouben Mamoulian movie I've seen so far (hasn't seen J + H yet) <br /> <br /> It's no wonder why this movie has less than 200 votes. A bigger gray zone that can no longer care about what is proper will not be seen until the 60's. As morally ambiguous and dark as 70's, but also with a certain charm. Of course it had to be low in the later 30's and unfortunately it didn't seem to be rediscovered. <br /> <br /> Serious. It has everything. Big actors: Gary Cooper, Sylvia Sidney and not so lovely Guy Kibbee at the time. And a great good director. So far I have not been RM's biggest fans, but I have liked many of his films and with that he goes to a new league. One of the best 30's movies I've ever seen! It's something I never thought even existed! 9.5 / 10
