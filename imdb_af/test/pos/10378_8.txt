Don't expect a classic military comedy, claiming to make the military fun as it only increases a military outlook. Instead, deconstruct the elements that make the army such a murderous machine. Type of East German version of "Buffalo Soldiers". <br /> <br /> "NVA" works at a meta-level that sympathizes with his heroes' attempts to escape from lower drill any way they can. It's not about hard laughs, but about long-lasting smiles. Utopia, of course (in one scene you will be the hard reality), but very considerate. <br /> <br /> Just to fill the required 10 lines: Don't go in that movie if you were an army officer. and love your work.
