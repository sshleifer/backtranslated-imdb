First, ignore the comment on how South Park should make Republicans a pleasure. Everyone is doing it now, why should South Park blindly follow the rest of the media? And what the Republicans do is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his world-wide hysteria. <br /> <br /> But all that is set aside is this episode is just funny. Al Gore's depiction must be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original and it was based on people's views of the man. I don't want to throw anything away, but it made me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> There are also some of the best Cartman / Kyle moments ever. <br /> <br /> Everything in everything I want to say is one of the best episodes the show ever had, and I would recommend it.
