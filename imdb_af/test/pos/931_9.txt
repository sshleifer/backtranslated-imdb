and there is not much in theater history. "Rouge" seems to be a bit of a heap. Hope in man and in life. But just to say it may be naive. Kieslowski can find the right way to tell the story of the bitter judge and the twentieth but wise model. Perhaps the old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated - there is the new couple with the young judge after the accident. But what to say about this master of the camera? You can't miss a second of the movie, because you have to look at each of the faces. Kieslowski loved people and it is very clear in the way the camera deals with the actors. Mrs. Jacob and Mr. Tringtantant is perfect. It's not just this movie, but the cunning "You won't kill" and "A story of love" that you can think of contemporary theater as a way to express an artist's standpoint. Sorry American audiences - the average one - can't see these movies. At least they are not in the Maltein's dictionary. And even the baseline doesn't know what to say about this unique man. abel posadas
