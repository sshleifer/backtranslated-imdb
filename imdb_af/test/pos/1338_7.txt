This movie is the most traumatic and painful horror movie I've ever seen in my life. Knowing that this film is based on a true story and Jeffrey Dahmer's (Carl Crew's) brutal murder, his victims are enough to bring a tear to my eye. I admit it was a low budget movie with not the best dialogue, but it explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a psikotic maniac. Being so selfish / inwardly emotional, his emotions and selfishness went so deep into his brain that he became a murderer. Every person he had attracted to his apartment was attracted to and had feelings and the reasons why he had killed them were not just the excitement of killing them, but because he couldn't cope with the fact that they leave him. In the scene when he killed his first victim, he threw an object at the back of the guys. He didn't know he wanted to kill him, but because he was devastated by the idea that the man had left him. From then on, he made use of the murderous behavior and killed his hobby for both evil and emotional reasons. <br /> <br /> The scene when he talks while crying with his mother and telling her how much he loved her and the love he showed to his grandmother and how he didn't want to go out of her house, prove that he had love in his heart. One scene that I found rather spooky and strange was when Jeffrey a priest heard in a bar that a man returned to his apartment and then Jeffrey phoned in a bar in the bar so that the man could lose patience and his mind changes home with Jeffrey. When the man left the bar, the priest hung the phone and laughed at Jeffrey. I also found that Carl Crew played a remarkable performance as the role of Jeffrey Dahmer. His evil and cold bloody facial expressions before killing his victims were so real, I was shaking in my seat. His facial expressions reminded me of the way Vincent D'onofrio (Private Pyle / Leonard) in the movie 'Full Metal Jacket' just before he crashed into the toilet in the toilet racks. <br /> <br /> If you are an emotional person, I would not recommend you to watch this movie, but if you don't, than to see it.
