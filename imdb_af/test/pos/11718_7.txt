I think it's one of Burts' top five movies, along with Deliverance, Smokey and the Bandit, Boogie Nights and City Heat. He also directed this one so he also had a talent like his friend, Clint Eastwood. I wish he made more movies like this, or even a successor to Sharkys machine than that of Stroker Ace or Cannonball Run II. It's a tough, funny cop thriller with Reynolds at the top of his game. With the beautiful Rachel Ward in it from Thorn Birds, fame also helped. Henry Silva is the bad guy and he always does good work. The film is also a good soundtrack. I recommend it, wishing it was on DVD in the UK, a sound comment from Reynolds would also be good. *** 10/07 ***
