This movie gave me nightmares, with Alan Rickman's voice representing a ubiquitous, treacherous, fascist ruler. The scary movie I've ever seen - psychological terror more powerful than anything that a horror movie ever achieved. Alan Rickman's voice will always represent me the power and terror of a totalitarian state, reminiscent of Orwell's 1984. This movie describes those who do not care about the reality of much of the current world governments. This film is disturbing, but in a way that everyone should look at - it is a description of a reality that no one should ever experience, but do so much.
