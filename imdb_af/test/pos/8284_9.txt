When I first saw this movie, I was just a little kid and I fell in love. They really no longer make movies like this, I just watch it slightly older and still like it. <br /> <br /> The Humor is perfect and fits well into the movie, all the gags are kind of childish, but will also make adults laugh and in a children's movie it is very rare. <br /> <br /> The animation is incredible and handmade animation is a real fresh air in all the computer animations we see today. The wallpaper is beautiful and the color is wonderful. The characters are just the kind of characters you fall in love with at the moment you start watching girls think Chipmunks are rich and the guys will think the Chipettes. is very sexy. <br /> <br /> The songs are also fun to listen to and some really make you cry or get up and dance, it's also fun to see visual humor to go with them. <br /> <br /> The Voice Performance is great, no doubt, although most of the voice workers have a high pitch, but an interesting thing has come up and this is one of the songs from this movie but the delayed shows the right voices behind them and it's really so nice to watch. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a store or rent somewhere, I say it's really worth seeing and is a perfect family movie. It's absolutely wonderful, words can't express this movie.
