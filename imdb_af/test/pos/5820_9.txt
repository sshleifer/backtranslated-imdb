This light-warmed (for Cassavetes) love story is pleasantly conveyed by two wonderful performances by Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassell. Rowlands was never more beautiful than a repressed, damaged mid-30s woman who met her Seymour match. Cassell is a powder jar of energy and romantic ideas (on his terms). <br /> <br /> There is a great supporting performance by Val Avery as Zelmo Swift and an unusual (as always) Timothy Carey worthy of admission. Made Between Men and a Woman Under the influence of Cass's most accessible film, the heart of anyone (especially the Cassavetes haters) is to claim that his films are too long and heavy. Made my Top Ten that year and didn't see enough people. An 8 out of 10.
