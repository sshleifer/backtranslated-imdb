The beautiful, beautiful, highly versatile and talented Irene Dunne is one of the largest 5 or 6 actresses of the American cinema. In over 21 - as in all her films - she lights the screen with a natural but glamorous presence. She is simultaneously authentic and human, and a charismatic, inspiring model. This role is quintessential Irene Dunne, full of pathos and white and a bit of evil. I love all her movies, and this movie was a fantastic new discovery for me when TCM broadcast it last night. I hope they don't wait years to air it again. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Charles Coburn is one of the biggest characters in all American movies. He often shows variations on the same theme, but I'm not tired of looking at his soft sadness. Here, his character is the perfect foil for Irene Dunne, and he is perfectly portrayed by Coburn. Their conflict in this movie is absolutely fantastic. They never miss a mate. In addition, they represent the central conflict of the film and the moral conflict of Irene Dunne's husband, portrayed by Alexander Knox. <br /> <br /> I'm not so familiar with Knox's work. He was recognizable, but it was just about everyone. But with Dunne and Coburn he threw his own. He delivers a good, nuanced performance. His character has noble motifs made accessible to us by Knox's performance and never held us as a holy grail. He is noble but inconsistent and doubts his ability to successfully complete OCS. His interaction with Dunne is always convincing. Dunne supports him without getting streaky or a martyr, and he responds in kind. Their screens were very well done. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is a fantastic snapshot of a moment and an environment not portrayed in other movies. I do not remind myself at the top of my head of a movie depicting America, but still World War II, but with the end in sight and the focus on establishing the post-war world. Not the ordinary WWII movie! This in itself is interesting; It is also essential for the plot and the movie's message. Unlike other commentators, I thought the climate was good, but not great. Knox delivered it very well, but it was not as "stiff" as the build-up led me to expect. I heard better movie speeches about many similar themes. It served its purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the greater value of the movie was the portrayal of Dunne and Knox's life, reflecting the typical OCS experience. The sense of community among the women living at Palmetto Terrace was absolutely authentic - as did Palmetto Terrace itself, despite the fact that it was, of course, a good boost. The incredibly short encounters between the women and their OCS men. The guidelines of the OCS candidates, mastering the difficult and complex material they had to learn. The detached "basic housing" - of course, hastily built. The tired and worn furniture. The constant and sad short deadlines - to return to the base for lessons, to catch trains after next "posts." Tenants constantly walk in their predecessors and successors in basic housing while moving inside and outside. Yes, I suspect it was a glimpse of a true WWII experience - dressed in some comedy, but very much in its core. I loved it, and I strongly recommend it.
