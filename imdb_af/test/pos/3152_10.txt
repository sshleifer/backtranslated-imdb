I have a little hobby to find really cool pictures out there, which are almost unknown - and then let people know about them. This one is on top of my list to get the word out of this summer. This indie movie (and I mean really indie - not Miramax, Fox Searchlight indie) can be easy to look at the great celluloid maze, but if you want something completely different, you should check this one. <br /> <br /> Actually, I thought it was awesome. I had to know from the DVD cover, front and back, that it would be something completely different, but they all say they are different than hooking you. Well, this one is really quite different. It's in your face: beautiful and scary and unashamed to tell you to wake up. War, peace, 9/11, poetry, even a horrendous kind of music video that is once a "patriotic" song and a strange man in an RV. Should I say more? See it just.
