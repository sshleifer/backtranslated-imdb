This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does not measure up to the 1956 classic, but is a fine movie with enough rough and jerky action and moves along with a good clip. The Ranger looks at a series of mysterious murders that have a sinister pattern for them with peaceful Indians who are the victims of a gang of pirate killers. There are more murders and violence that are usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has underlined racial insensitivity, with commentary spreading throughout the script. The Ranger uses disguises, just as he can to put clues together and uncover the outdoor tires and bring them. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels star in a colorful show that benefits the desert and cactus land from old Tucson. The music score is good, but the well-known William Tell Overture theme is rolled up by interesting fever but lacking the beauty and beauty of the Ranger's traditional theme.
