Eventually I discovered what I thought I was four years old. Having seen the 1960 color version on VHS, I said I remember seeing it in black and white twice before. Now, the IMDb helped me know the truth, that it was broadcast twenty-two (2 productions) in black and white in two successful years, 1955 and 56. These are the ones I remember best than four years old. I didn't realize the 56 broadcast wasn't the same as the 55 broadcast. In 1960 I was 9 and the color production just didn't do it for me. The black and white version was wonderful with just as much awe and wonder impact as today's high-tech movies, even without any computer effects. You must have been there! Please comment if you had a similar response to the b & w version.
