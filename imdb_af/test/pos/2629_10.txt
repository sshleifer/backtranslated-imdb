I only saw this movie thirty years ago, and it remains one of my all-time faves! It's a classic - the intriguing plot, great characters, excitement and shocking turning ends (all against the backdrop of the beautiful Monterey / Big Sur coast) never get old. Roy Thinnes portrays Johnny Brant, a fascinating character who grows more mysteriously as his true identity unfolds. The acting is great and credible; viewers are trapped in the web that develops between the workaholic man, disillusioned woman and the enticing stranger (Thinnes as Brant). I searched for a copy to buy for years. Unfortunately, I don't think about TV movies. Great movie, see it if you can get it.
