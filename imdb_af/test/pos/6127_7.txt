A very strange, disturbing but intriguing movie. I don't think I ever needed to see what one can do with his buttocks, and I doubt I'll ever see it again. It is said that there must be a lot of amusement, like Divine's Jayne Mansfield's classic "The Girl Can Help It" walk, and placing stickers of meat between her legs in a grocery store. A Gritty feels very much like a Russ Meyer movie. In general, poor acting, with the notable exception of Divine.
