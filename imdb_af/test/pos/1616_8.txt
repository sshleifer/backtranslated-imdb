I bought this DVD from Walmart for cheap, and think it would be a typical, straight-to-video sample junk, but it turned out much better than expected. There is really no criticism to say about it. Of course this is a low budget but it just adds to the fun old-fashioned fun. It is very cool and entertaining. <br /> <br /> There's everything: horror, sex, a big plane crash and good characters. And I'll say it's pretty original, cuz it really doesn't come like any other movie I've seen. It has its own unique look, which I liked very much. Therefore, this film deserves credit. I look forward to seeing more of these wonderful movies from "The Scare Master", Brett Piper, which I have never heard before. <br /> <br /> The DVD menu is really creative with rough music playing about it. So it's perfect just to keep it up when you're not ready to sit down and watch. It also features some special features, which are very interesting. But we never see the director or hear him in the comment, must be ashamed. It comes from Edgewood Studios in Vermont, USA. I recommend it to all horror buffs, you will love it!
