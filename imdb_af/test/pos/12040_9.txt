Darr, although a copy of some Hollywood movie, is one of the best movies I've seen. Not only is it beautifully portrayed, it also has good songs and beautiful scenery. Shahrukh is his usual self. His expressions and voice fit his character. I was pleasantly surprised by Sunny Deol's portrayal in the film. He is a bit romantic and loves the movie, unlike his other characters in his other films. In times you feel that Justice has not done its character. Sunny was meant to be portrayed as the good guy in the movie, but eventually it looks like the villain at the end. Juhi Chawla is beautiful and bubbly. She is her usual self. In short, a great love story with passion.
