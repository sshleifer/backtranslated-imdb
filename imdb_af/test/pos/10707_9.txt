For once, a story of hope has highlighted the tragic reality facing our youth. Favela Rising attracts one in a scary, insecure and unfair world and shows through beautiful colors and moves music how one man and his dedicated friends choose not to accept that world and change it through action and art. An entertaining, interesting, emotional, aesthetically beautiful film. I also showed this movie to many high school students, all living in residential areas with poverty and gun violence and they were enchanted by Anderson, the main character. I recommend this movie at all ages of 13 (due to captions and some images of death) of all backgrounds.
