Why did Ramón (Carlos Fuentes) bring his five peers to a ghostly abandoned school building that used to serve the black sheep children? The answer might just be in a diary in his possession that is thought to have been written by his dying father. What they come into contact with is actually a revived episode that includes another group of six. Five of them apparently met graphic fate in the hands of a sadistic security guard (Paul Naschy) who happened about a few years ago. But if they are looking for a way to escape from this place, terror is waiting for their terror, as the terrible moment in time repeats as the group runs for their lives, often in states of panic, as the killer is in a different blood ways. Will Ramón and any of his pals survive this night of horror or be haunted the same night as those before them? <br /> <br /> Stylish Spanish Treasurer has that professional glamor and powerful, shocking violence to suit. Certain spiritual exchanges between characters. In their dialogue, pop culture references are to American horror movies that annoy some viewers. A demented Naschy is really furious with the kids, as he is fleetingly attacking. " A bloodthirsty maniac that performs its violent acts. I found the loud musical cues a bit annoying and the filmmakers often use flashbacks of past events in the film as memories of the audience. I don't think these tricks are necessarily necessary, but feel the director wanted to communicate in depth with the viewer, so using directions and flashbacks. A small distraction for the movie's plot continues to move and the camera follows the pace of the characters and how they respond to the chaotic situation presented to them. Your enjoyment of this movie may ultimately amount to your acceptance of the paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot. Moments revive in time and a murderer apparently stays out of his grave. The turn looks a bit crooked and sudden, but it might (or may not) consider how the story speaks about why Ramon's father was shown among those ghosts, who had revised the two earlier events twice before. I will say that this movie is unlikely to stop when it is explored in detail, but as a slasher movie it is a fresh air.
