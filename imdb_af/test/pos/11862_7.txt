One night at McCool's is one of those movies starting with a huge amount of promise, but as the movie goes on, it gets stupid and loses a lot of time. Liv Tyler plays a manipulative woman who tries to get her own way by attacking her body to every man she meets, all of which falls under her spell. There are a few funny moments in this, but they are less and less degraded than the movie. a comedy farce. Michael Douglas, who plays the assassin, is good like Liv Tyler, though she looks as though she has a little weight since poor. It's ok, but is just unforgettable for the scene in which Liv Tyler rinses her car, you will know what I mean if you see it fella! Shwing !!!!! 7 out of 10 (not).
