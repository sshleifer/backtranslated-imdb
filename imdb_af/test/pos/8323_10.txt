I watched this show in London TV in 1999 and blew away. As another user said - This is what I liked when I first watched 'Jurassic Park'. - Life and death of Dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary. The CG is very lifelike, and the variety of dinosaurs and habitats also shows it very educationally. <br /> <br /> The series takes all that is virtually known about dinosaurs, adding very good ideas about "what it might have been" to make up what looks like a documentary series. What I missed was a small bar constantly in one corner of the screen, between "fiction" and "fact", along with the narrative and the pictures, because you often wonder how much is educating and how much is pure fantasy. <br /> <br /> For a few clues on facts and fiction, you should see the 50-minute "Making Of", which is not only very educational about the CG process, and the collection and inclusion of paleontologists Knowledge in the series, but it is also very funny (Dinosaurs smoke cigarettes and complain about CG animators). <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this series before going to the upcoming Disney Dinosaur movie or watching any Jurassic Park (like) movie again. This will definitely make you much more critical of that movie. The Disney Trailers looked particularly bad.
