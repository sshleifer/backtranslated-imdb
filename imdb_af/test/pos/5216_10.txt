I thought it was an excellent movie. Gary Cole has played the role of a military man who is trapped and unhappy with his wife's fabulous death! Over all, I thought the movie was wonderful, certainly not a boring plot line! It's sad to say, but I think many men can feel this way. I think he should just get a divorce and be asked to be transferred instead of the extreme he went through, but he felt there was no other way out, so he stained his death. I thought it was neat that Cole's real wife played the woman in which he was dissatisfied with the movie. I think what the man did was a bit extreme, but the movie was great! Definitely recommend it!
