That's why it's important to talk about the DVD release instead of just the movie. Crapper stories are a movie that can only deliver one studio in the world. The one that brought our latest and original REAL independent films for 30 plus years: Troma. It's really a very special movie because it's definitely not my favorite of the Troma productions, but released on a disc that's just because of what I just said is one of my most popular and favorite DVDs. Not only counting the many Troma chips I own, counting my entire collection of movies. The film itself is the result of a bad plan to produce a television series directed by a director who is trusted with a significant amount of money (especially for Troma) to make something wonderful and unfinished and incomprehensible material to lay. I stop (or be fired, I don't know what at this moment). To prevent a huge investment being pushed into the toilet, Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz decided to gather a team of directors and actors and use the material as the backbone of one movie. One movie that really consists of two, in the old old Tales From The Crypt Anthology mode, presented by the Crapkeeper who himself by Mr. Kaufman has been played. But, as I said, not quite my own favorite of all their movies. This is largely due to a strange sense of discipline at the various sets, forgetting the harsh Troma rule of "no liquor on the set" discovered by an angry Lloyd and other less respectable employees what Troma at the time of had the filming of the added scenes. All this made it all impossible for Mr. Kaufman to make a valuable product in the editorial room. But Lloyd Kaufman is a genius, and with the awkward plays on an already unfinished product he didn't make much less of a masterpiece. The movie itself is as good as circumstances will enable the most brilliant filmmaker to cut together and it is definitely highly entertaining, totally confusing, loaded with the elements that Troma made great and certainly unique and one of a kind. As a movie itself, but not as brilliant as many other Troma productions. The genius of Independent Cinema, however, made the DVD of this movie so much more than a movie with a few extras. The movie, if the impulse comes, is actually just a part of the whole DVD that is a document of the difficult situation as a whole, are serious film makers in the world who are monopolized by the few Very Large Who Do Not Really Others players on their market grave do not allow. A document of the problems one has to trust people to be on the level, just to find out that freedom is sometimes something difficult to live and realize that accessing a movie budget when the boss is there around, even those can damage who should really know better. The brilliance of this DVD is that the movie is not perfect, and that Lloyd knows it and doesn't want anyone to think it is. The full-length commentary is a show in itself (as is often the case with Mr. Kaufan's sound comments), mixes humor, triggers with those who deserve it, and highly interesting information for anyone interested in Independent Film Making in such a way that Watch again to the movie with these comments straight after watching it on its own merits, it is so interesting to stop. The printed documentary THE THICK BROWN LINE takes us behind the scenes in the different places where Lloyd only visits the sets, sometimes to take over and make the best of what he finds there. We sometimes see him somewhat disillusioned, unlike his appearances in other document making, such as a patch of darkness and apocalypse, both of which are found in the must-own make your own lady movie box set. <br /> <br /> The additional plays with James Gunn (who first started his career at Troma to succeed as a writer and now a director in Hollywood) and Trey Parker (again someone with a Troma exempt start work., to be a national hero with his South Park series later) is entertaining and probably (like much more on this version) a reason for acquiring this disk only for anyone interested in remote the work of these two characters. Posted with much more than what I can mention here (including a SECOND audio comment), this is one of the best Troma DVD releases.
