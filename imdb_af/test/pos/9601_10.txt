I can't add much to what has already been said, unless I need the 10-line minimum policy. <br /> <br /> I actually got it on a VHS-to-DVD copy, but the quality is pretty poor and I desperately need to release it officially. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine what extras I would like to see (Tim Healy's character curses his way through one of those 'Soccer Bloopers' type programs will be good!). You can imagine it now, can't you? But of course, it seems most people will have to continue dreaming about a DVD edition. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there should be someone in the DVD delivery department at ITV who also knows something about British culture, is the web proficient and have enough to watch IMDb every now and then? Oh, well.
