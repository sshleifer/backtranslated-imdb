If one ceases to remind you of the regular screenwork of Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, they are probably best remembered: "They were wearing their shoes" (1941). This is the flowing saga of General Custer (Flynn). He said from the time he entered the West Point military academy and went for the nice Elizabeth Bacon (DeHavilland), through his tenure during the American Civil War, and eventually with his death at Little Big Horn. Director Raoul Walsh highlights his historical epic on the laurels of highly dubious retrieval of historical texts, rewritten by writers, Wally Kline and Aeneas MacKenzie, until truth and fiction are all disproportionate. Therefore, the battle against Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) is portrayed as a cricket match between politicians - California Joe (Charley Grapewin) and an indifferent corporation who wants to return the country that Custer gave to the Indians through the systematic genocide of the Nations first peoples. <br /> <br /> Flynn, who cleverly plays Custer as if he were part of Arnold Schwartzenegger to two parts, Albert Schweitzer, was never more indifferent. He literally smears charm and sexual appeal of every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine. Resident Warner stock players, Arthur Kennedy and Sidney Greenstreet deliver wonderful cameos that have much more depth and character than actually written in their material. <br /> <br /> Overall then, despite its loose history of history. In favor of a good romantic yarn, "They killed with their shoes", is enough filming for a Saturday matinee or Sunday night that goes with your loved one. Warner's DVD is pretty pretty. Although film grain is often obvious, the gray scale is very well rendered with deep, solid blacks and very clean whites. Some fade is obvious during stage transit. The sound is very well cleaned and is presented at an adequate listening level.
