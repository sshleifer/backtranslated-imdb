We all enjoyed the movie. This is a very beautiful family movie with lots of fun cameos. It was fun to see Austin musicians, Charlie Robison, Joe Ely and Robert Earl Keen in the movie, as well as images by well-known actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is especially cute in the movie, but all the kids are good. The West Texas landscape is wonderful as is the soundtrack of Texas artists. The last half accompanied me a little, but my son was interested in the movie, which is not so often with him. Something in the story was fascinating for children. If I showed calves as a kid, I really stopped. This is definitely not the way it really works unless you have verses.
