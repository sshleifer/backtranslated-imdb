In 'Hoot' Logan Lerman plays Roy Eberhardt, the new child in the school who just moved from Montana. But Florida is very different from Montana. In spite of this, problems with mixing in, Roy discovered a bigger problem. A new franchise restaurant is coming to town and families of diggers are in trouble. Can the new kid, a tomboy (Brie Larson) and a runaway (Cody Linley) stop big business to destroy this owl's home? <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty good. The kids (Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley) are the real stars of this movie. Luke Wilson (Delinko Officer) is good, but doesn't really matter. Also not Robert Wagner (Mayor) or Jimmy Buffett (Ryan). <br /> <br /> However, it was a fun movie that the whole family will enjoy. For a first time producer, I thought Jimmy Buffett had put together a good piece of work. Plus the owls were very cute.
