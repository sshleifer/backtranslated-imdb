It is indeed a very long movie. But it's pretty pretty, and a good example to show why cinema can be considered art. An easy-to-tell story cannot be expected in Les Amants Regulars, but every scene tells every silence here over a hundred dialogues. Be different, perfect in his pictures and soundtrack, and show why the film-covered closure as one of his main features has become the greatest innovation in any dramatic performance. Someone who is accustomed to that kind of movies where everything is told and action is taking place all the time will find this exhausting. But it's worth looking at, to find out other possibilities to feel a story.
