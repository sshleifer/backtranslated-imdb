Just to explain, Matthew Poncelet was not a real person, but a character combination of 2 killers who were both convicted and convicted of killing two teenagers. <br /> <br /> I read the user comments and they respond as if Matthew were really. The character is based on a mix of two killers, Elmo Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie (who murdered separate people) and the murder itself was based on the one who committed Willie. The conflict of both Willie who had someone else and both parties swore the other, also worked the murder in the story. <br /> <br /> Prejean's approach is unique in not only giving the condemnation service as they wait for their death and help them take responsibility for their actions, they also reach out to the families of the victims to help them know that they were found guilty, indeed repent of what they did - to help both parties effectively. <br /> <br /> Everyone posting here has strong convictions on the Death Sentence. It's not my place to say it's right or wrong. In theory, death with death punishes some kind of Karmic sentence, but a person denies their freedom for the rest of their days, though expensive, makes me more sense - stuck in a small room 23/7 (with one hours of exercise) for the rest of their days is reminded of the cruel thing they seem to be a more appropriate punishment - they are technically alive but have refused life. Tell someone killed someone so they could come out of the responsibility that the person they killed needed (as Susan Smith kills her poor children by moving her car in a lake). I find it ironic that they would not get the "freedom" they wanted and would now have to spend the rest of their days capturing. <br /> <br /> The story of Prejean comes very well through the story. She has my respect - she manages to find that balance - she doesn't support a killer, they lead them to accept what they've done. If they didn't have a kind of remorse, they wouldn't ask for spiritual guidance. <br /> <br /> Ona final note, when Poncelet gives her apology to Delacroix parent to murder his girlfriend's son, was also murdered murderers, about why he did not apologize for her . I think the point was that the whole film was denied by Poncelet, both children refuse. There is some doubt in Prejean's mind that he has done both murders - there is a friend sentenced but not to death. My thought is that Poncelet killed the Delacroix boy and killed the other man. That's why Poncelet took responsibility for what he did. If he was responsible for the girl's death, he would probably have apologized too.
