This young filmmaker has a talent for quickly capturing his audience with unusual camera work and sparse but intense scripts. The concept here to combine animation with live footage has been remarkably well done and the soundtrack is very good. <br /> <br /> The decision to make the movie in twelve parts online puts the onus on the director to make each episode fascinating. enough for the viewer to invest in the purchase of each upcoming episode. I just wish all movie photos have this kind of commitment to entertain their audiences through their stories. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
