"The love letter" is a somewhat pleasant, very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter evokes the secret passions and desires of a sleepy seabed residents. <Br /> <br /> It's not for all audiences. "The love letter," I feel, it is easy and quiet. Never be deliberately wacky and deceptive like most romantic comedies, but it's beautiful, picturesque and comfortable. However, for this very same reason, many viewers will be bored and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> The role play is nice. It is wonderful to see Tom Selleck again, and is such a subtle role. And it's hard to believe it's the same Kate Capshaw we met in Indiana Jones and the Doom Temple 15 years ago. She is pretty good here, of course; improvement in every role I've seen her since the dress on Indy's nerves. And is it possible Capshaw to be just nicer and nicer with age? (What's with Spielberg!?) <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter too much; but after another noisy summer movie season I will probably look back with love for these light-like-feather novels.
