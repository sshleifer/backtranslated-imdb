Kramer vs Kramer is a tremendous drama about an unhappy woman who walks on her husband and young boy. The man must now take on the responsibilities of caring for the boy. As he learns, they get to know each other better. But then the mother and wife return, and she wants to supervise the boy. "Kramer vs Kramer" has a lot of drama with some great pieces of comedy being thrown in well. Dustin Hoffman won his first best actor Oscar for his brilliant performance here. Most people say his performance in "Rainman", which won him his second Oscar, is his best. He was wonderful in that movie, but I disagree that she's the best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after stage shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. He is sometimes funny too. Also, a tremendous performance is Meryl Streep, who was not as well known when she made this film as she is today. Stripe, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for best supporting actress) for her work in Kramer vs. Kramer as the wife and mother trying to find out after she went out on her family. Justin Henry, who was only 8 years old when the film came out, is wonderful like Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for his role here, and until now he is the youngest artist to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also fine as a family friend. She also has an Oscar nomination (for supporting actress where she lost for co-star Stripe). "Kramer vs Kramer" is a good movie from start to finish. Author-director Robert Benton has made a film that is absolutely memorable. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
