I'm constantly amazed at the American networks. What's the matter with them? Another very promising series is being beaten to just 15 episodes and we didn't know what the hell was going on with everyone. I thoroughly enjoyed this show and am so irritated that we will never find out what happens to the characters and the "monsters" of the depth. This show had everything. Humor, tension, action. What more could you want. Why, why did the plug pull on it? It just does not make sense. Buffy went for 7 series, and it was pretty much better, like Charmed and was enjoyable like Surface, Invasion and Dead Like Me. Just because a show doesn't get terribly high ratings doesn't mean rubbish, and if they have given it a little longer, more people will take it and they will end up with a big hit. One season just doesn't give enough time to catch and the networks are far too eager to pull the plug. They must learn it like good wines and cheeses, they take time to mature. <br /> <br /> Return surface and invasion - P L E A S E !!!!!!!
