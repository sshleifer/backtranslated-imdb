I remember when this movie came out and watched it several times on VHS. I was so happy when it was finally released on DVD. I was hoping for widescreen, but would be about to be available. I like how they used color in the film, the outside scenes are so vibrant with color. The trees are the greenest I've ever seen. Most of the movies were shot in Stillwater, Minnesota, a beautiful village on the St. Croix River. They really had to investigate the places for filming, because they did a good job. The story is well written and directed. I would rate it as one of Peter Horton's best. I'm also surprised that Andrew Dintenfass (the director of photography) didn't do it anymore. He did an incredible job. The acting is also higher. It's amazing to see two young actors from such a young age draw this kind of movie. Annabella Sciorra did a good job as Dexter's mother. Who doesn't want her as a mother.
