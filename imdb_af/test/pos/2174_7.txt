First, let me confess that I did not read this particular Balzac novel, so maybe I am unfairly directing my plots on director and editor. Yet, my experience with Balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist, not an obsurant. It is definitely a worthwhile movie, but one is totally surprised at the end. Was the Colonel a fraud used by the lawyer for his own purposes (or for whom outside himself) or the colonel was not a fraud, but used it as before by the lawyer; Or did the lawyer really try to serve the honest Colonel? The director and / or editor seem to conceal these questions deliberately, which does not seem like the realistic Balzac. At the same time, the film does an excellent job of defining the characters, if not their motives, and the role and production is excellent. The open battlefield scene is bound to haunt your dreams. Yet one is wondering among everyday lovers among contemporary filmmakers to promote in particular uncertainty. Were the problems and motives of all these characters not enough for Yves Angelo?
