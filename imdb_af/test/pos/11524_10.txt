Serendipity. I thought I had a bad start bringing the wrong DVD in the case of "The Intruder". Rental Store personnel! So I didn't want to see this movie, but I'm glad I did. In all likelihood, my chosen movie would not have been such a nice movie, as this delicious and delicate taste of what independents can do in both the US and Europe. Seven years apart, two heroine sisters began early in the 1970s post-student demo / Baader-Meinhof Europe. Striking shot in the Algarve, Portugal; And in Berlin, Paris and Amsterdam (reminiscent of the feelings of the out-of-bounds in Paul Verhoeven's early masterpiece, The Fourth Man), it was remarkably performed by Brewster, Diaz and especially Christopher Ecclestone. The story reveals him on an abstract plot, capturing the ephemeral emotions of these characters as they confront their relationships and see ideas from one another and shatter themselves. A movie with great refinement and taste. Not for Arnie Commando fans, which is probably why the adjudicator claims to be wide-ranging from the point in 'she' being a girly movie. Do the criteria. Wrong too. Well worth the experiment.
