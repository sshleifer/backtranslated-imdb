I think it's so bad and sad coincidence that both John Candy and Chris Farley left us. When they had many things to do. God bless them both. , I think the plots of 2 movies are really similar, Road Trips of two different pole characters, and many unfortunate consequences due to the Chubbies. This movie cannot be airplanes' trains and cars, but it is a very entertaining movie, especially with the big show of Chris Farley, The missing part in this movie is the nice thing when comparing it to Candy & Martin Classic, but I think it's better this way
