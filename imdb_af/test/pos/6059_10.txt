I had the good fortune to be at Perris Island in the fall of 1959. The DI proposed one night at the outside theater in front of our barracks, Plt 162, B ​​Co, 1st Bn, 1st ITR. <br /> <br /> While we were not there long enough to even think about a movie, we could hear those laughing. This is one of the many indelible memories of my thirteen weeks at PI. <br /> <br /> At a later stage, I actually saw it in a theater. I am still convinced that to date this has been the most realistic depiction of the experience of the late 1950s. Nobody did better than Jack Webb.
