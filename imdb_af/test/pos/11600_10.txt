Many Europeans and Americans seem to see Indian movies for the wrong reason; I see that some people complain that this movie had no dance series! A class apart from their Hindi counterparts, Bengal movies tend to be more realistic. Rituparno Ghosh is one of the best young directors in India, widely known for his choice of subjects for the movies and the strength of his scriptures. 'Chokher bali' is a perfect example. A faithful adaptation of the Nobel laureate Tagore's novel, the pursuit of sexual pleasure of a Bengali widow, gives the director a new dimension to the award-winning and controversial work.
