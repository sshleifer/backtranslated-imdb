Hi! To speak Cantonese, I found it very funny and could do all the jokes that one doesn't get because of language boundaries. The battle scenes are spectacular and it's a good movie. However, I have my criticism. First, I find that it is not as good as the first one, and now it is! :-) The reason is that SPOILERS WAS NOT READED FIRST IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE !!!!!) Because in Project A Jackie ends up fighting his enemy; the man he was sent to kill, Sanpao. That's what he tried to do all the movies and the action is spectacular. But in A II, he is fighting Chan, the revealing scene between Jackie and his nemesis is not long enough and most of the action is against the Empress's men. They are not nearly as bad and have only played a small role in the film in relation to Jackie, although their battle order is spectacular, they are not the one Jackie is hunting throughout the film. viewer slightly unfinished. However, this is just my humble opinion, so don't speak the word and see it for yourself! It's a good movie in its own right! Be careful and hope your admiration for Jackie grows! Sincerely, Ian PS. You know the police chief in A II? He's the same man in First Strike to know he's still strong!
