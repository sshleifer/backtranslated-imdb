I liked this movie very much ... but the ads I saw implied, and one published review actually said this movie has "light touch benefits." It is very misleading to me. There is indeed a lot of humor: eccentric, un-subtle, sometimes somewhat twisted humor: the kind of humor I find very attractive indeed. But most of the humor is the kind that is always aware of things that are serious, very sensitive and even very painful. The film combines themes of past and present, perception and truth, memory and activity, life and death. The entire film is fulfilled throughout the history of European anti-Semitism in general and especially in the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> How can Humor and Horror be combined in the same movie? The review I saw suggested that the humor is Absurdist. I don't think that's the case; at least not in common sense. Instead, I think this movie is in the tradition of many Jewish / Yiddish literature and theater. I do not claim to be any kind of expert in this field; but from what I have seen, Humor is used in this cultural context as a management tool for the terrible tragic experiences of these people; and also humor is used as a way to restore the divine to men and women who prefer a path of faith rather than a path of despair or absurdism. See "Fiddler on the Roof" for humor that is used in both ways in this rich tradition. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood (Jonathon) Wood wears horizon glasses that really make him look, compare Sin City when wearing the same kinds of glasses with cooling effect. In this movie it is easy to see how the glasses become a metaphor for both his search and his struggle between perception and truth. Eugene Hutz (Young Alex) and Boris Lesking (Old Alex) are both really wonderful. Jonathon and Young Alex are of the same gender, but look so much, very different; and then find that they are not so different at all. And the way the apparent narrative voice gradually changes from that of Jonathon to that of Young Alex. As a journey of intended discovery for Jonathon, one of the discoveries for both Young Alex and Old Alex ... is moving me so much. <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful scenes and panoramas of (I tell) Prague and surroundings, stand out for Ukraine's storyline. Everyone feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful sense of place; although I have never been to Ukraine myself and can hardly testify to the first-hand experience. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're looking for light comedy, I wouldn't recommend this movie at all. . On the other hand, if you are interested in a wonderful, delicious and deep-moving movie, look at this wonderful movie.
