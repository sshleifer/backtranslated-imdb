That's exactly what I expected. Relax, humorous and entertaining. The acting couple was wonderful, as well as the scene choice. I recommend it personally. It's kind of the movie that can be seen all over the family at the same time without anyone feeling uncomfortable or bored. This cute movie will make you smile and laugh too. And the action scenes are nice. Classic of modern American comedy. And done very well.
