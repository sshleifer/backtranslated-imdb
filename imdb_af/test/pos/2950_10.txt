This movie surprised me. I make it a habit to find as little as possible about movies before attending, because trailers and reviews offer spoiler to spoiler. All I knew when I entered the theater was that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that IMDb readers gave it a 7.8, Rotten Tomatoes users, at 7.9 ranked and the critics on average have a wonderful 8.2! If it is something, they have this jeweler UNDERSTANDED. <br /> <br /> Filmmaker Doug Block has decided to sign his parents "for the offspring" and at the beginning of the film we will be interviewed with his parents, outspoken mother Mina, and less than future Dad, Mike. I immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker (Mike & Mina's son Doug) is going to fetch us. In fact, I doubt Doug himself knew where he was going here! <br /> <br /> Life takes unexpected turns and turns and this beautiful expressive movie follows the journey. It's hard to verbalize how far I was with this story and the unique way it was told. Definitely sounds from start to finish and it's really a must-see even if you're not a fan of the documentary genre. This movie will remind you of your own life and can even recall memories you have thought for a long time. "51 Birch Street" is one of those rare movie-story experiences that make a deep impression and never leave. The best news of all is that HBO had a hand in the production, rather than playing a limited art house group, and eventually millions of people will have a chance to see this amazing piece of work. BRAVO !!!!!!!!
