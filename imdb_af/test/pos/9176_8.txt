'Hitch' is a nice surprise: a romantic comedy that actually has romance and comedy. Most romantic comedies for me range from mediocre to terrible because they are not funny or romantic. "Hitch" takes actors such as Will Smith, Kevin James and Eva Mendes in a fun, light-like-feather trip that really laughs at me and, yes, a little "oh how good!". <br /> <br /> Meet Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), aka Hitch. He is a self-proclaimed 'Date Doctor'; He helps hopeless guys like Albert (Kevin James) win guys like Allegra (Amber Valletta). Unfortunately, Hitch has to deal with Sarah (Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist who is bent on breaking the Date Doctor. <br /> <br /> "Hitch" is actually pretty funny, and it even works the standard slapstick scenes. simply because the rollercoaster is so energetic and clear fun. I have to wonder why Will Smith didn't make movies like this anymore. His sharp, fast firing is perfect for this genre, and his chemistry with Mendes and James is wonderful. James is a true discovery; I have never seen his show 'The King of Queens', but he is funny and sincere, and again proves that fat white men can't dance hip hop (Smith's response to his efforts is hilarious). Mendes is hot and hopefully like Smith's perfect match, and Amber Valletta is sweet like Allegra. <br /> <br /> "Hitch" is not perfect; It's a bit too long, and things get too "dramatic" near the end (though left unhappy with the happy ending filled with funny dance). But it is a major overhaul of the cookie cutter romantic comedies holding junkies.
