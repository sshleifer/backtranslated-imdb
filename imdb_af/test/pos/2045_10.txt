I'm a Geena Davis fan of life because of this movie. I always loved Samuel L Jackson. And the two make a big pair on the screen. That said, I think 'TLKG' is the best action movie I have ever seen, forgetting the revolving endings that the audiences have now expected and that filmmakers are now trying (mostly failing) to take in their movies. <br /> 10/10
