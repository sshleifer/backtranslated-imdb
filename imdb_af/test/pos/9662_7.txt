I must say I didn't expect this movie to be so good. Oriental theater usually offers the communist past in 90% of the films. However, this film surpasses the Roem Ense movie, which is worth more advertising. <br /> <br /> The play is truthful and not exaggerated, the plot is simple but complex as it offers life in the Romanian suburbs, the sound surprised me, directing was good and what else can I say ... <br /> <br /> This "Crash" of Eastern Europe was drawn to me in the movie that lives every moment of it. I even felt a desire coming from me, a desire for adventure after I saw it. <br /> <br /> See it! You will definitely enjoy it! <br /> <br /> 7/10
