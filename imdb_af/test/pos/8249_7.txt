When Pinky, a qualified electrician, is released from prison, his parole officer found him a job at a metropolitan bank. When some of the crime underworld learns from its past, they plan to exploit it and rob the bank. Pinky was initially frightened because he wanted to go straight, but when a lot of the fate happened, Pinky started thinking that one shouldn't see a gift bitch in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Also known as The Mayfair Bank Caper [among others!], this is a very enjoyable piece in the 1970s. London and even though it is highly questionable fashions are lit like a Christmas tree in Ralph Thomas and Guy Elmes's crap. If the viewer can accept David Niven as an older crime, he has some evasion (it's not easy to tell you), then A Nightingale Singing in Berkeley Square can surprise you. The actors aren't sure about trees, but it's really not hurting the picture, it has an honest fun quality that is never less than entertaining. The score and soundtrack may be guilty of over-recovery during the dramatic criminal moments, but it is a slight complaint to make me think it is a British pearl. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan starred Pinky (of course hoping to attract American viewers), 70's heart, Oliver Tobias (a lot of hair), interested around the ladies, while the blocks are pleasant Every summer's face and her beautiful legs for the company. fine enough clip and with a seriously rewarding final, a nightingale song in Berkeley Square deserves much better than the poor 5.7 score here on IMDb, but just how many people saw it, I wonder? Hmm, go on, give it a turn if you The chance, that's good stuff. 7/10
