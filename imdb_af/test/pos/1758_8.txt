Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those movies I grew up with, but a copy can never be obtained until now. I just watched this movie on DVD and thought it was a beautiful and beautiful movie, with great animation, a good plot and good songs. If this movie is made by Disney, the movie will be considered a classic, but because it was made by a little-known movie studio that has long gone, the film slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The movie was created by the Max Fleischer studios at their Miami, FL studios and released by Paramount Pictures. The film had its premiere on December 7, 1941, the date of Pearl Harbor's bombing. Although it may have injured the release of the film, the film has been playing for some one year at some filmmaking, as shown by research. The movie was called a family favorite by most US newspapers. The film is released annually, usually around holiday like Easter, at least in the big cities. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1950s, this film was released under a new name. Hoppity Goes to Town named after the main character in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is a real period, capturing a slice of Americana as it was in the late 30s and 1940s. and many of the characters are very cute. The animation of the people in the movie is via the Rotos purchase process, which means that actors are filmed and then the footage is traced by animateurs. The movement is a very real look. <br /> The Fleishcher studios were one of several animation studios that make animated cartoons in the 30's and 40's, while some of the Fleischer characters such as Betty Boop, Popeye and the Superman cartoons are better known as the work of the studio more or less forgotten. <br /> <br /> Almost the entire work of the Fleischer studios is in the public domain - all Superman cartoons are public domain, though one of the "Color Classics" - series of public domain, and the movie "Gulliver's Travels" is also in the public domain in. This movie never appeared to be released on VHS or DVD in the US, but was released in Europe. But some who look around on the internet can quickly produce a copy. I recommend the search.
