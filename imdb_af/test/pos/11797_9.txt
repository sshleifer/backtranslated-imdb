On more than one level I can relate in a very personal way to what is happening in this movie. And all I can say about it is that it is true, which Dexter's mother told at the end of the story, Eric said at the end of the story: he "healed" her son, by his sad feelings and his loneliness. <br /> <br /> This movie highlights a philosophy that I can very well agree with. We will all die someday sooner or later. In the end this is not the amount of time we live, but the fun / good times / happiness we have at that time. It's not the quantity, but the quality that counts. <br /> <br /> I think all the other words used here will just keep you watching this movie, if you haven't. I really want to see it on DVD. Definitely, it will be added to my all time classics right away!
