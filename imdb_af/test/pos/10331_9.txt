This movie should be easily qualified as a movie <br /> <br /> that promotes human understanding among people. <br /> <br /> Even trying to understand that a young Jewish southern girl could give shelter to an escaped German prisoner of war can be quite annoying. <br /> <br /> Kristy McNichol portrays an incredible portrait of the unhappy young girl thirsty for acceptance and love. Michael Constantine delivered a remarkable performance as her tough father and Esther Rolle, if the girl, Ruth, gave an excellent Emmy winning performance as an understanding girl involved in these events. <br /> <br /> Bruce Davison portrays the German who is allegedly not guilty of Nazi atrocities. So its role seems. He escaped, but he joined the German army and he was perhaps a member of the Hitler youth movement. <br /> <br /> The action takes place in 1944 Georgia, in a rural setting. The townspeople are filled with prejudice. Even the FBI inspector acts as if he wants something about the Jews. Note the opposite interpretation that, as McNichol is in bed, Davison is being rushed and eventually shot. It is interesting to see that society regards McNichol as a traitor to get an escaped prisoner. The film also deals with an extremely complex relationship between father and daughter. Constantine's outburst at his daughter at the end is a few plays. As the mother, Barbara Barrie, is given little to do. It was annoying that she was stereotyped as the typical Jewish mother with that hard lipstick shade on her lips. <br /> <br /> Memorably done and worth watching.
