This film appears again on Channel 13 in the 1990s when they did a series of Hollywood comedies in the 1930s and 1940s. In fact, with the voice of The Jolly Fat Policeman, they got a screen shot to make the range of people laugh, including one of Gary Cooper's shorter movie viewing movies in a movie house - a row of this movie . <br /> <br /> All this starts out innocently if Cooper, a millionaire, is going to a fine department in France to buy pajamas. But he just likes to sleep in the tops. The clerk (Tyler Brooke) insists he can't sell half a pair of pajamas like Cooper wants. Claudette Colbert hears the argument and offers help to help - she just loves to sleep in pajamas. What if Brooke sold them every half? Brooke has never had such an offer, so he goes to the floor hiker (Rolfe Sedan) and asks him if it can be done. He is also disturbed - the request is rather unconventional. Eventually they contact the owner of the shop (Charles Halton). Halton is in bed, and goes out - his skinny frame just supports a pajama top (as a suitable long one for the sake of censorship). Can they sell the two clients one set of pajamas (half for each)? Properly terrified, Halton replies, "No, of course not! It's Communism !!". So the sale is not allowed. Apparently, nobody thinks that Cooper can buy the whole pair and sell half to Colbert. <br /> <br /> Lubitsch's BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE has a reputation for falling flat, most viewers don't like it because of Colbert's character deception. She is considered a true mercenary to Cooper. She sells herself on her terms. <br /> <br /> Actually, Cooper's character is the nastier, because he is rich and figures that all have a prize. He is correct most of the time. Look at the way Colbert's father's father, Edward Everett Horton, sees his new son-in-law as a golden goose he can use. Cooper's willingness to marry Colbert includes an agreement that if he is hesitant or decides not to marry her, he must pay for it. Horton, when he realized this, took out a watch, and (in a reassuring voice) told Cooper: "Take your time with my son!" To make a decision. Later, we see that Horton's wardrobe has become more modern and finer. <br /> <br /> The movie, Billy Wilder's and Charles Brackett's screenplay, compares well to their Mitchell Leisin's MIDNIGHT screenplay (also to Colbert, but to Don Ameche and John Barrymore). There, Colbert is willing to sell herself for a money marriage with (to Francis Lederer), but it becomes complicated by a fictional marriage with Ameche. She really loves Ameche (a taxi driver), but she unexpectedly explains in realistic moments that her parents have "married for love," but poverty has grown to hate each other. It is not found in BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE, where Colbert does not have such a background (after all, she is the daughter of a Marquis). Her mercenary plans are to teach Cooper a lesson on his standards. <br /> <br /> The movie has a beautiful work by supporting staff, including Herman Bing as a private eye that seems to be hiding things that Colbert teaches about, and a young David Niven, what a set of choice moments as a stand in the bag and as a willing ear to Cooper. Coop tells Niven about his problems with Colbert, and how she is so busy. Niven is listening with respect. In the end, Cooper is touched by his willingness to hear what he had to say. "Albert, how much do I pay you?" Cooper asks. Niven thinks and says, "Thirty-five francs a week sir." Cooper looks deep into his soul and says (shakes his head), "That's fair!"
