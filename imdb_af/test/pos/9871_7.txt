I bought it in the budget department last week. I have had Halloween and Halloween II, and since I have been aiming to collect every horror movie ever, I chose it. The first two were good. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty intelligent to tell the truth. It seems to create the right atmosphere, and has a good "Michael Myers history". it uses the old locations of the original, and the main character is the child born laurie in 1978 with the fatal Halloween. <br /> <br /> The climax is also quite satisfactory. Anyway, it's much better than the H20, which is honest, is absolute shit.
