Running out of time is probably as close to a perfect movie as you'll ever see from Hong Kong. All the elements click: a fantastic screenplay (by French writers Julien Carbon and Laurent Courtiaud) that even the weird clich√©, reliable imaginative direction by Johnnie To, and the excellent central performances of Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan, his great comedian timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line in parody (especially in its indignant reactions to its superior negotiating skills). The supporting role-play is also good, with Yo Yo Mung having a strong impression in a small role, and even the often-hysterical Waise Lee (look remarkably, and very appropriately, like a naked Andy Lau), making it okay. It is better not to know too much about the plot that goes beyond the basic setup? With just a few weeks to live, Lau does a criminal game with Wan's policeman, with no obvious motive? just sit back and enjoy the ride: it's definitely worth it. It also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies, and has played in just three screens (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of movies I have already seen). There is also a good score by Raymond Wong. The best cat and mouse on the movie in years.
