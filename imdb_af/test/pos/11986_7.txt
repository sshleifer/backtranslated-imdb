One should take Martin & Lewis like a little salt and pepper. Why does Martin sit with Lewis? Then again, why do all the women in this movie like Jerry? Because he is innocent! Martin sings some good songs (lip-sync'd at least once) and Jerry manages more girls than in all his other movies. I usually find that I can take as much of Jerry's anesthesia before they become aggravating. BUT .... in this movie, watch when Jerry is thrown outside on an underwater submarine! EXCELLENT! Buster Keaton had to be proud. I give the movie a 7.
