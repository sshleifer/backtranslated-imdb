Anyone who has seen the trailer for this movie will be forgiven for thinking this movie is an out-of-out comedy. In fact, it is a light-hearted but not exaggerated funny skirt over some freeways. <br /> <br /> There are many mistakes in the movie. The writing and plot are poor and the love aspect of the story is strange. Still, despite all these things, it's pretty nice, thanks to the two main members, Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller. These two fine actors, especially Carlyle, are always good to look at and there is a good chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Director Jake Scott is the next generation of the family whose brothers, Ridley and Tony, gave our movies like Alien, Blade Runner, True Romance and more recently GI Jane and the enemy of the state. His debut is focused on energy and enthusiasm, which captivates the movie, but without the strong throw he has made, the results couldn't have worked so well. <br /> <br /> In short, if you're looking for an easy enjoyable movie to pass an hour and a half, then you can do much worse than Plunkett and Macleane. If, on the other hand, you want something subtle, historically accurate and thoughts, go elsewhere. 10/07.
