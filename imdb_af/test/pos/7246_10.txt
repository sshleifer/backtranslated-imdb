I give it a 10 out of 10, not because the plot was difficult to uncover, because it wasn't ... but because it made one deal with the characters. The play, by all the role-players, is fantastic, especially Joan Hickson, and it's a wonderful episode because of his heart. <br /> <br /> Miss Marple is called by Jason Rafiel's dying request to investigate and resolve a murder that occurred about seven or eight years ago and discover who, why, and when she goes. Mr Rafiel is the same Rafiel as in a Caribbean Mystery and so there is a sense of a connection here. <br /> <br /> Nemesis is definitely one of the amateur psychologists among us, and if you're one of those just happy with lots of blood, bowel and rip-roaring action ranges, you won't. don't like it. . But if you're like me, someone who likes to know people and discover what makes them tick, then Nemesis is the one for you.
