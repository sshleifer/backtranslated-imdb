THE KITE RUNNER is one of those modern epics that one is sometimes comfortable with. Tension two continents, multiple family generations, and many decades, touch this movie on a myriad of items, including friendship, love, loss and ultimately salvation. <br /> <br /> It is the young swamp of young Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi), a native Afghan boy who often plays with hired help; mainly young Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), a Hazara boy whose family is believed to be inferior to the ruling Afghans. But the two form a friendship relationship based on education (Amir learns to read Hassan), proximity to Amir's home, and of course kite flying. <br /> <br /> But bad times are heading for the city. from Kabul. The communists were invaded and Amir and Hassan divorced because of an unwavering brutal act of prejudice by an Afghan boy against Hassan. The two can never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Amir's dad is chasing himself and his son from Afghanistan and finally finding their way to America. Here the two set up a petrol station and live hand in hand by selling at niche markets. And, as Amir's father gradually becomes ill, a new revelation in Amir's heart will cease; one that he cannot ignore and requires his return to his beloved Kabul. <br /> <br /> A study of friendship, war and reconciliation, The Kite Runner is truly a fantastic piece of cinema. The story is never spoken inappropriate in English when we are in a foreign country, and only broken English when we are in America. It was refreshing and lent itself to a sense of realism. <br /> <br /> The acting was in line with the best you will see. Special notes should be made of Homayoun Ershadi who plays Baba, Amir's ill father and strong patriarch. Also lead Khalid Abdalla as the older Amir played well, especially when he returns to Kabul to find it in ruins; the contrast of when he was gone. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of Afghanistan during Amir's escape and eventual return is nothing short of breathtaking, with snow-capped peaks that let your mouth relax not exactly what mountain range they used in the movie, but where it Anyway, I want to go there and film it myself!) But it's not cinematography or the actions of one or two people making this movie a success. This is a simple story that has been told very well, which makes it worthwhile for any movie-keeper. Highly recommended.
