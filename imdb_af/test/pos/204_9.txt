One of those films I encountered about the Criterion collection, and as usual, surprised me as a change of pace. It was a good decision. I was almost fascinated by the quality of the film, the story that told it and the way it was told. The almost minimalistic feel for the movie with sparse dialogue and almost constant music just added a very exciting level to the movie. It's a great movie to spend and enjoy.
