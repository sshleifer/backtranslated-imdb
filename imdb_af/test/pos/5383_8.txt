Bravestarr was released in 1987 by the now-defunct American animation company Filmation on the back of the Lord: Masters of the Universe and She-Ra: Princess of Power, in 1983 and 87 'respectively. The cartoon of the cartoon was about a native American cowboy named Marshall Bravestarr, who strengthened the bear, ears of the wolf, speed of the puma and the eyes of a hawk, and his trusty sidekick, a talking horse with the name Thirty-Thirty, who carried with him a gun, "Sarah Jane" and with the help of Deputy Fuzz and Judge JB, to protect New Texas from the evil Tex Hex and his band of illegal. <br /> <br /> Set in futuristic Texas, it has been and still is one of the few characters established in a particular US city today. Hence in the South thousands of light years ahead in the future. As it was created in the 80's, the creators have done an impressive job trying to revive the wildlife-western appearance, but from a scientific perspective. Bravestarr not only made morality and good verses bad, but also gave lessons to children about life, but it also emphasized the themes of culture and society and that we should not take things and life for granted. And despite being an action adventure cartoon, many of the story lines, themes, and issues that have been addressed resonate with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them. In addition, Marshall Bravestarr was one of the first major cartoon characters from a (ethnic) minority background to make an impact on TV. <br /> <br /> The sound effects were great, the music was great, the theme song equally memorable and the animation was wonderful. The characters were well-designed and the stories were diverse and taught children's morals and the importance of what is right and what is wrong. Unfortunately, there is something that cannot be said about today's cartoons. <br /> <br /> While being overshadowed by the success of the man, Bravestarr is still a personal favorite for many 80-year-old fanatics. Successful to say, I chose Bravestarr about He's husband because of the variety of story lines, characters and that the depths of the situations and problems faced by the characters were more what I actually realized realistically would say. For some reason they reacted more to people because, for example, in 'The Promise' where a child dies of a drug overdose, the fact that there was no happy ending was not important - in that sense that when children see that episode Well, everyone who watches that episode will realize for themselves the devastating effects of drug use and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs. Brave, brave and sometimes thought-provoking, Bravestarr is certainly brave, brave and mindful. A culturally classic for many years to come, dared to take some risks, but it was good and really paid off. It will be remembered by many cartoon lovers as one of the most interesting as well as the best 80's cartoons ever, and rightly so <br /> <br /> 8 and a half out of ten
