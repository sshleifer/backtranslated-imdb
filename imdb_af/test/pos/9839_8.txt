Frankie Darro was a wonderful kid actor who was excellent at playing pugnacious little toughs with huge slides on their shoulders. He appeared in some top films from the early 30's - The Public Enemy (1931), a crime drama and the Wild Boys of the Road (1933), a topical depression era film about children driving the tracks. He was essentially a younger version of James Cagney. Although his great willingness to do his own bounty, he kept him in a series of programmers when the bigger studios no longer used him. <br /> <br /> "Crime School" had to be a repeat of "The Mayor of Hell", but it had much more humor in it and has The Dead End Kids and Humphrey Bogart as a very ranks Deputy Commissioner offered. "The Mayor of Hell" is really a combination of "Hel's House" / "Crime School" / "Boy's Town". Although Cagney did not make his appearance until the 25th minute, his impact (as usual) was immediate. He plays a baboon on the payroll of a political group run by the crowd. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Smith (Frankie Darro) and his gang (including "Farina" from "Our Gang") run a car wash, but bite more than they can chew when robbing a general store and the owner pushes through a glass pane. They appear before the juvenile court and are sentenced to go to state reform. It is painted in glowing terms - a model school where boys get the opportunity to learn a trade. In fact, it's a hellish place by a sadistic governor, Mr. Thompson (excellently played by Dudley Digges) is managed. The only compassionate person is Dorothy Griffith, the living nurse (played by Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> "Patsy" Gargan (James Cagney) was given the job as a new deputy commissioner. . Upon arriving at school he saw a failed escape attempt and after talking to Dorothy realized the school had to have reforms. He soon ran the school and introduced a "self-government" system - rather towards "Boy's Town". Although Cagney doesn't have much to do, Darro's energy is captured by the gripping climax. After "Patsy" is temporarily out of the picture (he accidentally shoots a gangster and has to leave the state), Thompson returns and his brutal treatment, which leads to the death of a boy ("Skinny"), turns the rest of the boys in a fierce gang. They burn a shed and Thompson falls to his death - "Patsy" just comes back in time to stop the crowd with some sobering talks. <br /> <br /> Sure, all the boys were getting stuck for their crimes, but I disagree with one of the judges - Thompson was more than a "meanie". His sadistic treatment led to a boy's death. There is a scene at the beginning where the boys are served a dishonest scrap. Thompson orders ham and eggs and keeps the butter on the bread while talking to Dorothy. <br /> <br /> Allan Jenkins plays "Uncle" Mike and Sheila Terry, although only if a blonde is photographed, have one of the most memorable lines when she pouts and says: "I thought there were young boys going here be, where are they? "!!! <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
