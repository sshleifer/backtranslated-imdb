I first saw the movie at a video store and as the Bam Margera fan I was, it had to be hired to see what it was all about. Since I have a big and stupid (watch the word stupid) sense of humor, I found this movie absolutely hilaries. Some of the parts are pointless and random, but it makes them so amusing. You have to think things like being slapped in the face and grounded with a watermelon, is funny to appreciate this movie. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> I was also amazed at the acting. These people really did a good job. Nothing Oscar is worthy of, but good enough to get past the amateur level. Teenagers and young adults are likely to find it more entertaining because of the modern snake and situations used. I will not predict that this is being looked after by your parents and vice versa. <br /> <br /> All in all, the play was great, the writing was hilarious, and the story is really something you can talk about.
