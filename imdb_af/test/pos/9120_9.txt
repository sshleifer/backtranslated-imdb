I just saw it as a closing movie from the Austin Film Festival. I saw some pieces of their act at Alamo Drafthouse and thought the trailer was amusing, but I didn't expect such an epic theme music and using tarot cards is genius in the title sequence. Watch out for cameos by Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins, and the dark gentleman himself (who has a fetish for KG). So much top fun and the songs are so catchy. The car hunt was by far my favorite scene. I know it will immediately earn cult status and win some new Tenacious D fans just like me. I hope the theaters are doing well. "Follow me, we are the shadows"
