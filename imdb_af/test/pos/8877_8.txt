The one thing I really can't forget about this movie is the start: classic comedy, made brilliant. I love it. See it for yourself (no spoilers here! :-). The sparring between DeVito and Crystal also glows in this movie, with DeVito as the perfect suppressed boy. One of my favorites. Highly recommended for Crystal fans.
