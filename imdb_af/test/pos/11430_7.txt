Based on the novel The Dismissal by Ermanno Rea, essentially the story of the slow friendship developed between an Italian maintenance technician Vincenzo Buonavolonta (Sergio Castellitto, who can be seen as the villainous King in Prince Caspian, and was starring in Bella Martha) and a Chinese translator Liu Hua (Ling Tai). They actually went the wrong way, with the former chastening of the latter for her inaccurate and slow translations of what he wanted to tell a Chinese delegate who bought equipment that was faulty. Vincenzo wants to do the right thing, which is rare, and that is to tell prospective buyers beforehand the mistakes as well as the complexities that their purchase would bring, and since he is disturbed by the fact that the deal still went ahead, he takes time to make a component that will put things right. <br /> <br /> But it also means traveling to China, looking for the elusive machine, which apparently is well hidden and apparently disappeared. without a trace. With the initial reluctant help of Liu Hua, they started in this treasure hunt from city to city, bringing us to fewer images of China, away from Beijing and Shanghai, cities such as Wuhan, with industries such as backgrounds such as steel mills and nuclear power plants with their smoke stacks that attract the scenery. The mighty Yangtze River also makes an appearance. Along the way comes the usual stumps of such a travel-styled movie, such as learning culture, ideals, food and basically the notion that the world is without strangers, if only one tries to connect. While suggesting some romance between the two leaders, it rarely pointed itself to a point, perhaps late in the movie (hey, lure, no?). Besides the large industrial plants and factories, we see several cottage industries, such as seamstresses working in a sweat shop like environments, and I also believe Cotton, along with noodle. As a movie it gave me the travel opportunity without leaving my seat and admitting that he didn't judge on a moral high ground on exploitation and the containers. And also for the film to enter into a dialogue based on the mother tongue of the characters, rather than (and I will not mention here) some other film and cross-cultural co-operation where dialogue is forced and unnatural and really troublesome. Some may also be the supportive characters too friendly, and always open their arms and doors to a stranger, but I would suggest that perhaps in the more rural areas people generally get more sincere, friendly and basic /> <br /> If there is a message to take away from the movie, besides the fact that I mentioned that the world is without strangers, I have to remind myself that some of the things I'm important about oh, maybe not so for others. Importance is something that is placed on something else, and its basis really depends on how we define the boundaries we set. So, we have given our finite age, I think I should relieve a little more, live and live, and sometimes wake up in the illusion that ignorance is bliss.
