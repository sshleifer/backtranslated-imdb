This BRASS EYE special PAEDO GEDDON was overwhelmed by complaints (More about later) when it was broadcast in 2001 to a national debate on a possible "Sarah's law" after the kidnapping and murder of schoolgirl Sarah Payne. In fact, his schedule was delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after finding out that the show's author Chris Morris had misled him in a campaign called Nonce-sense. <br /> <br /> If the truth tells you that this show is probably more remembered for controversy than the content that is in very bad taste, but I confess that I laughed out loud. The edition centers around pedophiles and how society both deals with them and their victims. Chris Morris plays the presenter telling the audience that a notorious pedophile was launched in space and confessed that an eight-year-old child was accidentally placed with the pedophile in the capsule. Cried the child's scream screaming. As I said very poor taste. <br /> <br /> Other highlights of the show include Dr Fox who gives a scientific lecture that pedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs ("No one knows, but this is a scientific fact") Labor MP Barbara Follet gives a public warning on pedophile equipment on their genitals while surfing the internet and Kate Thornton warns viewers that pedophile can send via the internet that makes young children susceptible to sexual predators, including one victim. "Who was once a shy innocent child and who has the sexuality of a sixty-year-old Colonel?" Morris also shows a police officer in the child protection group a serious photo that wants to know if they are classified as obscene. The photos include Barbie surrounded by a wedding aids and a composite photo with a young boy's head, a dog's body and a right-handed penis that just belonged to John Holmes. Hey, I never said this show was tasteful I had? <br /> <br /> It is impossible to name PAEDO-GEDDON without the hypocrisy that surrounds it where politicians, children's organizations and police officers rushed to condemn the show for the fun of a very serious subject. The show was bad taste, despite me laughing all the way there, but it's a biting satire. Perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted pedophile mucus to enter the streets of Britain before criticizing a mere television program that exacerbates tension.
