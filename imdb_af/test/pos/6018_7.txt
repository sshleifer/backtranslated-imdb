"Gypsy" is probably the greatest musical ever written, so it's too bad that the movie version was such a disappointment. To make this easier, we have this repetition which, if not flawless, is a pleasurable and well-adjusted adaptation of the musical. The script is quite accurate, including all the songs, and the setup remains close to the original Jerome Robbins staging. Bette Midler is a great choice for Rose, her singing and personality Merman-esquire, and her acting beautiful. Peter Reigert is a fine Herby, if not a good singer, and Cynthia Gibb is a straight forward, natural Louise. In fact, a lively tapering of the 1989 revival with Tyne Daly might have been a better idea, even if only because "Gypsy" is just exciting on the stage. But this movie is a good translation of good music.
