Even from the beginning of this film, I really like the artwork and canvas layout of one of Japan's national islands. We see some big rolling green hills and some eastern coastal town houses. We immediately look at the Pacific beauty on the wide screen of the theater. And to prove how big this movie is, I must say that Charles Darwin would be proud. Teachers of evolution classes and school sciences, such as biology, will benefit Hayley Miyazaki's brand new film, "Ponyo". The title character, as you can see, can be the perfect animation icon of media that will be represented in all classrooms and auditoriums. <br /> <br /> Besides the scientific aspect of everything, let's dive into the blue waters of this exciting story. We have a skinny, old and powerful wizard named Fujimoto who lives in a dip tube and is cynical about the urban expansion of humanity and the pollution of industrial waste. He wants to have complete control of the sea and the cute, tranquil water life, including fish and organisms. Fujimoto, whose blood consists of half-human and half-amphibian, resembles both an ocean-loving anti-hero and antagonist; similar to the James Bond villain Stromberg in the spy who loved me running an Atlantis-doped underwater city. <br /> <br /> His daughter, whom he treats like a cared for pet, is called Ponyo. She is a big goldfish that already looks like a pretty red-haired girl. The father forbids her from the real human world and claims it is dangerous and too much for her to handle. But frankly, Ponyo's explorative curiosity is as strong as her amorous nature. Ultimately with building features, similar to wonderful scenes from Nick Park's "Chicken Run", she breaks from her father's rocky and watery water town and swims to the water surface of Japan and to her happiness and joy she falls into the hands of a younger ship tanker captain named Sosuke. <br /> <br /> Living in an oceanfront home on a neat viewing beach, or Sosuke has two overworking parents, a senior housewife mother, Lisa, and the first mate of a tanker Koichi. Lisa looks angry at her husband because she's gone on a ship and left her with all the homework. Even more so, the black magic exerted by Ponyo causes an apocalyptic chain of events to occur: the moon approaches the earth too and waves rise from the imbalance of the tidal interaction forces and human tsunami waves stretch the peaceful, but evacuated town. But it seems that this curse is underestimated and literally more powerful than supernatural power, love and tight embrace friendship between the childish Captain Sosuke and the beautiful Redhead Ponyo, who want to be a sensitive human being just a preserved fish. Like the fresh and generous hobbits in The Lord of the Rings, Ponyo reminds me a little. <br /> <br /> I could write about this great animation movie, the best since Coraline in theaters in February. And now, Hayao Miyazaki, celebrate your eyes on another 10 star grade of your animation, Graham Abraham. The year 2009 can be filled with decades of animated films; However, Ponyo is the most beautiful film of many environmental beauty and must be dedicated as a new wonder of the world.
