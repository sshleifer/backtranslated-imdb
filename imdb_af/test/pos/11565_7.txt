It's a cute, small, French, silent comedy about a man who still enters a bet that he can't stay in this castle for one hour because he is haunting. And as soon as the man enters the house, it looks much more like a crazy fun house or perhaps like the descendants of LSD !! While there are ghosts and skeletons, there is a strange menagerie of animals, strange special effects and gags. It's very hard to describe, but the footage alone makes the movie worth seeing. But understand that the confident director also had many "funny gags" that were completely flat and hurt the movie. His "camera tricks" were not that difficult, but annoying and stupid. IGNORE THIS AND KEEP WATCHING - it gets better. The movie is fast, funny and worth seeing. In particular, I really liked watching the play by Max Linder - he was so expressive and funny! Badly he is almost forgotten today. For an interesting but very sad reading, look at the IMDb biography about him.
