The Frozen Limits is a large screen vehicle for the artists known as The Crazy Gang. They were a group of British entertainers who formed in the early 1930s. In the lead was the group's six men Bud Flanagan, Chesney Allen, Jimmy Nervo, Teddy Knox, Charlie Naughton and Jimmy Gold. Very popular in the variety of halls, the group was also darlings of the then Royal Family. The plot here sees them as the Wonder Boys troops trying to find their prosperity in Alaska after reading a gold rush in the newspaper. Only problem is that when they finally arrive at Red Gulch, they seem to be 40 years late! <br /> <br /> I often cry when I see the statement "it is very British" because it means it can't struggle to get it from the British Isles. The reason why this is bothering me is because at this www / internet age I got a team of non-British film-loving friends who were known to divide their sides by the best of Ealing, Will Hay and the urgent Terry Thomas. So, is it true that something like the Frozen Limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non-British public? Well, that's true, so much here is British, but it should really be said that the classic movie fan is pretty good in history, and when all is said and done, the visual joy here is universal. With the anarchic "not" so wild west makes an absolute winner. A winner who has every chance of being more appreciated by an American audience than it will now be by a British audience. Not all the comedy works, and in fact, the "big 6" time is thrown by a movie stealing Moore Marriott. But here are sketches and parodies that deserve respect and a need for approval of more illustrious comedy acts. You're unlikely to fall off your chair like I did because of an Ovaltine gag, but if you're a classic comedy movie lover? I'm sure you'll admit the worst that there are many talented people at work. <br /> <br /> Now, do the Mounties always teach their husband? 8/10
