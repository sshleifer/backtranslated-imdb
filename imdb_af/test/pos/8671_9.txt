Andreas arrives in a strange, inhuman place where everything looks perfect. He has done a good job, everyone is friendly to him and to everyone, and he doesn't really bother too much, even if he is looking for a beautiful girl. But in this named city, Andreas soon realizes that a perfect commercial type of world is not a paradise. Actually one of the better movies I've seen this year. The attractive plot is perfectly supported by a clever direction where each component (cool, unsaturated photography, cold symmetrical design, unmotional acting, slow, highly-controlled camera movements) helps to build a unique strange atmosphere that will leave the audience to the end hang. A sarcastic, ironic, bitter comedy that reminds me, just think, as only the best movies can do. Nothing new, probably, in the analysis of modern human civilization, but really a clever job with great surprising ideas that will hardly be forgotten by those who were lucky enough to see it. Simply beautiful the wonderful scene in the subway underground.
