I didn't have as much as "as good as it was," but I'm a big fan of William Hurt and Holly Hunter's work, so I decided to watch this movie. And the most surprising thing to me was the wonderful work of Albert Brooks. Here, in Spain, he is little known, and only as a 2nd division of Woody Allen in the West Coast. He played a big role, but Hunter and Hurt were also good, especially Hurt, in a relatively unusual role for him. Hunter played the part that reminds me of her part in "Once Around" (Lasse Hallstrom, 1991). <br /> <br /> Finally, the rest of the cast is also good. Robert Prosky, one of these famous faces of the American cinema, ex-bondgirl Lois Chiles, is well placed on the role, I think, always perfect Joan Cusack in her early years; and especially the short look of Jack Nicholson. Maybe he's not a good scene, but it's Jack Nicholson, anyway ... The best movie by James L. Brooks, a wonderful story (well resolved), and great role for one of the best movies of the 80's.
