WASTE WARNING !!!! It was my son's review of the movie, which he wanted me to post. He wrote it, I swear. <br /> <br /> With Malcolm in the middle of Frankie Muniz and Nickelodeon's Amanda Bynes, they're going to show business. They are teaming up with actor Paul Giamatti. He stole Jason Shepherd's Big Fat Liar essay and made it into a movie. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) must go to L.A. go get it back. Jason's father doesn't believe he wrote the essay. So every time they see each other, Jason Wolf (Paul Giamatti) asks Jason's father to give a call because he wants his essay back !!!! Wolf doesn't make the movie, but the president of the company makes it. In the end, the family and Kaylee see the film, Made by Wolf Pictures and based on a real story written by Jason Shepherd.
