Don't listen to most of these people. sick gives you a better overview of this movie that my friend and I love! It's about Jill Johnson, played by Camilla Belle, who babysits at the Mendrakis home and someone breaks in. If you were wondering how he got home, he probably went through the garage. So anyway, don't listen to the "worst acting". it has wonderful acting. with a great story. I think there are two benefits that Jill has. 1. Shes a fast runner and is on the job team. 2. She became alive! lol. <br /> <br /> It's a cool movie and pretty scary. Check it out, you'll be happy with this masterpiece. do not listen to the other people on the site. It's very good. Trust me, I'm good at reviewing movies. I'm a future film critic. I want to buy this movie completely. and you will also see when you see it. it is incredibly wonderful.
