This concert is the kind of concert that occurs only every twenty years or more, Madonna's Confessions on a dance floor era will definitely be remembered as one of the highlights of her career. She is 48 and she just looks divine, she keeps pace with the dancers who have been her junior for almost twenty years. I am also very happy to report that all the songs are sung alive, which is good because she actually lives better. Every song was so unique, the footage was amazing. The show of 'Live to tell' was fantastic and surprised me, 'Isaac' was exotic and beautiful and was rich in political symbolism, the Arab horn, the American eagle released. I especially liked the rock performance of 'I Love New York'. I almost got up in my living room and cheered when she told her critics to suck George Bushes. And again I was impressed with the 70's inspired music (inferno remix). This spectacular Decedent concert made me a fan. <br /> <br /> Pronunciation: Highly Recommended with a Capital H.
