very seldom happens that I sit down to write a comment for a movie .... but this movie !!!!!! oh my holy god !!!!!!!! never ever was a hindi movie better than this ...... and never ever there has a movie better than it came ...... this is the king of all comedies ..... <br /> <br /> aamir khan is probably the best comic actor in indian film industry ... although it is funny to say this because he is a class act, not a comedian ... but what he does in this movie may have been the most hilarious performance by any Indian actor in an out-of-out comedy. .. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan has never been a good actor in my eyes .... but this movie got the best from him .... he was innocent comic ... if ever a term like that .... just what the doctor ordered as far as his role in the film ... <br /> <br /> rajkumar santoshi I don't know why, never tried his hand again on comedy no. ... he managed big businesses like The Legend of Bhagat Singh and khakee, but couldn't recreate the magic of andaz apna apna. </ br /> <br /> I don't care why this movie is being bombarded at the box office. Although I feel sad that a movie like "hum aapke hain kaun" was the reason for its failure ...... from now on I hope to be rumored where ..... there will be "andaz apna apna- 2 "they say ....... we if the audience can only AMEN !!!!!
