(This review contains a great spoiler, but I don't know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away.) I saw Pinoccio's Revenge a while ago. <br /> <br /> Now, you might think it's just a child's play rip-off. Indeed, there are similarities. <br /> <br /> Chucky, however, was a puppet who works independently of the child. It is possible that Pinoccio is possessed with a demon or a curse or something. The puppet itself is, however, quite infinite. The KID is insane, and the KID is the one who kills people! Everyone, including the audience, the survivors and the child himself, thinks it's the doll. But this is the KID. <br /> <br /> The nudity is almost unfortunate, because otherwise I could tell everyone to see it, because it's really an interesting horror movie.
