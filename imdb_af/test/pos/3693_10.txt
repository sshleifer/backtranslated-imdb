I found this movie very excellent. I'm biased. I think Kathy Bates loves me. I sang her an extra pleasure. She has a very good voice. <br /> <br /> Me Bates plays Grace Beasley. There she meets his three surviving thesis booths. She also discovered that Victor left a male lover, Dirk Simpson. <br /> The story leads you to some surprisingly comical and heartwarming situations, as Grace and Dirk develop a true love for each other, after an initial, rather rude rejection. They come back to Chicago, where they work. with Grace's spicy, hilarious son-in-law, Maudie, to find the serial killer who killed Victor. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the photo had a good job. Enjoy especially Julie Andrews, Lynn Redgrave and Barry Manilow.This movie was fun.It makes you cry.The music is absolutely charming. <br /> <br /> Other posters experiencing problems with any part of this movie have no idea. <br /> <br />
