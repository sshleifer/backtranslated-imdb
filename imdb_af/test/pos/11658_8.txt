I read the book before I saw the movie, and the movie is one of the best adjustments out there. Very true and true to the book. Sean Penn and Sarandon are wonderful. Robbins is a talented filmmaker and I wish he would add more to his repertoire. He made the film very haunting and deliberately slow to add depth. A particularly brilliant movie was the reflection of the victims who eventually appeared in the glass of the execution room.
