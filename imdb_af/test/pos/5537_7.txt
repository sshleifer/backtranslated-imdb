The only problem with Married to the Mob is that it is not funny. It looks like a romantic comedy, but almost nothing happens is funny. But if you can see it as a movie where almost nothing happens, then you have a very good time. It's also a glamorous movie, as per the title. Extremely brilliant. But the director, Jonathan Demme, is one of the few ruling cult directors who fully and completely embraced the 1980s in the work of the decade rather than understanding it as though it was still the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Combining 1980s with animation, Italian-Americanism and mise-and-scene, the opening points immediately struck. From there, despite the 1980s, it feels right. The relief by Demme's regular film Branch Fujimoto and jukebox soundtrack, with wide variety of pop and alternative jams, is gaudy and indeed controlled and nuanced as part of the atmosphere. Demme is good at colorful momentary characters in his visual and sometimes seemingly turbulent compilation of a fun mix of styles, a plot that could go any way, where a smooth FBI agent, played by a very mere Matthew Modine , try to infiltrate a mafia family, see a chance when a rifle ball with Michelle Pfeiffer's blanket played out of it, trying to leave the criminal lifestyle after her husband of the trigger man, just like you in a Alec Baldwin action will hope. . <br /> <br /> The way it goes, works for a while because Demme looks a sturdy hand on the wheel. He knows how important it is to show us the very subjective and related home screens with Pfeiffer, as well as her caring and longing as a moral conflict mum, although her relationship with son Joey is taken for granted. What mobster's son is listening to a daddy's mom when Dad's boss, with Dean Stockwell's trademark naturalness and by far the play-telling performance of the cast, gives him such tremendous gifts? Overall, however, Demme's lather-on styling is easily regarded as a novel taking a fun crime thriller story. <br /> <br /> Finally, however, we find that we have gone the wrong way, because inevitably, Modine and Pfeiffer must fall in love. It's not inherently bad, and everybody here and there actually feels bearable, but as a romantic subplot it's not interesting or well handled, as it bumps over several diverse cliches, which meet the initial expectation of a cheesy 1980s. Date flick, and for the audience, I think it has just the right impact. But for someone who is really interested in the story and the aesthetic approach, it is a decrease in the state of tedium. <br /> <br /> It is therefore a decent movie with great missteps at certain points, but as a date movie or a nostalgic piece for those who grew up in the 80's, many date movies may have been in the 80's seen, the entertainment value is not as likely to fluctuate, except for the real lag shortage. There may be some cartoons, and it's very wide in the cheek, but I won't leave the comedian with the high expectations I initially entered. Whatever the case, there are additional feature films by big character players that are now beginning to fade, such as Nancy Travis, Joan Cusack and Oliver Platt.
