To think this movie was made the year I was born. To think people still took away their constitutional rights, now in the name of "homeland security". To think this movie was deliberately banned from the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK addresses the political divide in the United States better than any movie I've ever seen. If it was more commonly seen, would it have changed something? A movie like this is so polarizing, it has the potential to cause riots. It shakes you and forces you to take sides. This leaves you facing the problem: are you for the people's right of division in a wartime or for the constitution in the name of a national security measure? The protagonists are forced by the government to rush to the American flag in a game that undermines the ideals of the flag. The acting is quite convincing. So much so, I can't see any play here. If it is a written documentary, it is more convincing than any reality program on television today. PUNISHMENT PARK is probably the most important film ever made. It really makes you think.
