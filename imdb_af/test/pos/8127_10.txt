I really enjoyed watching this movie for the first time a few years ago and when somewhere somewhere (which happens in European cable television from time to time), I experience the same thing, I'm moving, entertaining and eventually wanting to be more movies like this. <br /> <br /> It's all about Leo (Kevin McKidd) and his group of friends living in urban London, Leo as a gay man who follows a friend after a hilarious New Age Men's Group and falls for the straight old Brendon, played by James Purefoy, who doesn't seem to be so straight. Digged as char actors are the equally great Tom Hollander and Hugo Weaving whose side story alone is worth seeing the movie, Simon Callow, as the leader of the men's group, in 'But it's really hard to get a few people here Every character, the female, such as Jennifer Ehle, Julie Graham and Harriet Walter, has also performed wonderfully. Perhaps even Kevin McKidd is a bit pale compared to his fellow actors, but it does offer a somewhat dull character. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this movie is a simple one: there is never only black and white, ratings are difficult and cannot always be the test of time. <br /> <br /> Leo identifies as gay but also ends up for a woman who turns out to be his teenage darling and Brendon's long-time friend. Brendon starts straight but learns that gay can be more than just an option for him and to be bisexual may not be that bad. Darren and Jeremy (Hollander and Weaving) are gay and love, and even the straight-line people like Angie, Leo's female roommate, get their fair share of love and funny moments to the end of the movie. The comedy pieces (especially Tom Hollander who is just hilarious) are funny and on the point, and the emotions are credible, as confusing as it sometimes appears as if this summary is occurring. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie is its really positive idea. Whether you're gay, straight, bisexual or simply not sure, make this movie feel like it's just right not to be sure and that "not sure" might also be worth living out! Sexuality is portrayed in this movie. None of the main characters have a real problem with that, apart from all the gay / straight camp fights you sometimes fed into other gay themed movies. I can only completely agree with the subtext of the movie, that what you feel one day surely, if you think you identify as gay, straight, whatever, may look very different. I have never seen (what to call it)? Bisexuality or perhaps the absence of the segregating need for sexual classification is portrayed in such a heart-warming and true life-long way. <br /> <br /> This movie dares to go where little movies go, gay or straight movies, by not playing on labels and stereotypical assumptions of sex and relying on them. It goes further and assumes that after known classifications a sexual life can be and I think the times are more than ready for it and other movies that explore postmodern themes like this one! <br /> <br /> And for all those who don't mind, it's just a funny comedy that's worth watching on a rainy Saturday night with some popcorn on your hands. Give it a try! <br /> <br /> Love it!
