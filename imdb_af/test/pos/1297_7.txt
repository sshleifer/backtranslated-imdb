This movie was made only 48 years after the end of the Civil War - probably in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. In the film there are recreation of battles and the people of the era that look impressive and realistic. It also offers a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary, BIRTH OF A NATION - a patent-like absurd and racist film. As a result, this short film will be great for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man running away to insist on being a drummer. The boy does well and is a hero, although the film ends melodramatically - a definite convention of the day. Not a good movie, but a decent plot, decent acting and a bit of the overarching acting you've often seen in other movies of the day. <br /> <br /> One annoying aspect of this movie was the too frequent use of title cards to describe or set the stage for things that were really obvious. It has become annoying from time to time.
