The judges complaining that this movie has plausibility or problems with construction miss the point. It's a wonderful camp romance, with lots of playing, cigars! Dance, cigar! music, which broadcasts both exotic love stories and celebrates them. Button-up Ray Milland makes an entertaining foil for a Dietrich with black hair, tattered scarves and tons of jewelry. The character's eagerness to feed Milland and keep him closer, looks like the good German hoar frost. Dietrich was off the set as her manipulated vamp rolls. Censorship in operation, it is clear that they only share a caravan on platonic terms, with Milland fighting Dietrich's advances, with a determination remarkable for a heterosexual bachelor who can be killed any day. His only excuse is that she smells, so perhaps a speckled, ingenious English man may have been abandoned. <br /> <br /> In the small role of Milland's young companion on his secret mission, Bruce Lester notes a different kind of camp. We are told from the outset that he completely adores Millon, and indeed he rather touches him. After being divorced, he meets Milland, who is now turning into a brown-gypsy with a waist-open shirt. His glowing appreciation for the disguise further indicates that not only Dietrich is accompanied in the Milland. <br /> <br /> Despite the wonderfully unlikely characters and sequence of events, the growing love of Milland touches Dietrich and his acceptance of the non-rational aspects of life. And when they only escape on their last night, he says that each one now contains half of the others, the two become one, and then the darkness falls. I think we can assume that the censorship has decided to give them a break! One goof - initially, Milland, who is supposed to be English, refers to a lieutenant, using the US verdict. Since Milland was Britain, he had to say so because American filmmakers feared that American audiences would be distracted by British style.
