I just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it. It still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate. <br /> <br /> I wrote a letter to Bonnie Hunt to tell her how much I love it. David Duchovny's sad scene is really really !!! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite line is when Duchovny says, "I miss Elizabeth, but I have pain for Grace". Oh man! I just cry about it. ALSO ... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are sooooooooooooo the perfect Chicago area couple !! I know them I swear! I'm related to them. I'm sure. <br /> <br /> This movie is in my rotation three times a year !!! I will look at it once a week, but I'm afraid I'll get used to it! I always want to make it a special day if I see it !!
