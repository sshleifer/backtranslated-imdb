Well, it's too long and it's too happy with itself. Still, "The Great Dictator" is a fascinating movie. Chaplin does a tremendous job that saturates Hitler and tries to portray the oppression of the Jews in Nazi Germany (that was before the concentration camps were general knowledge). Not a masterpiece of Chaplin, but still worth seeing. <br /> <br />
