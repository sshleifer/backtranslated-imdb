What to say about a movie like Rock Star? Very actually! This is the kind of movie that is almost tailor-made for the critics to choke. It is also a movie that I, as a BIG Hard Rock fan, did not love, while I was very consciously aware of his many mistakes and that movie, while a decent effort in some ways was the chance missing has escaped in greatness and become a rock movie classic. Oh well .... <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and will see it again and again - but I know it's purely based on my own taste. Rock Star is a movie that will appeal to everyone having experienced elements of rock or hard rock lifestyle and want to go on the road to nostalgia. It was a good time for metal heads. And it's nice to have a movie that captures it effectively (long forgotten by many non-rock fans.) Time effective, as I think Rock Star did. This is one of the strengths of the film, the concert material. You will feel like your right there with them and how can a hard rock fan not like it? Regarding the atmosphere, Rock Star gets a 10 out of 10. It also gets a 10 out of 10 for pure entertainment. If you want a movie to just let yourself go and get rid of some good memories of good times, then this is the movie for you. This is also the reason why I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> But it's not a good movie. I understand this and was it my real job to revise movies professionally, I'll probably have to be a little hard on this one. The problem with Rock Star is character development. <br /> <br /> What is wrong with character development is that, there is no. None. The movie has some scenes, few and far between them, but they are there. It affects the greatness: WARNING SHORTCUTS: 3 examples-1) when Izzy makes his debut on stage (including the fall he takes) <br /> 2) The first post-show party with Emily (Anniston and Izzy .) <br /> <br /> 3) Backtracking a little-Initially, when the original lead singer is fired unexpectedly (fired) entire "business as usual" shows the scene for what will come. It is played very effectively. <br /> <br /> But the problem is that nothing ever comes. There is little or no character development of anyone in this movie, people's people are simply touched, but never fully investigated. I don't think it's the fault of the actors / actresses, especially Anniston who is trying hard, they just aren't given much to work with. It's just that the writing was poor and didn't have the ability to go beyond the "formula" feeling in true film depth. Rock strength was sometimes sugar cover (including at the end). It was almost ridiculous. And although the scenes I mentioned were excellent and very credible, many others were unfortunately in the movie. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer mentioned the lack of build-up after the end and I agree, but there was actually a lack of build-up on something. Why does Izzy end up? Because he misses his girlfriend and the band won't let him write songs? It tests the limits of credibility. And frankly the end was just lean. It had no sense and it had nothing at all. <br /> <br /> It looks like watching a movie where its makers said: OK, it happens here and then it happens and then it is. Etc. etc. By the end, it's no longer a movie about a boy whose dream has come true, it's just another thickly formulated love story. And you wonder why so much detail is left out. <br /> <br /> I hope I'm not hard on Rock Star, because I really loved it, but not for the right reasons. I would like it to be a wonderful movie about the highlights and lows of rock fame. Instead, I loved it because it feels like the 80's, the clothes, the hair, the lights, the life. Although many others liked it, I suspect most people are the life of a rock fan, as I did or some play. I'd like to see the movie cross over and just be respected because it's a good, well-told movie, rather than a clich√©. I think one of the problems was the length. I hated myself about long films, but it was one that had really been longer. If a movie is really right, the length isn't even felt. There is just too much for the story because it was as short as it was This is one of the reasons why there is not a huge development of the story or the people depicted in the movie. <br /> <br /> So to wind it is a movie you can get into - but not a good movie. See it for pleasure. See it for entertainment. Seeing it to return to the great, good space at the time when metal was not just a part of life, it was life - and for those who were not rockers - consider it a little insight Get a life that means and means so much to so many of us.
