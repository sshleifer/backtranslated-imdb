I saw this movie a few times and at each look I still feel the thrill of a journey and the frustration of overcoming the obstacles that hinder the road. It's more than just a desire to go home; It's about the very basic human spirit to find one's way around the world, to overcome despair, to confront the traits that deter our goals. Underlying these human efforts is the challenge to reconsider the origin of life. While this movie is full of serious ideas, it only has enough comic lines to make the viewers hopeful. It's surprisingly funny. Running the story line is excellent! It's all packed with visually engaging animation. A must see. <br /> <br />
