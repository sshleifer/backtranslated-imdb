just another showcase of led zeppelin at their best and their absolute rocking the best. every band member is on their best jimmy page and his bow and JPJ guitar with his thundering basbozo moving away and Robert does not sing like they do tomorrow. I have to say when we get into the first song where it's going to groove, it's the beginning of something very special. This DVD follows zeppelin by their 11-year-old Carree who starts in 69 in the royal Albert Hall, Madison Square Garden 73, followed by a much older and mature band in the 75-year-old court and finally another watch band at their last English show at Knebworth in 79 This DVD is a fantastic showcase of zeppelin and if you are not a fan you will be after that. n
