First, I reviewed this movie 10/10. For me, it's just one of the best I've seen since I was born (I'm 23, but I've seen many movies). The story is cruel, but reality is not? It entered deep into me and stirred my bowels. I saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me - and I still remember it! <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is no "national preference" (this expression is a direct translation of the French) for This movie. I mean this is not because it is a French movie that I set so high: it really caught me when I saw it. Furthermore, I don't know Marcel Carne's filmography, so I don't know if it's his best movie or not, but I know it's not his best known. Hotel du Nord, Quai des Brumes and Les Enfants du Paradis are the best known. <br /> <br /> Third, the movie is in B&W, but it deals with inter-temporal problems of youth (not acne) such as love, friends and studies in a modern way. It can even be made frame-by-frame with real young actors, a Dolby (tm) sound and special effects (a car accident), it will still be a good movie! <br /> <br /> Problem: Perhaps This is a movie seen by young adults (from 16 to 25 years old) - and above all, of course - because his message is well understood. Did I say it was a good movie?
