Eric Bogosian's ability to roll character to character in this one-man show shows his true character as character. Every person has their own message about the truth, society, class, drugs, etc. Carry over. It's an absolute must for anyone who is a serious fan of acting! His show features some of the most Hilarious and Real moments I've ever experienced as a viewer.
