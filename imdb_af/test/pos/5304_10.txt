Hayao Miyazaki's magic continues with this absolute crowd pleasur Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, his latest animated movie, which turns on the usual sweetness to enchant your socks. I thought the trailer contained its quietly hypnotic song. I did not have to wait for an invitation to make sure I got my ticket for the preview of the movie that will be opened next week. <br /> <br /> For fans of Studio Ghibli movies, you'll probably know what you're involved with, as Miyazaki has another winner in his filmography, which will win new fans. I am ashamed to say the least that I have so far only watched My Neighbor Totoro (eyes that make a stack of Ghibli DVDs) and love bits, but I think it will serve as a final touch for me not to miss what will probably be animated movies I would love to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Ponyo (pronounced by Nara Yuria) is a magical goldfish who long to know what life is beyond the sea, with her constant rays in a bubble to the surface of the water around a peek to sneak. Yet these ambitions do not fit well with her humanoid father Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who has a human gender hatred for pollution and briefly touches on environmental protection / revenge by Mother Nature. One accident one day sees Ponyo washed ashore and is taken by five-year-old boy Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) on a house on the rock with his mother, Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko), while father Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige ) mostly out to sea because he is a sailor. And you can expect a few moments of throwback like the little mermaid, or splinter made for kids. To say something more is to spoil the fun. <br /> <br /> The artwork here is still surprising, though in 2D glory, because everyone's well-being worked well. There are so many things going on in the same frame at the same time that you will probably be a game for repeated views just to see them all. It certainly falls every 3D or CG animated production, as the beauty comes from its simplicity, not just from the art department, but also in its story, despite complaints coming in, it has a leaf of the Hans. Christian Andersen classics taken. While there are ways to make this movie very dark, it has only suggested some dark themes, but rather a movie with more positive emotions, suitable for both children and adults. <br /> <br /> In its core, it's about love, which is between the family members of Koichi, Lisa and Sosuke, and especially between mother and son. More so, it's about the love between the boy and his new pet he has baptized Ponyo, and I tell you, Ponyo, she has enough candy in her to knock off the likes of Bolt, WallE and Eva. Characterization here is moreover and it is difficult not to fall in love with Ponyo, in whatever form, especially when she is such a playful creature that does not hide her emotions. If she upsets you, she turns away or you can expect a jet stream to spray from her mouth into your face! <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a definite introduction to my top films this year. And next time I'm going to Tokyo, I'm sure I'm going to make my way to the Ghibli Museum to bask under the magical world we've brought through Hayao Miyazaki. Highly recommended movie, don't miss it on the big screen!
