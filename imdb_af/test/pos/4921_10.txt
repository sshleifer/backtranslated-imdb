This is a classic animated movie from the cartoon series! Most of the main characters get lots of screen time and also extra characters! The film's focus is on the superstar characters holiday and each one has his / her very unique summer fun! It's very funny from start to finish! It has excellent color, good music and believes it or not, I saw it more than any movie. It's so big and in my opinion it's perfect!
