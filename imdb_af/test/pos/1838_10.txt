Back to Me is a beautiful jewel of a movie. With an absolutely star-studded cast, who can go wrong with this contemporary fairy tale? It also includes many, many jokes written by the funny girl Bonnie Hunt herself, who wrote and directed this role. David Duchovny is also very good, and then another approach because of his one-day alter-ego mulder on my favorite show the x files. a great date movie!
