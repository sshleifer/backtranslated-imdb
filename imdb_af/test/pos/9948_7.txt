If you like Japanese monster movies, you'll love this action-packed battle that desires an alien invader, with the goal of conquering Earth, and a "Giant Robot" with a weapon of super weapons. The Alien, Emporer Guillotine, "of the planet Gargoyle, has an army of thugs named (of course)" the gargoyle gang ", as well as an endless supply of tremendously hostile creatures that are routinely released on earth for buildings. Too crushed, make loud noises, panic the population, etc. A kid called Johnny Sokko calls the Giant Robot at his beckon, and sends the robot, if necessary, to store, and then blows these creatures. joins a group of good spies, called Unicorn, and seeks to save the world. <br /> <br /> Despite the camp nature, incessant humorous dialogue and the fact that the target audience were children, of course, movie has non-stop action, colorful characters, decent special effects, and just happens to look right, strokes are well executed, and often, as the storyline requires, the good guys and bad guys made sure they have an inexhaustible supply of bombs, lasers, ammunition and schemes to attack each other. Despite the fact that the movie is made up of edited episodes of a TV series, the plot actually develops and reaches an ultimate conclusion. <br /> <br /> The movie has a positive outlook and appeals to everyone's (especially children's) desires to destroy evil in its many forms. Children may be the target audience, but it is fun for everyone to laughs about his comic psychology; Yet, at the same time, root for the good guys to conquer and "save the world." The play is fun, but it's the charm. There are several lines of wheat dialogue (possibly translation errors or possibly deliberate jokes by the filmmakers), and you will later quote these absurd lines. <br /> <br /> This movie is not high in production quality or budget, but, for what it is, campy sci-fi, it's nice To laugh, I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor for that kind of thing.
