If you took a very good Jack Black movie, you added a little jeepers rankers, and then a piece of joyride with a hint of Texas chain murder and a house of 1000 bodies ... you'll be MONSTER MAN have! I went into this movie, not really expecting much, but I really enjoyed the movie. The whole premise is really cheesy, a monster man in a monster truck chases people off, but it's so funny that the author / director doesn't expect you to take it seriously. Justin Urich is a comic jewel and needs a very promising career. He is identical to Jack Black. The only problem with the movie is the incredible role played by eric jungmann. But overall, if you are looking for a really nice movie that will break you until you roll in the roll and at the same time scare your shit ... look at this movie.
