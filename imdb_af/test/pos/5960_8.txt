It's probably one of the best French movies I've seen for a long time! This "pastiche" or parody of spy movies is made very well and will make you laugh from beginning to end. Some references to today's world are very subtle. The whole Moroccan context of the film needs to be understood in light of today's French culture / environment. All the jokes and seemingly shocking remarks that could be viewed as such because of this context are allowed and accepted because it is a parody. <br /> <br /> I have been told of my sisters who have already seen this movie, that I also had to go and make sure I had a good time and I did! If you like the old 007 movies with Sean Connery and also like movies like an airplane or hot shots, you'll be happy. I just hope this movie is released on DVD in the US ... Wait and see.
