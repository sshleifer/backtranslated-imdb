*** SPOILERS *** Although the movie "They Made Me A Criminal" is nowhere as good as the later John Garfield anti-heroic classics such as "Body & Soul" in 1947 "Force of Evil" in 1948 and his last and much underestimated "He Ran All The Way" in 1951, it was the film that determined his career from that time until his earlier death on May 21, 1952 at the age of 39. <br /> <br /> Garfiled plays part of lightweight champion Johnnie Bradfield and later the refugee of Jack Dorney's law, who is innocent of the murder he was charged with, even though he was officially declared dead. Jonnie's manager, Doc Ward, Robert "Doc" Gleckler, who, during a drunken victory party, killed reporter Charles McGee, John Ridgely, who revealed his warrior, Johnnie Bradfield, to the public, said he was an annual man and not drink. Mom's son. Doc Gleckler hit a bottle over McGee's head and killed him when Jonnie was almost drunk with a number of women who had caught in his hotel package. <br /> <br /> Later, Doc was killed in a car accident with Johnnie's friend Goldie, Ann Sheridan, but Doc was fiercely burned and Johnnie's watch on him was Johnnie confused. He said he was killed and buried by his lawyer Malvin, Robert Strange, who took $ 9,750.00 from the $ 10,000.00 of Johnnie's money he had for this great council. Malvin told Johnnie to enter a new identity and from now on call himself Jack Dorney and get the state out of New York. talk about messy shysters. Johnnie, now, Jack Dorney, moves the tracks from New York to Arizona and ends at the Rancho Rafferty Date Farm where most of the movie takes place. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't John Garfield's lead role as both Jonnie Bradfield & Jack Dorney the movie had long been lost and forgotten. Garfield, who was only 26, brought the best of everyone in the movie. Even the transported Dead End Kids, I think, we can call them The Arizona Kids here, where they slanted above what you expected from them, and they came as real and sensitive people, not a bunch of bangs like in almost everyone their movies. All due to the same stage, or filming spot, with John Garfield. <br /> <br /> "They made me a criminal" is a good story that is the undercover champion, anything other than not paying attention to itself and ending not just behind bars but also in the electric chair. In the end, Jack showed how a man he is by not fighting the big fight and against all the chances that last minute win dramatically, but by making four brutal rounds for the money for his new family on the date to take place, including his girlfriend Peggy, Gloria Dickson, to open a petrol station with it. <br /> <br /> He gives European champion Gaspar Rutchek, Frank Riggi, the battle of his life and gets $ 2,000.00, that's $ 500 a round. To do this, Jack showed everyone what the "Arizona Kids" looked at him. Sometimes it is a punch that is very brave and brave. The fact that Jack could easily beat Rutched, but was unable to expose him to the police, such as the killer Johnnie Bradfield. But instead he went so far that he could take whatever Rutchek could throw at him to help his friends see, and then all the battles he won in the boxing ring. <br /> <br /> For one I didn't get the end of the movie, but it fits right into the story. Police officer Morty Phelam, Claude Rains, who came from New York to Arizona to arrest Jack, had to live for years with the fact that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair. We told it all at the beginning of the movie. Why does he know that Jack / Johnnie was innocent of the murder he was found guilty of and did not know if he was found guilty in court, would he make the same terrible mistake again? I can easily see it in real life, why not in the movies.
