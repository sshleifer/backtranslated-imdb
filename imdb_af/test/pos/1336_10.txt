I just phoned my brother Paulie and he said he was watching Hoods and it was funny. So, as I said, never go against the family! The demand for more lines is OK, as I often express my own opinions. If something is spelled wrong, it's probably my sight and not my brain. This gives me another chance to take my shots at "The Departed". Knowing exactly what will happen in the last scene without prior knowledge usually means it is not that exciting. All you need is a good director, the same man I believe has done my favorite mob movie, Goodfellows, but in a completely different way. And then Jack throws the big one and you have an Oscar for you. I must see hoods to make sure it wasn't better than "The Departed" Gibbs
