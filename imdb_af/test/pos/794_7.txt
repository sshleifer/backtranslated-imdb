This Metro movie is episodic, but almost a constant series of pursuits, mainly trying to escape the police, whether real or imagined, as Buster is mistaken for an escaped criminal. It is consistently inventive and entertaining. Its greatest value is in the documentation of what Hollywood looked like in the early twenties, as 95% of them are shot outside the streets and built outside the buildings. There is a jewel moment and one jewel order. <br /> <br /> The great moment is when a train at a great distance quickly approaches the camera and eventually just stops from it - with Buster glitteringly seated on the covert catcher and so moving from a long shot close proximity in seconds. <br /> <br /> The big row is at the telephone box next to the elevator - one is constantly confused for others with races from floor to floor - one of the great Keaton gags. <br /> <br /> Cinema's pressure is sharp and clear - almost untouched. There is a violin / piano score accompaniment. It's one to find and enjoy.
