Millions in gold travel by train to US Treasury. Traveling along is Lois Lane to report on it. Along the way, the train is attacked by painted thieves. They leave the car with the armed guards in it and attack the remaining ones. This leads to an evil battle between the remaining guards and the thieves. The thieves overwhelmed them, but Lois Lane jumped in. She knocks the thieves off the train (at one point with a gun), but the train is getting out of control. Lois can't stop it and the thieves won't stop getting the gold. Good thing Superman is on the go! <br /> <br /> Fast, exciting, non-stop action. Probably one of the best of all cartoons. Just wonderful.
