OK, I'm a sucker. I loved it. I had no expectations and fulfilled them all. It was a terrible movie. I loved it. I managed to make a DVD of over use. No one can understand my obsession. I can't tell the truth either. For those who have seen the movie, it won't be surprising, but I asked the clerk at the video industry if I could buy a copy and I could because there were two in stock and only one was out and more than half of the time it was for me. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The acting is terrible, but I loved it. The actors are stupid, the plot stupid, the goofs are numerous - like seeing through the monsters. The "arachnids" looked like they were made of plastic rubbish bags. Maybe they were underground. TNT was underground. a deafening, etc. <br /> <br /> You should really love B movies to get some enjoyment from it ... alcohol helps a lot for others.
