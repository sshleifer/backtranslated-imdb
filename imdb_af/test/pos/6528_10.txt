I love Aaron Carter, but even I expected the pop star to be predictable, but I was so wrong! Aaron Carter was really funny in it and a good actor! Also the actress Jane played was a brilliant actress! Whoever I didn't look at, loved it! <br /> <br /> The music in it was also great! <br /> <br /> My favorite lines from the movie are "you can't send me a public school mom! Im a CELEBRIDEE !!" and "Take your time, I'll come to you!" <br /> <br /> Although the ends are kind of cheesy, do all the good chicks! This movie is great, and a pretty good chick flick, which I can watch over and over!
