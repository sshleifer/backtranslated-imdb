"Sweeney Todd" is, in my opinion, one of a few "perfect" musical. Like 'My Fair Lady' and 'West Side Story' it has a wonderful, intelligent score. It offers the two leads and various supporting characters interesting roles. It has a timeless theme, revenge. It has a lot of humor, and is just as strong when offered simply or on a large scale. <br /> <br /> "Sweeney Todd" tells the story of a simply wrong man during the industrial period in England. It shows men's inhumanity to man, how in Sweeney's own words, "There are two kinds of men. There is the one who stays in his right place and the one with his foot in the other's face." In an effort to correct the mistake made to him, Todd plans to take revenge. With the help of Mrs. Lovett, who owns a mutton under MrTodd's hairdressing house, found them serving the ones below. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate to have seen the original Broadway version eight times (six with Cariou and Lansbury, the other two with Hearn and Loudon). I saw the revival with Bob Gunton and Beth Fowler, and several other concert versions. <br /> <br /> While the technical aspects of this production are lacking, to say the least, I believe this filmed production version is the best. . Lansbury and Hearn were the two best in these roles, and they had a wonderful time apart. <br /> <br /> Very good supporting work by Ken Jennings and Edmund Lyndeck. Although Betsy Joslyn and Cris Groenendaal, as young lovers, have absolutely no chemistry, and basically are unshakeable. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
