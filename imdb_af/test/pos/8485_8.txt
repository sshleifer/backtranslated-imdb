Let's not beat the bush here, Taylor Hackford's undoubtedly smooth movie has little to make it out of the biopic genre, except Jamie Foxx's exceptional career performance. Remember the year that they handed the special effects Oscar to the Terminator 2 boffins, undoubtedly? They should do the same with this year's best actor. <br /> <br /> The fact that Ray Charles's story is worth filing is not in dispute. Indeed, the many flashbacks of his traumatic youth are treated well and used wisely. But for a life so unique, the movie looks incredibly formal and familiar. It follows the 'history of a defective genius' template almost to the letter: hardship and exploitation, women and drugs, recording of wrangles, band squabbles, rehab, yes yes. And truly, was there more humor in his life than we were treated here? <br /> <br /> I appreciate Charles's music, but where neatly cut medals would make the story roll, Hackford has himself with almost full-length versions of too many songs - in gin joints, in the recording studio. in concert halls, infinitum. Narrative, and for non-dedicated, they start acting like a movie. It may look like a hard judge over a music biopsy, but with a catalog as extensive as Ray's, we need a taste, not the whole dish. Otherwise, we want to buy the albums. <br /> <br /> Interpreted as I was, I watched my watch more than once. So for all Foxx's sheen, might Ray have served better than a HBO party?
