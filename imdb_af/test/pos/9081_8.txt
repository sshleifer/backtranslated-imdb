I just watch this move recently on Encore channel. What a good movie, also a good role. Flatlines are very exciting and unpredictable. The movie has a wonderful opening scene by the sea, then to a series of scenes that determine life after death, which offers a very strong past engagement. That's why Nelson played by Kiefer Sutherland, the first to go through the test to die and return. Then it becomes very dramatic by bringing back its wrong doing of the past to life. Then all the above-mentioned characters had the same experience, except for Randy stitch Olliver played flat. Then the story unfolds in a resolution and basic understanding of life and the presence and meaning of God. David Labraccio, played by Kevin Bacon, eventually questioned an atheist's own faith about God. It's amazing to see Kevin Bacon, Oliver flat, William Baldwin and Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts at such a great time in their careers. One can ask how come we no longer have such a good movie. This is one of Joel Schumacher's best productions. I really enjoy this movie.
