Considering the film as nothing more than a skateboarding documentary, many important aspects of Dogtown will not be recognized. Peralta (a well-known skateboarding figure herself) has made a film that not only deals with the birth of what we know today as skateboarding, but also the socio-cultural and economic circumstances in which this sport has emerged and widely appealed investigated. In addition, his film is very personal: Peralta's first-hand association with this cultural phenomenon serves as both the informed film investigator and the relevant participating subject. In this role, he is an important participant observer, bringing together a wide variety of personalities who participated in this movement and those deeply affected by the onset of skateboarding as a competitive sport and subculture. The film uses a unique stylish form of film and sound editing, and the narration (by Sean Penn) and interviews take on a fairly real, uncontrolled form related to the anarchic, nihilistic spirit of pavement surfing. The film shows the kinetic appeal of a long sports, music video that is tempered with an archaeologist's sensitivity to the importance of time, place and circumstances.
