When this movie came out, I saw Geena Davis playing just soft, female roles. This movie was everything but soft and feminine. Big lines, good action ... she and Samuel L really clicked. Too violent for the kids, but if you and your important others are trying to vote on a movie, try this one for size. Go Geena! Go Geena!
