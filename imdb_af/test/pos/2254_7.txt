The film "Everything is Illuminated" comes from first-time writer-director Liev Schreiber, who adjusts Jonathan Safran Foer's first novel. The book was ambitious and distributed, its magical-realistic elements and vibrant language seem impossible to represent on the screen. The movie, show, try less. While the end result is not as wild as the novel, it is still a full movie about a strange Eastern European road trip, or, as one of the characters would have, "a very rigid search." <br /> <br /> The character is Alex (Eugene Hutz), a young Ukrainian man who loves American pop culture, but can't get the English language straight. Nevertheless, his grandfather (Russian actor Boris Leskin), who runs a tour company to the American Jews, persuades him to serve Jonathan (Elijah Wood) as a translator. Jonathan examines his family history and specifically tries to find the wife who saved his Nazi's grandfather. More than one family secret is revealed during their search. <br /> <br /> The movie's Jonathan (not confused with the author of the novel) is a half-typomanic weirdo who steals his own grandmother's denture for joining his collection of "family things". Wood's quiet, wide eye, serious way works very well in this role. Hutz makes an impressive debut as the detached, easy-going Alex. His malapropism is hilarious, but he can also diminish the character's growing self-awareness. The dog Mikki is very funny like the demented Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., And one of the few movie dogs I've ever seen is not cloyingly cute and precocious. <br /> <br /> "Everything is lightened" puts the Holocaust on a human scale, and asks us not to remember it as a general event, but as millions of specific small tragedies. Reminiscent of a European movie, but also the effect of past events on contemporary young people such as Jonathan and Alex. With its original perspective, a strong performance and some very striking visual arts, everything is All Light. This is a good job for the first time, and Schreiber will hopefully continue to present movies.
