I will review this movie high on my list of Ingrid Bergman films. Ingrid's beauty aside, her talent is clearly in scene after stage. She was sad, temperate, funny, flirty, wonderfully funny, loving, gentle, sad, distressed, happy, etc. You call it, she was all those things and more. And convincingly <br /> <br />. Ingrid plays a notorious wife (Clio) who returns to New Orleans and falls to a Texas gambler, Gary Cooper (Clint). I especially loved the scene where they sat at the dining table and didn't say anything but just stared at each other. She, in an elegant white gown and in an attractive white cowboy <br /> outfit, sits there and looks at her adoringly. What chemistry! What love!
