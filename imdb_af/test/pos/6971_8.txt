Francis Ford Coppola's first 'personal' film, completed and released in 1969, was the last movie he made as a mostly unknown, upcoming director for The Godfather, and is in stark contrast to both that movie and the rest of his uneven career. It is apparently a road movie in which a fianc√© young woman gets bored with the household life, and pregnant with a child, she is not sure she wants, and escapes the stairs her dull marriage and hits the open path to freedom. Along the road she's befriended with a beautiful man, an old soccer player who suffered brain damage to a traumatic head injury, he played unexpectedly through a young James Caan. He decides to help him, despite his frustration with his simple ways. . Her attempts to get rid of him always fail, whether guilty or accidental, and eventually lead her directly to an emotionally wounded cop (Robert Duvall), who has ideas herself. The plot is thin, but Coppola does a good job of defining the emotional life of these characters. It uses editing techniques to display the story that is not common in American movies of the time. Shots are simple, but extremely effective, which transfers both the moody devastation of the open highway, and the emptiness of the American suburban life, with a soft melancholy created by the film. Coppola also earns credit for addressing the issue of domestic dissatisfaction from a woman's point of view in the culturally turbulent 60s. Overall, a fairly low key film not expected from Coppola, but one that is a minor triumph in its own quiet, unattractive way. 7.5 / 10.
