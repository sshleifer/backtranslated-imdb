Legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff (beautifully played with a bad sardonic aplomb by Ferdy Mayne) dies of a heart attack. A lot of drama school students steal Radzoff's body out of the crypt and bring it to a stray house so that they can participate. Radzoff comes back to life and counts down the rude youngsters to profane his grave. Author / director Norman Thaddeus Vane emphasizes a fresh, original and even stylishly styled spin on ordinary body-care, offers a neat portrayal of the glamorous Hollywood environment and strives to create a properly misty and haunting eye-arched atmosphere. to retain. . The killed pieces deliver the ferocious goods, with a gal that is set on fire, a juicy dapitation (the cut head rolls to the right on the stairs and on the lawn so that a raven can hide from it!), And another. weak lass is smashed with a levitating coffin rating than the definite gruesome highlights. Kudos is also fine for the star cast of well-known B-flick faces: Mayne has a glorious eye-rolling ball with his flashing role. Leon Askin carries an amusing cameo as bitterly excited director Wolfgang, Nita Talbot adds class as flaky psychic medium, Mrs. Rohmer, plus there are nice innings by Luca Bercovici as a dramatic drama student writer Saint, Jennifer Starrett as the sweet Meg, Jeffrey Combs as the geeky Stu, and Scott Thomson as the nerdy Bobo. Chuck "Porky" Mitchell as a detective, Patrick Wright in one of his usual policeman parts, and Tallie Cochrane as a body. Joel King's polished cinematography gives the film an attractive look. The state of mind of Jerry Mosely also hits the skeleton spot. A fun little scare movie.
