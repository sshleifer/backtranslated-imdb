I'm not exactly sure the accuracy of this movie is, but I can tell you that I am thoroughly entertained by this movie. The character of the storm, played perfectly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, was one of the most unique but entertaining characters in recent memory. This movie informed, but managed to avoid preaching to the audience. It made me laugh, made me sad, made me alive, and kept the time to watch the movie. It doesn't take time to understand what's going on, and take you on a path of true human emotion. I thought I knew my history, apparently I didn't know it at all! I give this move 9 out of 10, and recommend it to all adults, and young adults, and the young at heart, just not the young. but as soon as they are allowed to see "r" rated movies, it makes a priority.
