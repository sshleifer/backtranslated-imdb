See this film at the NFT in London where it was shown as part of the BFI's John Huston season. I wasn't really sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the movie kept very little. In fact, the rest of the movie still kept little! No real plot, no action, no tension, very little drama and, except for a short section at the end, no scenery. <br /> <br /> However, the result of the lack of all these features was a wonderful movie. I don't quite understand why, but I think his underestimation made the movie almost perfect. The acting, the script and most importantly, the casting were all about and I can't remember how to walk away from a theater so well, but I still can't figure out why. I just know I will get the DVD (it's one of those movies I will be sure of, just as well on the small screen as the cinema experience, if you can find somewhere quiet to see it!) And I'll do it to watch again soon. I would also be interested to find out what my family and friends are thinking about. I'm sure it won't be everyone's choice, but I'm convinced a large number agrees with my view. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
