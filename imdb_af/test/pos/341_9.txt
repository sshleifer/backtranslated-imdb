In Sri Lanka, a country divided by religion and language, since 1983, the civil war between the pro-Sinal government and the Liberation Tigers or Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist organization, has claimed an estimated 68,000 lives. Human rights groups have said that because of the war, more than one million people are uprooted, homeless or in camps. The impact on children and families caught in the conflict is being sensitized by renowned Tamil director Mani Ratnam in his 2002 film A Peck on the Cheek, winner of several awards at the National Film Awards in India. While civil war is simply a backdrop to the story of a young girl's discovery series, the human cost of the war is made very clear and Ratnam gives the battle a universal context, pointing to the global arms trade as the source of iniquity. <br /> <br /> Beautifully photographed in South India by cinematographer Ravi K Chandran in an area that reflects the Sri Lankan terrain, the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9-year-old girl who has her rights mother wants to find. in the middle of the fighting in Sri Lanka. Played with deep sense and expressiveness by P.S. Keerthana in an unforgettable performance, educated Amudha by a loving middle-class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (JD Chakravarthi) fled when the fighting broke out and left her in a Red. Cross fight. In a loving retrospect, we see Amudha's adoptive parents, Thiru (Madhavan), a prominent Tamil writer, and mother Indra (Simran), a TV personality, marrying to ease their adoption of the darker baby. <br /> <br /> Young Amudha has no idea that she is being adopted until it suddenly grew on her ninth birthday, according to the parents' prior agreement. While she is playing, Thiru tells her almost almost "you're not our daughter" and the answer is predictable. Disturbed, she asked who her father was, what her mother's name was, why she gave up, and so on, but few answers came up. Amudha walks away a few times until her parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her true mother, now a Tamil separatist fighter. The family's immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to traumatic moments and difficult decisions, which are mostly dealt with by Ratnam, although a sequence where the family is caught in a crossfire that felt amateur. <br /> <br /> Of course, a peck at the Cheek is a Bollywood-style movie and it means tons of music and melodrama. The melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors; However, I found the musical dramatizations of songs by A. R. Rahman against the mood of the movie with their smooth high-tech techniques and fast music video style editing. Yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is said to exceed the film's limitations. Tamil theater has been found by many, even in the country as too clumsy and commercial, but a Peck on the Cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that addresses serious problems. The fact that it successfully exceeds the line between art and commerce is not a rejection, but a tribute.
