Almost missed it. While visiting friends in Philadelphia in the early 1980's, I was navigating the channel after everyone went to bed. It wasn't just Bogart, he was obsessive; but rather the whole era of that old movie that knows about my age is so good. Add to that a plot similar to the Maltese Falcon - where so many different characters interacted with Sacchi - and you have a piece of art as far as I'm concerned. About ten years later it appeared on TV and I signed it. >
