I saw this movie yesterday and can't stop thinking. I moved to Norway four months ago and have since tried to find the origin of the strange emptiness I felt. When I saw this movie, I was punished with the brilliant snapshot of this society. Yes, this is all true !!! I also got a good job with a good salary, and I live with my Norwegian boyfriend in a nice apartment center. But so far everyone I've met has left me with the tasteless, empty feeling I've never had before - that's what this movie is about. Dinner parties with nothing to say to each other, but emotional remarks, long silence, no tension, terribly calm and frozen smiles of beauty. This Scandinavian nightmare is perfectly delivered in Den Brysomme men. See this movie !!!
