This is one of my personal favorites, a rare little gem uncovered by the general population. Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson are the heart of the piece that is a well-chosen film. Few movies have ever caught the real hostilities that the Civil War has subdued, but this one seems to capture all the right tones and moods. If you're a fan of the book, Cold Mountain, try this movie and see if you don't think it's a good companion.
