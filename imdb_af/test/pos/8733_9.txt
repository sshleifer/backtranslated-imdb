I played this movie incessantly this month and I love it. I was in the 60's (oh dear), so it's nostalgic in one sense. However, this is the funny point of departure, the funny dialogue and the great shows that watch me. <br /> <br /> Dr. Winston's reaction to Stephanie at the end of the movie is priceless. (I want to be more specific, but don't want to spoil it for anyone.) Whoever other than Matthau can't play a man at the top, but still love him? As for Bergman's costumes, I think his looks are as dull as she is supposed to. I think "she was robbed" the one time she appeared in a gown. It doesn't suit her at all, it's too bad. I never liked it when I first saw it and I still didn't. <br /> <br /> Goldie won an Oscar for her role. People thought it was a groundbreaking performance at the time, and yet it was the one thing I didn't love as much as the other. She does have the right amount of sweetness and likeness, which is important for this role. <br /> <br /> And I agree - I thought Rick Lenz was great in it and it's too bad that his movie career doesn't take off. <br /> <br /> I hope more people are watching this movie ... they will love it!
