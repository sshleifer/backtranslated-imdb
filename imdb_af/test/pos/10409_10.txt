Anyone familiar with horror movies knows that most of them are not scary at all. Some people enjoy great festivals with overall story lines and character development. Personally, I enjoy horror movies focusing on atmosphere and interesting concepts (eg a story of two sisters, Cairo, etc.). Whatever the kind of horror movie you personally love is just a few selections that really scare you. Noroi is one of them. <br /> <br /> It's a documentary style movie, which means the entire movie is a compilation of video clips linked to the legend of a demonic entity called Kagutaba. The premise is that a journalist has filmed his own footage by maintaining people related to the demonic rituals associated with Kagutaba, then compiling material from other sources related to his research. The result is an indifferent cold experience that feels very real and very disturbing, despite the fact that the story itself is false. <br /> <br /> Some have compared Noroi to The Blair Witch Project, but the only agreement is the documentary style. One obvious difference between the films is that Noroi scares the viewer by connecting events using different sources. For example, the journalist records the outside of a house he is investigating and sees something strange on the stoep. Later in the film, a clip of another character's home video, that equally strange appearance is introduced. The viewer's memory connects the two incidents and cold fever begins to drain their spine. Another example involves a television program with a child psychic that answers each question correctly except one. In fact, her answer is so wrong that the viewer may wonder what the filmmakers are thinking. Later, however, this wrong answer seems to be linked to an extremely disturbing event. It is indeed intelligent movies. <br /> <br /> Another difference between Noroi and Blair Witch is that Noroi does not offer one, but two very long finals, the second of which is placed one minute after the credits started rolling and is the biggest scare the history of the horror theater. I don't say such things lightly. It totally ruined me in a wonderful way. <br /> <br /> Other aspects of film making are well done. The legend and ritualistic background of Kagutaba is very interesting and most actors did a good job. The only over-the-top show comes from a guy who must be crazy anyway, so it is expected. The cinematography is intentionally eager because all the footage is supposed to represent videos shot on video cameras. Japanese films are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here are wonderful. In some cases they create a different worldly feeling (eg the static interference or the first finale), but in other cases it is terribly realistic (eg the second finale). <br /> <br /> When all is said and done, Noroi goes down as the scariest movie I've ever seen. I will go so far as to say that there is no film that offers such a fright from start to finish as Noroi. See it now.
