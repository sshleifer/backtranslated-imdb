Living room was a card-playing legend. He was quoted in an interview and said, "I think it's possible for someone to be a better No Limit Hold'em player than me. I doubt it can happen. But I swear to you, I do don't see how anyone can ever play better than me. "There is a gin rummy scene in this movie that is so wonderful that you put it in" X-Men "as a showcase for a superhero's mutant power . That's how incredible this man was. <br /> <br /> I have some minor issues with this movie. as dark as this movie, Livingy's real life was darker. poker pro todd brunson said: "During the last World Poker series, Bob Stupak, Mike Sexton and I had a drink and talked about Stu. Mike told us how he could barely speak, didn't think in weeks and how she fingers were burned black by a crackle pipe. "In the film, Michael Imperioli looked far too healthy to be in the last years of his life. when he won his last wsop, he looks like a skeleton, but let's see, this production lacks the time and the "deniro" missing that kind of transformation. My other problem was that I wish there was more poker playing, with real hands and situations. sure it might have bored the average non-poker enthusiast, but it would have been nice for the hardcore. too bad the movie was not 6 hours or so longer. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie with 3 non-poker players and they thoroughly enjoyed it all. Just as you should not be a former colonial army member to enjoy Gibson's "patriot", you don't have to be a poker player to see this gem. can't wait for the DVD. (8 out of 10)
