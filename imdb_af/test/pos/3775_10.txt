I saw this movie for the first time in the early 80's and we used it on betamax. As we all know, Betamax has gone the way of the 8-treadmill, sighing, it also had nice image quality. Anyway, I'm glad I found this movie again, I've been looking for it for over 10 years! This movie falls into the category of movies like airplane: continuous jokes, onliners, funny actions (body language). Mark Blankfield is absolutely hilarious. His transformation of the shame dr. Daniel Jekyll in the sexiest party decimal Hyde, is unforgettable, with golden teeth, bristles and gold chains. The part I had the best was when he hijacked the car of the poor guy and then drove to Madam Woo Woo. Totally psychedelic experience without the drugs! If you need laughter therapy, this is the movie to do. When I first saw it, I had tears in my eyes and my stomach hurt to constantly laugh. It's a movie I could watch over and over. I highly recommend it.
