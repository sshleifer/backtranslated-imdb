This is the most human and human film I have ever seen. The ironic abundance, Susan Sarandon as a nun, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in a movie that does not preach, but it also condemns. It is cinema at its best and yet the story is fiction from several real-life events. <br /> <br /> Which of the two are more wonderful, Sarandon or Penn? It's easy to tell who is more equal, but it's hard to tell who is more convincing. they are simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> You may think that all killers should be killed or you may argue that life without parole is not life and death is merciful. Whatever your personal feeling, this movie offers you the opportunity to break and reconsider. <br /> <br /> In the end, you just want to sit and reflect in silence. This is what great drama does, it gives catharsis, it creates a moment in time, a shared memory that touches our humanity.
