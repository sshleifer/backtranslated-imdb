Growing in the late 60s and 70s I couldn't help but become a fan of science fiction. With America's top-of-the-range space program, sci-fi books, movies, TV shows and comics have fueled my imagination and opened my mind to the possibilities that exist in the universe. Farscape is so different from any other sci-fi show, but it has all the ingredients that showcase Star Trek, Battlestar Gallatica, X-Files and Deep Space Nine personal favorites. One of the criticisms of Farscape is that the casual viewer cannot just jump and see one episode and understand what is going on. There are also other very successful performances that used multiple episode story arches and intricate characters. This to me is one of the charms of the show. I don't need or want the story tied neatly at the end of each episode as the various incarnations of Star Trek did. All in all, Farscape has wonderful and funny characters and a running story that says that while people may be the least developed or advanced intelligent species in the universe, they still have unique features and abilities. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the short-lived people on the Sci-Fi channel canceled Farscape's 5th season. They said the cancellation was based on sacking ratings. Yet it was only a few years ago their original original series and a critical favorite. It is a pity that all the artists who help create this show will not be able to continue their labor of love because of the fiscal problems of the channel / company that made it all possible in the first place. <br /> <br /> Hey, don't take my word for it, look at the show, look at the re-runs and make your own mind. Help save Farscape!
