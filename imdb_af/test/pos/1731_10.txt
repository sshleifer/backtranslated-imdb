Doctor Who is wonderful. This is everyone's cup of tea. It must be. The boys will like the monsters and the action and adventure, and the girls will keep the emotions and feelings walking around. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was extraordinary as Rose Tyler. She was so emotional and made Rose so real. <br /> <br /> David Tennant is so greasy and funny and it's so nice to watch. <br /> <br /> But now Billie is gone and Rose is stuck on a parallel universe with her on-off boyfriend Mickey and her mom and dad (he's dead when Rose was a baby, but this Pete Tyler is of the parallel universe). It will be very strange if Martha is the new companion, as I have only seen it with Rose (except the roadbath with Catherine Tate). <br /> <br /> Freema, better be good !!! <br /> <br /> But no one can beat Rose !!!
