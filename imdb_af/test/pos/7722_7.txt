Typically Spanish production - slow-moving, but with great sensuousness and sexuality oozing from the main actress Paz Vega. (See her in "Spanglish"). Big sets, lots of color - you see Cordoba, Seville, Spanish mountains and countryside. The plot tends to bend here and there, but if you follow it (I managed, although the film is in Spanish), you get the core of it. <br /> <br /> It's about how one highly sensual young Gypsy woman, Carmen, uses her female will to deceive men into offering her. Carmen is taken to prison after she attacked a co-cigarette at the cigar factory where she works. She persuaded Jose, the soldier in charge of her in prison, to let her escape. Jose gives her charm because she speaks Basque (he is Navarre and speaks the same language). Jose is punished by 1 month in prison and covered by foot soldier. He later met Carmen at a party and they eventually became lovers. But Carmen refuses to commit him, and continues with her capricious and lively lifestyle. In a jealous rage, Joseph makes a fellow soldier with Carmen. They must leave the village. Life going on keeps Jose in a bandit. Meanwhile, Carmen remains the same, a very prominent woman. In the end, Jose lost his mind and ended up killing Carmen. <br /> <br /> The story is told by Jose in prison and is waiting to be executed. The person he tells is Prospero Merrime, a French writer and anthropologist, whose fine watch (playing Beethoven's Fur Elise) was stolen by Carmen or Jose. <br /> <br /> Worth looking for the sets and the delightful Paz Vega.
