When the circus comes to town and places the lion's cage directly over the Bugs Bunny's house, Bugs come somewhere in the series between equally and fearlessly. Despite the title "Acrobatty Bunny", it is only at the end when Bugs and the lion perform acrobatics. But even leading it is pretty funny that Bugs do to escape to be eaten; somehow he manages the other character's weakness against him, and then pulls a comfortable object out of the air! Bugs later ended in the circus in "Big Top Bunny". I liked this one better, because the latter decreased slightly by giving the antagonist an Eastern European accent (I know it was during the Cold War, but still). I recommend this. <br /> <br /> In the end, we can confirm that it will never be Aloha Oe for this cartoon.
