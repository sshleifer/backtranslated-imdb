After reading the book before watching this adaptation, you would think it would have lost its excitement. However, the story is so clever that I can never tire of it. <br /> <br /> Sally and Elaine put their hearts in their roles and took out so many characters. I fell in love with the story and the women again. <br /> <br /> Great to watch thanks to directions, settings and costumes. In spite of the plots of television, I didn't feel anything was lost. It spent me on the edge of my seat with many wonderful moments of belly. Enjoy it thoroughly. This is the kind of television I was waiting for.
