I have read all the Junji Ito's English released manga. I watched the Tomie movie and it was a great steaming little turd. THANK YOU Uzumaki is really right about the manga. I think those who read the manga will appreciate this movie more, as many screenshots and camera angles are exactly like in the manga and it is interesting to see how the book characters are played in the movie. This movie reminds me of ominous Indiana. The end is different from the manga I expected. Kirie looks like her manga counterpart, and her male friend fits very well. Very creepy I must admit, this movie feels like a feverish nightmare, the kind you have if you were a kid. Not really scary, but freaky, if you get my drive? Another great horror from Japan, get yourself a copy.
