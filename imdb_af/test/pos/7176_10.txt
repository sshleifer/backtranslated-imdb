It's a documentary, unlike any other. It has so many layers and shows us so much that analyzing everything is almost impossible. Documentary William Greaves shows us the process of film making from a different perspective. We see the battle of the actors, the director, the sound crew, and everyone who tries to hang it and make this movie a success. If it's just about a movie being made, it would be normal. What Greaves does is make it more complex by having a crew song that is the actors, and then it will be filmed by another crew, just to have another crew song the whole thing. Three cameras, each with a different purpose. It has an almost dizzying effect on you, but at the same time is exciting. I like the parts where the crew organize and discuss what is going on. Even they are somewhat in the dark about what Greaves is trying to do. Half saw it as an experiment, while the other half regarded it as a chaotic and confusing failure. No matter which side you choose, you can't argue that Greaves doesn't engage you in this process.
