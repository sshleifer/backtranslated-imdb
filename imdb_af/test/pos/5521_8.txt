I saw two other horror movies. who threatened Blood "and" The Kindred "made by Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow and I have to say that" The Power "also does not disappoint. The plot is moving slowly, but there are some effective human goo effects and" The scene of a female tabloid reporter attacked by arms coming out of the mattress is a hoot, and I like this low-budget horror movie and you should, if you're in 80's horror genre .8 out of 10.
