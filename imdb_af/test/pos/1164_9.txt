It was my late wife's favorite movie. I'm sorry she didn't live long enough to have the video because I'm sure she would have carried it. What can we say? A great romantic story and the devastation of two great men, the Raisuli and Teddy Rex. Sean Connery and Brian Keith are big in this role. But while Connery is his regular sexy sex, it's late Brian Keith who gives us a solid performance as the mercurial Teddy Roosevelt. Backed up with Candy Bergen, beautifully in her early 30s, as the abducted American widow. Big backups also come from the great John Huston as Teddy's besieged secretary, John Hay; Geoffrey Lewis, of the Clint Eastwood movies, is great like the hesitant American ambassador, Gummere; the late Vladek Sheybal with his demonic evil stare is great like the Beshaw and more is given by Steve Kanaly and Roy Jensen whose faces we have seen in various backgrounds. All in all, it is a film full of wonderful romance, with a view to an era that is already over. Bad story? Not at all. The issue of large nations pushing smaller children for their own hegemonic interests is as true as it is today. Too romantic? Not really - certainly not maudlin in any sense. Fun to watch? You bet. I own the video and will watch it again. I suggest you do the same.
