Who can ask more? Taking my 2 and 4 year olds was a risk, I acknowledge. But well worth it. They got from credit to credit, with their parents next to them. <br /> <br /> I've been taking the movies with movies before, with mixed results: too scary, too boring, too sophisticated, whatever. However, with this film, I was pleased to see a clever movie with white, style and a passion coming out of the screen. Any movie that takes 5 (!) Years of production to make good or bad, deserves respect for the bravery and patience it takes to film a movie like this. <br /> <br /> O.K. I sneak a little. Then again, why won't I be excited? Watching the movie list today just reminded me of the poor quality of films being distributed. At least for the moment Regardless, W & G is a well made movie. Perhaps the originality was not the most inspired, yet it was well-known and well-played. <br /> <br /> Too much adult humor? Too many sex references? Can be. Although my kids don't really catch them. Too young. So, in my case, I didn't really notice. <br /> <br /> Well, needless to say, I like it.
