I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited after seeing it last (twice) in its unforgettable 1957 release in Toronto. I asked my wife, who had not seen it, to watch the exciting long track, no cuts where Veronika was seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris. In a handshake that definitely predicts the modern Steadicam, the shot pulls back and taps (unintentionally) across the street as she leaves the bus, and frolic among the tanks to cross the road. Then I remember not following the fence, because she looked through and looked for him, but didn't find him. But we continue to follow Veronika as she recruits the faces of harried and their emotional wives, all extras, and each a jewel of resounding Stanislavish behavior. How does one wonder Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky this extraordinary order. But what did I see in this version? After crossing the street, the scene suddenly ended, and cut to the scenes at the apartment before going to the soldiers and their families at the fence. It seems to me that this movie has not just been restored, but also re-entrusted. What a downer!
