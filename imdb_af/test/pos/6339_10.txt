Excellent episode, shown Dean not only has good taste by choosing Cassie for his girlfriend, but also shows that he has a heart and can only love one woman, and he is not just a guy who loves and drops ! Aweso e episode. Applause them on this one. I just hope they will return to the Cassie relationship the next season (if there is another season), I want to see her come back in their "supernatural" lives, especially dean. I also like the fact that they have chosen an African American woman to be the special lady in his life who somehow got away. I hope they don't screw it up and end it as the episode ended. The girl Cassie played was really a viewer and it was good to see that the WB has a branch in what we all see in everyday life - the interactive and common link (finally!)
