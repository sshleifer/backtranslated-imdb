Debt and redemption are two of the set emotions and plural elements of the heavy, powerful dramas the Oscars love so much (which is funny, as "The Kite Runner" was only voted for the best original score. The lack of nominations may have been unfair ). While most movie adaptations of books (or any other way) are usually inferior to their literary counterparts (and "The Kite Runner" is NOT an exception), Marc Forster's movie adaptation is a good one. <br /> <br /> Most people are familiar with the story, the book has been read by millions, so I will not go into the plot except to say that the book remains fairly true to its source. If you don't know the plot, see the movie, or read the book even better. <br /> <br /> The best thing "The Kite Runner" goes out for (except his story) is director Marc Forster. Forster is a director with an epic scope and unique vision that is perfectly used to bring Khaled Hosseini's book to the screen. A small part of me worried that he would use the same dreamy images included in one of Forster's earlier features, "Finding Neverland." Don't get me wrong, "Finding Neverland" is a great movie, one of my favorites, but the visual cheat he used there isn't here. Fortunately, Forster understands that, and the gloss of his direction shows his versatility. Although the lack of a Best Director nomination for his work here is not actually a travesty, I see a number of figurines in the shop for him under the road. <br /> <br /> Also, note is the display of the show. It remains true to the source, but leaves room for Forster's vision to interpret the material. The dialogue is not immersed, and so. Along Forster's direction, move towards a solid pass. Like Forster, the lack of recognition on screenplay awards was not an outrage, but I wouldn't have complained if at least nominated. <br /> <br /> The dividing line between this movie is wonderful and outstanding lies at the acting. Most of the shows are solid, but there are some that don't make the cut, and it hurts the movie. The most notable poor performance comes from Zekeria Ebrahimi, who plays the young Amir. It's not that bad, it's just that it's not as effective as it can be. He can't translate the debt Amir uses for the audience. In fact, I think I could have been a bit lost in the movie at this stage. I didn't read the book about this. He looks gloomy, and sometimes rude, but we can't feel his emotions. It's a tough part to portray, and for the most part, young Ebrahimi loves his own, which is especially surprising, as it is his first role-playing role. <br /> <br /> The best performances come from Khalid Abdalla, who plays adult Amir, and Shaun Toub, who plays the wise Rahim Kahn. Abdalla may not be a famous name (although he was in Paul Greengrass's "United 93"), but his work here is wonderful. He is a quiet, modest man, and he is perfectly emotional when needed. A less-suited actor could have made the character of Rahim Khan in a clich√©, but Shaun Toub uses enough subtlety and cares in his performance that he tries to portray. <br /> <br /> Forgive me or I'm going here, but that's something I need to address, and that's the PG-13 rating of the movie. The fact that this film received such a low rating is scandalous. There is no justification for this. Some may argue that the rating is bent due to the need for everyone to see it, such as the gore in "Save Private Ryan," which some say the movie had to earn an NC-17 rating. But the exception cannot be applied here. The only purpose the scene serves is to tell the story. Forster (probably at the request of producers) tried as hard as to fight the movie's most painful and disturbing scene to allow the movie with a PG-13 rating, but the subject matter is too distressing to be portrayed in any way and gets less than an R rating, regardless of "how tasteful" is portrayed. Worse, this editing robs the scene of much of its power, and trying to make it less disturbing to get the lower rating is offensive. In addition, some scenes of violence are also very disturbing. In terms of how much time these scenes take from the movie, it doesn't add too much, but what is a merit of an R rating at its least. The MPAA, whose rating films have always been corrupted, sank into a new layer by giving this film a low rating. <br /> <br /> But one should not blame the movie for that. The film is a solid film worth watching, especially if they are fans of the book.
