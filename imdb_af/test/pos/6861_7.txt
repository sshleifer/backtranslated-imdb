A horror photo that is finally parody, but still in the game can scare some of those who are devastated or easily disgusted when they see what is under their skin. But I laughed. It was easy to decipher the real killer and his acting didn't help. This meant that Potente looked even better. Anatomy is not much of a horrible picture for the strangers of the genre, but those who stand in it must laugh at some unintentional laugh and get an interesting spike at the German horror cinema. 10/06
