Although credit to dr. Seuess had to be given the story of the story line of "Horton Hatches The Egg", it was a fine movie. It touches both the emotions and the intellect. Thanks to the incredible performance of seven-year-old Justin Henry and a writing sympathetic to each character (and each one's predicament), the thought-provoking elements hang long after the tear-breakers are left. Overall, better because of a solid throw, excellent direction, and a very powerful writing. The right thing about humor throughout the help, is a "heavy" subject of annoying or difficult going through. Lastly, this movie is the test of time and in no way seems dated, decades after it's released.
