Happy 25th Birthday to Girl! Great soundtrack, probable story, wonderful performances ... capture the spirit of the 80's; the snake of the mainstream and the outcasts. A wonderful version of high school life and gritty downtown from a suburban perspective. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack contains songs by Modern English, Felony, Josie Cotton, Sparks, Payola $, Josie Cotton, The Plimsouls, The Psychedelic Furs, Men at Work, The Flirts and Bananarama. <br /> <br /> This movie is really Romeo and Juliet (minus the dual suicide) that occurred in 1980's Los Angeles. Julie's dad, played by Frederic Forrest (Sonny Bono, someone?) Is hysterical like an ideal hippie dad who wondered how he jumped like a materialistic reference. Yet he doesn't judge you dig?
