A very interesting addition to the Scandavian surreal collection. Recommended look for those who keep their movies complicated. My interpretation of the 'strange' end will be that Andrew's journey ends in hell. He does not like the mere consumer-led emptiness of purgatory; some kind of 'living' but not progressing, ie not everywhere - even the city's metro trains do not stop at the stations. It has a Metro system, as you can travel, freedom, escape, but you can never actually drive those trains. He is unable to reach fragrant, sensory skies and winds to continue his bus journey to his final destination. The old Norwegian version of hell (Hades, NOT the terrestrial city) does not burn quite like the British version, it is cold, frozen, the land of Niflheim (country of colds and towns). This seems to be where Andreas has finished, because he just didn't get to the sky through the tunnel.
