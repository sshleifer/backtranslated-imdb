On a second show, it's still a wonderful romance that, in my opinion, is much better than the movie that came with my 2-DVD series, Leo McCarey's classic "An Affair To Remember". Still, it seems to be a bit out of favor (Only a 6.6 rating here on IMDb, and dismissed by many critics as 'gooey slush'). How sad, because it is an intelligent romantic drama with very good work by two leaders, Jennifer Jones and William Holden. As something, the movie should be well remembered for its beautiful color kinematics and the memorable music count. I don't like Valentine's Day much, but it gave me an excuse to see this movie again, and I'm happy about it. While I still think Holden's character is dead too heavily preoccupied, with tension from the final scenes, this movie is very moving and I really enjoy it.
