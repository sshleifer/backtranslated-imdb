Favela Rising is a documentary about the slums of Rio, the favelas, specifically the most violent, Vigário Geral. According to this film, many more children have died in Rio's favas during the past decade or as much as in Israel / Palestine during the same period - a fact that is amazing if it is true, showing the lesser recognition of this social problem in the rest of the world. This is an important topic, especially for those who hope to see in grassroots efforts to avoid the neediest and most dangers through a lively cultural program. This is a compelling documentary, if it is at times horrendous by a somewhat personality-based version of events and by grainy digital video and film that sometimes makes you suspect that you should examine your eyes. <br /> <br /> Doctors rule the favelas and gun-toting teens are the main drug dealers, as in parts of Colombia. Fernando Meirelles's film City of God / Cidade de Deus has been accused of celebrating violence (Cidade de Deus is one of Rio's many favelas). But the early division of Favela Rising shows that favela boys actually commit violence and want to handle drugs where the money and the action are. It is cool to carry a gun there, cool to work as a drug dealer: it is fifty times more profitable than the earnings available in other ways. <br /> <br /> Mochary has the AfroReggae movement and his leaders Anderson Sa and José Junior while visiting a conference in Rio and quickly persuaded his friend and appointed Zimbalist mentor to end his work and Come to make a movie with its own promise to fund it. He's eloquence and charisma and an exciting twist in his life make him the centerpiece of the film and his main storyteller, but like the favelas himself, the movie is other people. No doubt that Sá is a remarkable leader, organizer and artist. <br /> <br /> Vigário Geral is compared to Bosnia: shooting was very dangerous. Anderson's friendship and protection and caution and diplomacy in the shooting gave the filmmakers access and shot detailed footage of their vagaries while (mostly: there were close calls) avoiding serious confrontations with drug chiefs or drug-dealing policemen. They also trained boys to use cameras and left them there on trips. This resulted in 10% of the footage, including rare shots of violent incidents, including police officers. It is difficult for an outsider to keep up with Rio's police murderers. There was one in the early 1990s waiting for the story to inspire Sá, who ended his own early involvement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement. Police are everywhere in the drug trade and if anyone doesn't like it, the poorly trained police paramilitaries come in (often with black ski screens) and shoot up an environment and kill many innocent people. <br /> <br /> This is actually the photo we get in Meirelles's city of God, except that this time, Sá, Junior and the other guys enter, start in Vigário Geral, but eventually spread to a number of other favelas to give percussion classes that attract dozens of youth - girls as well as boys. Founded in 1993, their program AfroReggae (Grupo Cultural AfroReggae or GCAR) is a new alternative way of life for young black men in the Rio ghettos. This leads them to quit smoking, alcohol and drugs (that's the rule) to explode in rap, song, percussion and gymnastics in expressive, galvanic performances. Eventually, the best of SA's leading artists appear before local big audiences with local producers, and their Banda AfroReggae has an international recording contract. <br /> <br /> Other centers and groups were created by or through the GCAR over the years in Vigário Geral and other favelas to bring about the improvement of youth through the provision of music, capoeira, theater, hip hop and dance at Providing GCAR Centers. <br /> <br /> The performance art is not all, just the focal point. GCAR is also a move for broader social change. Through such actions, public awareness is gathered. The centers also provide information training (newspaper, radio, internet, email links), hygiene and sex education to bridge gaps between rich and poor. , black and white, and offers audiovisual workshops, including the production of documentaries. The program is currently active in four other favelas. <br /> <br /> There are many scenes of favela street and home life in Favela Rising and they look very much like the images in City of God with the major difference that the focus and outcome are much, much more positive. Not that it's not an uphill battle. And the corruption of the police, the inequalities of the social system, and the indifference of the general population of Brazil are not addressed directly. But there is a scene where Sá talks to some young children in another favela, cynical boys who are not enthusiastic about AfroReggae and are determined to work in the drug trade as Sa himself did as a boy. No one seems to be convinced of them, despite the fact that male traders do not make it at the age of fifty. But we learn that the most negative boy in this group, Richard Morales, joined the movement five months later. There is also a freak accident account that So, but with a positive outcome, turned off. <br /> <br /> It would be great if the images were sharper and clearer and if the story was a bit edited, but it was lively, inspirational material and represented dedicated, risk-controlled documentary films and it was nice that Favela Rising included in seven film festivals and won numerous awards, including Best New Documentary Filmmaker at the Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently shown at the London Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA). However, a wide art house group in the US seems somewhat unlikely. <br /> <br /> Included in the SFIFF 2006.
