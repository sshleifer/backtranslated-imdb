It has no connection with Virtual Encounters 1, so it's not really a successor. The two videos share only the general concept of people who have simulated through a virtual reality machine. So, if you're really blown away by the story and dialogue in VC 1 (yes, right), and expecting a continuation in VC 2, just be warned. All the actors and actresses are new, but it has the same excellent director, Sybil Richards. <br /> <br /> But like VC 1 you get very nice women and very good sex scenes that can go the soft core envelope as far as it goes. <br /> <br /> If you have VC 1 and you liked it, you'll keep VC 2. If you don't, but like a very good cartoon sex, get both.
