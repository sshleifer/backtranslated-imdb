Trey's favorite of the first race of Season 10 and also one of my personal favorites, Manbearpig, features the adventure of Al Gore before he warms up the earth. And before the movie it was an adventure that was definitely an adventure. Al Gore also tried to make the world aware of something that Earth can change, something really dangerous, this time about something half-half-legged and half-pig, Al Gore has only one thing in mind: to be aware of Manbearpig and kill it! All Gore here is more than hilarious, everyone who sees him feel sorry for him and yes he can be childish, do tantrums, because no one believes him, but he's just a decent bastard. In fact, four kids are trapped in a cave because of Al Gore, but deciding that he doesn't have it in his mind, there's no room for any other subject, just Manbearpig as far as Al Gore is concerned. These four children are Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan. In fact, Stan felt sorry for AL Gore and the four boys only played in Al Gore's game, and never died that Gore could almost kill them while he wanted to kill Manbearpig (hilarious scene - they are just children, damn manbearpig) So on this side we have all the good things with the rescue team who also feel sorry for Al Gore and on the other hand we have a little but hilarious Cartman episode and there are no surprises about the attitude of Cartman after he found a treasure in the cave, surely, the whole thing with this treasure is fantastic and is great because you will see a sick Cartman in both senses, he is very ill for the boys and very sick for And finally, Al Gore Manbearpig killed! This character is a fantastic one and I'm grain! Great fun in this episode, a highly repeatable 10 out of 10
