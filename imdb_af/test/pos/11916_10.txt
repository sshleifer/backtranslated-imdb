This movie is a perfect example of great escape! I loved this movie and sucked from the beginning. Sure it's just an action movie, but isn't fun watching movies is all about? <br /> <br /> The movie of this movie is very strong with similar characters. The friendship between the boys is so realistic and attractive, it is heart warming and hilarious to see that a group of teenagers interact - especially this group of boys !! Sean Astin makes a big rebel, which successfully avoids being an early teenager. <br /> <br /> If you want fun, watch this movie! I thoroughly enjoyed it, although I watched it on a very dirty and old VHS that was terrible quality (go DVDs!)
