I heard an interview with the main actor who said that the film was not intended to be a horror movie, but he would describe it as a spiritual horror. I strongly endorse it. <br /> <br /> It's not clear why he's traveling to this place, but everything is monotonous, no bright colors, no honest smiles, nothing personal. Everything is ordered and everyone seems to be happy to live this kind of life. Our "hero" though from the beginning seems to be wrong and feels it himself. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so important and good is the remarkable deal with life in many big cities, or even countries, nowadays. You need to work, don't let your colleague know what your weaknesses are, you show your wealth, your car, etc. And most of you lack the true love of life that children have. Of course, in this movie you do not see children or parents - they simply do not fit into a society of strong workers. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to everyone - and make sure this utopia doesn't come true!
