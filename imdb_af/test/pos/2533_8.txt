When released in the early 80's, Pixote brings the problems of young criminals and their impact into Brazilian society to Brazilian society. I can't see the movie, because I was too young, but now I got a chance and watched it a few days ago. It's a very brutal movie, but everything is absolutely true and sad. Pixote is the name of a 12-year-old boy living and surviving in the streets with crimes; He stays in a house of detention for a while, and when he leaves, he continues with other bulls and a prostitute played by marilia Pera. the boy is still a marijuana addicted and smells gum with another teen, to forget his sad reality. The quality of the images is not the best, but the film is quite realistic about Brazilian problems and must be seen and admired.
