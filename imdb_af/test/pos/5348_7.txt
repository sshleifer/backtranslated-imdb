'Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit' 'is the same kind of animation and of the same creators of' 'Chicken Run' ', but the story is now different: Wallace, an inventor who loves cheese and she loves smart dog Gromit Wallace always helps in his problems, trying to keep the rabbits away from everyone's vegetables, as there is an annual huge vegetable competition in their town. But when Wallace tries to find an invention he has made to avoid vegetables, he is going to be cursed. Before I watched this movie, I didn't know that these two characters had already existed and were famous. I loved Gromit, and I think he's one of the coolest dogs I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> aka "Wallace & Gromit -A Batalha dos Vegetais" - Brazil
