It was one of my favorite childhood movies. I watched it so many times, eventually my band wore. I was a big fan of this show and still. The thing I like most about this movie is that it claims so many people, young and old. I now look at this movie and laugh as hard as I did the first time. I can now appreciate all the adult jokes I have never received as a child. My favorite characters are Elmyra and Foulmouth. Almost fifteen years later, my dad (a big fan of the movie too) and I still call lines from this movie. I love the part where Foulmouth and Shirley go to the movie. "You hit the seats, Shirl and I will snatch the dadgum snacks." I also congratulated Plucky and Hampton and his family on Happy World Land. Wade Pig reminded me a lot of my dad. I like the part when they finally arrive at Happy World Land and all they do is on the monorail. This movie is hilarious and appeals to children and children. What's more, the animation, jokes and everything about it. If you haven't seen it, rent it. You won't be sorry.
