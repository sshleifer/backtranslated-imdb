Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur is not one of his best rated films; Made between two very popular and critically priced photos, Suspicion and Shadow Of a Doubt, it is generally considered a lesser effort. I agree that the later movie is groundbreaking and pulling Hitchcock into the US mainstream for the first time, but Saboteur is at least as lively as Suspicion; His main goal is his less than charismatic star players, Bob Cummings and Priscilla Lane. <br /> <br /> In Saboteur we find Hitchcock his way around America, literally, as his main character is from California to New York. of an arson for whose crime he was accused. Cummings is very young here, and very pleasant. His boy (but not immaturity) fits perfectly with the character he portrays and looks appropriate, as the director, although middle-aged, was rediscovering himself and an older, more established star might have thrown things. Priscilla Lane's spiky heroine, who was not a typical type of director, was very common in American movies at the time. and she and Cummings give an openness and youth that the director needs in his life and work. I can't suggest older, more solid types, such as Cooper and Stanwyck. They behaved well, as they had between them, well. Too much luggage. <br /> <br /> As is the norm In Hitchcock's films is nothing like it seems. Where Saboteur differs from his better-known films, the audience is getting caught up early. Although Cummings is an accused fire child, we know he is innocent. The villains soon become clear; and the movie hangs more on its plot than its ironic. What a pleasure there is, and here the Master does not disappoint. There is an interesting, Tod Browningish interlude with some circus freaks, which helps Cummings discharge. In another scene, reminiscent of James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein, Cummings spent some time in the home of a blind man who, as it turns out, is Lane's uncle. Was the director perhaps studying the most important American films of the last decade? Either way, these and other horrible and discursive aspects of the movie give it a playful and variety that adds to the fact of quite youthful leads, the picture looks like the work of a younger man who still learns his craft. <br /> <br /> The movie's later scenes, in New York, are more exciting and typical of the director, as the picture gradually becomes more Hitchockian as it moves. In the end I find it a satisfying job; And since Cummings of Lane doesn't have a dark side as an actor, the movie doesn't have one either. It is deliberately lightweight, and I suspect semi-experimental; an attempt by Hitchcock to see if he could move into an American environment, which he did so well in England. He did a great job. The next logical step: Shadow Of a Doubt, a film in which the main character travels east to west, and with a completely different set of values ​​and plans. <br /> <br />
