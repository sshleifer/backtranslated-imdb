Twins Effect, starring some of HK's most popular stars, offers one of the finest movie experiences to ever come out of HK. It has something for everyone, action, comedy, horror, romance, and some drama. This movie cannot be taken too seriously, otherwise you will be disappointed, but if you leave your brain at the door and just watch the movie for some fun, you should enjoy it. <br /> Great special effects, great action, cute twins, cool HK actors, FUN movie! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone!
