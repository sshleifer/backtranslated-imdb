Mud and Sand is one of Stan Laurel's spoofs of the popular films, then of Rudolph Valentino's Blood and Sand (so Stan is Rhubarb Vaselino). While partially inconsistent with characterization (how did he defeat the bulls in the beginning, it is not explained), it was mostly funny from start to finish, with one of the best rows he did with his then common law wife, Mae Laurel. Another funny series relates to his reluctance to romance a femme fatale, Filet de Sole, while his wife, Caramel, waits for him to show a few cans of his later innocent character with Oliver Hardy. Worth seeing for anyone interested in mr. See Laurel's early work ahead of his fatal teamwork that made him popular in the world.
