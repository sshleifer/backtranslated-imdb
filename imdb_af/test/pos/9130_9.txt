Commissioner Mattei (André Bourvil) is a single with a small gun who loves cats and his boss at the police department in Paris is a philosopher who knows that even the police are guilty sooner or later. That's what the movie is about. And a jewel robbery at Vendome. <br /> <br /> Corey (Delon) brings the plan out of jail, Vogel (Volonté) joins him and helps him against two tough guys who are after him because he has taken mafioso. Ricos (Andre Eycan) holds money while Rico has already taken Corey's girlfriend and left him in jail for five years. Corey and Vogel find a third man, Jansen (Montand), a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by shooting special handmade ammunition in a hole. A perfect plan and collaboration, but they have to buy the loot and there is Mattei in the role of a buyer in disguise. The circle closes. To help each other, they are shot by the cat who loves Mattei and his little pistol. <br /> <br /> It took Melville 20 years and he said he would make a robbery movie after he couldn't get a contract for RIFFIFI. Melville wrote and filmed the screenplay in southern France and in Paris last year. The great Henri Decae is, as usual, the lighting cameraman. This is the one before the last photo of Melvilles who died in 1972 to another movie with Delon. <br /> <br /> Melville really wanted Belmondo instead of Volonté, he didn't like that Italian, but Volonté-Vogel is an excellent refugee and gives the most convincing performance alongside Bourvil. But remember: Melville notes that Volonté is an instinctive actor, a strange character, very tired and absolutely impossible on a French set. Melville didn't like him at all and never wanted to work with him again. <br /> <br /> Melville is wrong. Volonté gives the most vibrant character in nowhere of not so many interesting characters. You can see what he was driving through Mattei in winter 70 and his little dangerous rifle and all the dogs in France. A wild actor. <br /> <br /> Also, André Bourvil, near the time of filming. He was also not the first choice, but certainly a good substitute. He carries the instinct of a lonely hunter through the entire movie and eventually gets his chance to be guilty again. <br /> <br /> At night, Jansen entered the jewelery store with a gun and a tripod, but eventually a free shot was a successful shot. When he first meets at Delon, we already know that the elegant Jansen has a serious drinking problem. After the robbery, Montand left his share of the booty and named Delon, who was looking at him, that he had just entered the red circle because he wanted to take revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe. Delon didn't get what he meant. The audience remembers seeing Montand in a big scene in a haunted house attacking helpless nightmare creatures coming out of the wardrobe and attacking him. At that time, a very rare scene, one reminiscent of a long time after. I'm sure it was ever so difficult to arrange and direct those things at a time when nobody imagined the next day of digital film imagination. Great artwork when hand crafted. <br /> <br /> We will surely remember a crew like the actors, but even after 33 years this one seems to be the less popular of the six thrillers of Melville. What's wrong with that? I'm afraid there's not much interest in the three actors (three criminals) and their police hunter. We learn too little about Corey and his fatal 5 years away from his beautiful girl (Anna Douking). Montand is still a good sniper, but what made him a drinking man with funny creatures in his wardrobe. Delon serves as an early adventure of the samurai, Volonté is the man in the trumpet of Delons American car and moves excellently and Mattei swells to look, a great actor on the brink of his life. But how can he ever doubt that everyone is guilty? <br /> <br /> In an interview, Melville says there is no woman in the movie. Not in the very red circle, but I remember that very pretty woman Anna Douking (with no future career). We are in the 70's. There is actually a woman rising from the bed of an old mafioso wearing nothing and walking slowly to the door to listen to the voice of her old lover Delon. Bardot did so ten years earlier. This time Melville was directing. Well done. <br /> <br /> The RED CERCLE certainly added some but not very glittering jewelery to the movie history. The robbery at Place Vendome and Montands wonders the wardrobe residents and Volonté escapes Bouvil in white underwear and gently wears his pants over a stream. It is too small for a large gangster and robotic film. But the 110 minutes never carries you and it's a high level game. And there are probably some secrets that you learn when you watch the movie over and over. None of the secrets is that we are all guilty and that late Francois Perier also appears. <br /> <br /> Michael Zabel
