No one said it in "The Big Trail" and I thought it would be natural. Yet it was one of the best westerns I've seen and I'm a big fan of horses and gunsmoke movies. The magnitude and feel of this picture is simply staggering, and as someone mentioned in their comment, it has the feel of the 3-camera triptych of "Napoleon" (1927). Today, the cost of production and especially the exhibition of thousands is prohibited, but Raoul Walsh did it. <br /> <br /> The movie was excellent, though John Wayne was better off with no lines and just swaggered around. In particular, Tyrone Power, Sr. was a perfect villain - I've never seen him and that was his only talk. Ian Keith was a snake, but El Brendel is an acquired taste as the comic relief. He may be funny or irritating, but mostly the latter - and he appears at the most inappropriate times. <br /> <br /> It's a bit too long and it took a while for the Indians to arrive, but it's so close to a documentary about Manifest Destiny and so true of life as what you will see and have a favor for movie lovers, regardless of genre preference. By the time the settlers came to California, I was exhausted.
