Intelligent nail-biting drama came out in 1979 and was soon on the cover of every US newspaper (when life imitated the movie). A nuclear power plant employee in Southern California is threatened by superiors when he decides to go public with the right story behind an accident at the plant. The seemingly quenching problem, a TV news agency's film, shows that it was an accident that occurred on disastrous relationships - and even worse, security conditions are being scrubbed to save millions of dollars, a cover that covers everyone's lives. danger. The movie is sometimes too technical (especially in the second half) and can use more human interaction, but the performances of Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda (like a real-time newswoman in the right place at the right time). Michael Douglas (as freelance cameraman) is wonderful. The disposable clashes on nuclear lawyers are both completely accurate and bitterly satirical, and the newsbiz (with its corporate structure and vapid-yes-men) is captured alive. *** 1/2 from ****
