With the Nazi attack in Eastern Europe in the late 1930s, Charles Chaplin drew attention to creating a response to it. The catalyst may have been a propaganda publication referring to Chaplin as a Jewish sympathizer. In the great dictator, Chaplin created a deadly-shot parody of Hitler that is as funny as it is sometimes frightening. The film contains the experiences of Hitler in the German army from World War I to this day. At the same time, Chaplin plays a Jewish barber dressing like a tramp that comes out of hospital for a long time, just to discover how different the world is under Nazi rule. <br /> <br /> Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at Time plays a young Jewish girl whose family is suppressed in a Jewish ghetto. Jack Oakie has a great Oscar-nominated supporting role as a Mussolini Look-Alike (Benzini Napaloni) who gives Chaplin's Hitler character, Adenoid Hynkel, many fittings. Henry Daniell is his regular regular self as Garbitsch, chief advisor of Adenoid Hynkel. Chaplin wrote and directed the film and received Oscar nominations for his screenplay and his play. The film was also named for the best photo. <br /> <br /> Chaplin has made the movie under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not well known. He financed the whole movie himself with great risk because of the subject, and there were no other great films about Nazi Germany up until that time. The film spent about twenty-one months in production with Chaplin and even rebuilt a set and shot a scene to get things right. By the time of the release of the film in October 1940, the war in Europe was well under way with Hitler, who had defeated one country after another. The film has become much more active than production first. <br /> <br /> There is not much plot to watch the movie; The movie looks more like a series of comedy circuits and / or accidents that combine to reach a goal that is independent of the movie itself. Several examples of this take place in the final third of the film with the meeting between Hynkel and Napaloni. The scene is very funny, but it does not lead to the plot. Similarly, the escape of both the hairdresser and Schultz exposes to the faulty identity of the hairdresser for Hynkel to give Chaplin (through the barber's character) an opportunity to pacify to the audience at the end of the film. On the other hand, what better way to make a point about the misplaced narcissism of Aryan superiority than to have a Jewish hairdresser wrong with Hynkel? <br /> <br /> However, the film contains very high comic moments, such as the rallying talk, the new war developments (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), the dancing worldview, the coin in the pudding scene and the whole scenario between Hynkel and Napaloni (including the barrel chair scene) to highly recommend the film. One can also not forget the risks Chaplin made in his first feature film, an anti-Nazi film, and finance the film itself. *** 1/2 of 4 stars.
