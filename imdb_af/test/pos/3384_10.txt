I enjoyed a lot of North and South. I think it's one of the best and most luxurious TV shows I've ever seen. The caliber of the movie is incredible, you have actors of "Golden Age of the Cinema", such as James Stewart, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons with other actors who were the new faces of the 80s, like Patrick Swayze, James Read, Jonathan Frakes, Genie Francis, Philip Casnoff and Lesley-Anne Down. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the story is the friendship of two completely different men, there is Orry Main (Patrick Swayze) from the south and George Hazard (James Read) coming from the north. During the series, their friendship is constantly threatened with the differences in their backgrounds, especially on the treatment of slaves in the South (especially at Orry's plantation), but when they need the others, they will forget the arguments and help their friend. I really liked the chemistry between the two men and was really interested to see if their friendship could survive the war. <br /> <br /> I liked how the series showed how life was before the war, so the audience could see what were the factors that led to the war that was going on then, then the destruction of a nation torn apart and then rebuilding the land. The war styles were very well choreographed and very realistic to me. <br /> <br /> I think it's great, it has so many elements going through it, romance, history, battles that will interest most. heard, there is something for everyone. I especially enjoyed the romance between Brett (Genie Francis) and Billy (Parker Stevenson / John Stockwell), especially when she first rose to her sister Ashton. The other romance was interesting because it wasn't the same. Each one had something different than the others that made me especially look at the Madeline and Orry storyline to see if they would eventually be together. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best American mini shows I've watched, the story has the right balance of romance and the more serious history case that occurred in the country at the time, but it is just right. The characters are very viewable and the places are beautiful and the music especially at the beginning and end of the episode is so tapping well and works with the mood of the story.
