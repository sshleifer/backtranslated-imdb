Caddyshack 2 has a terrible reputation, just because it is a sequel to a highly classic classic. People have criticized the film on many grounds, but eventually they all returned to the fact that it is not Caddyshack. <br /> <br /> I will start by saying that we just have to take Caddyshack out of the equation and consider this movie on its own merits, but I think it would be unfair. The movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor. The class-related themes of snobs versus slobs and the desire to fit into a class above your own are as common as they were in the first movie. The two things that are really missing here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, who are replaced by Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason respectively. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not going to argue that Ackroyd comes near Murray. the movie, but Jackie Mason is an admirable successor to Dangerfield. He comes down as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without getting too heavy. I won't say he's close to being as funny as Dangerfield in Caddyshack, but there's a lot more attention to his character and his dilemma in the movie. <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase just pops up and handfuls of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. Perhaps these naysayers didn't notice that he'd only emerged in the first movie a few times. For my money, its screens are very funny here, if it's a little overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> While I'm on the subject, it's really the opposite of this movie that makes it down. It is so far more self-conscious in its efforts to get a laugh. Many of the jokes are complicated and there is too much of the Gopher, who had a much more anthropomorphic personality and voice, just if we didn't understand the idea that it was funny. <Br /> <br /> Characters are also hammered at home, especially the smarmy yuppy kids. Jackie Mason barely misses, and is consistently similar and very funny, but we don't need the tango sequence! The director is clearly not the same mindset as Harold Ramis. Not to suggest that Caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a bit overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily decorated with a strange music expression. <br /> <br /> All these things were considered, it's a fun, fine movie with something to say about the class and identity that was currently very little movies. Don't be scared by the terrifyingly low rating on IMDb, look it yourself.
