I didn't realize how much of this episode was taken from The Enemy Below, until I finally saw the movie (it has since become my favorite war movie). There were also some elements of Run Silent Run Deep. Nothing wrong with stealing ideas as long as you do something cool with them. And the boy did Roddenberry and the company something with this one. <br /> <br /> The story begins when the Romulane violates a 100-year treaty and crosses the neutral zone and destroys a series of Federation outposts next to the zone, apparently for their superior weapon and invisibility screen (and subsequent shift in the balance of power between the Romulans and the Federation, in their opinion) as a prelude to an overall invasion. Kirk decides whether it is worth the war to stop the Romulan ship, or the fact that the attackers are most at risk of destroying four military outposts. Kirk chooses the latter. <br /> <br /> This is our first glance at an enemy of the Federation, the Romulane, a warlike but honorable race that is far from the Vulcans. However, unlike their peaceful cousins, the Romulans did not deny their emotions and violent and imperialist ways, even though they were technologically advanced. <br /> <br /> None of these things affect Mr. Stiles, the ship's navigator and head of this episode. antagonist aboard the company (the Romulan commander has his own problems with a gung-ho junior officer). All that matters to him is that he hates Romulans and Spock looks like one. Until the end when Spock saved his life (of course). It contrasts sharply with Captain Kirk and the Romulan commander, and no personal bad will to others. Both men simply do their duty. In fact, there is mutual respect. This is the first Trek episode that deals directly with prejudice, and it does so fine (unlike season 3's not-so-subtle "Let it be your last battlefield"). <br /> <br /> Like The Enemy Below, we have a classic chess match between two ship commanders that are really alike. You see immediately that both of these captains are good. ALL GOOD. If you go into battle, you want to have one of these men as your leader. Both are honorable and decent men who are obliged. Although the Romulan commander is tied to his homeland, he still finds himself destroyed before he can do it rather than start another interstellar war. Still, he still does everything he can to make it home, just as Kirk does everything he can to stop him. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of Trek's top five. It has everything: lots of action, excitement, great dialogue, fine acting (I still love the Romulan commander was Mark Lenard's best Trek role), and he manages his social commentary without being prehistoric. A pity Roddenberry forgot about the last part when he did TNG. <br /> <br /> Look at this episode and then look at the enemy below.
