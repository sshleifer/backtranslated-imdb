The crew of an American submarine discovered it was HELL BELOW, while fighting in the Adriatic region in 1918. <br /> <br /> Although it is almost forgotten, this excellent war film still delivers good entertainment, thanks to a literate script, excellent performances and highly credible action scenes. <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery and Walter Huston play undersea officers under the stress of war that is in conflict with each other, with dramatic and tragic results. Since Montgomery falls in love with Huston's daughter, Madge Evans, in a well-played role, the situation becomes even more complicated, both on shore and under the waves. The viewer is torn between the two strong characters, one controlled by his heart and the other by the rules. <br /> <br /> Robert Young makes an effective appearance as Montgomery's partner. Sterling Holloway creates a short, lively, portrait of a doomed sailor. <br /> <br /> Eugene Pallette as the torpedo master and Jimmy Durante as the cook's cook makes for a very funny comedy team and offers the story a lot of laughter. . Durante's nose comes in for many ribs and his obsession with amateur dentistry leads to chaotic encounters with British tars. <br /> <br /> Movie mavens will recognize Babe London as an obese Italian lady; Maude Eburne as the wife of a British admiral and Paul Porcasi as an Italian admiral - all unreasonable. <br /> <br /> MGM has given the film absolutely first-class production values, with the underlying rows especially well-produced. Both the claustrophobic compactness of the ship and the inevitable tension associated with submarine warfare are accurately portrayed. Other moments of unexpected drama (Montgomery & Miss Evans caught on a stalled Ferris wheel during an air gear) and hilarity (Durante who gets a kangaroo) are expertly screwed into the material of the movie for a completely satisfying viewing experience.
