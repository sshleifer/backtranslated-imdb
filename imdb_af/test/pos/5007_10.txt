Spike Feresten is a comic genius. "Talk show" demonstrates a fresh take on the kind of weird ball irreverence that shows like Letterman and The Daily Show successful. His equivalence is tangible. He seems to find the unique corner of the joke, not the predictable sitcom road ... thank you. His comedy reminds of the award-winning Arrested Development (cross your fingers that 'Talk show' has a longer lifespan). The topics he emphasizes tend to be those things that everyone sees unnoticed, but if he jokes around them, you wonder how you missed it for the first time. I especially enjoyed the sketches ... "Unfair Target" will be a cult class at a time. Imagine your Tivo's people ... it's a show that can't be missed.
