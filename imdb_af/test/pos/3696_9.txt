Jenny Lewis plays an uncomfortable girl named Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have many friends and she has a nagma (Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds her closer to her mother's boyfriend Billy (Rob Estes) growing, perhaps she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't have to tell you what happens next. <br /> <br /> This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone has to blame. This movie also has the best play I've seen in TV movies. Beverly D'Angelo does a very good job as a lovely and loving but neglected and blind mother. She couldn't see what's going on under her own roof. Rob Estes is here at best but the ball. Jenny Lewis is striking. She looks exactly like her character. <br /> <br /> Everybody seems to love this movie!
