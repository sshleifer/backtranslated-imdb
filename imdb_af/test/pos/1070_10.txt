This Christmas gift came with mercy from TCM. We have never seen the movie, although we have seen most of Barbara Stanwyck's films. This comedy made us laugh so much that we sometimes had to withdraw to hear the dialogue. <br /> <br /> It is a movie that has to be seen by people experiencing stressful situations, especially around Christmas. It will definitely lift your spirits just by letting go. The movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a DVD, or a VHS band. <br /> <br /> "Christmas in Connecticut" was directed by Peter Godfrey, based on a story by Aileen Hamilton. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is the happy compilation of two of the most popular stars of the era: Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan. Barbara Stanwyck always played strong women, of course, it was a change for her. In this movie, as well as "Lady Eve", show me. Stanwyck a talent for the comedy. She and Mr. Morgan, who has played in many musical comedies, makes a winning combination. <br /> <br /> There are no poor performances in the movie. Sydney Green Street, an actor who is known to play heavies, is a delight to watch as rich and fat, Alexander Yardley, the man who owns a media rich and who has a good reputation when he saw it. Reginald Gardiner, an advanced English actor, adds brilliance to the stellar role behind the two principals. <br /> <br /> S. Z. Sakall is another source of ongoing joy; he plays Hungarian chef Felix, who has a difficult time with his own version of the English language. Also, Una O'Connor makes a perfect Norah, the housekeeper in the Sloan perfect Connecticut place. <br /> <br /> When reading other comments in this forum, it is sad to learn that glorious black and white filmmaking is not appreciated. by some people. The color was not widely used in the 40's, and most of the classic movies should be seen in the original format, because what would be achieved to color them? <br /> <br /> This movie should be a requirement for anyone who wants to spend about two hours of uninterrupted fun on Christmas because total enjoyment is guaranteed. Look at it with an open mind and heart and maybe you want to see Christmas in Connecticut every year.
