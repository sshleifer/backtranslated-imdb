While my kids enjoyed the movie (and later announced that they wanted to buy it later), I think I got more out of it. The scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life (I didn't use the cut comments aloud, but I thought). It's a nice high-life movie, a bit juicy and some scenes work less well than others (why does the child stay with Bruce Willis after he knows his mother dies?) But all and good time. It also told our family something to talk about - did my children think my life was boring? What do they expect at 40? How can you not like a movie that has a good conversation with your children?
