Unlike most people who commented, I was born after the last Sylvester Mccoy episode and so I couldn't compare the two centuries-old doctor who compared in the first place. I really enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series. Since then I have seen old Doctor Who episodes and some are so big, but like the doctor, the series had to regenerate to continue. The 21st century good doctor thought Martha was big, almost a doctor's game and if Jack's appearance goes something she will be brilliant if she comes in series 4 or 5. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Jack, turning around, Torchwood is also brilliant and you both need to watch these programs (though definitely more suitable for kids). But if you insist that it's not the same and just not a doctor, you just stay in your basement. <br /> <br /> 10/10
