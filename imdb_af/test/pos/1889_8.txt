These are the kind of movies I loved and still love growing up. Unlike big budget movies that crate big holes and never admit it. This movie takes everything in play and just makes something you can sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br /> There were some film students who complained earlier that it was not a listing material. But that's not the point. The point of this movie is that no one likes big CGI Clich√©-filled movies. There are many people who like movies that are just meant to entertain you, and not as much money as they can. <br /> <br /> It's also nice to know that the good o 'Bruce is not dead yet.
