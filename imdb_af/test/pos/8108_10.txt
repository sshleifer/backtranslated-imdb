I was amazed and impressed to find out that this movie was released in 1940, before the United States entered World War II. On the surface satirization of something as solemn and terrible as Nazi Germany would be wrong as a result. But Chaplin's brilliance is not limited to joking. In fact, the seriousness of his message would not have been nearly as valid if it wasn't for the excellent use of humor in this movie, along with the moments of a dramatic drama. Drama alone would not have had the bite and resonance film. Laughing someone (Adenoid Hynkel) can be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (the Jewish barber) is the best way to love them. In the Jewish Barber's final speech, I forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. They are words that now have meaning and in any time of war. For this reason, I believe the movie has become much better than harmful, as it still has the same effect today.
