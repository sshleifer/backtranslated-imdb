I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I buy these slasher movies, if I know it's the same every time. Maybe I'm a little masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a small group of teenagers who go camping, drinking and having sex in the bush. Yes, they are killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic! This is one of the best experiences I've seen in a treasure trove. The places where it was shot are so wonderful. You see mountains, waterfalls, rockies. It's just amazing. It takes a very long time (except for the opening scene) before the killer starts killing, but I don't care! It was nice to look enough to not care. What I mean, you won't be sitting there waiting for the murders to start, because every thing that happens is enjoyable because of the beauty of the movie itself. The end is a bit strange, but I will tell you nothing more about it. You will know what I mean. Another thing I enjoyed: you care about the characters. They are not just a lot of jerks who spend their time typing each other. Sure, they are pure stereotypes of ordinary treasure characters, but there is something special about them. Anyway, this is a great horror movie and I hope you have a good time watching it, because I really did!
