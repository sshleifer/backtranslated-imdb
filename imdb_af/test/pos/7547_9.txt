The first of five St Trinian's films (although usually discounted) is based on the artist Ronald Searle's schoolgirl characters and features the wonderful Alastair Sim in suit as Millicent Fritton, chief and her own brother. Much of the humor is dated but curiously touching and outrageous in today's computer world. The girls are drinking, playing, smoking, and later selling to rich Arabs, but are always in control, defeating bureaucrats, police, judges and other settlement figures as they wander over England. Perhaps, because the films are so often seen on TV, St Trinians still inspire fancy dress festivals and club days. The films feature recurring characters that include PC Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell) and Flash Harry (George Cole). The forerunner of the whole series is a lovely movie called 'The Happy Days of Your Life' (1950).
