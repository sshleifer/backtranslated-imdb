Well, I'm an Italian horror fan and I like movies by directors like Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, just to quote the best known. "La villa delle anime maledette" is one of the most unfamiliar films of this genre, shot when this kind of theater started with its crisis that still persists today, and director Carlo Ausino sounds totally new to my ears (though he has six movies .. This is the price Italian directors have to pay not to work in Rome.). But the film isn't that bad. And it's absolutely not right to talk about "trash". OK, the plot is not so original; It reminds me of things like the Amytville series (the year is the same as "Amityville Possession" by Damiano Damiani) or "Shock", the latest work by Mario Bava. But you have to think it's the movie of a movie maker (like Mario Bava movies); so the most important thing is the atmosphere, not the story or the characters; atmosphere created very well by the use of light and by camera movement. The rest remains in the background. I think the movie works; not so good, but working; It's definitely better than a lot of Hollywood production like the "Haunting" that has a bigger budget, but no bigger ideas.
