This is the funniest movie I've ever seen. However, I laughed a lot at many movies. This is because the brilliance of Best In Show is not in slapstick or one-liners, but in sophisticated and layered oral white. The improvised dialogue is so fast that you don't end up on every single joke, but only after several jokes build on each one disarms your senses to the jokes and you can't help letting go. <br /> <br /> It's a well-shot movie, but what makes it extraordinary is the play. I was impressed with my first viewing, but when I looked at it after learning that virtually every scene was improvised, I was surprised. It was enjoyable to see the comedians work, to make jokes out of nothing and to immerse themselves in their characters. <br /> <br /> I think the golden days of the second city were so.
