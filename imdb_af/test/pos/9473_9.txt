I just took my 11-year-old daughter and 8-year-old boy to this movie and I can't remember a movie where I laughed so loudly - literally out loud, deeply bursting with laughter because this movie is yelling. Granted the story line is predictable, but the ride is so enjoyable that it doesn't matter that you know how it will end. The actors' comic sentences of timing were impeccable. The actors were thrown perfectly. My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes is the last of the young women actresses who do not ruin their lives. She is so refreshing. My kids said it was their favorite movie of 2006. Our money was well spent on this movie.
