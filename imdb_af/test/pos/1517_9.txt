This movie, with only two characters, takes you closer to these two people, the interrogator and the prisoner, than most movies take you to any character, but well-crafted. <br /> <br /> The confusion, terror and pain that Madeleine Stowe's character undergoes is very disturbing, such as Alan Rickman's sadistic but charming interrogator. <br /> <br /> This film is all possible and builds into a shocking climax, the effect of the film as a whole. you are quiet at the end. It will haunt you for a long time.
