Well, it took them 4 tries, but they did it! In this 4th sequel to the Karate Kid franchise, the producers really hit a home run! Well, I'm complaining first to finally get rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt he never served the role of the Karate Kid. I'd rather have seen Danny 'Ralph Mouth' Most in this role. Macchio turned out to be the best movie in the series, and watch where his career is now! Instead, they put in a girl! They got Hillary Swank, best known for playing a variety of sheman parts in every movie she's in. I don't personally care for her teeth, but it's a personal preference. But watch Karate Kid 4 launch her career in the job! She won a freakin Oscar. Jiminey Christmas! Meanwhile where is Ralphy ?? He has to put out an amateur band like Screech or something. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my only difference with the movie is that they have a girl doing karate. As a self-proclaimed master of Karate, I was the proud owner of a white band for the last 8 5/8 years. The first thing they taught me was that there was no room in any of the girls' martial arts ... except Judo ... but that's gay. So, for the sake of accuracy, I think they should have sat with another man for this role. I might have thought of Dennis Franz. He will give the role he needs. <br /> <br /> Maybe they'll listen to my suggestions and make the right adjustments in Karate Kid 5. It's no longer Pat Marita either. I thought maybe Justin Guarini was the perfect replacement for the lovely Asian fellow Miyagi. He will give "Wax on wax off" a whole new meaning. HAHAHAHAHAHA, funny, huh? Anyway, if you're looking for an exciting movie full of karate and human spirit, Karate Kid 4 is for you. Don't waste your time with 1-3. This is the Karate Kid for you! This is the Karate Kid for the ages!
