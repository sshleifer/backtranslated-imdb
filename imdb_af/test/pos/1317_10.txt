Mishima - A life in four chapters is, in my opinion, the best Paul Schrader movie to this day. Mesmerizing cinematography, accompanied by Philip Glass's mystical musical score, added a completely magical aura to the story of one of the Japanese greatest novelists, whose originality and picturesque story is beautifully portrayed in this picture. As a gifted character, Mishima was upset about serious self-conflicts. The chief of them is the conflict between the "pen and a sword" as the director puts it in his last chapter, or the struggle between the sensitive poet with homosexual feelings in a notorious male society with centuries of war traditions, and thus broaden the gap between the sensitive and militant traditional side of Mishima itself. <br /> <br /> All Schrader's films (and the one for which he wrote writings) are basically stories of the inner conflict within a man who does not belong in an environment in which he lives. This also applies to Mishima, who, apart from the Japanese military school education, grows up with love for theater and words. His demise consisted of both of these key points in his life, it was about words and theater ending in a life-long play. Movie like this comes together once in a long time, and most will have to wait a lifetime to reach this beauty. 20 out of 10 !!
