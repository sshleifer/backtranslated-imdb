It is definitely one of the ultimate cult classers, and is a must for all psychotronic supporters. Why? It has everything that a good 70's exploitation movie should have. Over-the-top dialogue, bad acting, enthusiasm, sex, sleaze, political inaccuracy, violence and many other elements of a good cult class are included. In other words, Dolemite is a must-see. <br /> <br /> As with many of these films, the plot makes little or no sense. What I understood from it is that the pimphous Dolemite was snapped up for stealing furs and stolen drugs. While he was busy, his patron Willie Green (the same man who took him) took over his nightclub. The sympathetic assassin (the only white character in the entire movie who is not completely angry or unfit) decides to free himself to stop the evil Willie Green and his drug trade. Fortunately, he knows kung fu, and so it goes with 50 to 75% of the characters in this movie. And even happily, while he was locked up, the Mrs. Queen Bee sent his "cough" to kung fu school. With this army of Kung Fu planning "his cough" (his words, not mine) on his side, he plans to take Willie Green's nightclub back. But two racist white police are trying to rebuild him and throw him back in jail. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, don't try to follow the plot. I saw this movie about five times and there are many elements that seem to have no connection with anything else. Supporting characters wander in and out of the movie. I'm still figuring out what was with Mayor Reverend Gibbs and the Hamburger Pimp. Who finally gives up? The screens with these characters are all invaluable. As far as the dialogue is concerned, it is terrible with even worse delivery. Since Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian, I wonder if this film is meant to be a spoof or a serious action movie. He didn't seem to decide which one. Lines like "Yes, I'm so bad, I kick my own ass twice a day" call for further investigation. Anyway, the movie is hilarious, and the plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese factory. Another hilarious feature is the most unrealistic use of sex and nudity ever in film. Actors you never want to see become naked (including the Mayor and Queen Bee). Not to mention the fact that the tree microphone appears in every other scene. <br /> <br /> Most of all, Moore shows incredible enthusiasm. He seems to be generally good time and is definitely charismatic. His comedy raps were a big influence on the latter-day gangsta rap, including Dr Dre who sampled him on his groundbreaking 1992 album "The Chronic". As technically inactive as the film, it is culturally influential. More importantly, it's a good time. The biggest crime that a mining film can commit is boring, and it is quick and entertaining for all its mistakes. In other words, if you dig this kind of movie, you'll love "Dolemite". If you don't dig it, you're a non-business, born-insecure, jock-jawed motha-f *** a! "(7/10)
