This game has cartoon graphics, not much violence and very short levels - then why do people say it's so brilliant?!? Because it always keeps your attention, it captivates you and refuses to let it go! You will try to find that damn flight recorder, try to figure out how to get into the room without warning the guards, etc.! The levels are only short when you know what to do - until then you will spend hours trying to find where similarities are found, where helicopters and so forth are! And you'll have fun while doing it! Well worth a rent!
