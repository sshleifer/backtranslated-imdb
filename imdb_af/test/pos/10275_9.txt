Gilles Mamouni plays with the audience with the story of Max (Vincent Cassel), seeking his greatest lost love (Monica Bellucci), just to get engaged to another woman. Mamouni uses many flashback sequences without warning, so the best way to know where we are in the story is to look at the actor's hairstyle. Oherwise can be very confusing. Another strong movie debut for Mamouni, beautifully photographed by Thierry Arbogast (the 5th element, the messenger), and Monica Bellucci is a treasure to watch ... I feel a little disappointed near the end so I have given it 9 out of 10.
