I know this movie had a pretty rough ride with the critics, but I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. The right star here is the fantastic Dylan Moran. He fails to be both hilarious and convincing in all his diverse disguise. He also manages a lovely charm that elicits his outrageous pratfalls. Special mention should also go to Michael Gambon, who plays with a brilliant, accurate and yet comical Dublin accent. The only weak link is Caine who, while obviously a good laugh to hammer, plays the least interesting and most uncontrolled character. It's probably not going to play so well overseas, but it's also worth a watch to be worth it.
