I think this film has become an important record of the most horrible aspect of the East German regime - the imprisonment of its people through which the regime called its anti-fascist protection wall. It is a document of despair and courage not to be missed. However, I would like to comment on the actual location of this escape. It did not happen in or around Berlin as some respondents supposed and was nothing directly with the Berlin Wall. The escape balloon has flown over the Iron Curtain which has not only divided Germany, but then divided it all over Europe. The balloon fell from PÃ¶ssneck, 170 miles southwest of Berlin in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), and flew 14 miles to Naila in Bavaria and freedom in West Germany. The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall later that year. While the balloon flight created a brand new ghost theater, it should remain a monument to those who have lost their lives while trying to escape from East Berlin, other parts of the GDR or other Soviet-controlled states.
