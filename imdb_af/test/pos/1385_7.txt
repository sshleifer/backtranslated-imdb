"The Planet" is an amazing piece of film. For just Â£ 8,000, Stirton Production is one of the most original sci-fi movies for a long time. <br /> <br /> With the physical intimidating Mike Mitchell, the movie is a mix of great special effects, strong storytelling and well-planned action. From the opening battle to the fright, everything about this movie is far above budget. <br /> <br /> Starting with the special effects, and certainly not the "Revenge Of The Sith" standard, they are level, if not above, like Babel 5 and Farscape. And for a cut of a price too. The detail and movement are excellent and captures the imagination. The design of everything, ships, weapons, entities is unmatched. The imagination and creativity involved is a real surprise to a film of this budget. <br /> <br /> Another surprise was the strength of the story and the bow that needed it. There are a few twists and turns, most of them well written in writing, surprisingly and well played. I was surprised that two years in the making and the first time proposed 15 years ago, how relevant some aspects of the story are to contemporary society. With the events around the world there may be some resonance with the lengths after which the mercenaries must be forced to survive. <br /> <br /> Even the sound effects are about, just like atmospheric music. The use of light and costume adds to the professional look. Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen looks like a deserted and lonely place. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, this movie seems to be 10, if not 100, spending the budget, and this is proof for a creative, hard-working team of directors, the cast, the effects by the producer and sound team. Great effort, I recommend you get your hand on a copy as soon as possible
