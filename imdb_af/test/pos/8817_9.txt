This blaxploitation classic about a kung fu mum traveling to Hong Kong to avenge her brother's death offers everything you learned to expect from the genre. Playmate Jeannie Bell (with a huge afro) really kicks ass and loses her clothes very quickly. If you don't take it too seriously, the movie is fun to watch. Stan Shaw gives a solid performance, Jeannie Bell is a little less convincing. Pam Grier she is not. <br /> <br /> That's where Quentin Tarantino got his idea for the light link scene in Jackie Brown. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack by Don Julian is a jewel and is frequently used in rap songs.
