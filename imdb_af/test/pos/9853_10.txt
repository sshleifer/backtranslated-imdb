In Sudan, the Arabs are always in control of the Christians and Animists living in the southern part of this East African country. This film follows a group of Dinka boys, a tribe of cattle herds, left after their village was destroyed and their families murdered in a cruel attack by Arab forces. Most of these boys are now teenagers and are called "The Lost Boys". <br /> <br /> The filmmaker follows a group of "Lost Boys" on their journey, as they were accepted as refugees in the US. , where they will land in Houston. Those who have been accepted as refugees are known, as they feel (from what they heard) that America is great. Making a trip from Sudan to America is like making a trip to heaven, says one young man. A great feast is being thrown for their departure, and they are told to do Sudan well and as soon as they are educated they must return to Sudan so that they can contribute to the Dinka society. They are also warned not to be like "those with pants", who are responsible for the negative stereotype of black men, and also, whatever happens, not to forget the Dinka culture. <br /> <br /> You watch the boys from a third world land coming to America and how they are trying to integrate into American society, as they are from a place, with virtually nothing to this abundant world everything is massively overproduced and over-consumed. They are taught about the cleanliness and how to use all the utilities we take for granted daily. It is sometimes humorous, humiliating in others. <br /> <br /> Listening to the comments they make about black Americans and American society / culture is very interesting. As the film progresses, you see how American culture began to corrupt their previously humble thinking. <br /> <br /> One of the boys, Peter, is not happy with the job and just enough to survive. move from Houston to Kansas City so he can follow a training. When the other boys visit him, they talk about how they can't get to any school. The main reason they came to America was to get an education and the media said the boys from Sudan were brought up for education. This happens because the boys have received arbitrary ages, which make them older than they actually are, and prevent them from enrolling in high school. <br /> <br /> The film depicts images from Houston to Kansas. We watch Peter school in the school, where he is a friend of a group of Christian conservative children, and as Santiago tries to manage business school (though he is driving without a license anyway), and works at Walmart. We see Peter struggling with high school life as he strives to make his school's basketball team. And as Santiago struggles to keep up with work, rent, tension teams coming to Sudan, and especially with loneliness. <Br /> <br /> It comes to the point where the boys want to return to Sudan and tell them that everything they have learned about America is a lie. "You have to do it alone here, do it all alone," says one of the boys. A suspicious message to a liberal capitalist lifestyle, which shows how it causes people to become radical individualists (a trend that led to the creation of both neo-conservative and radical Islamic movements). However, their biggest beef with America is that there is no time; time is money and we don't waste a moment! <br /> <br /> Despite this, the boys never lose their sense of Dinka culture. They celebrate the Day of Liberation of South Sudan, indicating the day the SPLA began fighting in Sudan, a struggle that continues today. They also meet with other "Lost Boys" on the commemoration of their arrival in America, where they discuss their experience in America compared to returning to Sudan. When asked, one boy says that if he was able to live, he chose to live a lot in Sudan. It's far too lonely in America, he adds. They never lose their community awareness, which they conditioned as part of their culture. <br /> <br /> This film asks us how we live, let's question artificial happiness that materialism and the nature of our societies have created within us. It will also change how I look to refugees, I will never take for granted how hard they should work and what immigrants mean to a country like my own, Canada. It's a great movie. I laughed, I cried .. a very emotional journey, and a very well-made documentary. 10 out of 10.
