An ever-cynical, sarcastic and intense movie that mocks and mimics the style of pulp fiction and stylized gangster movies is an entertaining, exuberant and hilarious excitement on Thursday. An amazing eclectic mix of over-the-top characters and bizarre entertaining situations, this day-in-the-life of an armed man trying to go straight is a worthy addition to the series of films that attempt genius of Tarantino's to mimic black-haired masterpiece pulp fiction. <br /> <br /> Nick (Aaron Eckhardt) stops at Casey's (Thomas Jane) home to catch up with times. Casey was a former armed man for drug dealers who has since been reformed, become an architect, married to a successful businesswoman (Paula Marshall), and now intends to adopt a child. Nick, who still has ties to the gangster underworld, leaves a briefcase full of drugs at Casey's home while borrowing his car to run a few men? unfinished business. Disgusted and angry by bringing drugs into his home, Casey rinsed them all in the kitchen sink. That's when Nick's double-crossed accomplices, Rastafarian drug messengers and rogue police officers are all knocking for unsuspecting Casey who is going to have an incredible Thursday. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a hilarious drive in a petrol station where Nick finds the best deal for a cup of coffee. After considering getting the size cup, a fiasco breaks with the cashier when claiming a free snackie cake and using a $ 50 account to pay. Due to a comical brilliant bloodshed, the situation from bad to worse will intervene as a police and be caught in the most unusual circumstances. This opening segment establishes the perfect mood for the rest of the film, which never takes too seriously and includes outrageous characters who are self-aware of their own existence in this unbeatable gangster movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is broken into segments based on several events and times over the course of one day. This effect is very much like Pulp Fiction, which is also the same chapters, although Thursday is not wasted chronologically, except for the occasional flashback. Also, like Tarantino, music music presents everybody's scene and every character wonderfully. Strange humorous creatures, such as the Jamaican slave man, the pizza deliveryman who lands over the phone and shares his hash, and Paulina Porizkova's narcissistic Dallas, who tries to rape Casey, add humor to every event, no matter how frightening and rude some The coincidences are. Introducing Mickey Rourke's tranquil curly head Kasarov, the cautious staging and complex setup are fully compiled, and Casey's tough situation becomes even more daring and laudable. <br /> <br /> Definitely a Wannabe Pulp Fiction, with plenty of violence, witty dialogue and extremely unpleasant antagonists. On Thursday, some things are doing right, but other tribute attempts may just be far enough to suggest rip-off. A retrospective showcase that Casey shoots shooting and plays a hairstyle that exactly matches John Travolta's pulp fiction, is easily one step too far. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie, www.MoviePulse.net
