One of my favorite movies. Great role, led by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Serious drama situations with brilliant comic punches. An exact mix of character and story. True people with real problems, and everyone has a different relationship with each family member. Feelings move from slightly sad to hilariously funny. Read the quotes. This is the best fit for a Neil Simon game. <br /> <br /> If you want to see more of Eugene, Biloxi Blues (with Matthew Broderick, who has played versions in both stages) is right, a little darker. Get away from the Broadway Bound-made TV.
