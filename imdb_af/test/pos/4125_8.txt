I saw it (video 2000) years ago and would like to watch it on DVD. A good movie, but I would have loved it even more if it included the legacy of The Beatles and The Hollies. <br /> <br /> I also don't know exactly where the story is - made to dramatize the story? <br /> <br /> I was just 3 when Buddy crashed and didn't wake up until the late 70's. Much later I found out that our family moved into our new home - yes, February 3, 1959. <br /> <br /> Well, little things you say and do ... His songs will always be remembered - always ...
