I thought it would be a lousy movie. Honestly, I mean, Rupert Grint, RON, who plays in a movie other than Harry Potter, was really hard to see. But as the movie started, it showed that this man has talent, I mean, is the best actor of the HP trio. As a reference, have you seen Emma try Watson? Or what about Daniel's acting? Both have a lack of experience, although they performed in a million Harry Potter movies. Ben, his character is a very shy boy, unable to show his true feelings about everything, his contempt for his predominant mother and the rage of his father who is incapable of standing up and she confront an unfaithful woman. Julie Walters was absolutely brilliant! Her interpretation of an old retired actress trying to live with the shadow of her past while trying to remember Shakespeare suns is absolutely wonderful! It also appears that many youths are being wasted in religious nonsense.
