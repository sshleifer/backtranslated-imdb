Paul Bettany played a major role as the tortured father whose favorite little girl died tragically from illness. For that he earns all the credit. However, the film was mostly about exactly what Darwin's adventures held, as he collected data for his theories as telling incomplete stories to children and completely outdone the disputes over his ideas. <br /> <br /> Two things have bothered me terribly: the soundtrack, with its glittering sound, the sadness of the viewer, and the movie car, displaying beautiful scenery, the theological muscles of him and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends while preparing for a fight against blind faith so that the film is completely misrepresented. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, if the scenes of the movie cart were removed from the movie, the result would be a non-descriptive family drama about a little child dying and the suffering of her parents than as a result. Obviously, not what I expected from Darwin, although the movie was beautifully interpreted.
