I watched this movie, never read the book, and took the characters at nominal value, but I have already seen it in the past. I have a very different viewpoint from the movie. <br /> <br /> Without the burden that I constantly have to focus on every character, I paid attention to the cultural issues outlined in the film. . The farm families of Iowa are as intimate as they are around Indiana, where I grew up in the 40's and 50's, instantly recognizing the back stories and motives behind the characters. Perhaps Jane Smiley has meant for us to see outside the superficial world that these people had to live on, but viewers are so caught up in the Hollywood aura of individual actors that they miss a rich explanation of a lesser lifestyle, pass less than every decade. Another movie with these features is the "Bridges of Madison County". Try both to watch these movies again for the whole picture.
