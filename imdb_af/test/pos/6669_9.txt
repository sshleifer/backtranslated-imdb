Ultimately, a movie that handles the probability of alien visits with the appropriate depth and loving warmth. just if we are not alone, I believe these visitors are just too tourists to care for us or to give that vibrant group of anthropocentric goofs a stable proof of their existence. we will not interfere in the battle rituals of a troubled desert tribe unless we are spoiled with our travel insurance, how? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie shows the transition cathexis of a tired mind and body through a superior entity. It happens quite unpredictably and rather unrecognizable, but we're going to be a movie, right? so prot's hospitalization is just a trigger for the plot. <br /> <br /> Jeff's bridges work well as usual but spacious are hilarious. The role seems straight to him, convincing and lovingly "crazy". Eat unleavened bananas, sit in a tree and give his doctor a hard time with quick, wisdom and (mostly!) Beautiful quotes. they thought to me and I thought for hours. <br /> <br /> It's an encouraging movie, the least, and the soundtrack at Edward Shearmur is simply beautiful. just go and get a copy. catch a ray of light. now.
