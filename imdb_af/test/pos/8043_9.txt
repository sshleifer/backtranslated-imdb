Smooth, neat and well-made old school version of how great international stuff should be made. Determine a dreaded global terrorist, known as "Carlos the Jackal", Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, "Without Borders", "Space Cowboys"), a CIA operator and his Israeli counterpart, Amos (Ben Kingsley, "Gandhi", "Sexy Beast") gets a noble naval officer, Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn, "Music of the Heart") to become Carlos and use him in a daring plot to get the KGB to the kill real Carlos because he has an offer from the CIA. Sutherland and Kingsley are both good here, but the movie really belongs to Quinn, who embodies him here (in a dual role). Director Christian Duguay and film photographer David Franco are yet another great asset of the movie here with Hitchcockian tension and great world events.
