"Rockster" is not on the way to any "stairs to heaven" category as one of the best rock movies of all time, but it makes you 'jump' from time to time because of its high-level energy. The film's theme is on a hard rock band fanatic who is actually the lead singer of his favorite band. The story is based on the true story of what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest. If you think this movie is filled with a witty script and mind direction then you have another thing to come. But what shook me all night was Jennifer Aniston's fine as the rock star's dedicated friend. I couldn't say the same about the rock star itself; Mark Wahlberg was much better than a porn star as a rock star. I enjoyed the 80's retrospective journey of movie recording. It reminded me of my teens where everything smelled like a spirit. I think the movie is worth watching, but if you have a better time watching it, make sure you bring a few girls, girls, girls.
