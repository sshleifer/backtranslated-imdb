I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (so far known in the USA as the Golden Door) and was very impressed by both of them dreamy and sometimes surreal stories of a family dating from the office early to the USA immigrates. of the 20th century. It also worked as a (proverbial) middle finger trapped in the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably all the way to the 3rd knuckle), portraying the bad treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they of their original motherland. The (mostly) Italian cast, with a few exceptions, works well. It's a quiet, understated movie to watch (the occasional but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure), while the script is well written. It is a movie for those who are sick and tired of the incessant escape from Hollywood that serves little more than selling popcorn (not that I have a burning problem with popcorn, you think! --- I really love for the things). You will be wise to find Nuovomondo / The Golden Door (or whatever is called in your area).
