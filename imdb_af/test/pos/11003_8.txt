An appropriate description by Spock of an all-powerful fop in whose clutches the crew of the Enterprise falls. It was one sector of space that our star ship had to avoid. First, Sulu & Kirk just disappeared from the bridge; A landing party follows them on the surface of an unfamiliar planet and meets Trelane, an apparently aristocratic man dressed in Earth from centuries ago. But he does demonstrate capabilities of somebody or something far above man and does not register on McCoy's medical tricorder. The officers succeed in escaping to the ship, but Trelane, like a bad cosmic penny, holds up. He brings everyone back, including a female comrade, to continue his games. The dilemma now takes out the elements of 'The Dangerous Game' in space and there is a surprising, even disturbing aspect of the crew's total helplessness before such unbridled power. <br /> <br /> What really makes it a good episode is the unforgettable show by host Campbell as the overwhelming but not all-knowing alien. Of course, his character is an early version of Q, launched 20 years later in the pilot for the TNG series. Trelane's confrontation scene with Spock comes out under all the unfamiliar drama unfolding. As usual, Kirk is starting to look at possible weaknesses in his new nemesis, though he is quite excellent. The answers to exactly what or who Trelane is, are always right in front of us. When we learn the truth, it is completely meaningful in the light of Campbell's sequential acting. He remembers himself constantly, prancing in front of an unknown audience, and noticing things with an inflamed flair, but not quite right. We can't even get rid of it, but there's something missing here. Every few minutes she is showing sinister and the crew is now in serious danger. In a way, you can't keep your eyes away from him, and always wait to see what he's doing next. Actor John de Lancie caught the same kind of scene as Q on the Next Generation series.
