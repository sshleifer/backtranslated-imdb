I think Andrew Davies did a wonderful job of taking a wonderful book that followed the pace and styling of a Victorian novel, changing it into a moving and entertaining movie. I'm glad I read (twice) the first book that is usually the case for me. I know that one should see a novel and a film as different media and judge them accordingly. However, it is often difficult to read the original material after giving a movie the best parts. <br /> <br /> I realize Davies is a very good adapter, but I wish the producers chose a woman to write the script. Davies, as he acknowledged in the commentary accompanying the film on DVD, wanted to emphasize the more scatological pieces in the book. I definitely enjoyed it, on film as in the book. But Davies missed a half-dozen moments that were so unbearable, painfully soft, that he could incorporate if his sensitivity was more feminine. <br /> <br /> I would also compromise the problem with its use of the book's primary symbol, the rose. <br /> <br /> While the script by Davies was planned, the unbundling was inevitable and appropriate. But I really think writer Waters's final nod to the rose symbol was much more interesting. And I did let the way the novel chose, "get older" than Davies's choice. <br /> <br /> A quick comment on the four actors who set the primary roles. They are all wonderfully talented - well, except for the singing and dancing, perhaps - and besides, their physical appearance is so much what the spirit's eye sees when they read the novel before they see the movie. I thought they were all great. <br /> <br /> I recommend that any lesbian and anyone who loves good fiction add both the VELVET book and the DVD to their bookshelves.
