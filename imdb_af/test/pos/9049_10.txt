If a joke doesn't offend anyone, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> The Inki cartoons are offensive, no doubt about it. So is rap music. Come on over. I suspect that a healthy black person will find the Incarnate cartoons hilarious, and that people who are offended by them, need white people who still think blacks, need their protective protection against racist humor. <br /> <br /> The Inki cartoons are funny. It's my sadness, not because someone is really offended, but because someone might be offended, I can't buy Inki cartoons or The African Queen or Song of the South on DVD.
