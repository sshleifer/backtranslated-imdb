This movie has everything I need in a movie: - Women, skateboarding, violence, music by H.I.M and Tony Hawk !!! the artwork and camera effects in this movie are wonderful. The music in this movie is the best I have heard in any other movie. Every track goes so well with its scene. I thought the acting was really good as no one from Bamese crew had been in scripts before. Although the whole concept of the film is the story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend (Glauren) who sleep with Hellboy behind his back, is a predictable and centuries-old story. The way they acted is very unpredictable, for example: Falcone and the guest boy, Raab Himself, Dunn break bottles behind the wawa and all the Don Vito scenes. These movies are a must see!
