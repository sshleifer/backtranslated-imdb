In Koue Berg, North Colorado, near the American Civil War, Rev. Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives in the village with his daughter, shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), due to health reasons. Ada also meets the shame Inman (Jude Law), and they fall in love with each other. At the start of the war, Inman becomes a soldier, and his great support to stay alive is the desire to see Ada again in Cold Mountain. Meanwhile, Ada meets Ruby Thewes (Ren√©e Zellweger), a survivor of the war, helping her on the farm and becoming her best friend. The story ranges from current and transient situations, which reveal beautiful romance. I love this movie a lot. With the names of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi in the supporting role, a wonderful direction of Anthony Minghella and seven indications for the Oscar, this film does not disappoint. My comment is that some very important scenes have been deleted in the story and presented in the DVD. At least one of them, who shows what happens to Sara, her baby and the three dead in her farm, should not be removed as it was. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cold Mountain"
