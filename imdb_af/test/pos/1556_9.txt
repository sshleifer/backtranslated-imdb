I gave these 9 stars out of a possible 10. If it had just a downside because of a bit more plot line, I'd have given it. <br /> <br /> However, this is a very interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Judith Ivey, who plays a nice floozy, had to give the Oscar for her performance. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace (who depicts Alice), whom I have never seen, is also doing an excellent job and has the sexiest body I think I've ever seen on film. <br /> <br /> In a knock to make an old car, Alice stretched out of the ne. for Florida where she has a friend (or maybe it's her sister, I'm not sure, and that's my fault, not the movie), and high expectations of going to college, what she and her family really don't can afford. <br /> <br /> </ p> </ p> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> <p> > She was silent at that time and was assisted by a woman named Sandra and her husband, Bill, an older couple driving in a RV. <br /> <br /> They go south, to Florida, and take her under their wings, but are they all the way they offer themselves? Flashbacks and paranoia enter the story as our young heroine learns new life lessons.
