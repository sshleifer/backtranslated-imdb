one of the best and most inspiring movies about another culture I've seen for years. tragic and touching. worth the watch. maybe several times. We all know how cruel children can be. I know from my own and my brothers experienced as children and this movie hit the nail on the head. perfect! The kite is amazing and I have to research the validity of that event. Even if it's done in CGI it's still amazing and very interesting. Managing such a kite seems impossible, but it makes it credible. Anyway, this movie has many twists and turns that I'm sure for many, probably easy to find, but they hit me before I could. that makes me a good movie! Finding the whole movie in the first 10 minutes ruins it. but this one does so smoothly that it's hard to guess even when it happens ... I'm a guy and I don't care to say that tears are flowing at more than one point in this movie.
