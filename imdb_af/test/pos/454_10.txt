a big movie, with a rather unclear political message. It was shot in a theatrical style, i.c. Most of the action takes place. mayor surv and diana ashcroft look equally suspicious of each other. Emotions are high as Western tourists and businessmen seem reluctant and are unable to deliver the mayor's eastern Russian charm, although he does everything to understand their point of view. The two opposite world views are made clear, but the film also shows that human emotions cannot be controlled by politics. It has been vigorously performed and has a high emotional impact for a 50-year-old movie.
