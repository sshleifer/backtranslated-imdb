Focus is another big movie with William H. Macy. I first discovered Macy in Fargo and I saw some of his films and he hadn't deceived me yet. Macy is the archetype "nice guy with something to hide". In Focus, he plays Lawrence Newman's role, a loyal and hard-working stiff, who wears his disabled mother on board at home. The scene was set after World War II, at the height of McCarthyism. Newman is the head of Human Resources for a company that is actually anti-Semite. After having accidentally hired a woman of Jewish descent, he was asked to buy glasses to improve his lack of vision. <br /> <br /> Incredibly, the simple act of buying glasses has huge consequences for his life and that of Gertrude Hart, his wife (played by a great Laura Dern). As the movie unraveled, Newman will begin to see a whole other world, where Jewish, likes to be an animal. <br /> <br /> The movie is disturbing in the way it seems to be racist, something quite normal. The chilling idea is that it is probably still in some places.
