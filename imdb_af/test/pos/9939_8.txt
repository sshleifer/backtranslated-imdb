I finally managed to get myself a copy of Dario Argento's Opera, and I tell you ... it's time! It was the last Argento movie I still had to see and I'm a fan of most of his work. I think most of his work is extremely important to the horror genre, but some of his movies tend to disappoint (like Phenomena). But Opera's plot idea always addressed me and it turned out I was right !! I enjoyed every shot in Opera and I was fascinated by this movie for the first minute to the last. From all the Argento movies, Opera went straight to the number one spot and I hope I can encourage as many people as possible to see this one as well. <br /> <br /> Opera's script and plot idea is rather simple. Especially when compared to Argento's previous movie phenomena that had too many ideas in it and was eventually a mess. The plot of Opera is creepy and chilling, but at the same time it is an excellent satirical remark - almost a spoof - to the opponents of explicit violence. *** SPOILERS *** A young opera singer (the beautiful Cristina Marsillach) is hit by a terrible sadistic killer. During every murder he commits Betty to his actions with her eyes wide open. There are needles attached to her eyelids and when they close, they are torn apart. *** END SPOILERS ***. To this simple yet effective idea, Argento adds many horrible elements such as RaBe, the classic piece (and curse) of MacBeth and the entire atmospheric location of the opera building and music. Especially the presence of the creepy rawe is and extra value. Ancient masters like Edgar Allen Poe already knew these black birds had a lot of mystery around them, and Dario Argento knew it too. <br /> <br /> The violence and gore are very well presented in Opera and this makes it a true Argento picture. His best in my opinion with profondo Rosso as a close second. I hope to recommend this movie to many people among you. Especially for fans of the (Italian) horror business, it is an absolute must! Favorite "Rewind" scene: Argento shows his visual talent best in the scene where Betty's friend is being shot while trying to see who's at the door.
