For most of us, life is an unfolding process of love. However, for others like Soo-mi, it is dominated by darkness and fear. Based on Korean folk tale Jangha and Hongryun, Kim Ji-living's brilliant gothic horror story turns a story of two sisters around two sisters, Soo-mi (Lim Su-jeong) and Soo-yeon (Mun Geon-yeong) are part of a dysfunctional family living together in a creepy Victorian-style home. Feeling alienated from the world, they cling to each other for survival with the older Soo-mi, which obsessively protects the younger Soo-yeon from danger. For Soo-mi, however, which does not relate to the circumstances surrounding her mother's death, mental illness and a mind mean conflict with reality. <br /> <br /> Recognizing condoms like conditional observation cottages, opening and closing doors, a cruel and remaining stepmother and other high stranger events. Two Sisters' languages ​​investigate deeper psychological meanings, including the inability to abandon inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge. Soo-mi says, "Do you know what is very scary? You want to forget something. Make it completely out of your mind, but you can never do it. A ghost." There is a timeline, but it is left to the viewer to unravel. The plot cannot be summed up, but only suggested and the film keeps us on the question whether what is happening on the screen is objective or subjective. <br /> <br /> In the film's opening, Soo-mi, a naturally disturbed young woman, is questioned by a doctor in an environment that resembles a spiritual institution. When the doctor asks her to describe what happened on that day, the movie flashes back when Soo-mi and Soo-Yeon return to their father's Moo-hyeon (Kim Kap-su) and stepmother Eun-joo (Yum). Jung-ah). The stepmother is hostile and cruel and the father is passive and distant, but it is clear that it is soo-mi that really hurts. As the girls try to recreate, they are constantly scared by a presence in the home, which can be nightmares or supernatural incidents. <br /> <br /> Soo-mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed hanging over her and harvesting black blood, a dinner in which the gas apparently sees a ghost hide under the sink and goes into convulsions, a monster comes out between the legs of one of the sisters, people mysteriously disappear from pictures and many other manic schizophrenic devices to hang the viewer on the edge of madness. While we feel that much of the story is predicting someone's mind, we don't know whose movie we've been challenging constantly, at least until an important idea is presented in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> In a wonderfully low-light cinematography, a story of two sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that surpasses all the whims, and there are many. It's spooky in more than one sense of the word and its images can stare at you when you least expect or want. While the film may not be able to provide the weary traveler in the light of light, it shows us where we can end when we choose the darkness. In the words of a wise observer, "Blame is never the answer - whether it blames yourself or others. The answer lies rather in issuing judgment - yourself and others. Forgiveness and understanding have great power of healing."
