I have so much hope for the success of Gen-X. Fortunately, my expectations have come true. You have a whole lot of action, comedy ... stupid comedy and surprises. I think the newcomer Edison is really a hit in the movie, but I find Sam's 'Alien' annoying with English. Although the movie had errors with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue, the action always kept it strong. The action is much stronger than the 1st. <br /> <br /> This movie is more of an American feel, as 60% of the movie is in English from the Cantonese. This movie will not disappoint you. I have recommended it to young people who don't care about pure action-packed fun. <br /> <br />
