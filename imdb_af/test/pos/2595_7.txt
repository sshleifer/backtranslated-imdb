... And there were quite a few of these. <br /> <br /> I don't like this cartoon much like many others, partly because it's made in his era. I prefer many cartoons with Daffy and Bugs that are fifteen or so years ahead. Many people will like this, especially people who always find violence funny, cartoon or not. <br /> <br /> The basic plot is a fairly well-known one for Looney Tunes: Elmer goes out hunting, Daffy leads him to Bugs and Daffy ends up being shot instead. Also included are very clever and highly entertaining jokes (some do not enhance the episode), ugly shooting and animation that is slightly mediocre. The plot is mainly focused on jokes - every joke keeps the episode going. This way of plotting is not as uncommon in Looney Tunes (of course if you're actually a Looney Tunes steak - or an avid one like me, you already know). <br /> <br /> For those who love everything from Looney Tunes and Daffy Duck and like the sound of what I said about it, enjoy "Kanynprumerer"! <br /> <br /> 7 and a half out of ten.
