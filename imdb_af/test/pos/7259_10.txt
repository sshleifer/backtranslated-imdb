This movie has almost everything. The action is cool, it's funny, 2 big leading men and a real nasty villain I really hated. Not many movies have bad bad guys. Just mostly spectacular books. He really deserves a chance to kick. <br /> <br /> Jake Scott really has his fathers talent to know how to make good visuals. The direction is flawless and has an irresistible light-hearted feel. I don't usually like movies like in the old days, but it loved me very much because it is very boring, like so many other period films (Sense and Sensibility, Age of Innocence and the absolute worst ... Lady and Duke ). It will restore your faith. Thanx mostly to Craig Armstrong's incredible score. The music is atmospheric and ethereal and in action it is very exciting. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and has a very smooth and muddy 2.35: 1 anamorphic picture.
