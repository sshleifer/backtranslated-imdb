Looks like the bet film I've ever seen. Not too much for intelligent perception, but so rich in perception sensitive. Antonioni is comparable to his movie. Malkovich's so organic roles are so true, situations are so real. I changed my global prospects to this cinema. I am a beginner literati in Russia - country of Tolstoy and Dostoevskiy - and I am absolutely sure that Antonioni is good and quiet for resting, because I and we understand his point of view. so i dont understand his little raiting on IMDb. I'm sure, talking about Russia and our people, we love Antonioni because of his romantic soul and positive sensation of the surrounding reality
