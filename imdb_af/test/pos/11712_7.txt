Burt Reynolds directed this action movie and (surprise!) He is actually a pretty good director. This movie starts well, as Burt's attempt at bust of a drug dealer collided, and he is being broken down to the team. The ensemble cast has some pretty funny scenes, since Brian Kieth always eats something, Bernie Casey has more class than all his co-workers, and Charles Durning loses control over his team. <br /> <br /> The vice-police stumble upon an affordable ring-girl ring that might have something to do with a series of murders. Sharkey spends days breaking out Dominoe's (Rachel Ward) apartment, and really hears her from afar. <br /> <br /> Only when they get near the crime leader, Domino is murdered. I won't give away any of the surprises in the plot, but the first hour of this movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script is very clickable and incredible afterwards. <br /> <br /> Why would Burt Reynolds confront the crime boss with his great secret? Sure, it makes the man sweat, but it causes a lot more police to be killed. And it's not credible that Dominoe and Sharkey would make love after they know each other much less, while their lives are in danger. And in the end, what happened to all the police going to our heroes in the building? Isn't there a SWAT team? Also, the film never tells you how all the bad guys are connected, and why they have to kill so many people. <br /> <br /> There is a very effective torture scene on a boat near the end of the movie, which is probably the only true nail-biting scene of the movie. It is a pity that the climax is a typical shoot-em-up. Yet this film is definitely entertaining if you like crime and action movies. Don't think of the plot holes, and you'll have a good time.
