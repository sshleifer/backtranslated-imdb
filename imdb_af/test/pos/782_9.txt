I just heard from the ITV management lessons, and to be honest I didn't know how much I would like it. I turned on the TV last night and was completely surprised. Driving Lessons is a modest, simple movie that you record from the start. Rupert Grint plays the part of socially uncomfortable teen Ben brilliant. He is definitely one to look out for in the future. Lady Eve Walton is played by the wonderful Julie Walters. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. The highlight of the movie, to me was Evie's rather colorful poem. It shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely couples. In my opinion, watch rylesses is a great way to spend 2 hours. The landscape was also striking, especially the countryside. Anyone who can call this sparkling comedy does not completely forget me
