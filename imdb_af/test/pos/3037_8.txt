Our America is multi-cultural, with so many subcultures. This movie just tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these subcultures. It's basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people who live their lives unaware of the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It demonstrated entertainment, thoughts and lives that would otherwise not be seen in our own backyard. Must be seen by everyone. After living my whole life in the USA, I had no idea that there were civilians who didn't know they were citizens. This film helps to illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state. The obvious conclusion: If it really is, then there is something out there that we know nothing about?
