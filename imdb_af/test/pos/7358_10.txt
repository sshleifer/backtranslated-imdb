It may not have been the big budgets, celebrities or endorsements of Scream, Urban Legend or I know what you did last Saturday, but Campfire Tales has one thing that these three movies lack: real horror. <br /> <br /> This film has been the subject of urban legends for a year before the appropriate title and less than delightful Urban Legend did. It was intriguing, masterfully written and logical in a way I know. What you did last Saturday could only dream. Eventually it focused the focus and started with a flurry, while Scream was dying and dying. <br /> <br /> Most exciting about the movie is the variety of horrors the writers and directors have achieved. The overarching story of teenagers around a campfire was a classic fear of the unknown (but probably expected) punishment they had been waiting for in the bush, but the stories themselves were where the film really shines. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is pure, fast urban myth. It is based on a popular legend and the director plays with the style and pace of the action. This makes it more encouraging because we know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> The first campfire story is a straightforward thriller. Based on another popular myth, we do not realize it to the end, both because it mixes so well in the story and because the action keeps our attention. As a trill of the trilogy, this one of our fears is unfamiliar to the unknown and includes some well-done "jumps" that do not feel as cheap or scary as those in films such as Scream or Urban Legend. <br /> <br /> The second story is more tension. This time, although the characters still don't know what's going on, we do, and it offers the horror. The final story does not contain elements of the supernatural and uses a creepy / trippy atmosphere to scare the viewer. Because we are so easily connected to the characters and their situation, we get fear out of their intensity and what they can't explain. This is the true ghost story of the trio. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect to enjoy Campfire Tales when I rented it. I thought if I didn't have his more well-known, bigger-budget counterparts, how could I have it? <br /> <br /> The truth is, however, that this movie is succeeding where the other one is far from the point.
