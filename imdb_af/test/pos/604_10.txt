Jim Henson's The Muppet Movie is a beautiful, funny and brilliant movie that can be watched by adults and children. I feel it is my favorite childhood movie, because it combines good characters, a good story, and great white that it is irresistible. The plot involves Kermit the frog (puppeteered and pronounced by Henson) in his odyssey in America to follow his dream in Hollywood. Along the way he meets Fozzie Bear, The Great Gonzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf, and DR. Teeth and electric chaos. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many good things I can't even say. But this is memorable and every time I think of a puppet or mopet, I will think of this movie. Look for comos from Mel Brooks, Dom DeLouise, Paul Williams, Madeline Kahn, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthey), Elliot Gould, Carol Kane and the great Orson Welles. Excellent and spectacular, one of the 70's best films. A ++
