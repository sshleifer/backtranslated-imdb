Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of the Black Sabbath lost nothing. In this concert they play their best songs from their heights (1970-1978), including "NIB", "War Pigs" and "Paranoid". <br /> <br /> Also included are valuable background footage with interviews and retrospective in their days as the best hard rock group on the planet. Ozzy's comments, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to see as the fantastic action. <br /> <br /> A must see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans.
