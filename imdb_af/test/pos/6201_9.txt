I don't understand why this show isn't going on, there could have been several ways after several season to continue to season 2 on the line of Darwin and Farik. It was clear that Darwin could not be the UC agent's infiltrating cells and they were from within, but they still had to give this show at least another season. <br /> <br /> The performance is well-cast, credible and views Islamic religion from both the normal and the extremist point of view. It becomes in detail controversial subjects and it has a dramatic meaning that can be said from very few shows today. I'm actually sad that I didn't know about this show until late 2007.
