"Blade" would be a very average comic book, vampire hunting / horror if it wasn't for two minor mistakes. # 1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible Blades / Snipes, but its cutting and dicing, but the whole "Yes!" fist / punch was literally a countdown. # 2 Bad, no make it horrible, CGI ?? even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some have sprung all over. Well, despite those minor offenses, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburb work and the fact that it looks like another Matrix rip-off is hilarious, as it happened one year. So maybe 'The Matrix' copied 'Blade.' Anyway, it's a lot of movie for several genre-loving audiences: Comic Book geeks, action fanatics and horror / vampire lovers. So, we have Blade, half-man / half-vampire, or "day-walker" and his performance, Whisler (a low "Batman and Alfred") fight the undead who apparently make up almost people. What did you know? In a rare human being (Blade's more of an antihero), our sword ninja / vamp saves a new infected (accidental) blood specialist / doctor. Meanwhile, the trouble among the vampires breaks as one needs the highest power and Blade needs to get it. This is not the most original concept when you read what I just wrote, but still enjoy it. You will want Blade to succeed, you will root for him despite his imperfections and ways. And you will know what's coming because it's the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction. Still, watch it without trying too deeply. Like Vampire SPF-1000 "Suntan Lotion"? Really? What about the scalp? Won't it burn? Like the money they fire for weapons? Uh, okay, I'm going too deep. Again, sit back and enjoy the technologically loaded fun ride.
