I've seen this movie about 50 times and it doesn't seem like I'm ever going to get bored. I always watch it with my best friend and it has become a tradition for us to watch it almost every month. Every time we see this movie, we both actually get emotional and laugh at the TV and weep all the songs in a big voice and eventually we dance. Now we even know the whole dialogue by heart and watch the movie, feel like watching our own old friends on TV. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect! although I have to admit that the story itself is a bit cheesy, but the characters, the dance, the music and even the place where it all happens, let you forget about it and you start to believe that things like that really happen and that the song "Everything you need is love" actually has some meaning. <br /> <br /> I'm really a normal person and not too serious about this comment from me, but I can only wait until next time we'll see Dirty Dancing.
