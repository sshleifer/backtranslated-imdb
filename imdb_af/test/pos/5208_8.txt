The film is about the battle of Stalingrad. For those who know nothing about it, it was the worst battle in World War II. Over 1 million people died in the course of the battle. This is the only movie I have ever seen that has caught on the bad things in the war between Russia and Germany. What I really liked is that the two ideologies (Nazism and Communism) were nowhere in the film. Unlike most American films, the Germans are not seen as thirsty killers, but the average German foot soldier. A person. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were transferred there to try to take the city. The film follows these men from August 1942 until early 1943. During this time they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film one feels the desperation of the whole battle. In contrast to the "Enemy at the Gates", the filmmakers did not try to make a juicy love story or to contend with factual events. This film may be fiction, but it does indicate what happened in the bloodiest battle of World War II.
