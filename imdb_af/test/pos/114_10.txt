I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece. I would recommend buying this movie on DVD, as it is a movie you may want to see more often than just once. And trust me, you won't get much meaningful details after watching it several times. <br /> <br /> The characters - except for the grandmother - may all be very balanced, not black and white. Although you follow the story from the perspective of the two main players, there is also empathy for the other characters. <br /> <br /> I think the IMDb rating for the movie is too low - probably because of its politically controversial content.
