After reading all these reviews, I am very surprised to see that no one even noticed that this show was based on the 1957-1960 NBC show M Squad with Lee Marvin, I read reviews that compare to "Dragnet" and some of the Quinn Martin police show, but if you look at M team, you'll see it's based on that. In the late 1958 episodes of M-Squad you will see Lee Marvin, who plays Lieutenant-Detective Frank Ballinger, come out of his car and when he shot, and he shoots back, the start of the Police team is basically the same (including the Jazz music) and then Lee Marvin tells what happens. (Im Lieutenant-Detective Frank Ballinger, M team, a special department of the Chicago police) and in police group Leslie Neilsen do the same (Im Detective Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Group, Special Section of the Police Department), and so forth, in one of the M team deposits, there is even the Johnny's shoulder character and in an M section episode titled "More Deadly" there is a police group episode titled "A Substantial Gift (The Broken Promise) "that's the same story!
