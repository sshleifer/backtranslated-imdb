I have to say it. Gary Busey saved this movie. If it wasn't for his fine acting talent, that movie would be subpar. I recommend the movie, but only scarce. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie is its broad disregard for historical, geographical, and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How did Buddy's producer Petty ignore? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is Nashville being treated as a racist hatred to destroy the Holly sound? Why was Buddy's two-week court case dealt with as a complex, taboo, racial-blending stereotype? Why is Buddy's tile cupboards so light as feathers? Finally, why is the Cricket portrayed as a problem to make Holly's talent? <br /> <br /> On this face, these inaccurate things need a movie that makes itself known, "The Buddy Holly Story." However, Busey portrays a moving portrayal as the man whose death eventually led to the day the music died.
