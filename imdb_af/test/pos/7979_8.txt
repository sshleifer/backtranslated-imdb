For a long time this was my favorite of the Batman movies. It had the best cinematography and an edgy feel with two wild characters - Catwomen and The Penguin - along with the always interesting Christopher Walken. But after the last viewing it finally slipped into my ratings and honestly I prefer the last Batman: Batman Begins, with Christian Bale. <br /> <br /> THE GOOD - Yet it is still the most intriguing of the last five Batman movies. The stylish cinematography here is the best of any of the Batman movies. Director Tim Burton is well-known for his films that feature beautiful visuals, as a good example. The three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. Of the villains I chose Catwomen, and find her the most fun to watch before and after. Violence is not overdoing here as it was in several other Batman stories, but one is never bored to watch it. As he did in the first movie, Michael Keaton does a good job of playing Batman / Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br /> THE BAD - For a movie based on a cartoon that mostly reads children, I still think the first two Batman movies, both by Burton, were too dark and the curse was definitely not appropriate no. Although, unlike the first movie, no use of the Lord's name was in vain, there were still mockery and both villains made too many sexual remarks. It would have been good if they did not market this movie for both children and adults. Danny DeVito's "Penguin" is remarkably large in spots. "Grotesque" I can handle, but who wants "rough." Few guys meanwhile complained about the lovely Michelle Pfeiffer game Catwoman. Too much darkness and some cheap shots on Christian bashing have also made me reconsider my formerly high rating of this movie. <br /> <br /> GENERAL - Great visual and unforgettable characters make it the most interesting in the Batman series, but too dark an edge, too rough and too much anti-religious bias eventually turned me off after half a dozen after this movie watching. Sorry, but I prefer a kid maker Batman movie. After all, it's just a cartoon. Most will disagree, but I was happy to relieve the series after this one.
