It's one of the darkest, worst of Bergman's movies I've seen. I also think this is one of the most powerful films about the ugly war and what it does to human souls. <br /> <br /> The few musicians, who left a big city for a remote island and live as farmers, find themselves capable of unspeakable and shameful acts that would normally be impossible for them, even imagine as they struggle to survive the terrible reality of the war. They betray their souls, their friends and even each other in a desperate attempt to survive just another day. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow are brilliant as usual as lost, confused and terrible couple caught in the middle of a civil war. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
