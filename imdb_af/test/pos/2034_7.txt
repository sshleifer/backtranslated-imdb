I looked forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago and I was not disappointed. I won't sum up the story because everyone has it, but I'll say it was just entertainment. The performances were great, just like the music, and the main characters were nice. <br /> <br /> My only complaints are: (1) the story is definitely missing; The film suddenly wrapped up. In the second half, the writer became rather lazy in the second half, as if the authors were not sure what to do with the plot. Since the plot wasn't as important as the music and the action, it didn't really affect the entertainment value of the movie, so it's not as big as a complaint. <br /> <br /> (2) It's really nitpicky, but the music that the characters listened to in the movie was sometimes dated to 1985, when the movie was fixed. INXS 'Devil Inside was from 1987 and AC / DC's Are You Ready was from 1990, including errors. It bothered me a bit, as they went on for a long time, of course, they could have checked the copyright date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier. Again, not a big problem. <br /> <br /> Oh, I thought of something else that was strange. The Steel Dragon band members were English, but for some reason, Dokks bass guitarist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy guitarist Zakk Wylde played band members, and each had a few US accents. It was also so lazy, but it was still cool to see real musicians playing musicians, so I'll forgive them too. <br /> <br /> I can make sure all day long, but I don't want to give the impression that it wasn't a super entertaining movie. I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out, and I'll definitely buy the soundtrack CD for the six Steel Dragon songs (some of which were sung by the singer of the Steelheart band, if you remember them!). The highlight of the film may have been a wonderful edition where Mark Wahlberg lips a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays 'Good Vibrations' by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. The surprising appearance of Mark's face is priceless. Classic rock and roll flick! Score: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment
