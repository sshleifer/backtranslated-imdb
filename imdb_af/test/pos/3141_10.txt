One of the most poetic stories ever made, WAGONMASTER is a tough movie to keep right away. I love this movie, but I recommend seeing some of John Ford's other westerns before watching this one. The first time I saw it, I was 18 years old and I didn't see too many other westerners, and I hated it. I thought it was incredibly boring. I kept waiting for something to happen. It took me years to love this picture. First, I fell in love with Western in general - the traditions, characters, landscapes, ways to talk, etc. - and it made me realize when I saw WAGONMASTER again, that much is happening. <br /> <br /> I was also a more experienced film protector and learned to appreciate visual storytelling, and to listen to what each image told me. WAGONMASTER is a very visual film by one of the most visuals of directors working near the peak of his career. <br /> <br /> The movie is a celebration of a way of life and the subject is more emotional and inward than other Ford Westerns. Actually, it's not as accurate as saying it's rather a much less out-of-action than the other Western. (The other Western has out-of-action and indoor emotion.) It puts its pioneers beautifully in the context of nature. There are many shots of animals and children - not for any surface, narrative purpose, but to illustrate this idea. Therefore, the movie can be called a poem. It's not about the surface story (which almost doesn't exist) almost as much as it is about an emotional idea, and it gets the idea through composition, editing, sound and music. In fact, one can argue that it is a pure form of filmmaking because the images express the emotional idea of ​​the film directly, rather than first serving a story. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance and make it its own terms, not the terms of other Western or other movies.
