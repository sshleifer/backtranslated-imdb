Milos Forman's original HAIR was the perfect movie that actually revealed how life changed in those years, not just in the US, but especially in this country. One of the graves in the film was to be used in other films to come to Hair, for example in American Graffitti. It was an original story with a touch of generational sadness in it. The characters in the movie were like lonely "cells" in a "body" that changed over time. Overall, a very good movie, maybe a little underestimated. Annie Golden's role was small but she performed very well. It was the movie John Savage's practical actor started. One of the Chicago members played his part well, even though it was a minor role.
