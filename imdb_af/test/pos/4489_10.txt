This is one of the classic TWILIGHT ZONE episodes, where the viewer was hit with the simplest situations in a seemingly symbolic conflict, only to find the solution surprisingly and strangely acceptable. Five figures are in a container / prison: a master, a ballerina, a handkerchief, a clown and a stamp. They are definitely a strange choice of types to be in this isolation room, but they are all in them (and yet) and try to find out why they are there. What do they mean? Nobody can figure it out. But gradually the Major organizes them into work to stand out by standing on each other's shoulders. And the Major, to the top of the numbers, reaches the entrance, and .... I'll leave it that way, though one of the other critics on this thread actually gives away the story. <br /> <br /> The title is represented by six characters in search of an author, Pirandello's well-known play. Whether the real purpose of the show was to spoof the game is questionable: Pirandello's characters analyze their roles and relationships with each other. But the five characters here, while trying to understand their situation, are completely in the dark - they are not in the situation of the six characters in Pirandello who know their current situations. This uncertainty about what's going on, let the viewers think it's an abstract drama. <br /> <br /> Actors, William Windon as Master and Murray Mattheson as the Clown in particular, give good accounts of themselves. And the conclusion, whether planned or not, is quite effective.
