LIFEFORCE is a highly schizophrenic film, based on Colin Wilson's novel The Space Vampires, the script ignores most of the novel's concepts and structures (indeed, it owes more to the QUATERMASS series than the novel), but the screens to which it is the novel that is almost identical to that in the movie. And from the script it should be one of the most unequal in theater history, but it is written in different chapters in chapters. For example, taking Carlson, disappearing from the early scenes, which led me to believe he was dead, he was halfway through the film explaining the plot to the beleaguered Brits and that was the lack of attention from the authors. which spoils the film. And there are many other clumsy dissertations like the heroes returning to London in a helicopter and not realizing it. It has already been run by zombies until they fly there. <br /> <br /> I can go on great lengths over these plot holes, but LIFEFORCE is actually nice to watch as long as you don't use your brain. It's good to watch a sci-fi horror movie from an era when aliens are portrayed as cute creatures hiding children in their bedrooms, so nasty human adults won't get their hands on them. The special effects and fireworks are very good, there are lots of action and stunts and LIFEFORCE features one of the most memorable aliens in the form of space girl. When LIFEFORCE is called in conversation with men, it's always a race to say, "See the alien in LIFEFORCE? She can always take my life apart." Surely, surprisingly, the demographics of the voices are that this movie is more popular with men than females <br /> <br /> "Don't worry. A naked girl can't escape from here." Can't she? Sorry <br /> <br />
