'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic movie in itself. It is nothing like the book that can disappoint its fiery followers. Still, seeing it for themselves, the movie is a masterpiece. The view is spectacular and the acting is not bad either! Nicolas Cage was brilliant - so different from his usual action hero characters. Penelope cruz is great and really keeps the movie together. I think this film should be judged as an individual project - not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave rights to the film, so the film is an interpretation of the director, John Maddon. Go see this movie with an open mind - you'll love it; because below is the touch of love and war.
