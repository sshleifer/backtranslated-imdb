I saw it at the show at GenCon in Indy. I had time to kill and decided to check it out. It played up to about 1,000 people in a packed, single room. <br /> <br /> Wow, what a ride! The writing was tight. The action time. The pacing is perfect. The character layout is excellent. One thing I really appreciated was that you knew it wasn't a big budget movie. Yet it soon became clear that the creators pushed their sets and effects as far as they could, despite their limitations. And it was more than enough. <br /> <br /> It is true that this movie is aimed at a certain audience - gamers / table players - the creators make no effort to hide it. But other filmmakers can learn a lot from them. Because going to the scene to the scene and not worrying about Mommy watching, will not get it, they have the biggest laugh most times. But there is enough universality there that Ma will laugh too, even if she is not on every joke. I think too many times, I see movies trying so hard to lower the beam to the lowest common denominator, so they will dress with most people, but the movie just ends up for that. <br /> <br /> But not this movie. Indeed, this film was so solid that it wrapped the audience around its finger of the opening credits. And while the viewers around me * really wanted the movie, they didn't push - gamers could be under the most critical niche there. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I saw it in a huge crowd. At least 10 times, the audience had such a good time that they burst into applause during a joke or scene during the film. How often does it happen at shows? It should not be astonished that there was a large standing ovation when the closing credits rolled. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for me because it will be released. After finishing it, one of the producers said they were shooting for a simultaneous TV / DVD release. The date can't be fast enough.
