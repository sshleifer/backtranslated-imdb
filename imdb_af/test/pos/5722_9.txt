Definitely not a movie to revolutionize the industry or introduce new techniques of movies, it's a very nice and solid production. It's amazing that we can enjoy it on DVD today in excellent quality - most of the viewers probably saw a black and white copy about 100 years ago, as the template-tinted luxury edition was only available at the best theaters . Even if you're not fascinated by this movie or its subject, you can't just wonder about the copy of Image Entertainment (along with another gem, From the Manger to the Cross, 1912). It is virtually impossible to see a movie that is more than a century old, but shows so little damage. The stencil color process was a very effective one, and compared to the sometimes vague and lubricated images of hand-colored film, the colors were sharp and well defined. Filmed in the limitations of the films known in 1902 when filming began, the static nature of the screens can almost be considered deliberate, meditative and solemn today. The tableaux keep moving against a steady paste, so the film never gets boring. You may not be fascinated by this film as a work of cinematography, but it is certainly appealing as a work of academic, picturesque art. If you are a religious person, the fact that you look anonymously has long since added a lot of people who have left the characters long ago to the puzzle. A proper look for Christmas or Spring. <br /> <br /> PS: I chose the box "contains spoilers" just for fun. As you can see, I didn't reveal the end.
