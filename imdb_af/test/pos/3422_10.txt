I haven't seen a movie that surprised me and grabbed me so much; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I handcuffed the loo; and I didn't even want to break it because I was right. Emotive; powerful; many moves; scary and heartbreaking. It gives you a wonderful insight into South Africa; their struggle and their lives. The conduct of the leaders was sensible and the writing was incredible. Despite the terrible events unfolding in this movie and how terrible the story is; I was enchanted. I don't even want to try to explain the story; It's too complex and I won't do it right. Please see this; You will understand why when you do this. Cheers, Hol
