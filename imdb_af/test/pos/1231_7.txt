Travis (James Franco) is a young man who, for business reasons, drives a train (we will take off) leaving his beloved cellphone. It is taken up by a prostitute, Terri (Rachel Miner), and when he goes to her city to pick it up, there is a series of events that always stay with him. <br /> <br /> Both characters have barriers that they have gained to protect themselves from communication. But despite their facades, it goes without saying that both are eager to prevent them. In total, there are about 30 spoken lines, but from the way James Franco and Rachel Miner use their faces, you can simply turn off the volume, words are unnecessary. Terri looks at her in the mirror. You can only feel her despair through the room. <br /> <br /> But the movie isn't perfect. It is mostly filmed by handheld cameras, which are a bit distracting. Mainly due to the actions of Mr. Franco and Miner and photography, the writing errors are not so high. But sometimes it seems the story doesn't really know where it is going. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's the kind of movie that really stays with you long after you watch it. An hour after seeing it, you're still "what-for-yourself" on behalf of some characters. It's not flawless, but you want more, because it was at least 4x long.
