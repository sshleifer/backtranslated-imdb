My local PBS station WHYY Philadelphia recently showed "The Elegant Universe". After three hours to see it, apart from injuring my brain, I learned everything about worm bars, quantum mechanics and parallel realities and alternative universes. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the show is about the "String Theory" Physics, a semi-new branch of physics that not only makes many of the ideas of science fiction possible but PROBABLE. With the "String theory" it sounds like wormholes, alternative realities and alternative timelines. It can only be a matter of time until we get the knowledge to use it. <br /> <br /> Although it may not have given new information to someone who knows the topic, I found the show very interesting and informative. It was very understandable to anyone who was simply exposed to this subject.
