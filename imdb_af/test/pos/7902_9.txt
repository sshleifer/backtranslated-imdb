It's not your typical Indian movie. There is a very good humanity, and the characters are pretty realistic. There is great dynamism in the interpersonal relationships, and there is a sense of guilt, sadness, passion, passivity among the many characters. As you see it, you get a feel for the heavy burden of the 5000 year low and low history of social existence of one of the oldest civilizations. The final scene of an elephant leaving in the countryside was a good footnote for such an ancient civilization, yet human relationships are still preserved and nurtured. Watched it on DVD, the two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting. Was surprised to learn that the movie didn't do well (or not shown) in India (... but maybe not too surprised). The artistic heritage of rural societies is slowly disappearing and its legacy is not being absorbed by younger generations, as some of the older musicians in the film do not live today. Great movie.
