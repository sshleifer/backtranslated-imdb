I loved this movie! Fantastic original and different! A solid, intense, hard-core and thrilling movie that just gets the right of (dark?) Humor. If you are tired of the typical, exaggerated, ridiculous Hollywood B.S. movies, how many big explosions and awful and unrealistic shoot-em rifle battles that offend your intelligence, we can take, then this movie is for you. Fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and credible, and solid performances by all actors, not a bad character or performance in the movie. Skip Woods' film is a fresh air and I rejoice in its originality and efforts. His film has the feel of a cross between a Quentin Tarantino and a Cohen brother film (not a bad mix in my opinion). This movie grabs you through the throat and doesn't let go, there's nothing boring or bubble gum about this movie. The only disappointment is that no one knows about it, everyone I recommended, thanked me and shared my opinion. This film is a welcome change / alternative to the canned Hollywood mainstream garbage produced today, even with their big names actors, huge explosions, special effects and huge budgets. It's a very wild, intense, violent, graphic, humorous and miserable (I mean it drives in a good way, not an ugly Hollywood police here). Thanks to everyone involved in making this movie, you've done an amazing job!
