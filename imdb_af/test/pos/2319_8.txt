The first few minutes of this movie don't do it right! For me it is not funny until they go to the sub-board and start laughing those hilarious characters. Born and raised in Norfolk Virginia, I met some of the "different" sailors - even married! Most of my favorite movies are just funny, not topical, not sex or violence and funny every time I see it. Groundhog Day, Bruce Almighty and Down Periscope are still funny even after I know the dialogue. Kelsey Grammar with his "God, I love this work!" Was sincere, sincere and loving. Rob Schneider is hysterical, as the crew comes back to him because he is annoying. I'm still amazed at the size of that fishing boat along a sub! I can see why people who live this life will see the uh oh's, but it's not a documentary, it's a comedy and I love it!
