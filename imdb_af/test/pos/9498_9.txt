This is apparently the first movie with Gloria Swanson - the film that made her an outbreak. While she was good at the movie, I can't see how this show was particularly remarkable - but it was still a very good movie. <br /> <br /> Gloria plays the woman from a rich slum that takes her for granted. He cares little for his care, eats onions and forgets their anniversary! And at the same time, a Lothario comes in their lives and begins to pay close attention to Gloria and her brave husband not even notice or give her a reason to NOT cheat on him. Eventually she separates her hubby and marries the smooth Romeo. Although the movie could only be an exaggerated melodrama (it was quite common at the moment), it took some interesting twists and turns into an imaginative and fun movie. While not the biggest silent movie I've seen, it's a sincere and deserving reminder. <br /> <br /> By the way, the DVD edition of Image Entertainment is surprisingly good - with decent print and music. This is not always true of other image releases (especially the slackness of the Chaplin editions).
