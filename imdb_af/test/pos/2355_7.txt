Have seen this movie with my older brother for the first time in 1953. It was one of the great 3 Demension movies released in that era. We saw it thirteen times and were proud of it. Scott does a typical Western blast while being surrounded by Indian arrows rather than ambient noise. Oh, for the polaroid lenses again.
