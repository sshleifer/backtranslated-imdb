No dots, no secret agents, a story that is entertaining, funny and credible. With some of the producers / actors in this movie at the theater. They were as personally interesting as their characters on the screen. You may not hear from this movie on TV with a high-dollar advertising spot, but it's definitely worth checking out. I spent $ 8 on a movie ticket on many other movies that were not this entertainment. Looking forward to future projects by this production company.
