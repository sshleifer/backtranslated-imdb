It is by far one of the best biographical films of the past. I'm going so far as to put it with Ray and The Aviator. This is the story of a young, bi-racial boy living in a boarding house, through the incredible girl. Rachael aka "Nanny" is managed. You will fall in love with Nanny, a woman who gives herself to those around her. S. Epatha Merkerson brings the character to life beautifully, and the other roles are the same. If I have to praise every actor for the way they played their roles, I have to call everyone in the cast. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie combines perfectly with the story, almost dictating the way it goes. And it's more, this movie is actually entertaining. It won't tolerate you at all, not even for a moment! <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to spend an evening at home and watch a very clever, very entertaining, quality movie.
