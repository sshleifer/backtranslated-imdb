The flu demons "The Gentlemen" catch the voice of the people of Sunnydale, stealing human hearts without shouting. Giles finds that according to a legend, as a woman screams, the creatures will be destroyed, but Buffy and her friends, including Riley, must fight the monsters speechlessly. <br /> <br /> "Hush" is definitely the best episode of the fourth season from buffy to now. With lots of humor and funny situations I liked very much. Spike is hilarious, the romance between Xander and Anya is cool, but I love the "intense" dialogue between Buffy and Riley in the end. The Gothic scenario of the last battle against "The Gentlemen" recalls the environment of Dark City. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "SilÃªncio" ("Silence")
