I originally saw this movie in a theater in Times Square in the late eighties. Who would have thought this film would grow two followers and follow this cult. Night of the Demons was like most other films that came out of the time. A group of horny teens find themselves trapped in some remote locals and are then killed at once in various gruesome ways. Let's think the formula is still being used and apparently working as shown by Saw II I recently saw. <br /> <br /> I saw Mimi Kinkade during a Fangoria convention six years ago and she was so gentle! I think it makes her a pretty good actress if she could make a career playing this devil-possessed woman in all these horror flicks. Anyway, I just got this movie back on VHS cassette and this movie still holds on. a little slow at the beginning as I remember when I first saw it, but then quickly picked it up. One of the eighties horror classic and worth it!
