"Thursday" is a good movie, but we recognize too much of other movies in its genre and therefore it lacks originality. If you saw 'Goodfellas', 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and a lot of other movies inspired by the last one, you saw virtually every part of Thursday. There is a torture scene that even has the same dialogue as Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. <br /> <br /> Still, it's a good movie. Because not every part is taken from the same movie, the whole thing has some new ideas and some nice touches. The starting order is very impressive. We meet Nick (Aaron Eckhart), Dallas (Paulina Porizkova) and Billy Hill (James Le Gros). They come in a fight with a clerk at a petrol station over a cup of coffee and end with the death of the clerk and the arrival of a policeman. We've shed a lot of money in a suitcase. <br /> <br /> Then we meet Casey (Thomas Jane) in Houston. He is married to Christine (Paula Marshall), but still works with Nick. She knows nothing. Then Nick gives him a call and says he is coming. We learn that he has screwed his friends and the problems are going on. <br /> <br /> What exactly happens is not for me to reveal, but we meet other characters, anyone interested in the money or the drugs Nick also had with him. Casey flushed it into the drain. Very funny moments, lots of blood, a very funny subplot involving actor Michael Jeter and a few surprises (although if you really think about it, you'll see them) It's a great movie with some very good performances, pretty directed by Skip Woods.
