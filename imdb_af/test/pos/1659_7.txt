This 1955 pagan film follows Tony le Stephanois, who was recently released from jail for theft, as he undertook the robbery of his life. He boasts of his old treasure trove and they bring in a knowledgeable safe, Cesar of Milan (played by Jules Dassin, who also directed it. He just targeted because he was a black commander in the US and couldn't work. ) The brilliance of this movie is the 1/2 hour during the robbery. During this time there is no dialogue and no music, just the muted sounds to dig through the floor or drill the safe. It increases tension and pulls you in. They're getting away with a few hundred million francs, but a jewel presented by Cesar to a dancer brings their haul to the attention of a trio of brutal brothers. They came out to find the stash for themselves and to bring about misfortune in their wake. Big hoist / gangster movie, but I prefer J.-P. Melville's movies in this genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a lemonade I had last night. I went to a Caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made with sugarcane juice instead of sugar. It also had lots of ice cream and was heavy on the lemons, and it has quite acidic (what I want). The sugarcane juice has a subtle, slightly more gentle taste for it than the real sugar, and the ice cream made it cold and refreshing as I sucked it. 7.5 / 10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
