Yes, I know, Roscoe Arbuckle didn't want to be called 'Fatty', but I couldn't resist the joke. <br /> <br /> It is a fine Lloyd Hamilton shortly after its peak period, directed by Roscoe. The two, along with very good gags and Roscoe's usual attention, focus on the details of shooting the picture in an interesting way. Most comedians prefer flat lighting and a quiet camera to make them more interesting. Roscoe uses a few long-hauling shots and a nice camera trust to tell his story and show Ham as a good actor, as well as a talented comedian. <br /> <br /> This story plays with some interesting themes like Lloyd's classic MOVE ALONG: this is about the perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make of them. Or you can choose to ignore such problems and laugh at your head.
