The Australian public and the Australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough Aussie films, or that they are all the same. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is not a carbon copy. of other Australian movies. It is unique - it will make you laugh out loud, it will make you cry and it will make you feel very good about yourself. <br /> <br /> The decisive movie is wonderful and the play is the second none. The writing and photography (color / light, etc.) is wonderful. But more importantly, it's a good movie. I don't want to talk about the plot because I think it's always best to watch a movie that knows as little as possible. That's enough to say this movie will appeal to a wide variety of audiences. Take your girlfriend, take your mom, take your friends - for a good night. <br /> <br /> 10/10!
