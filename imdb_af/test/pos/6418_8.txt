OK ... The end of this can be something of a decay after what has come before ... And Klaus Kinski had to cut out his 10 second look ... But there is no going away from the fact that it is a really wonderful Euro-thriller ... I can't believe I've never seen it before. It's good to know there are movies out there that are still worth exploring ... And that's really ... Beautiful visuals ... Haunting ... And build a great atmosphere ... Florinda Balkan is perfect as our heroine ... And the scene on the beach with Nicoletta Elmi is one of the most relaxed and perfect plays you can see ... Lila Kedrova is about to be a fellow visitor to the town what may or not is who she looks like. If you miss the hay days of the Euro cinema, chase it out. There is a decent widescreen print to go around ... And please get it in a restored DVD someone ... They did it with the directors "Fifth Cord" ... And this is a much better movie
