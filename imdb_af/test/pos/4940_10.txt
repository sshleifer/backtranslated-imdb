It was just to start on TV when I opened it, and when I felt too lazy to change the channel, I finally watched it. Man, was so happy. <br /> <br /> This movie is more of a fairy tale than a demanding drama, and sometimes openly sentimental. It's definitely what you can call a good movie, and I usually find it boring or irritating. Yet this film is so well done, I couldn't help it, but I love it. The script will not turn your brain; it is conventional but flawless. The actors are brilliant, each one is perfect for the role. There's not much of a score, but the pieces of music enhance the movie beautifully. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate other things than saving expensive pirates, evil murders or the world in a movie, watch it if you ever have the chance. 5/5
