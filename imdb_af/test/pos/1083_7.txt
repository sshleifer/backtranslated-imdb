Again I have to play something of the contrast. Most of the reviews for Ab Tak Chappan were extremely positive. Mine is positive, but only slightly. A 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a "C" grade of mine. <br /> <br /> It seems that many praise is produced in two factors: One is that Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than the typical Bollywood movie, and two, that it tries to do things differently. <br /> <br /> The first point I couldn't care less about. I'm not looking for realism in movies, and so I don't score higher for a movie that shows a story and characters closer to how I believe the real world should be. I'm a big fan of surrealism, fantasy, absurdism, and so on, though I don't like realistic movies just because they are realistic. <br /> <br /> For the second point, I agree that it's worth trying out things differently. However, I don't think "originality" versus formalism makes for a better or worse movie in itself. A movie can be "original" and poor, just as a movie can be formulated and excellent. What matters is how good the film is, and how pleasing or aesthetically rewarding it is to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Ab Tak Chappan is based on the true story of a Mumbai policeman named Daya Naik. Naik was a "meeting specialist". Encounter specialists, who can be said to be early instances of the real world "Judge Dredds", are trained to work like the criminals and gangsters they follow, and they are basically given a license to kill - act effectively as a policeman, judge, jury and gangster in a matter of moments. Ab Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar), the meeting specialist based on Naik. We see him at work, interacting with his fellow meeting specialists and engaging in violence. We see him at home and try to live a normal life in his less than luxurious environment. We see him trying to adjust halfway through the film to a new "commissioner". And we see his strange relationship with a notorious Indian gangster, Don Zameer Zafar (Prasad Purandhare). <br /> <br /> All this has the potential to make a fantastic, eager movie. I agree it's nice to give away the typical Bollywood music numbers and romance - not every movie needs that stuff; Ab Tak Chappan producer Ram Gopal Varma is known for leaving music and romance in the background or along the road in many movies that he is directed or produced. In addition, Ab Tak Chappan has great achievements. Patekar almost gives a death wish (1974) -a Charles Bronson vibe. It also has admirable cinematography. The handpieces near the beginning of the movie were especially effective. It has a good score that mixes more of a moody Hollywood-sounding action / crime score with traditional Indian instruments and modalities. The violence is good and wise. <br /> <br /> There is also proper exploration of sub-texts, including the morality of specialists (meeting with specialists), the idea of ​​following orders, and so on. The meeting specialists are shown to separate themselves from right and wrong ideas. The film claims the merits of blindly following orders. Parallels are being struck between meeting specialists who follow orders and say members of a country's army, and we have shown what a corrupt situation can cause it. <br /> <br /> But you just knew there was a "But" coming, didn't you?) Director Shimit Amin and his screenwriters created a story with too many characters, too much sprawl, and moving a little too slow. All these problems can be due to Amin and the crew watching the Godvader movies, which Ab Tak Chappan has some (at least superficial) agreements, but from a policeman's perspective. <br /> <br /> Most of the meeting specialists don't teach us well - these are the characters that carry the characters, and the least, except Agashe and Jatin Shukla (Nakul Vaid). For one, Narayan, I didn't know who he was at least halfway through the movie. His name is mentioned a few times, but I'll just get from him, until the scene changes. Then everyone will change clothes by the time they reappear and I must first find out who Narayan was. <br /> <br /> The same happened to Agashe's first commissioner. The film was far in the new commissioner before I could figure out the relationships. There seems to be new characters in each scene. We never learn the stories of most of them. Although it may have artistic merit, the meeting specialists are mostly killed by people they know nothing about (because they mostly do it on orders), as we don't learn much about most meeting specialists, it is too. It doesn't really matter to a gripping movie. <br /> <br /> The primary villain is Zameer. But until halfway through the film, there is no indication of this. He doesn't get much more screen time than the other villains going through the movie, and he literally talks about his performance. He is in a different location (Dubai), who only communicates for most of the film telephonically. We don't actually see Zomer. To some extent, the film is dependent on a few "twists" that do not have to show that Zamer is doing a lot of things, but we could see him doing other things, and many other villains could be left out. <br /> <br /> That would boost the movie a little, make it more focused and about half an hour shorter, which would both benefit. It's not an active movie. For at least the first 45 minutes or so, I found myself Ab Tak Chappan's substantial style, but said, "Okay, keep up the story though."
