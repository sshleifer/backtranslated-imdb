When I was younger, and today is Mr. Bean a work of genius. Three times BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson stars as the almost silent (miming) human looking for alien on the Earth, causing chaos and mischief wherever he goes. He tried to do an exam, went to the blind man's pants (he didn't know he was blind), tried to dive into a pool, make lunch on a park bench, ' a scary movie, turned into his car, had a picnic with a flying invasion, Christmas with his girlfriend (Matilda Ziegler), went to a baby in Portsmouth, to room 426 of The Queens Hotel in Portsmouth, a pet match with his Teddy, driven on top of his Mini on a new chair, and even met and knocked out the queen. Guests included Rudolph Walker, Richard Briers, Angus Deayton, Nick Hancock of They think it's all over, Caroline Quentin, The Day Today's David Schneider, Richard Wilson, The Fast Show's Eryl Maynard and The Vicar of Dibley's Roger Lloyd Pack. These have been named BAFTAs for Best Comedy (Program or Series) and Best Light Entertainment Program. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on the 50 largest British actors, he was number 24 on the comedian's comedian, and he was number 8 on Britain's favorite comedian. Outstanding!
