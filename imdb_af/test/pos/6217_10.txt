Every episode I saw when I was an innocent child was stupid. There were some funny dolls called "The Mitts" that will always discuss childhood. They would play this song before "The Mitts" part of the show going like this: "Let's join the Mitts ..." There was a Groucho Marx puppet telling jokes. Before the session, this man would "Hot Fudge! Right On!" Sing. There was a green puppet with teeth called Seymore. We will always see more Seymore. He'll crack jokes and sing every episode. In every episode there was always a morale. One episode, a man sang: "League's are losers!" Another episode he sang about sharing and caring. Seymore told me about the two little girls, Sharon and Karen. The Hot Fudge Holey Moley share this guy strange stuff and they played strange music.
