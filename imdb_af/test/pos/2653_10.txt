There is really no way to compare this movie to any other movie, because no one has ever made any of it and nobody will ever want to. And it should really be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At least it deserves a good sound system. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science fiction and wanted to see a "space" movie. Remember, this movie was made before the first moon landing. <br /> <br /> There we were waiting to start it. But, exuberance! There was no cartoon, no upcoming attractions. The theater-owner of the Cooper Theater has for some reason decided to play the "Star-Spangled Banner", with the lights still on so we all stand, never did it before or after a movie and then sat down when it ended. Then the theater became completely DARK and the strange offense started with the blank screen barely visible. <br /> <br /> The transfer ended and my seat started VIBRATE as the blue screen appeared with the MGM lion, along with the first deep bass notes, and then my senses were overwhelmed, and for the first time in my life , I also hear "Sprach Zarathustra". The ride just started. <br /> <br /> (I recommend you to see this opening, this movie, in a DARK room with your subwoofer as high as possible to get the effect I had in that theater.) Of course It took quite a while before we got to outer space and the movie that followed was nothing but a science fiction movie. INTERMISSION came (a good thing, highly underrated and unused nowadays) and we all looked in wonder, caught our breath, and then the ride resumed, wilder than before. <br /> <br /> I've seen It's 7 more times in the next year, always in a full-size theater, like all the multiplexes theaters. I could have been "high" once, but I didn't go there again because I was "getting out". I went because I knew I saw an artwork. It was so damn BEAUTIFUL; the sound you can feel in your legs, followed by terrible silence; the attractions that are unpredictable and unthinkable; The love for HAL turns to terror. And of course, WTF was really trying to come to me? Years and many more views later I understand, I think, as I will ever. Read someone else's comment if you are looking for someone to explain it to you or to search the web, and you'll find "explanations". It is not my purpose to write this comment. <br /> <br /> What I hope To do, encourage you to watch it patiently, enjoy the beauty you want to enjoy a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know (eg. Gayne Ballet Suite or the Blue Danube); enjoy it if you want to enjoy a wonderful meal, soak it like a good wine; Look and listen to the clues and the hidden symbols out there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick wanted to share something with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think where you are. one came and where you go. <br /> <br /> If it's too much work for your brain, and you can't see the beauty and mystery of Kubrick's movie and don't explore my stupidity, but your life is about as significant as that of a tapir or a premonolith monkey. If you want unceasing escape, it's not for you. <br /> <br /> But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, music harmonies, mysteries and sensualities and have open thoughts, this movie will add something to you. life.
