I learned a thing: you have to take this movie like a funny period comedy if you don't want to be disappointed. The movie is nice, because it's a nice comedy. I think the overhypes damaged it: the over-glorified Monica Bellucci appears in few scenes and is not as good as they wanted you to believe. She sounds unnatural, fake: the best actress in this movie is Sabrina Impacciatore, who speaks with a perfect Tuscan accent and shines with Massimo Ceccherini. Elio Germano is very, very good: the most promising young Italian actor, I think. Daniel Auteuil looks like Napoleon, but I chose other actors. So, the disturbed performances were also the worst. Costumes and production design are okay: sure, American movies are more accurate about these things because they have bigger budgets, but the Italian ability rewards the lack of money. A nice time comedy, briefly, with an excellent rate (except Bellucci and Auteuil).
