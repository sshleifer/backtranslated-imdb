Hollywood is one of the best and beautiful things that have happened in my life. I admire and am very fascinated by the way Hollywood generates and implements ideas. It makes me wonder about the extent of the human brain. I saw Flatliners a long time back, but the story, direction, throw and all of the plays are still fresh in my mind. The story begins with our main actor Sutherland at sunrise "which is a beautiful day to die." For all of us, this is a story that shows emotions that are sometimes withheld in our minds throughout our lives. Never understand a few things in life. It shows us to be motivated and to improve our quality of life. Anyway, I suggest it to everyone who sees it once.
