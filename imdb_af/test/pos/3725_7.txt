Luc Besson's first work is also his first decline in science fiction, a genre with which he will return to the Fifth Element (1997) fourteen years later. Even if this movie is heavily influenced by Hollywood theater, it's still very enjoyable. Back in 1983, "Le Dernier Combat" reveals Besson's own approach to science fiction. He takes back an urgent subject and his efforts are noticeable to make an attractive work. Shot in big screen and black and white, a disaster has virtually destroyed all the people of the earth and we will never know what this disaster was and why men can no longer speak. Some barbaric hordes were formed. At the same time, a man (Pierre Jolivet) stays alone and arrives in an unrecognizable Paris where he is received by a doctor (Jean Bouise). <br /> <br /> There are no words in Besson's work. The actions of the characters and the progress of the events go through watching and gesturing. Although the starting point and the backdrop are unpleasant, the film never has the appearance of being discouraged. The man and the doctor seem to try to portray gestures and actions related to humanity before the disaster. The film opens with the man who has sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to talk him through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It's all the more interesting because these paintings are from prehistoric times. Following this reasoning, one can argue that the bearded giant (Jean Reno) was angry and threatened the efforts made by the man and the doctor to restore what ultimately made one. It's for the gang of bad things at the start of the movie. <br /> <br /> The pessimistic whiff that can transfer such a movie is not really at stake and leaves room for a glamorous hope. Personally, the movie could not have gained any music, except the one that the man could hear with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson was making better and still filmed films like this, but he also encouraged Pierre Jolivet's career as a director. He will in the future have a turbulent job behind him: "Force Majeure" (1989), "Simple Mortel" (1991), "ma Petite Entreprise" (1999) or "Filles Uniques" (2003).
