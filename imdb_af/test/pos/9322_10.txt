This excellent musical film, in beautiful Technicolor, is so wonderful that it is enough to make every person of Irish descent proud. Full of joy and celebration of all things, Irish, a great role, with brilliant institutions and wonderful plays, beautiful Irish music and the excellent Irish voice of star Dennis Morgan, a congratulations to the Irish for such a wonderful movie. enjoy over and over! Not just for St. Patty's Day, but for the whole year. One of the jewels Jack L. Warner produced during his boom as a studio boss in Burbank in the 1940s. <Br /> <br /> Shame on Warner Brothers because they don't have this fine home video and DVD photo available!
