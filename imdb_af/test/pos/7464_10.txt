My friends and I rented this movie just to satisfy a friend who was very bent on renting it without knowing what it was all about. We all thought it would be like a Canadian American pie, but when we saw it, we were completely surprised. We were all quiet in the movie and loved it! It was nothing like American Pie and has a plot that teenage girls will surely worship (since the man beat the shit at the end of it), after that night it became my favorite movie because it's not just the plot but the actors and the great writing. There wasn't a moment where I thought it was incredible. Everything is very realistic and related to anyone living in a small town with little prospect. I absolutely love this movie and would recommend renting it the next time you have a chance, it's worth it.
