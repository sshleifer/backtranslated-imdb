David Cronenberg's "eXistenZ" is a well-designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It addresses the problems of a culture linked to technology that can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical. The film shocks the audience with its replacement of mechanical technology with organic, metabolism-one. In this context, technology can be part of the human body. After playing the virtual reality game of 'eXistenZ', the real world feels like a game and as a result, human behavior changes to apply violent game calls even when the game is over. In eXistenZ, technology has evolved from machinery to biological organisms that connect directly into the human nervous system; an idea that reflects Marshall McLuhan's belief, which is a well-known media theorist, that computers are extensions of human consciousness. As phone is an extension of the ear, television is an extension of the eye, telegram is an extension of the central nervous system high-tech virtual reality is an extension of human consciousness. In eXistenZ, technology is biological and therefore more human than it is in our world. But as technology becomes organic, humans become more mechanical and therefore less free, unable to withstand their pin drives. eXistenZ is a virtual realty simulation of man's existence. Jean Baudrillard describes a mediated society in his book Simulacra and Simulation, which has transformed all the power to appear. The world has passed a pure simulation of itself. In eXistenZ, it is clear that Baudrillard's mediated society, with the themes of the invasion of the body, sees the loss of control and the transformation of the self to others. <br /> <br /> While in the eXistenZ, awareness is slowly being replaced with another identity, your role in the game, which is a reflection of each individual's real life subconscious. As you step by step control of your hyperreal life, the aura of your real life disappears. For Baudrillard, "Simulations or Simulakra, became hyperreal, more than real. "Our hyperreality, like Cronenberg's world of computer simulation," now feels, and for all purposes is more real than we call the real world. '(Baudrillard) The purpose of the game, which can basically be called' experience ', is quite metaphorical. Because you can't even know what experience is, unless you experience it. As existentialists say that life without an exact explanation is absurd, the play of eXists is also absurd. Cronenberg ironically reflects the absurdity of our lives. For example, in the game, the other reels are silent unless you ask them a pre-programmed question. And when you set their aimless, funny, looking condition in the representation of our life, the exposed absurdity really shocks. <br /> <br /> The theme of the game is to understand what it is for? This hidden metaphorical question creates anxiety about the people who play eXistenZ. They have no doubt about their existence, but they do not know the underlying reason of their existence. The essence. <br /> <br /> Existenceists found that humans do not have a solid nature or essence like other animals and plants do; Every person makes choices that create his or her own nature. In the formulation of the 20th century French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, existence exists. `Choice is therefore central to human existence, and it is inevitable; Even the refusal to choose is a choice. Freedom of choice involves commitment and responsibility. Because individuals are free to choose their own path, existentialists have argued, they must take the risk and responsibility to follow their commitment wherever they go. "Maybe I should mention," eXistenZ "is also about the concept of freedom of choice. You reach your final role in the game by making real decisions. If you don't, the game becomes uncompromising and boring. So, you questioned the game, your existence rather than your essence. Suddenly you are alternating with the game and realize your position outside the game. As a last word, eXistenZ is a well-designed reverse simulation of life, thus existentialism. <br /> <br />
