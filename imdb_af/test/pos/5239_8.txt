I really enjoyed this movie. It's John Wayne's first show. But then you can say Wayne has a true presence, though he won't really age in the icon he is known to, Stagecoach, 9 years later in 1939. It's about settlers from across the country to the new west to colonize it. Wayne's character Breck Coleman joins, but for his own personal reasons. Many of the lead actors have been acting actors and have never done a movie, which makes the movie even more amazing. They created credible, distinctive characters and there is quite an oddball mix. Cimarron would come out a year later and had a very similar story, although I didn't have as much as this movie. . For me, The Big Trail is a strong 8/10.
