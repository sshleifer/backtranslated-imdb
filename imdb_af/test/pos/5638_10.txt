This documentary film is the most hypnotic movie I've ever seen. I had to tackle it for a whole day. The chosen material included in the piece flows incredibly well and develops three characters that are impossible to ever forget. The different layers of these people move back to making a strange moving movie about perseverance, loyalty and determination. These characters have become surprisingly fascinating and the movie is unforgettable.
