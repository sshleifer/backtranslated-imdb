Most people are totally unaware that this movie exists. Fox, who paid the judge to do so, kept it in mind for a while and then spent nothing to promote it. I think it made many people think it is one of the rubbish movies being rinsed in late summer. Well, I'm here to tell you that it's a funny and rather scary look at a future that's not that hard to believe. Basically, Judge suggests that the stupid one is cleverly expanding by a wide margin. Then they become stupid people by basically spending all their time watching television and having sex, causing more stupid people. By 2500, a person of average intelligence today, seems to be a genius, who speaks "everyone phaggy." Seriously, it's really that hard to believe. Oh yes, this future is painfully funny and ridiculous, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great if the time the army is going to travel hopelessly tries to return to a more comfortable time. Where this story will get its cult status is with the many funny one-liners, such as "can we make her family style" and "hey man, I'm here a little!" It's a funny movie and a pretty sharp social commentary on an American society that apparently disappears with self-entertainment, comfort and stupidity and I guarantee you that I'll buy it on DVD the first day it comes out and watch it. and over.
