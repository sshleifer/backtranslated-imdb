It's also the best book I've ever read. Karl Urban and Steve Zahn are good together. It had drama, adventure and sweetness and sadness. I laughed. I cried. It's hard not to laugh when Gus speaks. I wish Gus would have complained to Clara as if he had done Inez. Clara only leads Gus over the years, with no intention of ever marrying him. She likes to play with him. It was sad that he had spent all his life for her. It would have been nice if Woodrow had married Maggie, but she would have just died on him anyway. Woodrow was a man who could not express his feelings and bottled them. It was clear that he loved Maggie after the attack on Austin when the rangers returned and he ran to hold her. Val Kilmer is great for playing strange characters. I loved his portrayal of Captian Inish Skull. I loved the whole of Lonesome Dove saga. Comanche Moon is the best of the bunch.
