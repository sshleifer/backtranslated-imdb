Hal Hartley is compared to a contemporary William Shakespeare, due to the fact that he gets his actors to deliver their lines in an iambian pentameter. He certainly knows how to collect a cast and Martin Donovan is again sensational. Thomas Jay Ryan plays his role with an unforgettable intensity. Although the movie lasts only 1 hour, the screen works great and keeps the audience up to speed. Without a doubt, Hal Hartley is one of the best directors to come from America over the past 20 years, with a vision that is unique, funny and heart-warming.
