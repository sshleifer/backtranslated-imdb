Oh, how refreshing to see a vision of the 18th century England, complete with mud, smallpox and gibbets ... and accompanied by a beautiful techno soundtrack to get started. This is the story of the retired freewayman Plunkett (Robert Carlisle) and Gentleman captain Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller), and how they come together and rob the aristo pigs. Plunkett is a hard nut, but MaCleane is polite for that and becomes "the gentleman highwayman". He falls in love with Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler) (who is honest, is the only weak part of the whole shebang) and wants to impress her. <br /> <br /> The costumes are fantastic. Big, colorful, historically impressive beautiful trains. Alan Cummings gets all the best threads and the best lines as Lord Rochester, which penetrates a very 18th-century eyebrow. The music shifts between swooping glorious choirs and dipping bass-charged techno, which doesn't bother as you think it should be in a historic movie. The writing is moving fast and peppered with contemporary colloquialism; Dealer Ivory, it's not. There are hilarious parts, disgusting parts, sit-on-your-seat-and-nibble-your-fingers parts, but the whole thing chugs along and is wonderfully entertained throughout. These are courage-in-the-theater stuff. Thinking away.
