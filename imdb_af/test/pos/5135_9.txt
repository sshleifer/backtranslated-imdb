It's a beautiful jewel of a movie, unfortunately pigeon-holed as "just for kids." The plot revolves around a young man, Roy Eberhardt, who has just arrived in the southwestern Florida from the Montana mountains. Roy tries to fit a brother-sister team into the middle of the school with the other children, and tries to protect endangered owls from an illegal construction site. Search for Carl Hiassen, the author of the book on which this film is based, as the male secretary of the evil boss at the head office. Author / director Wil Shriner is also the clerk at the Public Records Office, where the fearless teenage detectives discover that the incriminating Environmental Impact Report is missing. Luke Wilson almost steals all the critical scenes of the beautiful teenage actors who have the most of the best lines. Wilson is the clumsy police officer, in his three-wheel electric police wheel, with blue light and funky siren. As Officer Dave he tries so hard to do good, but usually ends up in the spill, literally! Various times! Jimmy Buffet is pretty low key as the tacit support science teacher. But young actors, Logan Lerman (Roy), Brie Larson (Beatrice the Bear) and Cody Linley (Mullet Fingers) are wonderful as teenagers eventually follow Officer Dave on the right track. . I hope you get away from this movie, feel as good as I do. Just fun! One small complaint, though. I hope all non-Florida people realize that not all of Florida is so bad for newcomers as this film is portraying. We are really a friendly bunch! Just ask Carl Hiassen and Jimmy Buffet !!
