I didn't know much about this movie when I entered the theater for a preview. I gathered at the ads that it was a thrill. <br /> <br /> What we have is like "Compulsion" meets "Matlock". Two teenagers decide to commit a perfect murder. A victim is randomly selected and then carefully executed so that no traces of the real killers are found. Then a lot of false clues are planted which points to an innocent bystander. (Innocent of the murder anyway) <br /> <br /> Enter Sondra Bullock as the investigating officer. (IMDB says she's FBI, but I don't remember. I thought she was a regular policeman). She is frustrated by the contradiction of the killer profile ("The profile does not match the profile!") And by the power and influence of one of the boys' father. <br /> <br /> She also has her own demons who decide in her decision to become a cop. But it is the only character that is really more than one-dimensional. All others are fairly flat. <br /> <br /> For a thrill, there really isn't much excitement. It's mostly a cat and mouse game like an episode of "Matlock" (which she watches at one point in the movie). The twist is that there are two involved in the murder. Just who is the real killer, Justin or Richard? It will cost you eight dollars to find out.
