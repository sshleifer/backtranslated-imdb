"Medusa: Dare to be truth" is an exorbitant funny parody that is a good companion to the original, "Madonna: Truth or Dare". Julie Brown's brilliant creation boasts Madonna's highly entertaining documentary (though not exactly daring, informative, honest or truthful) with fidelity to detail, right up to the packaging. I highly recommend it to Madonna fans, Julie Brown fans, or anyone who enjoys sharp and smart parody.
