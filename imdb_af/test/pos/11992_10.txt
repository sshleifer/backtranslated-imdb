Like Richard Pryor, Mason never got the material he earned. Whatever you know about him is probably wrong. Get past the accent and go see his stand-up. You'll be very surprised - he's one of the best stand-ups I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from Lenny Bruce to Eddie Murphy to Jerry Seinfeld to Chris Rock - Jackie Mason is definitely up there ). He is known to be a comic book. Even Howard Stern said he was one of the top 3 funniest comedians ever. <br /> <br /> The accusation that Mason is not Dangerfield is ridiculous. Dangerfield is known as a great Mason fan. Dangerfield's career went nowhere before he started following Mason's performances. That's when Mason Dangerfield provided inspiration for his "no respect" routine. While I think Dangerfield is big, they both stand up and you'll see Mason is the better comedian.
