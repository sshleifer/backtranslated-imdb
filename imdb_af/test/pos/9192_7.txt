I read the last comment on this movie and disagree completely and completely. <br /> <br /> You see, I'm from Portuguese nationality and although this movie can say little to anyone from Boston, it certainly says something for both Portuguese and Brazilian people as well as immigrants everywhere. <br /> <br /> And why are you wondering? Well, first of all, this film is about two brothers and sisters: Portugal and Brazil. Brazil gained its independence in the early 19th century (through the hands of the Portuguese throne) and since then relations have improved significantly. <br /> <br /> But significant as it may be, there is still much bias. Due to the economic climate in Brazil during the 1990s, immigration to Portugal has grown largely. You see, Portugal is not just a country that has a similar language, culture and beliefs to Brazil, but also a gateway to the rest of Europe. Some people therefore had to decide to cross the Atlantic and look for a better life. Portugal was the first logical place to try to immigrate. <br /> <br /> As many immigrants continue to live, their averages are below the minimum wage and are treated like "dirty" - only in this case, because the language is similar, they are constantly made aware of their status as immigrants. <br /> <br /> Another strange thing in this movie is the idea that a man who is so familiar with the history of his own country is still trying to make a quick buck through the exporting sought-after national resources. It's exactly like those who keep Brazil in a constant state of arrested development, as the country is well-equipped with natural resources and the economic ladder can easily climb if it gets a fair chance. <br /> <br /> In a sense, it shows how colonialism still exists - Pablo representing the exploits, Igor the man whose status as a "nobleman" (or at least rich or "good off") ) is assured by the foreign colonialist power, which in turn is represented by Kraft. <br /> <br /> If you have seen other films from Salles, you will recognize it as a recurring topic - the battle against an oppressive force. I don't mean to give lectures or to teach anyone's history, but I thought this movie was very strong. I'm not saying there was no room for improvement (as always is), but I think the last comment written on it was not just meticulous, but the hand is ignorant. <br /> <br /> One last thing to be said about this is the fact that you watched this movie with the eyes of a US filmmaker. No damage meant by this remark, but I think "strange" movies can't be all about "beautiful scenery". Art deals with the problems of his time. You won't expect Otto Dix to paint all the beautiful places in Bayern and the Black Forest. Why should you expect a movie maker to focus exclusively on nature, if he feels there are more relevant issues to attend? br /> In a nutshell, do not judge movies lightly and with only two or three criteria in scope. This film is very interesting, photography is pretty good and even the idea that black and white color traffic goes hand in hand with what it handles. I believe the image is purposefully grainy ... like reality, no? :) <br /> <br /> See it and reach your own conclusions ...
