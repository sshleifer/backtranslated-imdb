The idea is not original. If you had seen such a story before, you would know what the end would be after looking at the first twenty minutes. The writing, the positioning of the actors and the show are also obvious ... If you haven't seen such a story yet, this is definitely a good experience, you will finally enjoy the turn ... don't forget to see it again after you know the "truth", you will even have more of the plots ... Although I really thought at the beginning of the law, I still couldn't help standing on my seat no. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A must see! ! This one from Korea is better than any recent movies from the genre from Japan ... forget Hollywood! <br /> <br /> Don't miss it !!
