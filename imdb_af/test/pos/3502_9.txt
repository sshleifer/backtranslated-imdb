Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - although the big screen didn't lose him kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-and-second fun party - just like on the small screen. He did not lose anything of his character or stupidity, and behind it all - not one of the films is brainless fluff. A human side to Ali is unveiled during the film. The idea of ​​Ali G for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one. And the unceasing stupidity of Staines's gangster is well mixed with the harsh, political world. The film is also full of brilliant new characters - and instead of just an interview after interview, we get a decent comedy movie that never gets repetitive or boring. So why didn't I give it ten stars? Well, the end was funny, but also broke and failed - nothing made sense. And in parts, the movie has become offensive to be funny - but it is Ali G for you - if it is not offensive, it is not itself, and it is completely and completely destroyed. Ali G's big-screen debut was a success in my faith, and had to reach the 6-7 average rating on IMDb. But it can also be worse, and people should have mixed opinions, especially on a movie like this. Overall, Ali G Indahouse is hilarious British comedy at its best - and funniest and smartest. A good job! 9/10
