This movie came out about the same time as Pretty Woman. While the general theme is the same: rich man meets and learns to love a poor working class woman, the characters of Romuald and Juliette are much more fond of and appreciate our time with them. I never forgot them and saw the movie better than Pretty Woman in so many ways. Juliette is a remarkable woman and the clever ways she helps her boss overcome his problems will arouse you. The final scenes feature some of the most memorable lines in the romantic comedy. The efforts made by Romuald to win the love of Juliette surpass the hundred-fold past the pretty woman's climbing scene. See this movie, it will warm your heart.
