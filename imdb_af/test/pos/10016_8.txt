I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it. Sure, it's a bit slow in parts, but what would you expect from Rollin? Also there is a lot of nudity, nothing wrong with it, especially because it includes a lot of beautiful Brigitte Lahaie. There are also some spectacular erotic female dead, a bit more dodgey, perhaps, but most effective. There is also a sci-fi story with a brief explanation at the end, but I won't bother it too much. No, here we have a very interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to what extent one is still "alive" without memory. My DVD caps mention David Cronenberg and although it may not be as good as his best films, there are a few similarities here, especially with the huge use of seemingly threatening architecture and the effective and creepy use of interior space. As I tried to point it out, it's not a ripe burning thriller at all, it's a fascinating nightmare like film that makes most of its places, including a beautiful railroad finish at the end.
