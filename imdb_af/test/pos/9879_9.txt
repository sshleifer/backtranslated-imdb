To understand "Crash Course" in the right context, you need to understand the 80's in TV. Most TV shows had no point. The sitcom tapped the drama at least 3 to 1. They still found out where the lines were so that they could cross them. (TV shows like "Hail to the Chief" were quite the brave step!) This "Crash Course" for television had an All-Star cast, bringing together members of the 80's classics: "227", "Family Tie", "Who's the Boss?", Et al. Directors must have a certain affection for those all-star movies. Yet this movie offered very light fare and a simplistic view of heroism and maturity. And sometimes it's not bad. Viva Soleil Moon Frye.
