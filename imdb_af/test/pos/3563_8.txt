A gang of convicts led by the sharp, unruly, ruthless Monetero (a perfectly impressive show by Gilbert Roland) steals $ 300,000 gold coins during a brave train robbery. But untrustworthy member Bahunda (an amusing turn by Jose Torres) finishes with the coins and hides them. Unfortunately, Bahunda is killed before he can tell Monetero where he hit the boot. Monetero should therefore work with slick, hasty, mysterious bounty hunter The Stranger (played smoothly by the handsome George Hilton) and cagey, corrupt banker Clayton (a beautiful imagination of 50-year-old idol Eddie "Kookie" Burns) to find the coins . . Dedicated by Enzo G. Castellari, with a clever, complex and distorted writing by Castellari, Tito Carpi and Giovanni Simonelli, a playful amoral and nihilistic tone (everyone is double and triple with happy greedy desolation), a cut , fragrant, fast-paced score by Alessandro Alessandroni and Francesco De Masi, many moveable shooting ranges and rosy fist images, a bad, smart sense of smug humor, a steady fit and a real doozy of surprise. ending, this greedy and often hilarious feature makes for an inspired broadcast by Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." Delicious Stefanie Careddu, such as Monetero's fiery gallant Marisol, Ivano Staccioli as a hard captain, and Gerard Herter as well-known lawyer Lawrence Blackman appear in a nice secondary part. A very amusing and pleasant skirt.
