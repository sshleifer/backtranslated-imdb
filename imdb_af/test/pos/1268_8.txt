There are two things I noticed in this movie. (It's not a spoiler, just a storytelling mistake.) When Cole Bill takes his first B & E, he finds the "box". Once Cole finds it, he says, "The box. Everyone has a box". A few minutes later, just before he dumped the content on the floor, he said, "We're really lucky. You don't see it often." <br /> <br /> Observation # 2 (Spoiler Alert!) <br /> <br /> I had to watch the thing three times, I couldn't make up a few things. Then I looked at the Chronological version and saw that they changed flash feeds from the latter to the previous in time. So on some points we actually looked at three different times in about one minute of wall time. <br /> <br /> It was a good thing because I didn't know how many times I could see it before giving it back. Netflix. <br /> <br /> Color me obsessively.
