Rachel and Chuck Yoman (Valerie Harper, Gerald McRaney) have decided that the city is too busy and dangerous for their family. They packed their reluctant son (Gregory Togel) and daughter (Tammy Lauren) and pulled back to a lake like the one Rachel had as a child. <br /> <br /> They say you can't go home again, but it's an ideal rural home with what looks like a Mayberry feel. Later, the residence looks more like the people in salvation. Soon bodies will show up and everyone looks suspicious with the exception of some friendly faces. It doesn't like the family to enjoy walking around and wandering around in the woods. <br /> <br /> We find that they should be super ignorant to find the secrets and tell no one until they become the antagonists. <br /> <br /> Can the ignored young Stevie save his parents or will his runner-up place his / her foot in it? <br /> <br /> This movie is more than most parodies as it was played with faces. They couldn't have picked better actors and Daryl Anderson was extremely creepy. An added plus is that they let us know what happens before the characters find out, rather than take a clue from the hat. Anyway, it made for TV movie is good for a few laughs.
