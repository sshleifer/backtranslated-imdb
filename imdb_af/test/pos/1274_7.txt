A surprisingly good movie about the circumstances of its production. Characteristics of non-name actors competing with the top talent on the planet (unfortunately no one has sustained a career). <br /> <br /> Also know Christian Nolan's godly ability to write perfect dialogue. Dialogue is what bears this story, it's about a man who wants people to follow material for his books. Well shot, very well edited, even better written, and done incredibly well. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything a good movie needs, except people who have seen it. 9/10
