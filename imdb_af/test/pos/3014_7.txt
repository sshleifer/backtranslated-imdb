The cell fascinated me at first glance. I was a little surprised at that fact, because the story of that movie is absolutely boring. If it had no story, the movie would be better. Bunuels "Un chien andalou" come to my mind - a film without story, but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images. But the cell is first a Hollywood movie, and only a second piece of art. I'm very interested in Tarsem's next project. Hamlet on Indian can be very interesting, especially if it looks the same as THE CELL. <br /> <br /> For movie music enthusiasts: Howard Shore's score for THE CELL is absolutely wonderful, but a hard listening experience, due to its very modernist style.
