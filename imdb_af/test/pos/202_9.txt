In Moscow, the young couple Veronika (T. Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) are deeply in love for each other. With World War II, Boris joined volunteers at the army and sent the day before Veronika's birthday, and they didn't have the chance to say goodbye. Waiting for Boris's news, Veronika is raped by Boris's cousin Mark (A. Shvorin) and they marry each other. However, Veronika does not forget Boris, and waits for him. <br /> <br /> "Letyat zhuravli" is an impressive and sad romance in times of war. The direction is excellent and uses ellipses next to the story, also in the capital scene when Veronika is raped by Mark. The camera work is great, with sophisticated planes and corners, and long journeys. The scenes of Veronika in the middle of the tanks, or in the train station with many figurines are wonderful. The beautiful cinematography is highlighted by the restored image of the DVD. T. Samojlova has an extremely beautiful face, and a touch and sensitive display. The final scene speech is another great example of an anti-war film. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Quando Voam as Cegonhas" ("When Fly the Stork")
