When I saw the first preview for this, I almost got out of excitement. I've been a fan of the Twelfth Night for a long time - it transferred me to Shakespeare, so having a modern adaptation is a dream come true. My expectation was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The plot basically follows the original storyline and that means: complicated! I don't even want to try to relate it, the plot summary will probably cover the basics. Imagine having a girl as if you were a resident of a residence and thinking of all the possible situations that would create. I won't even break to question the plausibility of such a plot; the reality is NOT the tip of the movie. <br /> <br /> What it is, however, is absolutely hilarious. Almost every scene nails the comic setup. Kudos for the writers, directors and actors on that score. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is the star of this movie and she wears it wonderfully. She is super-cute, not a vixen and can do flawless comedy. I admire her so much that she is not in her films or in public life, as many stars do today. I'm glad there are at least one decent young actress who left in Hollywood. OK, I'm out of my soapbox ... <br /> <br /> Channing Tatum, yes he's hot and built like a flippin gorilla, but he really makes me laugh! My favorite scenes in the whole movie are when he first tries to talk to Olivia first by talking about cheese and later about his workout. <br /> <br /> The rest of the role also failed to add characters to the characters of the incoming debutant mom and Monique, the classic evil girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Overall, lots of fun, laughs of laughter and a very attractive role. Perhaps not up to date with the original, but it speaks modern versions of other plays, including the common 10 things I hate about you.
