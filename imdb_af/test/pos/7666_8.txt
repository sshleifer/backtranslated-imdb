This show was incredible but too esoteric for most people. If you've never seen a European variety show in the 70's or 80's (or at least a Mexican one) the whole show would probably be lost to you. If you had this, this show was a death on the shrewd satire of the ominous spectacle and shallowness with which it dived. Helmed by a chain-smoking suave wannabe with a pencil mustache and his ultra-glamorous and immasculating harridan from an ex-wife, "Viva Variety" is a variety of shows trying to get off the ground every episode but always falling in fighting and acts went very wrong. The hosts are added by Johnny Bluejeans, a dull white shopper who is allegedly named because blue jeans are a very popular product in his country and that means the kids will love him, which of course they are <br /> <br / > The result was a hilarious spoof of variety shows in general. Imagine the argument that BACKSTAGE probably happened during the last days of the "Sonny & Cher Show". Imagine that this is happening before you and the stars are trying to keep their calm. Now add cheesy acts and a Euro-Riche mentality (tuxedoes, gown, liquor, accent and smoke). Now you have 'Viva Variety'. <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard a musician whose music is pretty much written to other musicians? Too conceptual? Viva Variety did it for comedians. Away to esoteric for the standard American audience. It was funny like hell. And doomed.
