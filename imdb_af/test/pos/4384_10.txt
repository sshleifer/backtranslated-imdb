'Oh brother, where art you' is a gratifying tale of Homer's 'Odyssey', introduced in the 1930s Mississippi and haughty with beautiful peculiarity that is the trademark of Coen's brothers. Three unlucky prisoners make their escape to find treasure - and more than their share of adventure - in this beautiful movie. George Clooney is in fine, inventive form as the chic, friendly leader of the trio; but the real kudos go to John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as his goofy but lovely cohorts, the Clooney character of Clooney's character after receiving the baptism by full immersion in a river. The three cut a record under this homepage nom-de-plume for the cash, and unknowingly become overnight rock sensations with true rock star status. The movie is accompanied by enough music and songs to qualify almost as a musical. And there are some amazing performances of filmmaking: the scene at the KKK rally is a real doozy, and is so similar to the scene as Dorothy's friends save her from the witch's castle in 'The Wizard of Oz' it almost amounts to film-like plagiarism. And what a wonderful job of plagiarism it is! Without giving the end, I have to say the climax of the movie is one of the most breathtaking rows in recent memory (compared to the spectacular final of 'Magnolia', one of my favorites). "O Brother" is a must-see, a perfect 10!
