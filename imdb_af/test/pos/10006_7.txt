I felt this movie had very good qualities. The cinematography was definitely different, and exposed the stage aspect of the set and story. The original characters as actors were definitely an achievement and I played the most, very convincingly, of course they play themselves, but definitely unique. The cultural aspects can be very disappointed as a familiarity with Chinese and Eastern culture will answer many questions regarding parent / child relationships and the stigma associated with any drug use. I found the Jia Hongsheng story interesting. On a downward note, the story is in Beijing and some of the fashion and music series of the early 90's, although made in 2001, so it's actually cheesy (the Beatles crap, etc.). Whatever, not a top ten or twenty, but if it is on television, check it out.
