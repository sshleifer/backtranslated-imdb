At the end of the Vitnam war, Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen), sent by the CIA on an illegal one-man mission to kill an apostate US naval commander, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). "totally insane" but successfully running a private border war from its base in Cambodia, a neutral and therefore unlimited country. <br /> <br /> The whole narrated story of what Willard sees and does while manning the Da Nang River through an undisciplined and terrified marine patrol vessel to kill Kurtz is a great metaphor for excess, decadence and finally the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche. If we don't understand anything, and we can't control it, wipe it out. Kurtz finally made it known. <br /> <br /> Unless you pay full attention to every emotional gesture, every word of the dialogue between starring, especially in the scene where the two of them alone in Kurtz's darkened Lair, you will be one of the central themes of this incredible movie miss. Kurtz's subtle deal with his officer, his one-sided "surrender" in return for Willard who agreed (he cut) to tell Kurtz's son (another metaphor for us, the next generation, the one watching the movie) the truth about all the horrors they both saw in Vietnam is widening things. The connection between the two men, while Kurtz Willard cross-examined, with his own horror stories, interlaced, is incredible, genius, genius, film. The closing text of the ritual battle of a sacrificial bull is the single most powerful symbol. Coppolla deliberately or not made the ultimate anti-war statement, one that has to resonate over the centuries.
