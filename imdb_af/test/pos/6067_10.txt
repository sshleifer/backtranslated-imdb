I just saw the last episode, No. 32 (although the site says there were only 30 episodes) and I have to comment on the fact that this series was really good and I highly recommend it to anyone who is crime / cop enjoy stories. All 32 are presumably based on facts with information at the end of each episode of court sentences committed to the perpetrators. It was sometimes a harsh, well-regarded, credible and daring one to say, entertaining series. The fact that the forces in Denmark decided to dissolve the unit was almost unbelievable because they did their job so well and at least never got a man in the series! It's a definite 10/10 for me.
