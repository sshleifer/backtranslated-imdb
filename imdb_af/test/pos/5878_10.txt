While watching an everyday modern movie (The Runaway Bride) at my granddaughter (age 22), she asked me, "Since you've watched movies since 1938, what's the best movie of your lifetime?" Boy! What a choice it is! It made me think the whole summer and I attacked some movies before making my decision. It is "the best years of our lives". This movie has no errors. This is a movie in which each of the small characters shares and dialogue is essential to the whole story. There is not a single role in the film that can be left out. The young girl's fixation with her brothers' lack of hands, the man who comes home to young adult children who grew up without him and with different ideas, portraying a young man whose only responsibility was as a soda the leader became a group of men, and awarded medals for his action. A women who has to adapt to the man whose life has been away from her for years. The realization of the people in their safety has safe homes from the sacrifices made by these ordinary men on their behalf. Look at the life of love and life with a man without hands. A parent first looks and responds to their son's new malformations. A man decided in time to take life and death, and had to return to the omission of a conservative bank's loan structure. It is not sympathetic, tearing, heartbeat. THIS IS REAL LIFE! It couldn't be depicted otherwise. This, my friends, is how it was !! It can easily be considered a documentary. In this day of color film, please do not be turned off by the black and white, as this is one of the best B / W filming, editing and directing you will ever see. The casting was perfect. If I could, I would make it mandatory for anyone who takes history, filmmaking, creative writing, sociology, family council, or psychology to view and report this beautiful example of filmmaking.
