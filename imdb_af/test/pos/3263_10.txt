If you enjoy movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, you'll love two hands. It has the same kind of black humor that has passed with it and will entertain you throughout the film. Like Pulp Fiction, it has the crazy scenarios with which the characters come in and how they handle it. Along with Gallipoli and picnic at Hanging Rock, it must be one of the best Australian movies I've seen. It also faces a young Heath Ledger before becoming really big in the states. <br /> <br /> It's a terribly underrated movie that I believe is as good as Pulp Fiction and Size. You have to see it!
