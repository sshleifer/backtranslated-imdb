It's an excellent movie I've watched since I was 6 years old with my great sister. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over again and still laugh, smile and cry every time without ever being surprised like other movies. It is a movie that will last forever through generations. i love it :) when i fall from 1-10 in my case i will easily rate 9.9 each time. <br /> <br /> It's a film about changing a girl (baby) and her first boy friend (Johnny), their relationships within the family, the changes in baby and Johnny's worldview during their relationship . br /> DIRTY DANCING WILL ONLY LIVE AS A TEMPORARY CLASSES. Thank you, sorry, but just for the brief comment.
