This movie was one of the best I've ever seen. Just the other day I was reminded of this movie by something on TV. It came back to me like a flooded dam. I've never been touched by a movie more than this one. After the movie was over, I couldn't stop crying for about 2 hours. No movie has ever moved me that far. I was 15 at the time of the movie and didn't see it, but I hope I can find a copy to buy so I can see it whenever I want. If someone suggests you see this movie with them, go .... you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Peggy Fries
