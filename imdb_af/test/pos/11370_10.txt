I saw this mini-series when I was in high school. I remember this as absolutely brilliant and compelling. At the time, I didn't know any of the British actors in the series, but have since learned that some of today's stars have fulfilled it, including Sean Connery (the original James Bond under many other roles), Judi Dench (Queen Elizabeth in) Shakespeare in love "under many other roles" and Eilene Atkins (probably best known for creating "Upstairs / Downstairs" but also great in many plays). Like the other commentator, I want to see it again. I'm sure the production stays timeless, and I hope it will be released on VHS or DVD. If you get the chance to see it, don't miss it.
