It is absolutely the best 80's cartoon ever, perhaps the best cartoon of all time. It all had action, adventure, excitement and more ... <br /> <br /> I can't imagine how difficult it was for the Ruby-Spears company to make this amazing cartoon, there are many spend money for this masterpiece of work and it was worth it. For example, only the fencing scenes were difficult because I wouldn't call the 1980s for a good technology year, with computers like now in the world in which we live, so the fencing scenes are excellent! <br /> <br /> The cartoons will never be the same as before, so I hope they will all be released on DVD especially The Centurions, as this is my favorite. I have the entire full set of 65 episodes on DVD-r, but it's not the same, because if they are released on DVD, the people in the world will be able to buy it and watch the DVDs in almost every store that means to fans. My good friend Ted made this petition to either get the show back on TV or better on DVD, that's when we get many requests to get them back on DVD. <br /> <br /> Please help us by signing the petition. at http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html
