The Further Adventures of Mum and Dad Kettle almost took off seamlessly where the egg and I stopped. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles, a new writing team and director are introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was the producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Ketel. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses, the focus of the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Mrs. Birdie Hicks for the first prize at the quilt for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I. The prize money of the quilt match had to be used to send Tom Kettle to the college. In this movie, Tom comes back as a college graduate. <br /> <br /> There are two plots interwoven in this movie. One is the comedy of the simple mountain family moving in a modern modern house. The other is a light moral game about how children become children as they grow up. Pa Kettle (Percy Kilbride) wanted a free tobacco package to enter a game and eventually win a home. His disappointment not getting the free tobacco pack is played for the laugh. When Dad plays dynamite, he is completely unaware of the explosion. Kilbride never fled into the scene, as the blast of the blast fell around him. He played the part to perfection. In his autobiography, Jack Benny said how impressive he was with Percy Kilbride's deadpan delivery. Kilbride took the comedian to a high level of perfection. <br /> <br /> Mom (Marjorie Main) and Dad move into the new home with modern conveniences that Mum and Dad confuse almost as much as they help them. Mom fits much faster than Dad. Included in the modern facilities is a television, a very new household item in 1949. Moving walls, hidden beds and plumbing are used as comic props, but attention is paid to Mom and Dad, never the props themselves. <br /> <br /> Tom Kettle (Richard Long) meets Kim Parker (Meg Randall), a magazine writer who believes hygiene and environment are essential for kids to succeed as adults. Tom is a bright, self-made man who contradicts the theory that success only comes from a pristine environment. This topic is briefly discussed in a few screens but left to decrease. It was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise erratic movie. <br /> <br /> If the Kettles move out of the old house to go to a new home, it will be a disaster if it's not true for the characters themselves. Mom was practical, just as she was in the Egg and I. Dad was the fish from the water that provided the best comedy. He never felt at home in the new home, but the real location of a comfortable bed would never worry him.
