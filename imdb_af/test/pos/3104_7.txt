I have this movie on a collection of cheap B-movies. It's not restored, in fact the sound was difficult to discern for the first few minutes. <br /> <br /> Initially, it looked like a typical haunted movie, and much like the predecessor of Clue, Murder through death, home on haunted house, and so on. <br /> <br /> About half an hour into the movie, the storyline takes a very interesting turn - and it goes from a clich√© melodrama to something completely different, and far more entertaining than I initially thought. <br /> <br /> Check it out, it's a lot of fun, even though the long cuts and wider shots (and almost a lack of music score) make it a bit crunchy by today's standards.
