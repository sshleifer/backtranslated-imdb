It's a movie that everyone in Sweden has to watch. The film shows the political riots that took place in Gothenburg in a new perspective in 2001. It contains interviews with those who have been found guilty of getting those people first chance after the riots, telling their side of the story and why they think the world can be a much better place to live and share. I react emotionally when I see it, as I feel just as crazy about how people were treated during the riots, but also for the riots. <br /> <br /> I hope as much as possible to see this movie, as it really reminds you: Is it possible? In Sweden, a democracy, in 2001?
