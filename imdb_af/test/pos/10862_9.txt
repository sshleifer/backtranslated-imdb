This wonderful 3-piece BBC production is one of the loveliest love stories I've seen for a while. The actresses show a very high level of talent, especially Rachael Stirling and Nan Astley. She is funny, seductive and cute. The love shows and the nearby kiss are very erotic, regardless of their sexual preference. <br /> <br /> The characters are well defined and very credible. I think it's a by-product of a good adaptation of a well-written novel. <br /> <br /> A truly remarkable, fast-paced, fast-paced drama to some boring (but essential) scenes in the beginning. <br /> <br /> My vote: 9/10
