From the beginning the movie I laughed at trying to keep quiet so that I woke no one in the house. It didn't go so much by the rest of the movie, I didn't laugh at everything "out loud" funny, yet I found some things very funny. Initially, I had to laugh when he dropped the very clever Hand Grenade in his sleeve. Then there are scenes where you will just smile, as when the hairdresser in an apartment falls through a roof, I see it is funny, but in today's days and times that were done a lot, it did not feel original, though By that time I was sure it was. I loved Hynkels (Hitlers) with the beautiful, clear English translation. The final scene is much discussed, as it is absolutely true and so intelligently built. Although the film is sixty and eight years old, the last scene still applies today. If it doesn't show how well a writer Chaplin is, I don't know what it is. The particular scene in this scene was pretty good, the Barber conveyed the message perfectly and made you realize the serious nature of the movie while enjoying the humorous side. <br /> <br /> Another feature of this movie is the fact that it is such a brave movie that feels almost ahead of time. Of course, Chaplin did not know what would happen after 1940, he was not aware of the Holocaust (of course). He also went on record to say whether he was aware that he would not want to make this film. The fact that this film is so anti-Hitler is interesting, it is more interesting that it was not anti-Germany that would be very easy in those times. Chaplin could easily make it a propaganda movie, but did something. more, he made an honest movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend someone interested in this movie to watch it, as well as those who studied Hitler and World War II to watch this movie. It is entertaining to say the least, it doesn't have a boring, old mind that some movies of the time did. Unlike most "comedies" this movie actually has a message you want to bring, look at this movie, you'd be better off if you saw it.
