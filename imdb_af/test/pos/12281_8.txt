The whole town of Blackstone is scared because they have Bret Dixon's brother - and he comes back for revenge! At least that's what they think. <br /> <br /> A great Johnny Hallyday and a very interesting, early Mario Adorf star in this Italo-Western film filmed in the Alps. <br /> <br /> Bret Dixon returns to Blackstone to investigate why his brother was in line. He is a loner and a firearm, but everyone is afraid of him - the Mexican bandits (fighting the Gringos who own their land!) As well as the "decent" civilians that Britt's brother has hit. They cut him because they thought he had stolen their money instead of bringing it to Dallas for the safety of the bank. But it's just half the truth, as we find out in the course of these psychologically interesting westerns. <br /> <br /> But beware, it's kind of a depressing movie, as everyone seems to be guilty in one way or another and definitely everyone's bad ... <br /> <br /> Yet I enjoy it a lot and give it an 8/10. Strangely, just under 5 people voted for this movie for January 12, 2002.
