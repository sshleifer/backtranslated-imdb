In all sorts of ways, this film defines the essence of everything I love cinema, in terms of capturing those strange, elusive moments of unguarded truth. In other ways, it is undoubtedly an amateur-like, unconcerned result of junkies wandering self-assertively with a camera. Ultimately, it comes somewhere between pure brilliance and unshakiness (grateful, much more so to the former and the latter). Part of me just wants to reward it because it is absolute innovation and moments of pure sublimity, but at the same time I can't completely ignore the occasionally horrible horrible "acting" and openly poor production values. Initially, the editing seems overwhelmingly sloppy and unnecessarily distracting (or perhaps just unfairly "innovative"), but after a while I got used to it, which is ultimately the true sign or a movie on its own terms or not. I think the answer basically summarizes my all-around feelings for the movie. That is, despite being unforgivable, on a whole it works very well. And if nothing else, a movie like this really shows how fake and confronted the faux documentary, shaky-camera style can sometimes be when applied as naturally pure for effect (as in films such as the otherwise admirable Roger Dodger) . Here, the aesthetics are clearly derived from the necessity of the filming situation, and are not only used arbitrarily to cool it.
