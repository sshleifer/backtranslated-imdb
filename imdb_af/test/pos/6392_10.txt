My wife and kids were and still are the best comedy series ever made on TV. I really enjoyed it and everyone in you. I still look at the repetitions. The Wayans brittle. everyone must somehow come together in a comedy show. My wife and kids were a comedy that the whole family could see and you don't get it very often. Is there nothing we can do to make it happen again? do anything to have that comedy show again! 1 Damon Wayans must come back! I would really like Damon Wayans to die or make another comedy like this one with the help of the entire Wayans family. I was really sad when it ended that way and I hope they will be more in the future. Brilliant comedy, great stuff! Kind regards, DezMo
