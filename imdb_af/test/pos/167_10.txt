Bloody Birthday plays on the alleged innocence of children and shows them bloodthirsty monsters. Steven (Andy Freeman), Curtis (Billy Jayne, credited as Billy Jacoby), and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy), were all born on the same day during a solar eclipse. Apart from the birthday, they also share a love of murder (and they are not picky about whoever kills them). Young Billy, Elizabeth and Andy play the parts of these emotional monsters very well, but they know when to put on the charm. But they can't all deceive. It's a total good horror, it's not too unrealistic, there are a few good moments of stress and the kids portrayed the roles well (the adults are quite hammy). I'll say it's worth seeing (I have a copy myself).
