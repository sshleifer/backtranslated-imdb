I went to see Glenn McQuaid's "I Sell The Dead" in the North American premiere at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. Since it's the second worldwide show, I didn't quite know what to expect from this movie, especially since I didn't see the short film that inspired this big-screen adjustment. <br /> <br /> I start with a slightly more extensive plot of synopsis, without giving away spoilage. <br /> <br /> This movie is about Arthur Blake, how he became a tomb robber and the interesting and supernatural discoveries he and his mentor discovered. <br /> <br /> The costume and set design in this movie was excellent. I was surprised to hear that the whole movie was shot in and around New York. The costumes were very accurate at the time, bringing you as a viewer into the minds of the time. This movie works just as well as a period piece, as it makes a horror comedy. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the two leaders was very humid. They played each other and acted with ease. The dialogue between the two was very well written, with Glenn including his comic touch even in tense situations. <br /> <br /> The story is very comprehensive and the ball is going on from the beginning. I will compare it to a visual page spinner, and always wonder what will happen next. The characters themselves are all very lively and unique, adding different emotional layers to the movie itself. <br /> <br /> All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone in the mood for some dark humor, with a bit of horror mixed in. <br /> <br /> 9/10
