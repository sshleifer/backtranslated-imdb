I came back from Morocco, where my father was attached to the German embassy when the film came out in Europe; took all my girlfriends to see it, show them the beauty of the country, where Jimi played - and remains; where the hippies stopped after leaving Ibiza and before joining Goa. Sean Combs recently celebrated at a friend's restaurant in Marrakech. The Djema el Fna was much wilder in those days than it is now; The Stones went there earlier, Brian took up in Tangiers; So it's memories and family entertainment and I'm glad my son will get to know northern Africa watching this movie. Candice Bergen looks beautiful and oo7 / Connery is really funny, and Teddy Roosevelt as played by Brian Keith very impressive.
