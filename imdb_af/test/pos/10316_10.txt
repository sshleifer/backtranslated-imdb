There are one or two other Shemp era shorts that I would like to have more (ie SCRAMBLED BRAINS), but I think one can say without much argument that Shemp is giving his biggest comedian performance as a stew, after joining the team again. in 1946. <br /> <br /> Scene for play, this episode barely comes from: Professor Shemp Howard's voice lessons with the glass-tearing Dee Green, to his useless efforts to win a woman's hand in marriage (this is your little snookums ... will you marry me * click * to the unceasing finish, it fails to keep me in stitches. <br /> <br /> I'd call references that immortal scene with Miss Hopkins (the always lovely Christine McIntyre). Btw, is she not rather underwear and is it nice to say goodbye to the man she thinks she is "Cousin" Basil? Who knows, maybe the real Basil is a "very" distant cousin, which makes it legal in some states (as far as I know). >: -]
