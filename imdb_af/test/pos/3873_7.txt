I watched this movie from the lack of anything else. Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show stars. <br /> <br /> I won't give a spoil to the plot line or outcome, but most characters have at least some value loss. Until the last moment I didn't know how it would come out. Often you can add the formula and predict a story direction. I couldn't do it with this movie. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it as one of the finer movies of this genre.
