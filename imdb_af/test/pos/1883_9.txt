I saw it last week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. I thought it was wonderful. Almost everything I would expect from a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie. It's nice and very funny. Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. The plot is shaky, an American businessman goes to Bulgaria and dies. Stacy Keach plays a crazy scientist who rescues Bruce Campbell by entering half the brain of an ex-KGB twisted cabbie. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film avenging his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent. The movie has all the great Bruce Campbell stick and humor. The movie is somewhat predictable, I knew the woman was killed that she would share a brain with her killer. But I didn't see this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar winning script. I was going to see it because it was a Sci-fi movie by Bruce Campbell and I was not in the least disappointed. I recommend that you see him on his book tour or wait and watch it on the sci-fi channel next month. Although he said before the movie the Sci-Fi channel cut out some of the movies to make it TV-friendly. If you're a fan of Bruce, I highly recommend it.
