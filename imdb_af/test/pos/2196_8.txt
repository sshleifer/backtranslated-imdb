Last year I fell in love with Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd, so I wanted to see the other versions of this musical and I found this at the library. Although I think Burton's is the best, probably because I enjoy the movie better than theater, it's still a good production of the story. I didn't see any other versions, but I'm trying to get my hands on them. <br /> <br /> Having seen Johnny Depp as Todd, it's hard for me to think of someone else, but George Hearn does a fantastic job. Angela Lansbury is wonderful, as always and all the singing is fantastic. I sang myself. It's a play you don't want to miss, but try to see it before you see the movie version so you won't have a biased view like me.
