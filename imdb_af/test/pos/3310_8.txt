It is interesting to see how late 1950's society is portrayed in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (the time has not changed so many men, but has "sexual harassment") and women are just in the workplace until they find a man and sit down. Some of the dialogue is fervent, yet it is charming in an innocent, passive way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing the best on the soundtrack. I want to jump right into some scenes, filmed on N.Y. streets, about 1959 and experience a time that I only saw on film and in pictures. Some scenes in this movie reminded me of Melanie Griffith's "Working Girl". Especially when Hope Lange (who is a cross between Grace Kelly & Dolores Heart) is bombed in the attractive Stephen Boyd's apartment, he throws her in and just looks at her sleep (like Melanie, she wants to know if there is "something" between they happened the next day). Joan Crawford is certainly comparable to Sigourney Weaver's horrible female boss, except she was zealous (with a soft core), but Sigourney's character was sweet on the outside and awful on the inside. I upset it when the Suzy Parker character (Gregg) started out as an independent woman with career goals to be an actress, who apparently didn't need a man to finish her. She becomes a stalker / lunatic / utility job when she drops the man in which she falls in love to manage her bananas after he is finished with her. I loved the character, Mary Agnes, the office gossip, with her thick New Yawk accent. If you enjoy movies like Valley of the Dolls, you'll love this one as well.
