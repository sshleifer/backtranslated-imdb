The story of how the (communist) leader liberating the Congo from Belgian imperialism was eliminated by Western powers by Mobutu. A story of struggle and injustice, of hope and the search for freedom. The story can be one of any African country. A very moving movie with images full of symbolism and beauty. If you only have to see one foreign film this year, see this one.
