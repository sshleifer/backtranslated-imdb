... The reason I enjoy this movie so much is because of the spirit it has. It's a brilliant summer camp movie, so the jokes aren't in a lasting way, making one character a permanent villain of ridiculous. Pranks take place, but you get the feeling that the various fall guys will be able to look back and laugh. <br /> <br /> It's an extra special bonus when the ringmaster of all these jolly japes is Bill Murray. For me, he is still regarded as the comedy god without a peer when he gets the chance to release. No one is better off generating a feeling of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone. The tone of the entire movie has the same style as its leading man, founded with a great opening scene that shows the Murray way of preparation for the day. Everything is stupid, yes, but more important than behaving like an adult is having a lot of good-natured fun. "Meatballs" promise such and ultimately deliver a nutritious watch.
