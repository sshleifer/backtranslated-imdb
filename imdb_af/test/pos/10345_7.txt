Nynke is a classic filmed film in the same style as the Oscar winning movie Character (1997). But this comparison prompted me to add that the latter was quite exciting ... <br /> <br /> Certainly, Nynke is a beautiful historical and costume drama (with fantastic acting by Monic Hendrickx!) growth of 'Nynke van Hichtum' in her marriage to Pieter Jelles Troelstra. The subtitle of this movie is a love story. So it starts and ends with their marriage. <br /> <br /> But that's where the director makes a big mistake! Nynke's exciting, independent life began when the marriage ended. She wrote several children's books and traveled all over the world. What a good life she lived. But Pieter Verhoeff puts Nynke back in the conventional trams that pressed her and that she struggled: the thought that her life only extended her marriage to Troelstra is none other than the mother of their children. <br /> <br /> Let's hope for Nynke II!
