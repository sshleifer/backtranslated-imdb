This is a horror story in order. But maybe not as you know it. The right monsters in this movie are people. While the monsters are human and prey. As strange as it may sound, I see it as "Monsters Inc" for horror movie fans. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the effects of an STD horror movie, the monsters are like any monster-based movie, the Gore is there, there is even a shooter in the form of dr. Decker (played by David Cronenberg; I see flash of Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane here in Batman Begins - or vice versa?). And this is Decker and who are the bad guys. The monsters mainly want to pursue their own business, and intimidating people are more or less misleading to join the community. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie, you really grow like the very small monsters (and the dog) - not perhaps what you expected from the first few scenes.
