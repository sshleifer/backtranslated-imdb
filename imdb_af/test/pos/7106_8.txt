Dracula (John Carradine) visits dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens) who believes that everything can be cured by science. He wants Edelamn to heal his vampirism - Edelman agrees. Then Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) appears for a cure for her turn into a werewolf. Thr Frankenstein monster has also been discovered, but does nothing really. <br /> <br /> Very ambitious plot for a Universal Horror movie from the 1940s. Healing the monsters through science is actually an interesting idea. Also this movie has beautiful sets (LOVE where the castle lives as a doctor), tons of atmosphere, is very well aimed (big use of shadows) and has pretty good special effects. <br /> <br /> The play is all good except Carradine - he tries, but I can never accept him as Dracula. Also Lionel Atwill pops in (as always) the head of the police. It's almost forgotten and cheated as a silly movie, but I think it's very good. This is also the last time the Universal Samples have been taken seriously - the next film was in 1948 in "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein". It's a good movie, but the accent is more on comedy. <br /> <br /> The only real mistake here is a BIG plot for 67 minutes and some gaps in logic: Why does Dracula try a beautiful Miliza (Martha bites O'Driscoll) when he is healed? And why (and how) do Doctor Frankenstin get into his castle? Yet it is small complaints. Recommended.
