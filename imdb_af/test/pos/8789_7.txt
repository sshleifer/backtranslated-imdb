NO SPOILERS !! <br /> <br /> After Hitchcock's successful first American film, Rebecca based on Daphne DuMarier's sumptuous novel of Gothic romance and plot, he returned to some of the more well-known themes of his early British era - wrong identity and espionage . As the US established in World War II and the large-scale "civil war" of civilians building aircraft, weapons and other necessary militia, the exciting movie entertainment business began to eliminate paranoid and often jingoist thrillers with war themes. These excited people often involved networks of fraudulent and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good, law-abiding citizens. Kenner the director was at home in this espionage genre, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption, war-time sabotage and a helpless hero in a coincidence of coincidence and wrong identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp white of literary stomach Dorothy Parker (during her short stint in Hollywood before returning to her Bohemian roots in NYC), the author of the writer, was a perfect fit for Hitchcock its sensitivity. <br /> <br /> This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25-year-old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who met sabotage at the Los Angeles aircraft factory at the new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd).

These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of useful freaks and a popular billboard model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane), who falls in love with the worst crisis of his life as well as national security! Of course, in the country of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by alleged saboteur Barry, falls to her prisoner, adding romantic tension to the mix. <br /> <br /> In good shape for this outing, Hitchcock breaks a national network of old parents, average joes, and respectful businessmen, who double as secret terrorist agents, harboring criminals, explode guns and bombs to exploit things. move. It's a terrific plot that takes its time forward and once ignites, ending in one of Hitchcock's more memorable finals.

While Saboteur is not one of Hitchcock's best-known films, it is a popular B-movie that is definitely solid and enjoyable with many clever plot moves and as usual - awesome Hitchcock villains. Remember to watch Hitchcock's cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the movie. Hitchcock's original idea was shot (he fights in sign language with his 'deaf' wife). It was driven by the Bureau of Standards and Practices, which was afraid to break the deaf!
