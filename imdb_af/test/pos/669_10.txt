The fact that there was so much fuss is ironic, as the whole point of the program was to highlight the way the media deals with such taboo subjects such as pedophilia. The newspaper set, the suits, the smugglers, the men on the scene scream about things you can see behind them, the senseless cgi graphics and statistics, the whole thing was a satire, a very funny satire. The way c-list celebrity's will say anything whatsoever when their agent tells them, will be good for their career ("there is no evidence for that, but it's scientific fact"). It may be difficult to watch (with milly dowler and Cambridgeshire girls as well as 9/11), but satire is supposed to be challenging, and we shouldn't be afraid to stand up against the blatant scars and head media, just because it's a delicate matter. How this show failed to win any TV awards, because it is intelligence, observation, courage, acting and thought problem, is shameful, but if you see it, it won't surprise you.
