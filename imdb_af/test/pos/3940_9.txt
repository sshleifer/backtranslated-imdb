After the end I didn't feel that I knew the man much better. But I spent a very good moment watching many of the best moments of his movies again; and my respect for the very talented actor and great professional has increased tenfold. Interestingly, the film shows how Cooper's career can be parallel to the evolution of US society before and after World War II. Two of the wonderful moments are the time when Cooper has to answer right over communism in the film world. And when James Stewart (a very big one) received a grant one month before his death, Cooper. I'm not a crying pot, but ... it was a close one! Look, if you can: it's so much worth it. ... if you like Cooper, it is. Or an older America ...
