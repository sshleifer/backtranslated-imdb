"What do you dream of? Hoot Gibson ... Howdy Doody? I'm talking about the * theater *!" [Harry Crystal] <br /> <br /> Nothing beats a good stage show ... nothing! And Harry Crystal lives that faith. A Stage actor who is still waiting for his big break, brings Harry the magic of live theater to a small town and Artie Shoemaker (TOM HULCE). " A young man with big dreams (but only knew it until he met. Harry). <br /> <br /> With scenes and songs from many of America's classic musicals ... The Lips, The Ooge carry both the ups and downs of the people who take us to a fantasy land for 2 hours. but who manages to keep that magic in their hearts all day long! <br /> <br /> Like Artie ... once you've seen those lips, those eyes ... "You're addicted, kid!" [Harry Crystal]
