I'm not a big fan of movie music. "Annie" was a stage show I loved, but the movie was a flop. The "Phantom Of The Opera Movies" (and I believe there are three) did not match the Weber lineup. But I loved it. The DVD will take a place of honor under my "governor". Although it is a movie adaptation, it captures the taste and atmosphere of live theater. Bette Midler, always a surprise, is just exceptional in this role. There is good music, lots of laughter and even a tear or two. I saw most of the great music of the eighties and nineties. Somehow I missed this one, so there is no comparison to make. But if it's revived, I'll be in line for tickets first! But this movie is so good, I'll be in a strange position to wonder if the stage production will measure up to the movie.
