This is one of those movies that is much underestimated. Again I vote for an underrated movie. This movie has a good story line, maybe a little bit colored, but it can happen. Sean Astin (one of my favorite actors) shows us a good performance again. The man does a good job in acting, but is never recognized for his roles. He has done well since the goonies. Not just him, but Louis Gosset JR. Do a swelling job. I thought maybe this movie would have made more money in theaters, but who cares for money anyway. Around this is a good movie that you will sometimes have at the seat and the plot will move the movie. I enjoyed this movie and hopefully the rest of you too.
