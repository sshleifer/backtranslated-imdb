Thank you, Mario Van Peebles, for telling us not only the existence of black cowboys, but giving a compelling story that was easy to follow. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot, background, music and talent were all. It was great that you used so many African American artists to tell the story of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good guy? <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie to anyone wishing to broaden their thinking. It's an excellent movie and I feel privileged to see it. Hopefully you will feel the same.
