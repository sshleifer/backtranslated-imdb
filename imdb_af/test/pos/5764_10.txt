It may not be Oscar material, but it was a very funny movie. I was always a fan of Eddie (Edmondson) & Richie (Mayall). "Bottom" and "Young Ones" were legendary TV series, and it was about the time they made a movie. Some of the stuff they get is brilliant, from the pencil to the back to the rubber pants, as well as the infamous line Richie says when he falls and a candle he wears goes into his eye. He says to Eddie, "Cherry In The Eye, Cherry In The Eye," and Eddie was the simplest he was, sticking the candle he was wearing in his eye. Can't forget when Eddie is on his motorcycle and he has to urinate. It was a great comedy, not to be serious at all, but the film didn't have a ridiculous ending. <br /> <br /> Overall, an excellent comedy, full of laughter, and very fake green vomit. A 9/10. <br /> <br />
