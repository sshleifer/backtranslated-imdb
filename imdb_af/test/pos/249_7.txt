Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL du jour - she is one of the dancing girls in Danny McGuire's club, the most special one according to Danny (Gene Kelly) and almost everyone who comes over her. For example, take the Vanity magazine magnet John Coudair (Otto Kruger): captivated by Rusty's agreement with her grandmother Maribelle (who also played Hayworth in flashbacks), whom he devoted devotedly to falling in love with her, trying to get his youth revived by determining what he thought went wrong between himself and Maribelle. He doesn't believe Danny can give Red happiness, or whatever she needs to be, he even gets Danny himself. When Rusty shoots like Vanity's 'Cover Girl', Danny drives her in the arms and arms of Noel Wheaton (Lee Bowman). So what happens when Danny returns to town with his sidekick Genius (Phil Silvers) in tow, just to discover that Rusty marries Wheaton? <br /> <br /> As a musical, COVER GIRL benefits from the beautiful score and songs written. by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, including the Oscar-nominated 'Long Ago and Far Away' (possibly one of the most beautiful ballads ever written and beautifully, sweetly sung as a duet by Hayworth and Kelly), Maribelle's number 'Sure Thing 'the more dull' Poor John 'is not a Core / Gershwin collaboration and' Put Me To The Test '. Of course, the dance is top notch, because Gene Kelly had more than just a hand in choreography. It shows in the simplest dances, for example, his dance with Hayworth, "Put Me To The Test," or the joyful, exuberant "Make Way for Tomorrow" song (performed by Danny, Rusty and Genius). the reaction shadows. Gen's character told the policeman in the title number in Singin 'In the Rain. In particular, Kelly achieved a technological and artistic coup with the Alter-Ego dance. Like his successors in ANCHORS AWEIGH and an AMERICAN PARIS (Jerry the Mouse and the 16-minute ballet respectively), this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity that Kelly has brought to modern film music: the movie medium wants to use For current dances that could not be shown on stage, and years before CGI, Kelly insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly meet him in talent and style - himself. The number is barely five minutes long, but it (and Kelly's genius) still takes the breath away, even sixty years. That's why I watched DAY GIRL, and if it's nothing else, this dance is really worth it. <br /> <br /> You can see that a lot of money was sown on COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworth - not that. she doesn't deserve it. Testify of the scene when Rusty Broadway hits - the big screen showing all the different girls' cover gives room for a staggering big boost for Rusty's entrance. Hayworth is indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on the show in the movie, and she is dancing with a style and grace that is almost worthy of Kelly. (Very little of Kelly's co-stars have that honor.) She is spectacular in some scenes, for example, her drunk scene when John and Wheaton come to see her from Joe's. <br /> <br /> For some reason, her performance still lacks the spark of greatness that will help COVER GIRL overcome its general curse of mediocrity. The curse is only lifted when Gene Kelly is on the screen (dancing or no), or when Eve Arden as John's long-suffering secretary "Stonewall" coincides with another cut or clever observation. As the movie finally belongs to Hayworth, Kelly and Arden can't save it as a whole. That's not to say the movie is bad - it's not. It's nice, with good songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to look at. But it's just not a classic. However, the dance is classic - so COVER GIRL looks at it and you won't regret it.
