It has been for the cult icon Bruce Campbell for many years to get this project off the ground - but he has finally, it's here - and what a great piece of shock it is! Look at the plot; It sounds like two things. A good base for a very foolish B-movie, and a shameless apology for Bruce Campbell for what he does best. Evil Dead II-style slap humor, and this film delivers to both scores. The man with the screaming brain is cartoon nonsense throughout - but there are some fantastic scenes, and it is almost impossible to get bored with this movie. Bruce Campbell writes, directs, produces and stars in this film - and while not quite Citizen Kane, it has to be said to be an achievement for the man who is best known for fighting his own hand in a cabin. The plot follows American businessman William Cole on a business trip to Bulgaria with his girlfriend. The trip, however, is disgusting when he, his girlfriend and his taxi driver die; thanks to the same woman. The mad scientist Stacy Keach is about to join Cole and the taxi driver's brain. and we have a cult spot on our hands. <br /> <br /> The first half hour or so is entertaining and contains some laughs; but once the main plot point is executed; the movie really comes up. Bruce makes the scenario optimal in all kinds of stupid situations, from changing his clothes in a rubbish bin, to deciding (with the taxi driver in his brain) to eating in a restaurant. The humor is mostly of the slapstick variety, and anyone who has enjoyed Evil Dead II (who has to be anyone who saw it) will undoubtedly enjoy it. It seems as if Campbell is playing a little too much with his entire project, but if you have opted in and doesn't see Bruce doing what he does best, disappointment will come from it. In addition, no respect for the man; but he has never been the actor with the largest series. Despite being fun; The movie is not nice, as it sometimes gets a little too stupid. and there's a whole sub-plot with a robot I didn't like; But generally, The Man With the Screaming Brain is a movie that we regret not seeing too much. The film is an all-out, no shots excluded, B-movie; and it deserves respect for it as nothing else.
