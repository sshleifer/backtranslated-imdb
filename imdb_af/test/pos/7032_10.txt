I watched this movie for the first time last night and I enjoyed every aspect of it: the dance, the acting, the dialogue, the plot, the script and the whole atmosphere this movie created. I would highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Gray gives a wonderful and first class performance in her role as Frances (Baby) Houseman. She has a natural ability and flair for dance and she is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor. But what's wonderful about Baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension for her character. It's not just a movie about dance, but the scriptwriters have also given us a chance to see Baby Treatment with the different emotions and feelings she experiences throughout the movie and enable us to understand how her interaction with others at the camp changes her life. Gray portrays her character with such realism and poignancy that you feel bitter for Baby, as she experiences everything she does in this movie. <br /> <br /> Patrick Swayze is wonderful in his role as Johnny and succeeds in making his character come alive. He gives his character a comprehensive personality, strong appeal and good depth. The chemistry between Swayze and Gray is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this movie. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Rhodes is wonderful in her role as Penny and her portrayal of the affliction she is experiencing is truly powerful and carries a frightening dimension to the film. The other members of the supporting film Jerry Orbach and the late Mark Cantor deserve a special mention here. Also give wonderful and imaginative performances that give this movie an extra dimension of high quality acting and credibility that is great to experience. The dance is wonderful and first class of all involved. <br /> <br /> The writing and interaction between all the main characters is intriguing and empowers the viewer. The plot, although very predictable, is given more than enough life and vitality to make this movie successful. <br /> <br /> The great choice of music in this movie also offers a real magical atmosphere and a very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all the different scenes. <br /> <br /> "Dirty Dancing" is a truly powerful, beautiful and very attractive movie that touches you deeply and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance. I highly recommend it
