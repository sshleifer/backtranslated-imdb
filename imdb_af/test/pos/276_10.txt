I had a half-dose when I was watching a late-night selection of short films - but sitting up straight the first frames of "I Shout Love" and not putting my eyes away for his full, short, perfect length. With incredible insured pacing and performances, this film keeps its funny / sad / insightful tone throughout. The credits at the end went so fast and in such a small type I had to go online to find the person responsible for this masterpiece. What a pleasant surprise to see the name of Sarah Polley, a great actress too rarely seen. <br /> <br /> Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) turn into riches, becoming performances as a couple in breaking arrows. As they rework Tessa's favorite moments from their time, both actors unveil dimensions of their characters and their relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talents - and to the director / writer's skills. The film creates a moving story with deliberate moments and breathing. <br /> <br /> "I'm Screaming Love" is undoubtedly one of the greatest and most memorable short films I will ever see. It has white, heart and beautiful originality. It matters.
