This movie, I'd like to say, was absolutely awesome. I can see how many people would think it's just a shock movie. It's not quite untrue, but Chuck Palahniuk's books are so much of shockfiction. One of my favorite movies of all time, Bijo no Harawata, is a certain kind of immovable movie that you can have just about any reaction. It is frightening, funny, stupid, coarse, full of the best material and for some people, that stirs up. The time I saw it was with my friend, and his mother brought it to him to see it. He said it was just a few Japanese movies, but I saw so much more of it. It's bad, yes, but it has a certain kind of poignancy to be beautiful too. As the director says himself, it is a shock story made for some reason. It's like atrophy. If you soften the audiences, then the whole human race is soft. I think it's a good philosophy, and I agree with that one hundred percent. Byo no Harawata is the type of movie that rapes the gang of hell out of fitness, yogurt, and all these new-wave things.
