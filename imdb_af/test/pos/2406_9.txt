I wish the series didn't end so quickly. Although the acting may not be the greatest in the world, it ends in a positive note and teaches the morals and values ​​to the viewers. Hilary Swank did a good job of portraying a high school student who lost her parents, etc. Miyagi was great as in the previous 3 !! If you're not in the happy end, this movie, like the previous 3 in the series, isn't for you. This day in which we live, you cannot see enough about the bad guys they deserve and the good guys come out. The Bible teaches that good will always prevails over evil. This is exactly what happens in this one. It's a great family movie. Please check if you haven't done so yet.
