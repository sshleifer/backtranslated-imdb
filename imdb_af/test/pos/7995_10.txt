Why is it better? Because this is true of the dark vision of the comic. Because the images are inventive and, unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos in this one. The first one had too much of Jack Nicholson's shtick, too much Prince music, and an uncomfortable "romance". Here, instead of one villain, there are three. No Robert Wuhl, and the front lady is more than just a pretty face. In fact, Pfeiffer is the # 1 attraction of this movie. Her transformation is what drives the current theme, on the verge of common sense and madness, good and evil. She is really scary. These costumes and make-up are excellent. Danny DeVito's Penguin is inspired and anxious, not just a nut. His circus gangs are the one element of comic enlightenment (except that giant duck). Max Shrek is the only character I want to put down, Walken is very hammy as the ruthless businessman. Danny Elfman's score is perfect as usual, and the Siouxie and Banshees song (Face to Face) is easily the best of any of the songs from any of the movies, a perfect match of musical artist and movie soundtrack. The least of the movies, it's macabre, doesn't blow and requires second and third views like a fun park ride. Bravo Tim Burton and throw!
