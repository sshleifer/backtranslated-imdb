If you read about this movie, you want to cringe. I've seen it many times and yet I blame myself! So what is the attraction here? I think it is the indifference of romance to me. I find it very refreshing to have a strange link between the NYC Jimmy-Breslin-like columnist and a poor ballerina. You feel ashamed of Paul Sorvino in his uncomfortable approach to cheating this woman. Like the man in the bar who can't take a hint. He is a bit overweight (at least as a contender for a ballerina. Hope it doesn't sound innocent) and possibly a little too old for her. Nice change of the pace of the Greek God that welcomes the Super model. The Bill Conti score has held onto my head for many years, which is a good sign. But some of the plays are just scary. A subplot involving a young Puerto Rican boy, married to Sorvino's character, was just hilariously bathed. But the start scene where Ditchburn warms up to Carole King, draws you right into this story. Good luck finding it. You'd think the lifetime would reveal this or even WE, but I haven't seen it in a few years yet.
