Bonny Hunt writes a coup with her legal counsel. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have that indescribable something called chemistry. Certainly, the plot is unlikely, but it does not stop any of this movie. Carroll O'Conner does a great job as Grace's grandfather. Other major character players are his card partners. Jim Belushi is hilarious as the one-day man from Megan, part of the extended family. <br /> <br /> Faith, family and marriage are respected. A few sexual references and salt words are used, but in context and with gentle humor. <br /> <br /> And in the background is the wonderful Dean Martin tune - "Return to Me." <br /> <br /> recommended.
