Glenn Close is back as Sarah Plain and Tall, a woman who holds a family together through good and bad times. The play is wonderful - Christopher Walken (unusually non-creepy), as her husband is once again a top performer. It is good to see young Christopher Bell all big; Badly we didn't see much of Anna (Lexi Randall, also a few years older), but the new addition to the Witting family (played by Emily Osment) was most welcome. And finally, Jack Palance, as the long-lost Witting patriarch, is as good as ever.
