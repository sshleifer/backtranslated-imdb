It was the biggest movie I have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and I was so scared, there were many good things that made it good, I will see it 1000 times and Paris Hilton, D * MN she is good in that movie. But anyway, I would recommend it to anyone, even children (like me). Adults love it. You will probably have nightmares at night, but in addition it is AWESOMe, I can't start over. NEVER AUGEST WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THERE IN BRAGGED AND BRAGGED AND IN SCHOOL I have spoken a pilot's saying, 6 homeowners can see it. I set up my whole school in it. But anyway, I would definitely say. Say it may be 6 homes, be there. It is being killed.
