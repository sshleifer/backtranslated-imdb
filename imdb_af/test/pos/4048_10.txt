I probably watched the movie 4 or 5 times. Every time, I am increasingly impressed with how far the desire of a young heart can go and the power of both Kai and Gertha to struggle for what they believe. <br /> <br /> And the whole story is So presented, you're just transferred into the plot and before you know it, you're there. you can see ... yeah, there is kai ... hard work on the mirror ... a little jumping .... there is Gertha, fighting for her love ..... and there is the snow queen ... <br /> <br /> It's just a wonderful mix of love, adventure, excitement. <br /> <br /> this is brilliant 10 out of 10
