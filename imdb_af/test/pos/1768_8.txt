I like the good things in life as much as anyone, I think, but up to five years ago opera did not choose in my entertainment choices. Oh, I made a few attempts to learn what all the fuss came from; I watched several television productions - especially parts of Wagner's ring cycle on public television - hoping to understand other people's fascination with the art form. And I knew I could keep parts of various operas (I remember surprised as a kid that I actually liked the Madni Butterfly snippets in My Geisha, and I enjoyed the opera scenes in Moonstruck and Pretty Woman), but unlike the characters in those movies, I just didn't get it. <br /> <br /> When I saw a live performance of the "New York City Opera Company" Rigoletto in 1995, that night I got it. What a wonderful, glorious painting and music and raw emotion! And I mean Emotion with a capital E! The key is, according to me, the operative music makes the artists freely persuaded and credible in a way that looks clumsy when their words are spoken. Of course everything depends on the music and when the music is magical, like in Rigoletto, an opera can be a wonderful entertainment. /> <br /> A sympathetic family member gave me a laser disk copy of the 1982 TV production of the opera, and I found that since I can't see live perfo Rmances from "Rigoletto" live regularly, this video version is a fine substitute. Luciano Pavarotti is perfect in the part of the Duke; Ingvar Wixell is excellent as his moderate court hunter Rigoletto; And Rigoletto's beloved daughter, Gilda, is played by the somewhat simple Edita Gruberova. The sets and costumes are cute and the location shots on the river late in the film bring an increased drama to the story that can never be staged. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen "Rigoletto" or if you think you don't like or understand opera, I ask you to find this one on videotape and buy it or buy it. rent. If you don't like this, if this production of "Rigoletto" doesn't appreciate the power of the opera art form, just give it up and move on to something else. But I guess, if you're new to the opera, you'll be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Bill Anderson
