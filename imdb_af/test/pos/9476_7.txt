It's nice to see a young James Cagney doing his thing. He plays the cheap treasure weights and measures that take his work very seriously and tread on the toes of a group of crooked politicians. He is presented to the world, but keeps his integrity. He is beaten and erected, but that's the problem. We never know if he's really in danger. They say he's in a place, but Carte Blanche apparently has to move around and do what he needs to do. Sometimes he is so ashamed, he doesn't do much to protect himself. His allies are in the police department, but just about everything is pretty corrupt. He persists (almost too good to be true), of course, and we go for him. The problem for me is a lack of sustained tension. It would have been much better if he had to delete his name. He never falls into the depths even when his wife is rejected. It's still fun with the bad guys, kind of imploding. Just watch it watch Cagney does his tough guy who stops.
