Garlin worsens himself as a writer-director actor in his indie production of a great man (Garlin) wandering around Chicago for every woman he sees. The laugh remains almost every minute. It is a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man who seeks love, but with great comic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie. <br /> <br /> Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role that takes you upright in the mood of the rest of the movie. Sara Silverman is wonderful with some of the big pieces she does with Jeff. Bonnie Hunt is classic in her role. I just wish there was more of her in the movie, as I think most would agree. It's definitely refreshing to see her in a solid leather outfit. <br /> <br /> David Pasquesi was the separate detached chicks and voice of reason. Mina Kolb plays Jeff's mother with whom he lives. There were many other cameos, everyone did it very well. <br /> <br /> At the prime minister, Jeff called his impossibility to do more with Bonnie because of production issues. Yet it is good to let you want more. I think it's the indie thing to keep things unclear to make the audience think about filling in the spaces themselves. Jeff said some of the basic characters were based on his relationships. This explains why they work so well. Real people are always unusually colorful and make great characters. He left quite a bit of what you would expect after seeing your Enthusiasm and some of his other work. It's one of those people who break out of things where an actor takes a few risks to do something they might always want to do, but couldn't. <br /> <br /> I think it's remarkable that Garlin's improv Second City wallpaper, and Hunt's cause, sets the style of acting the focus of the story and the direction. This is perhaps a new innovative hybrid of improv, which meets indie movie-making.
