This movie looks very much like Death Warrant with Jean-Claude Van Damme and also has some similarities with Island of Fire with Jackie Chan and I also heard that there are a few other similar action movies, but this movie has a much better action as the Death. Warranty or even Island of Fire (that's right, Jackie Chan's movie). Rarely US action movies have such a good action series, although there were many negative reviews on this movie, it beat most of the more films of that time that were more successful. There were many martial arts scenes, David Bradley was fast as Bruce Lee in this movie and what else was good, those fighting tones were much longer than in most American martial arts movies. The screenshots were similar to John Woo's movies, perhaps not so good, but still very exciting. There were also many impressive explosions and one big chase scene. I saw other David Bradley's movies, but this one is the best in terms of action. OK, this movie has nice moments, but what movie doesn't it have? The acting was decent, Charles Napier was incredible and his character was really hard. Adam Clark who played Squid and Yuji Okumoto, who also played the worst bad guy, was also very good. Other actors also acted fairly well, although the acting is not important in these types of movies. If you are an action movie fan (I mean the fan of the real action movie, which really appreciates the action), than you should see this movie.
