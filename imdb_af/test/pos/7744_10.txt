"Tempest" is a somewhat self-sufficient, uneven, discursive film. But if another guest of Greece, Lord Byron, protested against his friend John Murray about his similar self-supporting and discursive "Don Juan". "It can be insignificant, but isn't it life, isn't it?" <Br /> <br /> The connections with Shakespeare's "Tempest" may seem, as another commentator claims, a bit tough. But look again at the movie after reading the "Tempest" again, and they will look much closer. What makes this movie flawed is its awkward mix of straight normal narration and sudden mutilating apparent improvisation, especially between Cassavetes and Rowland. But to be honest, these scenes are the most remarkable and most engrossing in the movie, the most difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> The music of this movie, compiled by Stomu Yamashta, is also overlooked. Especially fine is the perfect piece to accompany the afternoon siesta, as people, animals and apparently the whole island collapses to sleep the hottest part of the afternoon. It is a sublime moment, and representative of the best aspect of this movie and the one thing that unites it somewhat, the fact that (apart from extensive flashbacks and the end) it is one day on an island, of awakening until night. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'd rather see this movie one hundred times than seeing some bombastic Hollywood piece once. And in fact, I've probably been watching it a few dozen times. Most times I see something I've missed before. <br /> <br /> (Confession: I'm biased. It was the second movie I took my Greek-American goddess to see.) <br /> <br /> Trivia notes on this movie: <br /> <br /> - It was Molly Ringwald's first movie, as well as Sam Robards'; <br /> <br /> - It's actually not filmed on an island, but in Gytheion, the southern tip of the remote Mani Peninsula of the Peloponnese of Greece; <br /> <br /> - The primary special effects (according to today's standards) were made by Bran Ferren, who later became Disney Imagineering, and later became an adviser to the American intelligence community; <br /> <br /> - Paul Mazursky, the director, selected the title of his recent autobiography "Show Me the Magic" from Tempest's writing.
