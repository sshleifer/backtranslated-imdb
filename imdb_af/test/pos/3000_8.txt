The hasty approach taken by Lewis Seiler with the underworld king establishes a deeper plot while still maintaining effective driving time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is immediately transported from a shanty medical office to a luxury suite in the city's most sought after inn. This development is critical to understanding the position of the doctors. The story suggests that these two people are generally satisfied with providing medical practice to underprivileged people. By suddenly cutting this scenario into the morally conflicting profession (the crowd's personal doctor), the viewer is encouraged to experience these sudden events. The Nelsons (Kay Francis and John Eldredge) are employed by Gurney (Bogart) without objection. This stylized idea that influences organized crime and is powerful to overcome has become a standard component in every gangster image. The one aspect of this movie that raised me a few questions was the story of the story, and the pace it was telling. I think character development and social identity can suffer if certain aspects of a story are not fully investigated. This paradox is a result of personal taste, because I think the movie experience can be enhanced by rigorous character development. However, for the purposes of this film, I must admit that the fast action more dynamic spot adds to the impact of the movie. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 (from ****)
