Excellent plot line makes this movie one of the classic, cult ninja flashes of all time. The plot is that this woman's soul is in possession of an evil ninja spirit. I mean to be honest if I could acquire the ability of ninja through possession, I would. In addition, it's for the 80s and the fact that the ninja aspect was much bigger in this particular decade, and in spite of everything that Ninja 3 The Domination controls to keep it original from the American Ninja cookie cutter that has plagued the 80s for so long. This chick is definitely Michael Dudikoff on steroids. I mean the first American ninja was good, but let's get real people, it has nothing on Ninja 3.
