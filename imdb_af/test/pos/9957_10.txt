There were at least half a dozen silent movie versions of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice", and there were several television productions. But no one ever got to make a big-budget theater feature out of the drama. . . until now. Given the nature of the game's most memorable character, Shylock the Nasty Jew, it is a good guess that the little unpleasantness that came into being in Europe in the late 1930s and 1940s dampened the enthusiasts of the filmmakers. The main motivation for Michael Radford's new film is of course to give Al Pacino a chance to scream, braai, hatch, mumble and torment. This is all right. Like Richard III, Shylock's role is a dream of nature. It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare an anti-Semite, since he never met a Jew. Jews were banned from England from 300 years before his time to a few decades after his death. and it is unlikely he ever traveled abroad. On a certain level, Jews were so good to him as a mythical race. But, while Shakespeare may not have been anti-Semitic, his game is definitely in play. Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that is probably meant to put the slightest hint of the Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a 16th-century lender with the unmistakable thickness and cadence of Fozzie Bear. Radford's version begins with a crawl over the misery of the Jews and then mocks Antonio (Jeremy Irons), who spits on Shylock (Pacino), who really just stands to invent his own business. Will buy it if it comes out on DVD, sure! Sarge Booker
