Back in the mid / late 80's, an OAV anime titled "Bubblegum Crisis" (which I think a military snake term for when haywire technical equipment goes) made its debut on the video, inspired by "Blade Runner" "The Terminator" and maybe even "Robocop", with a little bit of Batman / Bruce Wayne - Iron Man / Tony Stark and Charlie's Angel's good-cast masterpiece. 8 episodes long, the overall story was that in the 21st century, Tokyo, Japan, 2032-2033, live machines called Boomers were engaged in manual labor and sometimes caused problems. A special SWAT, such as the law enforcement branch, was formed by the Advanced Police (AD Police for Short) to handle the boomers, but was mostly ineffective, causing millions of scientists Sylia Stingray, the scientist's daughter made boomers, four create. powered armor (hard suits) to be worn by women to fight the boomers and fight the evil corporation that manufactures the builders. This group is known as the Knight Sabers. Next to ringleader Sylia, her truck group included rebel women Priss Asagiri, a struggling rock and roll, with passion for motorcycles and a contempt for police, Linna Yamazaki. Aerobics instructor with an eye for money and a tendency to blow through boyfriends, and Nene Romanova, a young officer of the ADP and knowledgeable computer hacker (the first in a long line). THEN is represented by Quincy, an old old man who owns the company, his younger assistant Brian J. Mason (killed in episode 3) and an annoying boomeram named Largo. Other characters include Leon McNichol and Daley Wong, two AD police detectives (Leon appears in a spin-off / prequel anime, "AD Police Files" I heard was very dark), their bare, overweight boss Chief Todo, Sylia's younger brother Mackey, and a funny little mechanic, known as dr. Raven, which Sylia apparently helps to maintain the suits. Apart from the overall Knight Sabers & AD Police USA BY storyline, there was also another storyline in which a friend of Linna's was involved. It was apparently a daughter in a big crime family, the annoying Largo trying to soften and several Priss-wil revenge-for-a-less-character story. Oh, and did I mention that there were suggestions that Sylia was a boomer? <br /> <br /> Well, it was a good look, full of chaos and chaos and even some very nice pop songs, but it was not without his mistakes, some of which were unfortunately due to the fact that series ended after episode 8 when it was originally planned for 13 episodes. So some of the storylines, such as Largo's scheme (or schemes), the family of Linna's unsaturated friend, and Sylia's origins have never been solved. Another problem with the series was that Priss was currently the most popular character, so a good portion of the series was focused on her. Unfortunately, most Priss-oriented episodes basically focused on Priss who was justly seeking justice / revenge for some secondary character who had never appeared before, but was a friend of her, but she rarely went out of her way. she went to the Knight Sabers, who always saved her from trouble and for some reason much about her good- To be (just to be honest, she went to save Linna in episode 7, and her boyfriend was killed by a boomer and the ADP was wrong in the investigation). This meant that we didn't really look at Sylia's more interesting story, or even Nene's and Linna's day-to-day antics. Linna had two episodes around her, which related to her girlfriend with the Mafia family, while Nene managed to hook the last episode for herself, which showed her eternal good courage was actually good spirits and not thanklessness. no. Nene also had to use her computer skills very well, or she sometimes acted like a lovely roof, which made her screen time and character development a few corners above arm Linna, which was printed with her only in the background. greed and her tendency to eat boyfriends to give her attention. Don't get me wrong, I like it and I like the overall concept of everything, but it did irritate me a bit. It's also one of those runners-up for the worst English voice dubbing of all time, which means you're better off with the Japanese. Some of the voices were okay (some really matched their characters), but others were just plain and passionate, or, in the case of Priss, it really got over. <br /> <br /> Well, Tokyo 2040 comes along and pretty much throws everything out of the window. A few years ago, the story here is that after earthquakes broke Tokyo, GENES 's peasants rebuilt the city in a big old paradise, except that the boomers still have a tendency to fly the handle. It calls for the AD police to be formed, followed by the Knight Sabers being formed. So the overall story is the same, but the backgrounds of the characters and the appearance and attitude of the characters have changed a lot. <br /> <br /> 1) Originally, Sylia had short, pink black hair and brown eyes, was usually dressed like a strict, proper businesswoman and was far from others. 2040 Sylia has more of a super-fashion look to her, more attractive to dress and with white hair and blue eyes that look like color change, depending on the light (the nail varies from blue to purple to silver and eyes that sometimes look purple or gray ), and also 2040 Sylia is more of an emotionally unstable woman flying out of the handle when she is not in public, and possibly even more secret than before. Sylia does not take as much risk on the battlefield as she is more of a stay-in-the-phone type here, but she does the battle when she needs to. <br /> <br /> 2) Priss was originally a short woman with an Afro and a very bad temper. He always got fights with people who offended her, always biting more than she could chew. 2040 However, Priss went the way of the Clint Eastwood one resident. - Very cold, lots of stoic and emotionally distant (more like the original Sylia you might say), so she's not really connected to anyone. Her hair is firmer and cat-like (a big improvement) and she is dressed in leather like Trinity of "The Matrix" (although it is much less annoying than before, the writers finally frighten her when she reveals her reasons to HAT the ADP ). <br /> <br /> 3) Originally, Linna had her big black hair for her, but now her hair is shorter, browner, and, more than 90's. 2040 Linna is also an office lady who has poor luck with sexual harassment. As if to apologize for the way she was treated by the OAV authors, the 2040 authors actually dedicated the first 6 episodes to Linna, and wrote her as a land girl new to the city, but determined to be the Knight Meet Sabers and win a place with them. , what she does eventually. <br /> <br /> 4) Originally a short red haired girl who was often the victim of ridicule and lots of candy, Nene is now a short blonde haired girl who likes to pest and take pot shots at ADP detective Leon McNichol (revenge for him with her in the OAV?) and other characters, even her surrogate, great sister Linna and Mackey, Sylia's "brother" with whom she is abandoned. Cokkie and arrogant, she still eats lots of candy and is a master hacker, but eventually she becomes deflator and grows beyond her comic relief status. <br /> <br /> 5) Nigel Kirkland is a new character, a long, stoic, rough handsome man with long black hair (he looks like Adrian Paul of TV's Highlander), he replaces dr. Raven of the old series and now serves as the man who gives Sylia's hard packs of maitenance. Nigel is also Sylia's lover, but you will not know it by his attitude. He is kind of the father / big brother / mentor figure to Mackey. <br /> <br /> 6) Leon and Daley are back, but of course different. The original Leon was a tall, beautiful boy, built like a baseball player with a cunning back-brown hair, blue eyes, a black leather jacket, sturdy blue jeans and always wears a turret that can take magic more than a hooker than this is needed. While he wasn't really a bad man, he was a while, but he mostly served as a strip relief. He tried to pursue Priss romantically (exactly what he saw in her is a mystery), but sometimes and he and Daley served as information guides for key plot points. Also the original Daley was a fairly muscular red head that was just dressed in pink / purple, as he was a flamboyant homosexual character who always hit Leon when he didn't provide important information. In 2040, Leon is no longer a pretty boy, but more of your typical rough tough kind, with black black hair, brown eyes, long and sporty muscles, a brown leather jacket and blue docks (he looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger a bit or maybe Colin Farrell, or Hugh Jackman), and he still carries a turret, a big one, but it's not as powerful as before. Although Leon still has a bit of an attitude problem (especially in tackling Priss), he's not nearly as much of a while as he was in the old series, but he has a bad temper and is easily annoyed. by Nene and Daley (he also drinks too much coffee). Oh, and Leon is still after Priss, but he's got a lot more luck this time around. Daley, meanwhile, is now a bigger (but not as long as Leon) more beautiful boy with red diamond glasses, a white suit, green eyes and light brown hair, and he wears a big machine gun (he actually looks like James Marsden of the X-Men movies); Daley is a much smarter and more assertive in 2040 than the OAV and although it is not quite clear, his homosexual tendencies have almost disappeared, except for a moment of jealousy when he hears of Leon inquiring about Priss's email. <br /> <br /> 7) Brian J. Mason (what does J stand for?) is back, and so is Quincy, but Mason is far more the biggest villain here, with Quincy as fellow villain because he is no longer a tower scare, but a vegetable with a lot of batteries and wires plugged it in. Mason has now licked sport brown hair instead of black hair as he did in the PAV (he looks like OAV Leon in a suit) and he is much of the Alan Rickman school of villains. <br /> <br /> 8) In the first series, however, Mackey is no longer a pervert. In 2040 there are many things different about Mackey, but they will not be revealed here. <br /> <br /> 9) Sylia now has a companion, an Alfred-the-Butler type, Henderson, who is worried about her and the gang. <br /> <br /> 10) In the original series, boomers were like the replicas in "Blade Runner" armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions, but in 2040 they were more of the dumb-monsters-on-the- -rampage type. Most of the time it is just big robots that do whatever they are planning to do (heavy labor, struggle, clearance, etc.) And they tend to be "rogue", meaning to develop and a to become a monster. in the process. <br /> <br /> What remains the same remains the theme of humanity VS technology (has machines souls?). Unfortunately, this series, although well animated and well written, is only 26 episodes, so it moves faster than you can, especially those of us using more than one season of our beloved characters. Unfortunately, it still ends. on a wreath pendant with unresolved story pieces (which I will not discuss here.) Saving this presentation and making it what it is, but the characters, a colorful piece of screw balls they are, range from stoic loners, psycho women, genocide crazy men, rough neck policemen, sardonic intellectuals, wise old wise men, and lovely innocents, much more diverse than before and with much more to play off, they are enough to make you hope this show has gone longer . <br /> <br /> It's not good, but it's a good look. Also the English dub (by ADV) is pretty good, but not without some flat spots, but definitely better than the double on the original.
