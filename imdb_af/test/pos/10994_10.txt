We watched Manna from heaven, my husband, two friends, and we all enjoyed the movie. The characters are funny, the story is amusing and so much like real life. I think this is what I have had the most, just something faith, no murders, no sci-fi, just good, no clean fun. It's something you can take your children or older parents and don't worry. How many of them are there for more!
