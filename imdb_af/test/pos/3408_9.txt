I am a history teacher and overall I was happy with the movie. My teenage agents enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a bit juicy in places? Yes. But it kept my kids away from the computer and playing station for four nights. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were impressive and we met many historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook stand out as Abraham Lincoln stands out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff like Bent was everlastingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George. <br /> <br /> We'll enjoy the movie again!
