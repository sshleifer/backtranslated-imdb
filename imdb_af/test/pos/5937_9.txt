I both enjoyed the Van Dykes over the years and were delighted to see them again. <br /> <br /> Just as cute and funny and easy to watch and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Dick was good when he was younger, but I enjoyed him more when he got older. <br /> <br /> Son Berry was a good one to follow in his father's footsteps. <br /> <br /> Together they make a great team. and work well together. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed I haven't found another Murder 101 anywhere. <br /> <br /> I've seen both shown. I hope more, because it's really a nice duo to watch. <br /> <br /> You can say Berry follows in his father's footsteps, they are alike and have the same manners. <br /> <br /> Will enjoy everything they do separately. <br /> <br /> Be sure to watch anything they do alone and together.
