My former wife and I have seen and were awakened by the trailer for this movie. We waited for it to come out, but when it did, it didn't stay very long in the theaters. A few years later I bought it on VHS and I transfer it to DVD so I can keep it. <br /> <br /> I found it moving a lot. It's about real events in a real country. BURMA got such a bad reputation for the political repression that caused them to change their name. <br /> <br /> I find women with a little makeup very sexy. Patricia Arquette is in this movie. Frances McDormand and Spalding Gray are just short of it. <br /> <br /> After coming home to find her young boy and husband, Laura (Arquette) was brutally murdered. She is afraid of blood. A bad feature for a doctor. Her sister (McDormand) speaks to her in a holiday to Burma. While experiencing a peaceful demonstration and stealing her passport. In a brave (or stupid) move she asks a tourist guide to show her something about the tourist track. Her guide is injured by soldiers and she spends the rest of the movie getting him and her safe. <br /> <br /> Every time I see it, I remember reminding us of a farmer in the United States. living under military rule, socialism, where at least eating habits are virtually guaranteed, looks pretty good.
