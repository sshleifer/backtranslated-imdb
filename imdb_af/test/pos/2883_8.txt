I enjoyed this movie and after it's finished, it still makes you think. I believe Jeremy Brett is brilliant in this role, although his "dead" activity was a bit top, but if she's Jeremy Brett, I don't mind. <br /> <br /> It's a good piece of drama and does follow Oscar Wildes novel very closely. If you enjoy this movie, I also recommend seeing an ideal man with Jeremy Brett as Lord Goring. <br /> <br /> This movie gives a good insight into Oscar Wildes' way of thinking. And as he looks at the viewer, Dorian Gray reminds Lord Alfred 'bosie' Douglas and Basil Halward of Oscar Wilde.
