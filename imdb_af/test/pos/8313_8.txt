Tomorrow, another day is not the successor of Gone with the Wind, but a lover-on-the-lama story, and a surprisingly vigilant and moving one. For a suspected hack, B-minus features such as The Devil Thumbs A Ride seduce Felix Feist to fill his work with unexpected, inventive details. Steve Cochran left his jail when he was 18 when he was only 13. And now he is still a preliminary gawky bar working inside a man's hulky frame. Anyway, he visits a 10-cent-a-dance palace and falls for copper activity, and understands Rut Roman. But the sudden shooting of her police-bigwig boyfriend causes the unhappy couple to hit the road and end, like the Joads, in a California migrant camp. <br /> <br /> Roman is the revelation; In her best-known role, like Farley Granger's fianc√© in Hitchcock's aliens on a train, she was sick and unused. Here she modulates convincingly from a bottle-blonde taxi dancer to be wife and mother-to-be (and to raise a brunette). Cochran is almost as good, waving between the suspicion of an injured child and the explosive reactions of an under-subordinate man. And the end, while not convincing, is welcome. Along with them live at night and Gun Gun, Tomorrow Is another day a redeeming sweet and warmth that shows his film-noir family tree faithfully.
