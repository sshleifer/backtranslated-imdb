Firstly, I would like to say that this movie is the greatest thing ever happened to man. It's the best of all the excellent Muppet movies, and every other movie out there! so BOO-YA for Jim Henson! <br /> <br /> This movie is the first of all the Muppet movies and the best. (boo ya) It's about a frog (kermit) trying to make it to Hollywood. Along with the wonderful friends he encounters on the road, some of the greatest songs ever made come to be classical, including the "rainbow link". Finally, I want to say that watching movies was the biggest thing ever! If you haven't seen it yet, come off your computer and get home to your nearest video store !!! (if they don't have the muppet movie, I'll sue them big day)
