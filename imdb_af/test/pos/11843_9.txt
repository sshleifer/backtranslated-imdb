Joe (West) and Jim (Adam) are familiar with the beauty, isolation (psychological as well as physical) and total terror of most tomorrow in Navajo Southwest. Characteristics, settings and plot are constantly building. even if the personal types sometimes want our "more". with some interesting alternative choices about "who did it?" Flashbacks (eg Peter Fonda ... good to see him) give clues, but they don't go where you think. Comic asides (eg Preacher) are soft and appropriate. Where "Skinwalkers" and "Coyote Waits" start to drag. "Thief" involves the clutch and quad bikes around the next corner, never quite sure what is there. It doesn't agree with Joe Leaphorn's manic comment on Jim Chee to "slow down" for the pitfalls. Wrong ... there are no pitfalls in the plot, just tracks to follow. Up to the next episode! Great photography (as always), attractive characters and more to explore!
