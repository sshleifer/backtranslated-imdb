What a wonderful movie, filled with eccentric, unique characters that are amazingly realized by a large ensemble cast. The director also did a good job of keeping the story together, getting those wonderful performances (not to spoil them) and using music (and what great music it is) with great effect. S. Epatha starring is wonderful. I have always heard how a brilliant stage actor she is, and although I enjoyed her right and order, it really shows what she can do with a complicated, complex role. Macy Gray is great, Mos Def, as usual, wonderful. Lou Gossett, great. Jimmy Smits, fantastic, and doesn't try to focus because he's a star. A real piece of ensemble acting. <br /> <br /> Rent it, enjoy it, dig it and estimate it. Something special.
