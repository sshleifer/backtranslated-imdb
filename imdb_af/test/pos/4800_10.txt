Nazarin is a kind of saint, he wants to live exactly in life, how Christ taught man to do. But this is too late: now the Catholic Church is between the hands of a rich bourgeoisie. The bishops live in luxury and do not give a damn about the poor and the sick. Therefore, our hero is not the way his hierarchy asks him to follow. So, to himself, from everything, and on the path to purity, he is connected to some sort of Mary Magdelene and a woman. who is sexually attracted to him (telling the scene between this girl and her fiance). In Spain (that was the late fifties), they thought Nazarin was a Christian movie. Getting to know Luis Bunuel, it was quite uncomfortable: all his work is anticlerical to a mistake. To compare Nazarin and his "holy women" to Jesus is nonsense. In Nazarin's way, only blackbirds and couch grass grow. His attempt to help working men on the road is a failure, he is being chased out as a strike breaker. All his words are nothing. At the end of the trip he was arrested and offered a pi Neapple by a woman (Bunuelian sexual symbol). Thanks to Nazarin, Bunuel was allowed to return to Spain (where the sensors had no idea) and to direct Viriana.
