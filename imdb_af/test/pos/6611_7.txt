This movie to me deserves much praise, because although I am not a surfer or skater, I have inspired the entire documentary inspiration. <br /> <br /> The depth of the history and development of these two extreme sports highlighted what they could do for two groups of individuals. The dedication of these individuals is truly inspirational and it was because of them that others can now enjoy and do what these parents have created. <br /> <br /> Contrary to most other documentaries, this one is cleverly crafted, the number of recordings recorded and survived over the decades is outstanding, and as a result some of the greatest editing I have ever seen, compiled and resulted in the subject still being focused. Without the urge to return to the recent footage of the more famous surfers and skaters that are still popular today. <br /> <br /> The film explores areas such as success, such as gaining new tricks, winning competitions and gaining fame. As well as failures such as injury or burnout. <br /> <br /> It was also fulfilled to hear the experiences of the skaters and surfers themselves and not of second-hand information. This led to a better picture being drawn. <br /> <br /> Overall, a truly excellent effort.
