Since the last horrible Astérix movie and the fact that we only get the Swiss German version in the theater, I looked at this with a little trial. Incredible, as I wanted to discover ^ ____ ^ <br /> <br /> The movie is funny and modern, has good gags, good animation, an amusing character interaction, a good cast. (Note: I can only speak for the Swiss German one!) Except the Viking chief's daughter Abba (her name is great, despite the non-inspired voice actress) ... I especially have the character Justforkix (Goudurix in French, Grautvornix in German). He is the young man who is supposed to sit in shape ...). He is a very amusing portrayal of a cuddly, urban teenager; but he is very nice, despite the teenage fashion. XD The interaction between Astérix and Obélix and their young load is fantastic and well entertained. <br /> <br /> It shouldn't be compared to the old movies, as one is quite different ... What astonishingly doesn't make it bad. On the contrary. When they tried to modernize the last movie (twelve years ago), they blew it all. This movie, however, proved that it could just happen ... ^ - ^ <br /> <br /> I got out of the theater ... Always a good sign ^ _ ~
