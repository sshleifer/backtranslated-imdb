This show is really great. It's smart. It's funny. It is wonderful acting and written. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The Dialogs are really funny and well done. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a good chemistry. You really believe they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that maternal relationships should not just be mother and daughter, they can be best friends, but at the same time it shows that it is very difficult to get more than just mom and daughter, especially with Lorelai and Emily be. Just look at this show, I highly recommend it. It's great and definitely the best performance on the air. Season 7 stars Tuesday 26 September 2006, 8/7c on the new The CW
