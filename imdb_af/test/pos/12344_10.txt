I thought One Dark Night was great! It earns a 10! Regarding a statement made by one user, death was actually zombies in this movie. A dead person brought back to life is a zombie, regardless of the method or reason for returning to life. The "zombies" in this movie are used to scare the girls, not to carry them off, like traditional zombies. This movie is a definite star among 80's horror flicks. The score and atmosphere are quite frightening, and the audience is kept in tension throughout the mausoleum scenes. Actually, the acting is convincing, with real expressions of horror in the eyes of the undead. Although I enjoy all the zombie movie, this movie is a refreshing change from the typical "carnivorous zombie" movie.
