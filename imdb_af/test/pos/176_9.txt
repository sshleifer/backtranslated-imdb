After watching the skeleton dance Walt Disney on the Saturday morning Blog, as used by YouTube, I used the same sources to see a remake in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man Ub work. The colors, compared to the earlier black and white, are imaginatively used here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeleton players constantly strikes a wrong note or when one loses his head and decreases another or when one dance with another with part of the other - is just as funny as the previous one. It gets a bit repetitive near the end. Still, Skeleton Frolics is worth seeing for any animated buff that wants to compare it to the earlier Silly Symphony.
