Everyone knows that Lindburgh passed the first Transatlantic flight. So how can there be any tension or plot in this movie? Well, there is. Don't ask me how, but there. Partly because of the directors' expert narration of the story, but mostly because of Jimmy Stewart's profoundly engaging performance, we are drawn into the story as if it had unfolded for the first time before our eyes. In spite of the fact that half of the movie is filmed in a cramped cabin, it's as dynamic as any action out there. So if you're afraid to see this movie, because you think you know the story, give it a chance. I think you'll be impressed.
