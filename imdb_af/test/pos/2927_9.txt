I tell you though it is funny how these many swear words are in this one. I'm sure the number of profanities and swear words in it will probably count to about 200, because of what I heard last the biggest number of swear words on a South Park episode is 165 scores of the word s ** t, but in addition, it's so funny, because there are swear words and also pedophiles who shoot themselves in the head. Watch it for your own survival and also look out for an indication of cartman's father and also the annoying voice of Chris Hanssseeeen and also Kyle, should save characters from pedophiles (the catch of a predator show is also on date line) and they have " hit a peado and when they got there, the Peado "shot"
