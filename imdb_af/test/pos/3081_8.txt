Robin Hood; Men in Tights are worth watching, I watched it recently because I just became a Cary Elwes fan, and it's one of his main roles. Some moments really made me crack so hard! I didn't expect them to know you, it was so funny. Even the 2nd time you're still falling from your chair. The role is fantastic, of course Robin of Locksley himself, Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John <br /> <br /> There were a few moments, the movie was trying to make a comic scene, but you don't necessarily laugh at it .... but OK. <br /> <br /> This is the second time that Cary Elwes and Patrick Stewart have appeared in a movie, they both worked on Lady Jane in 1986. and it was nice to see them, 7 years later, older, awwww. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth watching, totally hilarious!
