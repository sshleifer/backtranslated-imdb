I saw this show on TV and tied it up. My daughter played it over and over. I lent out at work and everyone just loved it. It's just brilliant physical comedy. Bill appeared here in California (he was in New York and resided) and performed the flight on stage. I was able to take my daughter and her girlfriend to see this brilliant show. <br /> <br /> Bill received a federal endowment, and my daughter congratulated him, and Bill was so fond of her watching a photo. <br /> <br /> People ask me, and I can't decide if he's a comedian, and actor or a clown. Actually, he's already three. I really wish it was on DVD, my tape was lost.
