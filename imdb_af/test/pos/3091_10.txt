It will be something to tell someone that Fata Morgana is going very simply. Or maybe it's not: Herzog goes to the Sahara Desert and nearby towns to film different provinces and locals. But it's just the broadest stroke. It's a thing you've given yourself or not. He is completely in the shape of the world around him, without a story, which is bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, as his camera (shooting on so-called discarded film material) walks in a pure travel report. One can even come to the easy conclusion, as he sets up these tremendous provinces, then moves to more rugged civilized culture (though not the actual 'normal' culture itself) and to a point too abstract to properly convey on this. Sometimes it takes a while to get close, near a purity through the "creation" section, but a purity in how parts are manipulated by nature or by broken machines. Soon, the narrative, lectures of the Popol Vuh (which incidentally makes the music for most of his films), with the gradual procession of actually high-styled shots will add a whole different level to it. It's a hybrid movie, and it's not easy, but the rewards are the best closest to Herzog's idea of ​​"ecstatic truth", images he has for his entire career. <br /> <br /> One wonders if the images end By the time the second part, Paradise, led the words spoken or vice versa. Your eyes are moving with the stills and pans, and the wording is close to religious writing, but there are also music choices, how the bizarre free singing and low-key classical music goes with Leonard Cohen and Blind Faith. I think every side ultimately complements the other, and that is something that still doesn't seem to work. Perhaps this is the sign, the chances of going through deserted deserts and the smallest running sections of any civilized life (in this case the desert huts) make it so fascinating. If it's just for the cinematographic sense, it's a wonder too indescribable for the casual photography fan of techniques of shapes and some of the strangest images of any Herzog movie. There are pans, there are long shots, there are handmade while driving through the villages. There is a bus about miles away, which via a mirage only looks a few, there is a full on-the-fire and a man holding a reptile and talking about his radar (really classic gono comedy ), there are people who are still in counterfeiting, and a man and woman playing music. But most importantly, it feels at least natural to me for the personal nature of the approach. <br /> <br /> I'm sure only Herzog would know why he made this movie, as opposed to the simple "how"; He even started filming Dwarfs Begin Klein, and he endured many dangers to finish it. Yet, it makes Fata Morgana such an incredible achievement - it will appeal to one, depending on what someone is bringing to it, to actually look at it. It's definitely upsetting, but the temptation will soon see it again, just to experience all the ideas and realities, strangled strange vibes. (Yes, the word 'vibes' applies here). It is one of the truly spectacular "art films" ever made.
