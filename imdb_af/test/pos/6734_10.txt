This film starts with all the moody promise of a great contemporary noir Western - after the bad emerging spring-up sequence anyway. The scenery is beautifully deserted, the characters are painfully isolated. While some of the actors are less than credible, the plot ultimately produces enough tension and twist to make this movie worthwhile.
