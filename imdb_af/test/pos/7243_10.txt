I totally agree with the other poster. NEMESIS is one of the best of Christie adaptations with an excellent plot and role. <br /> <br /> The scene at which Liz Fraser is the mother of the murder victim is a study to act at the best level. This underrated woman was a fave in British movies in the 1960s that never had a mainstream break in American films. Look at her as Julie Andrews' friend in the 1964 AMERICANIZATION OF THE EMIL. <br /> <br /> All the perks in this prod have a chance to with and without the eternal Ms. Hickson to shine that was never called an Emmy. for her Marple work. Shame on them! And dig the lesbian CID agents! :)
