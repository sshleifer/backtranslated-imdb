Beware of possible spoilers ahead? Just look for Joe the second time. The first time was 30+ years ago on an air force base. I was reminded by the Air Force overcoat with Tech. Sgt. stripes worn by boyfriend / trader; our airmen have had quite a laugh the first time on the screen, because it is an "army" rank. Over the years, I have performed several other images from the film. The foremost was the absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive. As someone else comments, you can't take your eyes off her. Until now I didn't realize it was a 20-year-old Susan Sarandon in her first movie. What a loss she did no more movies when she looked like this. I also remember the irony of a counter-culture hero like Peter Boyle who plays the title role of a right-wing gun gun. Not different from George C. Scott who generals in Dr. Strangelove and Patton don't play. And of course, the shocking end has made a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> 30+ years ago, it was most talked about movie ever played on the base. We thought it was a good movie and I was reluctant to see it again because I was afraid it would be so disappointing as Easy Rider. But when I saw it today, I was amazed at how well the film rose. It's a very strong script with a few holes, though you have to wonder if the boyfriend comes out of the bath immediately when Sarandon arrives with him. <br /> <br /> Looking for an explanation why this movie is still so entertaining I must think it has something to do with the perfect physical casting. Boyle was physically credible like Joe (as others pointed out that his portrayal will inspire the Archie Bunker character a few years later). Did Ted Knight model his 'Caddyshack' character Judge Smails after Dennis Patrick's advertisers in 'Joe'? They look the same and sound. Patrick was completely credible as the wrapped-up-stiff top middle-class CEO. And Sarandon's do-it-yourself innocent with the Raggety Ann doll is still a protective response from all male viewers-perfect casting. <br /> <br /> The nude and drug scenes actually stop (they were very challenging for their day) and are as explicit as anything in "Thirteen". The only thing this movie dates to is that violence is not realistic or graphic. 'Joe' was about the same time as 'The Wild Bunch', and the scene of the movie violence just started to change. <br /> <br /> Another reason why this film takes place is that the events over the past few years have brought back the relevance of the theme and context of this movie. In the film, both types of conservatives are portrayed as fearful and hateful towards the unconventional ways of counterculture; and filled with envy in their free and hedonistic lifestyle. The counter-culture is portrayed to mock the straight culture; and although paranoid towards conservatives (legally given that it was just a few months after Kent state), they cannot resist weakening their lifestyle in an attempt to antagonize. The political landscape is not so different from 30+ years later. I'm not sure that conservatives are jealous of young people and liberals as much as 1970, but they fear and hate them more. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie that is surprisingly relevant as in the early 1970s.
