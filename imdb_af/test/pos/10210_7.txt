As he escapes from a bank elevator, the exuberant Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) helps Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), the chief engineer of the West Union, who has opened the Wild West and had a horse with an accident has. In 1861, Vance regenerates and is appointed to work for the Western Union with the team installing the Omaha poles and cable to Salt Lake City. Vance and Harvard Richard Blake's engineer (Robert Young) flirt with beautiful Edward's sister Sue Creighton (Virginia Gilmore) and she chooses Vance. But his fiancee haunts him as the brother Jack Slade (Barton MacLane) stealing West American cattle disguised by Indians. <br /> <br /> "Western Union" is a good but predictable western target by Fritz Lang. The story shows the problems of the brave and idealistic men responsible for installing the telegraph by the West, against thieves and Indians. The entertaining story has action, drama, romance and funny situations, but with the exception of Jack Slade's identity, there's no surprise in the story. Randolph Scott gives another beautiful show with a good role. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Conquistadores" ("The Conquerors")
