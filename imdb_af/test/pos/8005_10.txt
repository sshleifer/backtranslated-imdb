Many of us find art just enjoyable when the masterpiece itself touches us deeply. That is, the completed creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can somehow personally tolerate it. It was winter, here in Australia in 1992 when I saw Batman Returns at the theater and it blew me away. Both "I'm". I had to be an ideal, a standard, but at the same time I still lived a life. Tim Burton was the first filmmaker to say she's ready for a comic movie to be dark and confess that darkness can happen to all of us. After Tim Burton's Batman interpretations, many other dark comic book heroes and anti-heroes flooded the theaters. Comic book folklore for decades tells of friendly, durable heroes with dashingly attractive smiles and magical superpowers flying in the air, and hovering powerful webs of their wrists and wearing red boots and having the power of a locomotive. But what happens if you are only ten years old and you see your parents running cold in front of you? You understand. Somewhere in your psyche breaks your young psychological senses apart. The only way to manage such pain and pain is to create an alternative person. You make a promise. Your other self will be stronger, use all the rage to rage any means available to avenge the innocence of your parents on the criminal, criminals, any criminal. It's been seen by Bruce Wayne's eyes. Both pairs. The world he sees is dark, gloomy and cold. Although he patrols the streets and people see him through the sea, they are not going to get his signature. He is their Savior, not the winner of a personality competition. Batman Returns is about losers. Batman, for another Christmas, remains "the only lonely man in town". Bruce Wayne never gets the legal Max Shreck legally arrested. The penguin never loses its pain to abandon its parents on Gotham's citizens, and Selina Kyle is lost forever to be mentally fragmented and traumatized. And the hero doesn't get the girl or cat. This movie delivers the desire in all of us to want so desperately to have a house, as expressed by Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot. The film is in need of all of us to be heard, respected and not ignored as requested by Selina Kyle, Oswald and of course Bruce Wayne. But sometimes we are somehow suppressed, we are told that it is an ideal standard to behave. That's until we finally get it. Only hope remains at the end of the movie as we see Catwoman rising to the night sky. But come what should we all have good will for all men and women. As far as I am concerned, I cannot say that I will reach a point where I will believe that my problem will be reconciled with duality. But that's right. We all have a dark side. Batman Returns is not only the best of Batman movies, it is truly an outstanding fine masterpiece of storytelling.
