If you consider yourself a horror movie fan, you may have seen Hideo Nakata's Ring and Dark Water. They're wonderful, and Ring makes his way to Hollywood. (Perhaps Dark Water will soon be adjusted?). While Ring is almost 100% pure heartbreaking and nerve-racking, a story of two sisters is both nervous break and mind turning. <br /> <br /> Along with The Other, I consider this Korean movie a brilliant and cleverly ending horror movie. The only mistake this movie has, some consider its first 20 minutes fairly slow. It's actually typical of Korean and Japanese movies. I consider it to be carefully planned rather than slow, think of it as 'a quiet moment before the storm'. With thorough introduction of characters, the viewer becomes more involved with the character, one of Korean and Japanese movies' strongest points. <br /> <br /> Like Ring, a story of two sisters does not overpower the appearance. On the contrary, they let us do the intimidating work ourselves. That way it is scarce and horribly elegant at the same time. I will not be surprised if Hollywood remakes this movie after it has transferred Ring and Grudge / Ju-On. (This movie is not so good, I rate it 5.5). Don't miss it!
