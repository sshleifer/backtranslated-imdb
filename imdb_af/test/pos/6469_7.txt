John Cassavetes is in the process of law. He is at the bottom of the hope. He sees Negro Sidney Poitier as she looks and becomes friends quickly, forming a kind of alliance against a bully of a foreman played by Jack Warden. <br /> <br /> As someone who worked in a warehouse myself when I was younger, I can tell you that the warehouse battles, complete with tumbler cases and flailing grappling hooks, are as realistic as it gets. I was involved in this fight, although no one was murdered. <br /> <br /> The launch of Sidney Poitier's widow is a variation on Shakespeare's Shylock. "Shouldn't I bleed?" This is an anti-racist film, which was much needed at the time. <br /> <br /> All three main characters - Warden, Cassavetes and Poitier - are wonderful, with Warden the most outstanding of the three.
