I must say. It's easy to watch one of my favorite movies on Halloween. The Halloween party, the horrible play, the man dressed in Miami Vice. GREAT LARGE !!! <br /> <br /> ********************* SPOILERS ************** ****** ******* <br /> <br /> I have a big place in my heart for random 80's horror flicks and this one came out and pulled at my heartbeat. I always save this movie at Blockbuster and always laugh at the box cover. Now every weekend I will grab a random movie I have never seen ... one weekend it was Angela's turn. She has been backward for months. So I put it in at home and spent most of the movie under the blanket. <br /> <br /> For me it was scary and rough. And not just the acting! Some of the things they were doing for this movie were AMAZING. I can honestly say the best part for me was watching Suzanne (played by a co-icon), holding a tube of lipstick through her nipple. It was random and I loved it. To see dirty Angela FLOAT through the corridors and hear her terrible demon voice was enough to wake me ALL NAME LONG! <br /> <br /> It's not one of the smartest or best practices. But its 80's cheese and she has all the elements you need. Creepy Goth Kid, Virgin, Slut, Naked Girls, Scary House, Bad Acting, oh and I called Naked Girls? All the elements were there and were so compiled that it was made for one of my favorite films. Kudos to the filmmakers.
