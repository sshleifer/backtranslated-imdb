Yes, it's a bit cheesy. But it is exciting and entertaining, and one of my favorites; There are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a laudable work with the limitations of plot and characters. It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad old' role; I thought he was pretty credible - and rather chilling - as the increasingly paranoid CO Robert Conrad is a favorite for a long time. I think he brings his character to life very well. and Sam Waterston is star quality in everything she watched - movies or TV. <br /> <br /> I see this movie so often, but our band (a VHS TV copy I got) is so poor quality, it's hard to fully enjoy. It's a movie I think they should put on DVD. Maybe it's not universally sought after, but I'm sure there are many people like me out there, who like this kind of movie so there will be a DVD version market. I'll keep hoping!
