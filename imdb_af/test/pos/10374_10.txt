Aunt Cora was always tactless and her healthy family ignored the remark she made after her brother Richard's funeral: "He was murdered, wasn't he?". They remember it the next day, when Cora was brutally murdered with a greenhouse ... <br /> <br /> For some reason, this year's POIROT movies are far from true to the original book. I was disappointed with the changes in CARDS ON THE TABLE - my favorite Poirot book. AFTER THE FUNERAL is my 2nd favorite Poirot book, and I was scared the story would be destroyed. It wasn't! The movie was almost page-by-page, right to the killer's motive! All the actors were great, but my favorite should be Monica Dolan, who does a good performance as Mrs. Gilchrist, the companion of the late Aunt Cora. Without a doubt the best Poirot movie ever!
