"... the beat is too strong ... we are now dull mutants - like them", Rex Voorhas Ormine <br /> <br /> I'm surprised this movie is uniformly grounded. Let me be the first to discuss The Beat's virtues and why you should see this movie now. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake. This movie is cheesy and bad in the conventional sense. The story is over, the poetry is stupid, and the play is inconsistent. <br /> <br /> But that's the movie's TIPS. All of these ingredients are the recipe for one of the 80's most TEACHING CHEEZY FILMS. <br /> <br /> If the reference to "deaf mutants" did not show your interest, it might: What is the name "Rex Voorhas Ormine"? It's such an unusual name (for North American audiences) that I told myself: "Even the names of the characters in this friggin movie are fine." <br /> <br /> Well, "The Beat" is so wonderful that the "meaning" and "symbolism" behind "Rex Voorhas Ormine" are not too subtle by Bart Waxman (the deceptive adviser you'd like to hate) . I won't spoil the revelation behind Rex's name, but don't get too excited, okay? <br /> <br /> Overall, the play is inconsistent (John Savage - who plays the "concerned teacher" Ellsworth is pretty good, just like Bart Waxman's fellow player, but the rest of the cast is unconvincing) . That said, the acting is NOT the movie. Why? In each of the actors' performances there is a SINCERITY that encourages the characters they play. Although the performances may suck, you're still left with the impression that the actors are really trying to do their best. Consequently, the actors' sincerity succeeds where their play fails (which is often). <br /> <br /> The honor of beating "poetry" in this movie is bad, bad, bad. But it's a good, good, good thing when it comes to entertainment. Do you actually have better quality or more respectful poetry, especially in a movie like this? <br /> <br /> People, it will NO (think of the mischief they read us in high school - animated to damage the youth, politically conservative and without any critical analysis, etc.). Although you don't like poetry or "arty" movies (with all the "intellectual" attitude implying), you most certainly can (and should) appreciate LUDICROUS POETRY in a WANNABE ART MOVIE !! How can you not enjoy the following? <br /> <br /> "Do you remember the roar of the dinosaur? A woman's rugged crabs on the floor, bad, sly bad, oh woman is so sad that she was washing her hands and then waiting at The Door today yes, today! "Yes, this is an example of some of the remarkable poetry sprinkling throughout the Beat. But how about the story, you ask? <br /> <br /> Well, the story is ominous. But then again, this is the beauty of this movie. Apart from some clich√©s, stereotypes and predictable plot points, there are enough real unique elements for the plot / story to keep things interesting. Who is Rex? Where did he come from? What is he talking about? Deaf mutants? Ill-angels? Does Billy and Kate REXY really mean what Rex says? Is the audience supposed to understand Rex and his poetry? (I've seen the movie several times and I haven't figured everything out yet.) <br /> <br /> Will real bad poetry and high school talent really see END TIME violence? <br /> <br /> I guarantee you have never seen anything like The Beat - a perfect combination of brilliant bad poetry, mediocre but sincere acting, and a "mythopoetics conquering gang violence" storyline NO RIVALED DO NOT BE. . <br /> <br /> Classical NYC hardcore fans bonus: The Cro-Mags make a rare movie appearance as the "Iron Skulls" and it is a hobby to see that they perform several songs. I wish they included more concert material, but maybe that would be an extra on the "collector's edition" DVD I was fantasy about. <br /> <br />
