I'm a happy married 49-year-old woman, who just happens to kill this movie. <br /> <br /> Geena Davis's character is strong, smart and kicking ........... .... I thought she had an excellent (it's an understatement) work in done this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not really big on action movies, but I thought it was sooooooooooo sexy and entertaining. /> <br /> She is my alter-ego ............. when she begins to put the assault rifle together in the old hotel room ............ ......... I have chills ............... she did it as if she knew what she was doing ........... It's one of my favorite parts in that movie ....... <br /> <br /> I think she deserves an Oscar for her acting and physical roles ....... /> <br /> I'm going to have 'CHARLY' tattooed on my back .............. I'm one of those girls who will never be a chance ...... ............... I am like his ............... (shhhhhhhhhhhhhh in secret ........ and is isn't it so sexy?)
