Some people do not like Led Zeppelin, but fortunately the number of people versus the number of people who are not WAY is unbalanced. I am the proud converter of 2 or 3 Led Zeppelin fans and the only reason I could do this is because of this DVD. <br /> <br /> For one, how someone can listen to "Trap to Heaven" or "Immigrant Song" without falling in love with Zeppelin is outside me, but playing the guitar and not like Page ... It is like being Christian and not keeping Jesus. My friend was like "Led Zeppelin sucks!" and I was like, "Oh yes, watch it!" After about 2 minutes of viewing through White Summer / Black Mountain Side, he was glued to the screen and had never said bad things about Zeppelin. <br /> <br /> Sign up not to run the metaphor I call this DVD the Led Zeppelin Bible. <br /> <br /> Course There are a few things that are missing such as "Over the hills and far away", a good version of "Immigrant Song" and I really didn't have 2 version of "Whole Lotta Love," needed, but what the hell, I'll take them. <br /> <br /> Because there is nothing except "The Song Remains the Same" to compare it, it gave a 10 and even if there was more to compare it, I would have given it another 10 has.
