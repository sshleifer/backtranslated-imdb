It's really simple. The name of the movie is deathbed, the bed that eats. If you are something like me, you already know if you want to enjoy this movie. The other day I stumbled upon Best Jewelry about this jewelery and picked it up for Ten Bucks. I have ten valid delights from the title, and the box alone. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of B movies. I think it's one of the biggest B movies I've ever seen. Now it's not for everyone. <br /> <br /> Permitted, it's not even for most people. In fact, I suspect they're just going to be a handful of us who really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> For those of you who like B movies, this movie is a rough diamond. . It has a good starting point, a bed ... It eats people. It doesn't go, it's not moving, it didn't call a siren to attract people. It's pretty much dependent on people wandering around and sitting there. <br /> <br /> I loved every inch of this movie and have seen it three times in the rare weeks I've owned. <br /> As I said. After reading the title of the movie, you already know if you like it. If you laugh or smile, then give it a twist. It is worth the effort.
