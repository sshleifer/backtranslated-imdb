This movie was really a fresh air of the burly Hollywood shit I saw recently. The acting is wonderful and the characters are alluring and strange. There is really not much in the story, it's simple and it works well. An easy movie to just sit down and enjoy. The mood was fantastic and the sets really helped to compress the movie and presented good figurines. The film has, of course, aspects of horror, but is aimed at the humorous side of things. You won't laugh hysterically with this one, but you'll smile all the way. The humor works very well with the characters and the wonderful play doesn't hurt. I really watched this movie by the fact that Ron Perlman was in it. His role is a little smaller than I expected, but it doesn't matter; The rest of the team does more than enough to keep you engaged. If you like horror, watch it. If you like comedies, watch it. Just go ahead and watch it anyway, it's really good.
