This movie was fantastic! Tangi Miller and Flex did a good job. They both looked good together and they both pulled it off. Tasha Smith was as funny as the cousin, and she couldn't stay out of her business. Essence kept it for her girlfriend when she needed her. Aloma was sweet and played a dear grandmother. She really reminded me of my grandmother. And oh, I can't forget the stripper, he was so found and I didn't know if I should cover my eyes or smile while I was watching He reveals his sexuality on the big screen. Dame! He was good! Tangi looks flawless and sexy, and she has started a notch since Felicity. Throughout the film many A-List actors and actresses had. It was funny, sexy, crazy, touching, loving, emotional and wonderful. This movie is a must see! Now go on DVD, if not!
