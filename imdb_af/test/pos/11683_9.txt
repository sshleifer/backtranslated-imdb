Assuming you know what this movie is about, I also have to accept that you came to this review because you know you will probably see it, no matter what I say. If all these rings are true - read on - you'll probably find some consonance with at least a portion of this review. If you're unpredictable or not quite sure what happened in the late 70s and early 80s in the urban and suburban youth music culture, be sure to read one of the reviews that claim to be objective. <br /> <br /> Although I didn't grow up in California, the American punk scene was the first music scene I've ever lived in. At the height of the hardcore I was plunged between 1979-1981 and everyone had a band and the only common denominators between bands and indeed members of their audiences were: <br /> <br /> * rejection of conformity /> <br /> * tolerance and pleasure of difference <br /> <br /> * a desire to have fun - hard and fast <br /> <br /> Hairstyles, politics, aversion to authority figures and violent slam dance were not an integral part of what I experienced, although there were definitely clicks or factions that were intolerant of those who didn't dress, talk or do punk enough. And there was often a certain amount of undeserved credit extended from some of these clients to those who are really trying to live to live on the fascist paradigm of anarchic, self-defeating, vicious young people. <br /> <br /> Although the interviews with earplugs in Penelope Spheeris's excellent Cal-Punk documentary "Decline of Western Civilization" offer a very careful view of the subculture, some of us enjoyed the interviews with the groups, Club owners, promoters and even security people are much more representative of at least my own perspective and memories of the scene. Nonetheless, this is possible for those who approach it with prejudices about what punk this movie experiences without challenging their assumptions. Unfortunately, as it is, the debt rests solely on those who promote themselves, believe or feel comfortable with stereotypes. Not the filmmakers. Don't blame the messenger. <br /> <br /> The music presented here won't be for everyone or even the most. It's not the roughest thing out there, but it's hard, unpleasant, fast and less worried about technique than with raw energy. <br /> <br /> For me, the early Black Flag with Ron Reyes singing, X, Fear and the Circle Jerks was worth more than the cost of this tough movie to gain. As much as I like The Germs, Darby Crash sees the mess - and the nice guy - that he left me a little cold. Yet Darby's screens played with his pet tantrum while "Shut Down" was drinking up and down in the background. The X maintenance is also good. <br /> <br /> Speeris's straight documentary style is complemented by wild pans and zooming in the musical segments. During the interviews, framework is used very well to provide context for everything that is said. Considering her experience and budget, Spheeris did as well as anyone with this movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended for those who appreciate what this movie really is about and for those who have forgotten those few years of fun. , honest, directional rebellion before Amaerican punk was bought in yet another flow within the musical mainstream and the stereotypes became more important than basic philosophy.
