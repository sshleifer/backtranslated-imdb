Accepting is one of the best teenage comedies I've seen long ago. It has an original screenplay, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half pure unadultered fun. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby "B" Win (Justin Long) who doesn't accept any of the collages he applied for, to avoid his parents' disappointment, he creates a fictitious collage. In an effort to completely mislead his parents, he creates a false website and changes an old psychiatric hospital to a school. Everything goes smoothly until a lot of other "accepted" students come to his doorstep. Now he and his friend must find out that collage thing, not just for themselves, but for the other. Justin Long as a chief is absolutely brilliant, his character is as natural as he can be and the supporting acts are outstanding - Jonah Hill as Sherman Schrader, Columbus Short as Hands, Maria Thayer as Rory, Adam Herschman as Glen and Lewis Black as Uncle Ben. <br /> <br /> The humor is fresh and simple and most importantly funny, from the beginning to the credits. The plot develops so easily that by the time you stop laughing to start the last joke, you start giggle at the other. Along with all the fun, the film brings a very common topic to our attention, viz. The collage education. If usually the students in the film are united against the school government, in this case they are united by the mutual desire to go to school and to learn. <br /> <br /> But the movie doesn't mark all other schools wrong, it just shows there is another way. What they say, "If there is a will, there is a way. And sometimes the kids know better what they need than their parents. <br /> <br /> This movie is an unacceptable story about the great opportunities in life in the best format possible.
