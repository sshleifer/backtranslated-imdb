Black Snake Moon is unwavering. It is abundantly rich, fantastically orchestrated, strange and cumbersome, unique and visionary. In the continuation of Hustle & Flow, Brewer broke his portrait of the American South, almost as a mythological country that one could expect in a fantasy or ancient Greek epic. And how far above us his movies float, they are still rooted; In the deepest darkest ground there is rooted. <br /> <br /> As in traditional fairy tales, Brewer breaks his portrait into Black Snake Moan with extremes and exaggeration. Sharp and strong traits, when accompanied by such extreme deeds as connecting a half-naked white girl to a radiator in an attempt to rid herself of her sins, exaggerate and emphasize the metaphor in the same way as extreme visual techniques as some characters color in Pleasantville, the metaphor strengthens in that fairy tale. But Brewer does not start his movie at once. In this film and also in Hustle & Flow, Brewer offers us another fairy tale; a dark, Gothic fable of sex, prostitution and ultimately salvation. These themes flow through the blood's veins such as blood and resonate and bloom in its dark, breeding environment. <br /> <br /> But despite these tough extremes, Brewer treats his characters like humans and creates very well-executed, dimensional characterization in Lazarus and Rae, especially emphasizing their relationships with Lazer's friend at the pharmacy, Angela , and Rae's mother. <br /> <br /> The play is all perfect. One feels that both Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson were born to play these roles. Their characteristics are so intense and so serious; It's even more challenging for the actors to stop their heads and produce realistic characters. And they did a great job. Samuel L. Jackson disappears completely in his character, serving as a polar opposite of most of the character he had previously played. With films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Shaft, and others, he made him a tip cast of the "ultimate bad-ass". In Black Snake Moan Jackson plays an old, broken, defeated and earthly character quite different from anything he did before. And honestly, it's just fantastic. However, what is quite a surprise is Justin Timberlake's casting, and more specifically, the fact that he is considered reasonably acceptable. Certainly, he didn't have much screen time, but as Brewer did with Ludicrous in Hustle & Flow, he actually got Timberlake to act and do what he intended to do and not consider totally unconvincing and annoying. <Br /> <br /> But what's really so amazing about the movie is the atmosphere that Brewer creates. The rural southern areas work to the advantage of creating a dark, dirty, grim, crunchy, rugged film for the entire film, more than just the movie's thematic and metaphorical aspects. And by using all sorts of elements like the rising sound of the cicadas when Rae gets her itch, or a raging storm that increases and worsens as Lazarus plays his blues number for Black Snake Moon, Brewer can really create a fantasy world , a subversive mythology to the rural southern environment. And it works so fantastically to produce Brewer's unique vision. <br /> <br /> And one can't talk about a Craig Brewer movie without mentioning the music. In Hustle & Flow he used a soundtrack of down-and-dirty, street-wise hip hop music to accentuate the atmosphere and vision. In this film, the music works even better to polish off and fully represent the unique atmosphere. It's a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the dirtiest, rawest, grittiest blues you've ever heard. And it sounds absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> In all, this movie was a simple story of an old, broken, lonely, godly black blues singer who freed a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffering from nymphomania, there could not have been much to write about the house. But this movie is not about the plot, and not even about the characters, as well as what they are making in the film. No, this movie is about the vision? and what a unique vision it is! It's about the atmosphere, mythology, the environment. It's about anger, fear, salvation, and above all, the blues. And it's all wrapped in a unique, entertaining, stylized and impeccable ribbon. Brewer guaranteed him a place on the most promising upcoming director list. With such a solid follow-up to a major debut film, Hustle & Flow, he will definitely be on my radar for future projects. <Br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that the movie has one of the most fantastic and unique titles I've ever heard.
