Julie (Meg Tilly) is a high school girl who has a good two shoes, which can put herself under the rituals of The Sisters, a small click presented by snooty, homecoming queen type Carol (Robin Evans). The sisters suggest that July will spend the final night in a mausoleum for the final test and prepare to ride July on the wall, but did not know that the recent dead, ill-meaning psychologist Raymar was devastated and plans to causing destruction outside the grave. . <br /> <br /> While this debut photo for Tom McLoughlin ("Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives" and "Sometimes They Come Back") is limited by his obviously low budget, that's what McLoughlin and his crew are. be able to deal with what counts. It's really creepy, disturbing food; It might have been very fearful to me if I was under the age of 10, and even in my present age it still reached me to some extent. <br /> <br /> Some of the effects look cute, but decent search bodies and gore are created by Tom Burman, an experienced artist who has an effect on makeup. He is overshadowed by more famous names such as Winston, Baker and Bottin. He has a good resume with other movies like Cat People (1982) and "The Beast Within", he liked most of it, which was a true sense of premonition and atmosphere, and an aspect missing from some of The current latest horror films are shown in our multiplexes. <br /> <br /> Tilly is cute and attractive in her role, she recently completed her debut film in "Tex" before joining this production. "One Dark Night "was completed a few times before his release in the theaters in 1983, where it actually did significant business during the first few weeks. The other actors did what they needed to do well; familiar faces in the supporting film included the same alluring veteran singer / actress / voice-over artist Elizabeth (aka EG) Daily, Kevin Peter Hall, for once * not a kind of creative character, but unfortunately ending with very little screen time, and no one but Adam " Batman "West. The director's wife, Nancy, who is Lizbe will play in Jason Lives, appearing here as the spatial girl in front of the arcade. It's fun entertaining B-level horror, maybe too cheap for its ambitions, and maybe it's not nice (hey, McLoughlin * was just started), but definitely good for some chills. <br /> <br /> 7/10
