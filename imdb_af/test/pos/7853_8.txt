I thought Eastwood's most unusual role was in the Bridges or Madison County, but that was until I saw The Beguiled. He manages to pull it off, gives a very good performance and so does the rest of the role. The direction is imaginative as the film was made in 1971 and there aren't any plots - which the director sometimes struggles to cover - we're talking about an excellent movie. However, it remains powerful. <br /> <br /> 8
