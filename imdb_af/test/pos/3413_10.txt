Of all the seasons and episodes of the TWILIGHT ZONE, to all the great, sensible, formidable stories, this one is at the top. That's right. This story, the one titled THE HUNT, has the greatest number of best scripts in television history. <br /> <br /> True, there are no interplanetary space flights, no unexplained cracks in time. There is no living nightmare, no sudden changes to the environment. There seems to be nothing extraordinary for our protagonist to do with. <br /> <br /> The main character, played by veteran character actor Arthur Hunnicut, stretches out of his hut in the hills, accompanied by his faithful dog, to hunt raccoon. Because the raccoon is a predominantly nocturnal animal hunt, it is by moonlight. <br /> <br /> The man and dog soon become a large raccoon that falls on the dog's back and tries to drown the dog in a pond. The man jumps in to help his dog. There is some sort of almost black-out, after which the pair are seen on the beach, in a lie, almost asleep as position. <br /> <br /> Call his dog by name, (Rip, I think) the old man is going to go home. When he arrives, he finds the woman crying and does not respond to his conversation. He also notes that visitors come to his house and go to his house, paying with respect and giving words to comfort his wife. <br /> <br /> At the strange reception and departure it seems to be taking the Man and Rip off at the strange reception and on the house door. On a long walk along the road, where he remembers aloud that he did not remember such a long fence in these parts. He eventually arrives at a fairly large man, dressed in clothes such as his overalls, hat, work shirt. They are at a gate, leading to an area where many smoke emerge freely. The Gate Keeper is too eager in his persuasive pitch to try to enter the man. Rip sounds discontent. The gateman tells the Old Man that he may enter, but the dog must stay outside and offer the animal to him. The man will have nothing of it and the two will go on their way. <br /> <br /> After a little more walk they come across a second gate entrance where the Gate Keeper recognizes the man and welcomes him. When the Old Man reports what happened on the road, he tells how the man at the other gate tries to separate and add the Man and Dog: "With no dogs allowed, it must be a hell of a place! " The 2nd gate keeper said he was right! "That's exactly what it is!" <br /> <br /> Our family lost our 1st Dog, Lady-Mixed Lab, in October 1981. About 6 months later, the wife (Deanna) and myself with our 2 daughters (Jennifer 9 and Michelle 6) will watch this episode on TV, WGN TV, Channel 9 Chicago. Well, it made our perfect sense at that stage. <br /> <br /> We are sure that anyone who has that relationship with a family dog ​​agrees. The episode brings another state of watery eyes to this now 60-year-old author.
