My first exposure to Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli production company was when an English version of Spirited Away was released about 7 years ago. What a wonderful creative and unique movie experience it was! At that moment I got my movie competition friend to see this new movie of Miyazaki with me, especially because he loves Disney (the movie's American distributor). Again, all I can say is "Wow!" What awesome footage about the way water is portrayed as the ocean ... and what about the title character's transformation from a goldfish to ... and to see how some characters change behavior ... and, look, if you like, this movie to know what I'm talking about. Oh, and the voices are used for this American version: Tina Fey, Betty White, Liam Neeson, Cloris Leachman, and Lily Tomlin. Good choices all. Make everything sense? No, but it's part of the childlike charm that permeates throughout. There are many funny scenes about Ponyo and the boy and many other people they experience. Oh, I think I wrote too much, so I highly recommend Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo.
