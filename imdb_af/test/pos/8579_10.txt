It's a good movie. When two people with different backgrounds and social status think they have nothing to offer and in the end, they need each other to prove what the heart knows. Sometimes we wonder why one man with a woman or a different side and the outward appearance say one thing to our eye, but what they offer each other that we cannot see is wonderful and inexplicable. When Nimi thought that Matthew had nothing to offer her and when Matthew was just looking for a flame (because he had an open marriage to his wife Jenny), they finally realized they couldn't and didn't want to not without the other. It was worth them to resist what family and friends thought and what society said was right to be with each other. This movie kind of restores my faith in love.
