When John Carpenter's masterful version of "The Thing" was released in the summer of 1982, it was posted by critics and bombed at the cashier's office. The audiences could not handle another 'bad' stranger, they wanted ET. Their loss in the long run. <br /> <br /> I will kill to see this big movie on the big screen. It is a movie that was far away from time; Now it has influenced a new generation of filmmakers, influencing the route on things like Se7en, Alien 3 and even the X files. And the structure that disrupts character development in favor of incredible SFX is commonplace in today's pinch. <br /> <br /> Carpenter shows the same skills he used in "Halloween", using the camera to create a disturbing and claustrophobic atmosphere. The performances are all good, and the end is great - still unique today. <br /> <br /> A paranoid masterpiece.
