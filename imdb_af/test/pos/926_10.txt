Master Kieslowsky got an idea in 1993. The idea was to portray how the human relationship is in the world today, from White (a visual comedy film about marriage) from Blue (a visual masterpiece on marriage) Red (a masterpiece dealing with human interaction). <br /> <br /> While I can't spoil the move, I can easily say that Red is the best movie from the nineties because it is one of the strongest messages in a script I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie starts a bit slow, but finds it rhythm early enough to hold you through the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The performances are perfect, lofty. since the characters are completely realistic and have not clicked in any way and one cannot expect any less from the actors and one does not get disappointed ... seriously I believe Jean Louis Tringtignat at least has an Oscar earned node. <br /> <br /> The music of Zbiegnew Preisner is wonderful, it is one of the best musical scores ever. Piotr Sobocinsk Cinematography is also excellent, he got an Oscar cut (and deserves to win). <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people from foreign theater and people who don't. Don't miss it. <br /> <br /> How the terrible pulp fiction struck this noble masterpiece in Cannes is beyond my comprehension
