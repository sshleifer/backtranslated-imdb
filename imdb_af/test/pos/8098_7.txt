If a good fan of Charlie Chaplin was to good vibes after the first 'The Gold Rush' and then 'City Lights', I was keen to see 'The Great Dictator' as I said it was probably his best movie. I was also interested in the fact that it was a talkie; My first one, Chaplin-wise. <br /> <br /> The start is typical Chaplin and blatant evidence that Chaplain can cut it while not just relying on music to moan and talk; It's funny, well-timed and the elements of slapstick like falling from an anti-aircraft gun are well-tied with jokes. It was good to sign the viewer with this 'classic Chaplin' opening and at the same time start the character story to get to know each other. What was also well done was the way Hitler was ravaged. Any scene that Hitler or "Hynkel" was involved in this movie was funny and even now; let's think back if you know exactly who he spoofs and makes an internal reaction of some kind. The way English is mixed in the mixed German in the dialogue styles is a further proof of the way in which Chaplin succeeded in adapting to the talkie era. My favorite joke was the five-minute speech that Hynkel gave, just for the English translator to translate it in a few words; To remind you of Hitler's footage, you may have seen a speech at some point in your life and indeed laugh at him. <br /> <br /> Historically, the movie has also accomplished a few things. Hynkel is seen as his photo taken with children; something Hitler did for recognition because he manipulated the media, but here Hynkel is seen as a gift and bored. pounding at Hitler's underhand technique to win by the sympathy of the German public (oh, he hugs and kisses children. He must be good!). The film is also a fantastic representation of a Jewish citizen who is re-installed in the ghetto among all the travesties, but with the catch he is unaware of. Movies like 'The Pianist' and 'Come and See' are two good examples of Nazi cruelty to 'inferior' people we can all look back today and shake our heads. In the late 1930s when it was filmed, The fact that it was cruel and exploited, made it even more amazing. Chaplin has succeeded in replacing rifles and chairs for tomatoes and saucepans and yet pulls them off. <br /> <br /> However, what I didn't like about the movie was the fact that it was established after the opening of a real story. . This slowed down the film and it is very noticeable, as the foot is slightly reduced from the gas. The movie began to hint at stories and sub-stories. It includes the hairdresser and the female neighbor who fall in love and the supposed destruction of Hynkel's palace, while none of these has actually been developed. The 'give a woman a shave' and the 'who has the coin in their pudding, played the gut on these plot roads, but eventually they realized nothing but excuses for unsaved, clumsy gags. <br /> <br /> During the final straight, the Great Dictator gets a boost from the fact that the Italian dictator is being introduced, which adds a much needed life and excuse to comedy to the movie. It works a surprise as we see them arguing and more private tactics are being exploited when Hynkel tries to overwhelm his Italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (though humorous). Despite some weaknesses in the pacing during the middle segment and the fact that I felt the message to the end, was a little forced to force my throat, the Great Dictator is still busy today, but it's just because he uses the game to exploit no one else. knew there was.
