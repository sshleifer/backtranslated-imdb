Project A II is a classic Jackie Chan movie with all the kung fu, crazy stunts and slapstick humor you expect. Not as good as the prequel, but it's still a good movie if you just want something fun to watch. The story is simple, Jackie Chan to the evil men. So if you want a movie that you don't understand a braniac, I would suggest this one.
