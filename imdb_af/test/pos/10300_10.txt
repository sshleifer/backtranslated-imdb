Outside, this movie is better because of Vincent D'Onofrio (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), but this movie is just as good as the 1982 version. In some ways, the 1999 version is better because it is more up to date (a decade compared to the 27 years. The actors in this movie were great like Terry Kinney (McManus of HBO's Oz) such as James Daly and Tony Shalhoub ( USA's Monk and Gary Sinise (CSI: NY) Unfortunately, the dialogue has changed for contemporary audiences, and Neutral is much of the same writing, there were things not in the 1982 version that boosted this drama and comedy, but in the end this movie was just as big in the 1982 one. Characteristically: Vincent D'onofrio playing Phil Romano was excellent, better than Paul Sorvino, a match between Stacy Keach and Terry Kinney in terms of James, as for George, I would praise Shalhoub, and between Martin Sheen & Sinsise and Tom, I'd say win Sinise.
