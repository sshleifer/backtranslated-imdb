I remember this movie getting rid of judges when it was new. Letterman and Leno themselves had objections. Letterman called it (the paraphrasing) the biggest waste of film he ever saw, and Leno objected to the simpleton depiction of himself. But Letterman had John Michael Higgins as his guest on his show, so he seems to have done nothing too personally. A DVD re-release, with opinions and such of those involved, may be interesting, although I suspect the days of the survival of the nocturnal tradition of survival are gone and not coming back soon. <br /> <br /> I prefer the Letterman personalization to the Leno, but can never buy it. They never rose above caricature, and I never accepted them as actors. For comparison: Paul Sorvino as Kissinger in Oliver Stone's "Nixon" comes to mind as a personalization that could be ridiculous in the first few moments, but at least seems like the first moments of entertainment. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the show for me was Treat Williams as Michael Ovitz. Williams's speech to Letterman wasn't that big, but reminiscent of Alec Baldwin's entry (and quick exit) as Blake into Glengerry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> They could have done more with Johnny's role in all of this. I know he was mostly uninvolved in the events featured in this movie, and most audiences will be familiar with his reputation so Johnny Carson does not need any introduction. But more context about why Dave and Jay and all comedians would have honored Johnny, gave this movie the content he didn't have in a gossip. <br /> <br /> Guess I need to read the book ... <br /> <Rich Little imitating Johnny Carson, unfortunately, has nothing but Rich Little following Johnny Carson. <br /> <br /> I tell you what, after watching this movie, watched the Letterman or Leno show, all I want to do is open my Johnny Carson DVDs and watch the right thing .
