One of the Message Boards threads at IMDb talked to two women about Colin Firth, how they watched the movie just because of him. It was clear that it was two young women; But what struck me is how little this movie is generally appreciated by audiences. The brilliant, and I mean brilliant, performances of Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange were barely noticed, not just by audiences, but by the academy and most critics. <br /> <br /> I think I know why. First, the plot - or just the set-up - is a kind of bastardization of Shakespeare's King Lear with the dying, crazy patriarch and the three twilight daughters who will inherit. Their names even begin with the same letters, Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia - Rose, Ginny, and Caroline. And I think "Larry" (Jason Robards) works for "Lear." The apparent idea proposed by Jane Smiley in her Pulitzer prize-winning novel was to tell a doctrinal story from the point of view of the daughters and to call it a kind of late-twentieth century realistic way not considered by the Bard no. The problem is that the two older girls in Smiley and Moorhouse's story are very human with strengths and weaknesses, while the father is a despicable character, without losing much to redeem qualities. His only strength was his ability to make a financial success of the farm; However, we can even discount it because his father and grandfather built him the farm and inherited it. <br /> <br /> The second problem - and I can't see it personally - without reading Smiley's novel. - is that the film is only a limited and partial interpretation of that novel. Yet it is almost always the case that an excellent novel, especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances, cannot be faithfully transmitted to the screen. The vision and sound demands of film drown the subtleties of a narrative while the time constraints do not allow the character and motivation achieved by the romance players to be fully developed. Given five or six hours, maybe Moorhouse might have made a movie more in line with Smiley's novel. <br /> <br /> A third problem is one that maybe Moorhouse's alone. She began her career with the very well done Aussie film Proof (1991) with Russell Crowe. She followed this on how to make an American Quilt (1995) that celebrated women, especially women of a certain age. However, it was a bit heavy-handed and clear and definitely a chick spot. In a sense, it takes a thousand hectares, which not only shows the view of women, but in a way that seems to some politics. Larry Cook is clearly a bad, bad dad. He struck his daughters and he had carnal knowledge of them. He ran the household with an iron fist. Jess (Colin Firth's character) seduces the inexperienced Ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a little fun it seems. And then he goes to Rose, who is clearly the power behind the new ownership, and with her renovation, as she almost ends her husband in a drunken accident. The rest of the men are one-dimensional characters without nuances, as they often appear in romance novels. I think most audiences were enforced by the heavy-handed weeds, adultery and sexual betrayal waved in the story. <br /> <br /> It all said, I think the critics and the public are wrong. I think the direction was biased towards men, but in this story it had to be. I think Moorhouse did a good job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that wasn't too beautiful. And the play of Pfeiffer and Lange was nothing less than sensational. They appeared to feed each other in a way that I was absolutely authentic and deeply moved. In particular, Pfeiffer was undressed while projecting her excited anger and hatred. The way Moorhouse allows her character to gradually be revealed is a tribute to her ability as a director, as well as Pfeiffer's excellent performance. And the skill with which Moorhouse led the change in Ginny's character as she went from a "ninny", as she called herself, to someone with self-awareness and a little understandable bitterness, was also excellent. The fact that she left her husband was so much sorry for anything else. He had to get her and forgive her and bring her back. And robots in its intensity and madness were also very good. <br /> <br /> I predict that this movie, which is being bombed in theaters, would be better appreciated in the years that come when people see it on DVD. My question is, everything that happened to Moorhouse? Her talent is obvious, but she still has her fourth feature film. When she does, I hope she remembers going with what she believes, but also being fair. I think, actually, she was fair to the two main characters in this movie, but didn't give enough attention to the others. In addition to the unselected father, Jennifer Jason Leigh's Caroline was unfinished and asked us to wonder why she did some of the things she did. And the men had to be something more than mannequin. They had to be involved and involved.
