I originally watched it because I thought it would be the successor to the League of Extraordinary Lord and this movie is a very different thing that's going on right here - a comedy! However, I loved it anyway! <br /> <br /> The League of Gentlemen are apparently some British TV series with some weird characters and some sharp humor. This is the British comedy, so it turns out to be very stupid, dress up in costumes and make fun of Germans and French, homosexual references. In short, it's very funny! <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the authors of the TV program decide to cancel some characters and the characters come from their dimension in the author's dimension to prevent it from happening. It's a fun twist and there are many scenes in this idiotic adventure. I laughed many times aloud and applauded the brazen style of humor. It leaves Mr. Bean looks like the subtle lash he is. (Rowan is much better in Black Adder VAT range) <br /> <br /> It's not Monty Python, but you can never escape the comparison when you speak English. humor, and there are some similarities, but not so much as to like it to be his own thing and fresh. It lends more to the little ones and Guest House Paradiso in its comedic style. <br /> <br /> If you like, watch The Young Ones series and Guest House Paradiso movie, and of course I assume the TV series League of Gentlemen should also be quite funny.
