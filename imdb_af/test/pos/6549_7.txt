Gekyk Uzumaki last night and immediately reminded of two early Peter Weir films from Australia, The Last Wave and Hanging Rock Picnic. They were movies loaded with atmosphere, but short on real horror. Uzumaki, for me, seems clearly influenced by these movies. It has a number of fairly everyday scenes that are becoming more thin, the deeper you get sucked into the movie. It also has more scenes of utter horror and although I don't think the movie actually meets the two movies, it is worth the time of the most thoughtful fans of the unusual (not necessarily horror). 7 out of 10 looks fair, but I have to say that the year after the The Last Wave, the film still stays with me, and that's exactly Picnic at Hanging Rock's unresolved end that makes it so haunting. P.S. All the people criticize the acting ... pulses ... in this genre?
