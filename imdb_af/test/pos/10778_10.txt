With unlimited raw energy and a uncompromising vision, Talk Radio explores the public's love of reducing the alien's private radio entertainment issues. Eric Bogosian is sensational as Barry Champlaine, a rude, in-face radio host. He is of course for this kind of role, and fine voice one of the most impressive, interesting radio personalities I've ever seen on the screen. The timing and delivery of his insults to his various callers are brilliant strokes. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin also shines as Barry's boss. He shows the same explosive cynicism that he would later show the Glengarry Glen Ross in 1992. But the supporting role that really stands out is the stoned, seemingly brain-dead teenager played by Michael Wincott. You have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone and Robert Richardson are doing a great job of photography, which is almost completely limited to a single broadcast room. The claustrophobic feeling of the film reflects his toes perfectly. One of the main points of the film is the use of people's private moments to draw an audience. Stone shows that these moments are often too private for the whole world to experience. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is a movie with strong emotional and cerebral impact - as it is seldom seen.
