While both this movie and the signature car yacht have shown a lack of respect by many critics, both are far above average. Roy Scheider does an excellent job playing his best kind; a tough, courageous policeman who works hard to do the job, despite the desk managers and politicians who have to support him rather than impede. (He played a suburban version of the same role as the capital of the tourist town police in Jaws. Not so keen, but the same "gets the job done despite the politicians" and gutsy approach. As a man who can't swim or aren't afraid of everything that goes out in the water on an old boat with an Ahab wannabee and a nerd to confront a big killer shark is not sorry, tell me what is ...) . <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain; Most of the villains actually have depth and complexity. It's one of those movies that gets better with repeated views. Overall, it captures the atmosphere of parts of NY City: gritty, unglamorous, often dangerous but filled with energy. The story is sparse, stiff and subtle; It gets the job done without strange elements. It may not be one of the all-time greats, but it is a particularly good movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has an opinion on car hunters. Mine is that this one is right there with the Mustang vs Dodge Charger hunt in Bullitt. The Pontiac Ventura / Chevy Nova was similar to the Mustang as a compact car chassis with an accelerated suspension and a powerful small block V8 filled in an engine bay designed for a slick 6. The Ventura / Novas has little respect for the treadmill, but with the proper suspension mods, they have affordable performance cars that could handle both road and rail. The gossip of the GM V8's as they climb is music for the enthusiast's ear. I criticized this chase for the "imitation" of the Bullitt chase. The truth is, they are two works of the same master, Bill Hickman, who also choreographed and drove the French Connection hunt. In addition to most of the car hunting scenes, he has created a breeding, malicious presence and a good match with Richard Lynch as some cold evil killers. <br /> <br /> Yes, the chase is often "inaccurate". Like using 3 different NY roads to represent the Palisades Parkway, the end of the chase in an 18-wheel crash on a passenger-only roadway and the marvelous timing that all pedestrians can escape. It's next to the tip. Let's look at: movie hunters are by nature unreal. However, in Bullitt, The French Connection and The Seven Ups, Bill Hickman and Phillip D'Antoni have made more realistic and thus more exciting than the flying, explosive vehicle fantasy commonly seen in recent films.
