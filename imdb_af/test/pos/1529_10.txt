Rare film captures such intense drama and emotion. What makes this movie so disturbing is that the drama is so real, it's hard to remember that it's just a movie. It's far from Madeline Stowe and Alan Rickman's performance of their careers. The movie almost feels like a theater production as it is staged and lit. The only bad thing about this movie is that it's very hard to get a copy of it. I haven't seen it yet, except at Laserdisc. This truly powerful movie deserves a digitally remastered transmission and special edition treatment on DVD. It's really that good.
