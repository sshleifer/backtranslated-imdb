Imagery controls this movie. The characters, though interesting, eventually take a back seat. The first scene I remember is a framed black and white shot of the sea, which then opens to full screen and color. The bubbling of the water allows for a small coffin that breaks the surface. The theme of the film here is that death can be accepted and brought into the kingdom of life. <br /> <br /> Water as an ultimate consciousness, as an instrument of God, is used here to force people to get their "homes" in order (Judgment Day). The dead must be accounted for and lifted to a better place. What one left unresolved or unsolved would be washed away. There has been no cling to the past, to a buried memory of what was. <br /> <br /> This movie is compared to O, Brother where art and the threat of water and its use as cleaning power are similar to that movie. What is different in this movie is that the arrival of the water is known and therefore again the emphasis is on what needs to be done here and now. <br /> <br /> I agree that the screens are reminiscent of a David Lynch work. For example, take the food segment with the deep-faded and androgenic waitress. One gets the same surrealistic feel of the institution and strange character as one does with the back player in the scene of Fire Starter. The difference is that Lynch attacks us with the image to express the psychological processes of a distressed character, while this film apparently uses surreal elements to create a moral message. The men in black suits can have nothing they want. They must be patient and accept what is available.
