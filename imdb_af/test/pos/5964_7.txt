The Frogs who wanted a King or Frogland are Ladislaw Starewicz's most cautious story about people who want the government to solve their problems I have ever seen. The ironic thing is that they pray for the answers of the god Jupiter. Jupiter first reacts by sending a tree stump and then a stork. Nor does it work and the stork is especially dangerous for the amphibious creatures! The frogs have some human features when we see that they are dressing in the latest fashion of the day and we see some photos taking or using a movie camera when the stork arrives! As I said, this brief lot is a political allegory that is more suitable for adults than children. In fact, I only saw it on the Rhino VHS that Bambi Meets Godzilla had. This alone must tell you what to expect here!
