The Venice merchant was one of Shakespeare's most popular plays during his own lifetime, but during the 20th century it fell on difficult times because of its undeniable anti-Semitic content. The play is also called schizoids in the care of comedic scenes to tragic children, some leading to say these are two plays that try to live together as one. Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes, who played William Shakespeare in "Shakespeare in Love") is in love with Portia (Lynn Collins, excellent), but has to borrow a considerable amount of money to woo her. He goes to his gay lover Antonio (Jeremy Irons), who does not have the money on his person, but takes a loan from the Jewish army Shylock (Al Pacino). Shylock is amused and insulted that Antonio, who insulted him for his religion, is now coming to him for money, but he offers it, provided the penalty for default on the loan is a pound of Antonio's meat. What is, of course, what happens. Bassanio and Portia offer Shylock significantly more than the original loan instead of the pound of meat, but Shylock, disappearing after his daughter left him and marrying a Christian, refuses to take it. Portia, in a scene where the audience is never quite sure where to put his sympathy, deprives Shylock of what she should be legal, and then cut him off from his wealth and religion. Shylock was originally drafted as a cartoon villain, but modern actors and directors have transformed him into a tragic figure, which has caused the injustice of Venice in the fifteenth century. Al Pacino does an excellent job as Shylock, and Jeremy Irons is good as Antonio, but I think Lynn Collins's work as Portia is the best part of the play. Portia is one of the few notable female roles in Shakespeare's canon, and Collins is wonderful in that part. However, Joseph Fiennes is more than a little dull; I have never really enjoyed his often overwhelming play. I give "The Merchant of Venice" an 8/10.
