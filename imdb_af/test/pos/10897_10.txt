GoldenEye is a masterpiece. The storyline is unbelievably portrayed, the characters are pretty animated and the weapons are tidy. The storyline is so interesting, even when you complete each mission, to get more levels, you have to hit it with more trouble. And the multiplayer mode is so timely. You choose the weapons you want to play, then play. Me and my three friends, along with my brother, always play Goldeneye. If you don't have this game, I suggest you buy it.
