I believe this film was made for the non-senior sum of Â£ 8,000, but it didn't really show. There was nothing amateur about the production or the acting, the characters were eager and actually and the place could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too hot beach just north of Aberdeen. The actors were fairly easily accepted as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious, deserted and unfamiliar planet. None of them were exceptionally friendly with each other, but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their comrades alive. There wasn't a big explanation of what was going on, which could really be confronted, so much of the plot was left to your imagination, rather than The Big Empty which was a movie I also enjoyed. I found that I made most characters very hot. There were some unconscious amusing moments. The men were so ordinary you felt like you could empathize with them and the movie's climax and end was quite gripping. I think Mr Stirton and his crew should be very proud of themselves. I saw worse movies with a budget of millions.
