Well, I'm not a film critic or something. But I think the best in this movie was Amanda Bynes, she played her role for me look very well, I watched a lot of her movies, I liked it the most! If you watch this movie, you can just relax, come and watch. You don't have to search for subtext or something like that. You don't see it. Movie is really good. Maybe I liked it for actress, maybe for all the scenery, but I liked it. The whole atmosphere created. In one moment I just felt like I was in that university. In that room it's not another drama. made to win Oscar, it's just nice movie to watch in your spare time.
