Bergman's story of how hell of war can drive a sensible few musicians to barbarism. With many memorable scenes in the film, I have found particularly remarkable that near the end where Ullmann and Von Sydow go in a boat, are completely surrounded by dead soldiers floating on the sea. A fascinating masterpiece!
