Johnny Knoxville and the boys of Jackass are in the top for Jackass Number Two. At a press show, the laugh was so loud and racial that it was difficult to hear the whole dialogue. The stunts are over and the pranks are funny and shameful than ever before. <br /> <br /> All the guys put their limbs on the line to make a good movie, and they succeeded. If you like this genre, you will love this movie. If not, don't bother. <br /> <br /> Some of the funniest bits are the pranks the guys play on themselves, and they have no regard for what happens to them. They will do anything to make a stunt job. <br /> <br /> Many critics have put Johnny Knoxville in the first movie for a less active role but not worried. He is front and middle in number two and they have enough footage to look half way. a number three. <br /> <br /> It is a must have for fans of this kind of humor. <br /> <br /> Chris Sansone, Entertainment Editor, Fort Bend Herald
