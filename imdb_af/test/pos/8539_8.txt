Ed (coincidentally an editor) is appointed to cut horror films to be favorable in Europe (where standards are much stricter). But he finds the movies very devastating and starts a little angry. Well, a little, can be an understatement. <br /> <br /> Let me first say the best. opening. scene. ever. A man in an office blowing his head with a grenade. His boss then says - with a straight face - "you're fired". The whole movie doesn't like this level of intensity, but it definitely tries. <br /> <br /> Take the shotgun zones, the deapitation, the "Lost Limbs" tracks (which my friend Jason wished was a real movie). The author of this movie thought of a woman raped by a beaver and then immediately shot in the face with a bazooka. It's something you won't find in any other movie (at least, I'm pretty insecure.) <br /> <br /> This movie's biggest mistake is the quality. The picture is not as sharp as a 1997 movie, and the sound can be touched (though not bad). I thought I was watching a 1980 movie. Although it made my mind a boost, the film also had the 1980s style of writing: it was a pleasure and gave the audience a little extra at the top. I miss those days. <br /> <br /> I wish I had more to say, although I can't think of anything strong enough to praise this movie. I think you should see it. You saw the box in your video store with the ax that split the head. Maybe you've passed it a few times. Maybe you thought it would be cute. Pick it up. Enjoy it.
