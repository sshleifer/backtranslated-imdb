As much as 'The Beginning' showed that we're still getting 'classic' x files, Drive showed that the X-Files is going to explore new territory. They start by giving us a unique teaser, with the photocopy of the new camera. It was an interesting transition from the TV to the right events. I would have been even better if they kept the new photo camera for the whole teaser and didn't cut it inside the car. When reading this episode live back in 1998, I thought, "Am I on the right channel?" The first autopsy by Scully flooded me with big words I didn't understand. I think she taught her lesson to always wear a mask before performing an autopsy. Silly Scully! What is the handling of the lighting in the autopsy laboratory? It's as dark as a grave in there! How should they see what they are doing there? Assistant director Kersh gets his first line in this episode. I lost no love for that man. He is the third recurring character in a queue that tells you that you love to hate. The first two are Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender. I think the producers felt that there was too much love for Mulder, Scully and Skinner. They had to add characters to give our favorite agents a little sadness and encourage our hearts as fans. I love the quarantine suits worn by Scully and her team with the cool helmet bulbs. Boy. It is really smoky or foggy in the dry northern Nevada at night. Can we say the word "effect"? Drive is a cool episode but looks at route 36 on my American atlas. There is no way Mulder could maintain a speed of 70-100 MPH on that road. If he was on I-80, the highway might be. But not on a state road with so many curves. All the filming in the car looks very authentic. Excellent work by Rob Bowman. It doesn't look like the old days of the obvious blue screen or clip of passing scenery outside a car window on a stage. It was a fun episode, but some of the inaccuracies are a major episode. It keeps you on the edge of your chair, so hold fast for a quick ride!
