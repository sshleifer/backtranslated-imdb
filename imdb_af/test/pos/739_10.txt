Although not many, "Do not Look in the Basement" is not a very interesting movie and is definitely worth a watch. The story follows a young nurse, Charlotte Beale, who is hired at Stephen's Sanitarium for Dr. Stephens to replace after being murdered by a patient. Many patients start with Ms. Beale languishes, and her boss, dr. Geraldine Masters, act as if she is hiding something ... <br /> <br /> This movie has many attractive characters that you actually care about, and has sympathy for the climax, which doesn't happen often in horror movies. The musical score is huge and reminiscent of "Dark Shadows", the show by Rosie Holotik, Rhea McAdams and Bill McGhee are all great, the story is very interesting with a big turning end. This movie has a camping atmosphere around it that no other movie I've ever seen was able to catch. Many horror fans have never seen or even heard of this movie, which is really unhappy, as it could have been a horror classic. "Don't Look In The Cellar" is definitely worth watching for all the fans of the 1970s entries.
