The plot of this movie is being tackled against the terrible war in the history of mankind: the violent clash between Adolf Hitler's Germany and Soviet Russia, from 1941 to 45. <br /> <br /> With western areas of theirs destroying land and killing 20 to 30 million Russian people, the vibrations of this conflict in Russia can be felt to this day. Back in 1957, memories were still fresh and painful. <br /> <br /> This very black environment contrasts strongly with the fine and cohesive style of 'Letjat zhuravli's beautiful shots. His simple story is about human behavior in times of war: courage, love, patriotism, weakness, cowardice and corruption. Already beautifully tied by a toy squirrel. <br /> <br /> Add to this the wonderful play, and it's easy to understand why this movie is so familiar. Really, one of the very best ever made. <br /> <br />
