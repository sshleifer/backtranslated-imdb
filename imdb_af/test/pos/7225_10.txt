I L-O-V-E this movie ... everyone and their grandmother's sister's attorney's dentist should own it! She is spiritual, devilish, exciting, comic, and full of toasty action-packed goodness! With this movie, these wonderful people at Troma offer you a new perspective in the story of Romeo and Juliet in ways you never thought! It has all the acts of instant classic - car accidents, nice sexual scenes, feasting families, street fights, incredible music, cut heads and lemmy of mot√∂rhead telling the story line! and it's just a taste of what it offers! every single person i watched this movie now owns their own copy or requests ... A +++++ and + +
