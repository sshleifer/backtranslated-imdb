As a Canadian, I didn't know much about the Whitlam dismissal. I read the Wikipedia page about the events, but it was about it. Earlier this year, when Canada went through a possible constitutional crisis (it happily focussed) that could lead to our intervention by our governor general, the rejection of Whitlam in the press was mentioned. In an effort to learn more, I ordered the DVD of this mini-series through EBay. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed with how interesting the account was. As dramatic as events, it could have been a very boring political drama. However, it was a pretty exciting mini-series. I was also impressed with how understandable it was, despite my lack of familiarity with Australian politics. It didn't take long to find out who everyone was and what their roles were. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it's not a completely impartial account. Malcolm Fraser is definitely portrayed as a rather Machiavellian figure, who stands no person or thing in the way of his quest to be premier. Gough Whitlam is depicted in a more noble, almost holy, light. The actor depicting Whitlam channels the nobility in such a way that it comes more than pumping. I thought Sir John Kerr was portrayed in a reasonably sympathetic way. <br /> <br /> I have to warn people that the DVD is of very poor quality. I understand that it was made for television in the early 80's, but there seems to have been no effort to restore the picture quality or sound quality. It was very disappointing that no extras were added as well. A documentary, or even interviewing the historical figures, would have improved the experience, but there is nothing. <br /> <br /> I recommend this mini-series to anyone interested in real events.
