Can a movie be faithful to the book on which it is based? Judging from the 2007 adaptation of Khaled Hosseini's large 2003 vendor, the answer is rather ironic 'yes'. Like many, I was surprised by the book, an impressive first attempt by the African-American writer / doctor. So clear was the director Marc Forster ("Stranger Than Fiction") and the screenwriter David Benioff ("Troy"), who pay close attention to the key details of the story within the 127 minutes of the film. Yet, the seamless tapestry of sad events in Hosseini's novel often comes as episodic and short, because Forster and Benioff are genuinely trying to stay true to the full extent of the story within the time constraints. Part of the challenge is how Hosseini carefully used symbolic acts to give literary, then-and-now symmetry to what is essentially a three-action story, a technique that is generally confronted with a bit on the screen can be. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers, however, are doing the most important things, specifically the viewer gives an intimate look at a hidden culture that has so far been conveyed through CNN news reports, to ensure authenticity by characters in the Use Dari-Persian dialect of the Afghan language and the emotional suffocation of the complex story. The first part of the film was in 1978 in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion and the eventual takeover of the Taliban. The focus is on the relationship between Amir, the son of a wealthy businessman, Baba, and the dedicated Hassan, the son of his father's servant. Coupled with their mutual love of kite running, the two are thick as thieves until a tragic event separates them irreparably. Amir is unable to find the courage that comes naturally to his father. Amir was found guilty of not rescuing Hassan from an unspeakable act performed by a thirty local bull. Forster observes the ethnic tensions between Hazara and Pashtun in Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> At the 1979 invasion of Soviet troops, Amir and Baba flee to the US where the story picks up the story nine years later. Fremont, California, a suburban enclave of Afghan emigrants. Baby is reduced to work in a petrol station and run a flea market kiosk. Amir meets a local Afghan girl and marries. This is the least interesting part of the film, as Benioff's treatment briefly gives characters such as Amir's wife Soraya, and Amir is portrayed as an addicted young man with a downward role in his self-esteem. The last section flashes before twelve years where Amir returns to the Taliban-dictated Afghanistan to save Hassan's son from the Taliban at the time of his first book, as a way to sin for years before his cowardice. There is true tension and fear generated in this part of the story because shocking revelations and old acquaintances return to haunt Amir during his journey. <br /> <br /> A British actor of the Egyptian heritage, Khalid Abdalla (the chief creator in "United 93") has a challenging role to play in the central role of Amir as he has a constant sense of shame and reduced self-worth. The other professional actors are better - Shaun Toub (Tony Stark's rescuer Yinsen in the current "Iron Man") as Baba's business partner, Rahim Khan, who holds the key to the truth; Atossa Leoni, quietly influenced by Soraya; And best of all, Iranian actor Homayoun Ershadi brings pride and dignity to Baba. Three young non-professionals were recruited from Kabul's school system to play key roles, and all are pretty good. Zekeria Ebrahimi is facing the toughest part as young Amir, and Ali Danish Bakhtyari is pleasing to Hassan's almost catatonic son Sohrab. But it is the sad, moon-confronted Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada that will break your heart than the young Hassan, especially in the devastating pomegranate throwing scene. It is fair to say that his performance is in line with the young Enzo Staiola in Vittorio de Sica's classic "Bicycle Thieves". <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are well done, especially Roberto Schaefer's clean cinematography (West China convincing substitutes for Afghanistan), Alberto Iglesias' incentive score, and even the CGI effects the kites display in turbulent flight . The 2008 DVD has a solid set of extras that start with an insightful comment from Forster, Hosseini and Benioff, although some of their dialogue seems to be forced. There are two featurettes included. The first is the 14-minute "Words of the Kite Runner", which focuses on Hosseini's connection with the story and development of the novel. The second is the 25-minute "Kite Runner Images", a more standard behind the scenes look at the production. Completing the extras is the original theater trailer, a few previews, and a Hosseini PSA on how to help the Afghans at their current time of need.
