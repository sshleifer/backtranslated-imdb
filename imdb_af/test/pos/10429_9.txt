I do not understand why more people have not commented on this, except that many people may not have seen it. This is a wonderful role-play of characters, one after the other, all done by the guy who wrote the play. If you don't like filmed plays, you can't like it. (Usually doesn't play well on TV), but it's a one-man program that needs attention throughout. Highly recommended.
