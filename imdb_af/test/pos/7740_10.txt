I have often heard people say disappointment that Mazursky's "Tempest" has little to do with Shakespeare's original. In my opinion, this is true and false, but above all, it is a bad starting point for criticism. An artwork should never be criticized for what it is not, but for what it is. The movie "Tempest" is nothing like a faithful version of the play, but in my mind it is true to Shakespeare's work in the spirit. Which "Tempest" might be one of the most successful experimental films of all time. No, not experimentally like hand-held camera and mumbling dialogue, but experimentally like exploring the twists of a story without taking too much into the cashier's earnings. Mazursky's Tempest is epic, sad, realistic, joyful, full of life, but mostly, it is imaginative. Cassavetes depiction of Philip / Prospero is in itself worth a 10/10 rating, and when you get Gena Rowlands, Susan Sarandon, a wonderful deep Molly Ringwald, Raul Julia, the dialogue, the music and the beautiful suggestive spread tables in the picture ... I rest my case. One of the best movies of the 80's. Don't miss it.
