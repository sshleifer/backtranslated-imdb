Enjoy 'The Fragile Men' http://ow.ly/PTTp (my wife didn't, so I watched it in bits in a few days.) Judges are particularly confused - most agree that it's allegorical, but not of what; 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'Socialism', 'Capitalism'? <br /> <br /> Most people don't want to escape, and that is essentially prohibited, go with most of the options. <br /> <br /> So, probably you should suggest your favorite project. prejudice / prejudice / fear thereon. <br /> <br /> So I want to say it's about an a-epic life.
