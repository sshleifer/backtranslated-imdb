Although it was a movie of just under forty minutes, it is one of the best directed and performed stories I have ever seen. It reaches in less than 45 minutes, which most movies cannot be in over 90. <br /> <br /> This is the story of two brothers, one 18 and the other 10. They come from a poor farm family in Mississippi. Both are trapped in the war and the conflict of service, love for family. <br /> <br /> It brought tears to my eyes, especially because the whole movie acted and directed so well, and it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left behind. <br /> <br /> I fully recommend this movie as extraordinary!
