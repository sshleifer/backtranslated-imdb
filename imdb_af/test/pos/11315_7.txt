See this movie back to my 9/11 memories. The first thing I remember about that morning was the view of TV pictures of a plane flying into a large building, and my immediate thoughts "Must be a preview of a new Tom Clancy movie." <br /> <br /> It wasn't a Tom Clancy movie. This was definitely not a British version of "The sum of all fears". The typical Tom Clancy movie or novel has a relatively small role, a linear plot, and usually a kind of resolution. This movie doesn't. Certainly, what I saw directly on the screen was a small role, a plot and a vague resolution, but like 9/11, the point was that reality was so much bigger and more complex. <br /> <br /> I work in planning systems, and the reality of disaster preparation exercise, and the disaster itself, is painfully obvious. It is impossible to prepare such a disaster, and it will no longer be possible to handle it when it does. <br /> <br /> The argument between the police (Not enough is being done to prepare) and the politicians (To give everyone on the tube will be a gas mask), to the constant loudspeaker Announcements (You may not have any health hazard, but do not go home before we contaminate you), and (Do not eat, drink, or smoke before disinfecting you), I was on the verge of the whole movie. Not the slightest urge to navigate. <br /> <br /> This movie was 90 minutes long. It could have been twice, and still not showing all the possible details. Instead, it left unanswered to suggest each of us the details, each of us in our own way. This made it so much more to me than any Tom Clancy movie. <br /> <br /> Once in London, just outside of Edgeware Road. And I often took the train from Waterloo station. Looking at the Dirty War, I told myself it was just fiction. At the moment. <br /> <br /> Allah and Jehovah want to keep this fiction. And sometimes in 20 or 30 years, my cousins ​​can see this movie and remember the early 21st century, and the panic made us feel too much. Hopefully, as much as I do now, when I visit the memorabilia of the Cold War with the Angry Communist Regime of the mid-20th century and remember "Drop and Cover" exercises in school.
