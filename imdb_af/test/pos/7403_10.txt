All right, I'll say it. This movie made me laugh so hard it hurt. This statement may insult some of you who may think this movie is nothing more than a waste of film. But the thing most people don't get is that this movie is meant to be bad and terrible. I mean, did people really think that a movie about a killer was meant to be a masterpiece? Just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and you will find your answer. Instead, like the original Jack Frost (which I thought was just as funny), this movie has become a side-step in the depth of the stingy dialogue, bad one linen and horrible special effects. And it's all made to laugh at our viewers. It definitely worked for me. <br /> <br /> For example: Anne Tiler (for her troubled husband): What makes you so frown? <br /> <br /> If that piece of dialogue doesn't let you laugh, then you have serious issues. Who in their right mind would interpret those words in real life? Of course, nobody because it was meant to sound ridiculous! Just take one show of this open-minded and low-expectations movie, and hopefully you'll see what's so funny about Jack Frost 2.
