Here's another Antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again when it comes to tape or DVD. I saw it a few months ago when it ran for a few weeks for the first time (even in the metropolitan film stage LA!) And then disappeared (house audiences chose their own special area where older favorites like Antonioni and Resnais is only welcome as occasional curiosity.) <br /> <br /> Initially, I was disappointed, thought the pace was unbearably boring, and that the man had lost a chance (for years Antonioni found it difficult to find financing at an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his cannon; but to know Antonioni for what he was and how I initially responded to Blow-Up and the Passenger, I refused to judge until I saw the movie again. The next day I came back and I was not surprised that the movie keeps me going, making me aware of things I thought about and lost throughout my life, driving home in a contemporary environment, exposed to the first Once in 'L'Aventurra', the first time around forty years ago, an environment of subtle moods has formed which has so characteristic and fascinating alienation in the tone (and rather comedies) that I could not get enough. The scene with Malkovich, which sits on the finely colored swings on the windsurfing beach, with the weather so beautifully silver, and the Eno / U2 track in the background just flowing on its rhythm; it was still, but now the whole movie was just as big! What a strange phenomenon, the complex simplicity or the invisible complex that Antonioni's eye looks alone can pick up and communicate. The strange thing is, but at first glance it looks like some kind of softcover porn and it contains a lot of sex and the Maddeningly beautiful Sophie Marceau and many other international stars to divert you. This film is unmistakably Antonioni's core, but you won't make much sense, until you see it a few times and get used to its rhythm. For example, this is quite a funny movie with a deep sense of humor, something I didn't even notice, but turned on by another critic, and on many other performances noticed much joy (4 before they drew it) have and would "I'm back for more." If this film was properly promoted and people led to some degree how to approach it, I have no doubt that it would succeed on the art course as most of Antonioni's 60's. But the '60s are no longer and the movie will have to get its audience on the small screen where half of its beauty will even be lost in a letterbox DVD version (if and when released). I appeal to all movie notes general or esoteric to see 'Beyond the Clouds' and add a piece of magic to the tragic.
