carrying the same dark weaknesses that we all unfortunately possess: lies, deception, laziness, the list goes on. <br /> <br /> However, as an American, I was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist in today's existence. police force as reflected in the Duval County Sheriff Department's horrible detective and police murder of a white female tourist and a 15-year-old accused black youth. I shook my head in shame that detectives of their abusive work were protected while a young man's life was hanging in the crooked balance of justice. <br /> <br /> However, there is also a story of hope with our legal system and how poorly paid public defenders are held by their guns (irony meant) and forced the truth of the detectives. I wanted to fly to Florida and tell someone with influence who has a large public defense team in Duval County; those lawyers care for the "little" man and, above all, for justice. <br /> <br /> The other story line is about faith and family. Praise the accused's family and their strong Christian (give any dedicated religion) beliefs and wonderful family values. I hope they win their lawsuit against the Duval County Sheriff's Department. <br /> <br /> Bravo for justice !!! Bravo to the little guy !!!
