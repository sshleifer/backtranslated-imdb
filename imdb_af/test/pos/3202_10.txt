This movie blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison raid. After I looked at it, I saw I didn't know anything. The story is told by the relationship between the lawyer and the black prisoner. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were sounding. The flashback sequence in jail was wonderful. It's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage. It was so real. It was not just a big piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in a major chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper. I give it two inches.
