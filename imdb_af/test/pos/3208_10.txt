Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, smartest, sharpest, sarcastic and heartwarming television shows I've ever seen. (Secondly just after my favorite TV show of all time, F * R * I * E * N * D * S). The quick pace and numerous pop culture references can confuse some viewers, but once you catch the Gilmores roads, you'll be chopped for life. Just a few random comments, I recently (finally) started watching season 6 and wow! This is one of my favorite seasons so far. I love the Luke Lorelai thing and all the drama in the different episodes is (as always) exciting. The only thing I don't love so much is the surprisingly bad attitude and reckless acts that Rory suddenly "adopted". Unfortunately, I do not think so realistically and hope it is not just a way to raise more drama to keep the season strong. Overall season already and I can't wait for the next! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashly et al. "Tookie Clothespin"
