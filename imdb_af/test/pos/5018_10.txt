It's a movie with a theatrical message mixed with a few clever moments. Films like these are the vast grounds of big actors, they enjoy throwing the ball into open pieces like this. The Angel we don't see in old books and churches is quite a good change. It's hooked into Kevin Smith's play, Dogma, almost in the same slapstick vein. <br /> <br /> - = 0) Watch this movie for a good day after you've sucked it all out. Could it be that so many movies Is it difficult to be complicated that we forget the simple movements of movies like this? Perhaps one of the most enjoyable pieces I've seen for a while, I ran this one on VHS in a trash because someone's basement was flooded this summer and I grabbed a handful of tapes. <br /> <br /> Whether in a trash or on the silver screen, light comedies like this fun, you just don't have to tell everyone in a hip night club you like, or a heavy political party . Just keep it to yourself, and I'll bet many people borrow it from time to time.
