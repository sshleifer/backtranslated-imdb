Five minutes in, I started to feel naff, you have a completely unholy hero and his overweight fool in a friend. Seen it all before, yes right. I managed to get bored for a few hours. It's something I've got used to ... we don't all. Then after a few minutes of testosterone attacked insults and so, the truck appeared. Well, the filming techniques used to make it look fast are clumsy, but what cares! That truck is incredible! Soon, however, it was taken away again and we are back to the geek and his overweight friend. But now I'm satisfied that at least it won't be too terrible. I am constantly surprised by the cleverness of the film. There are so many jokes at their cost, it's like everyone in the world is here, except the two of them. The idea behind makeup and effects was a genius I swear. Believe me, if you are a man who misses you so many jokes in this movie, there is so much here that only a girl can understand. <br /> <br /> Brother Bob is by far the best mountain killer that can be found nowhere, the fact that he is sowing together only adds to the effect. There are, of course, many scientific facts here, but that is not always the case. When our 'hero' has a nosebleed and uses the blood to lead Brother Bob to death, it's now rubbish. There is no way that a nosebleed can be so bad and doesn't mean a cut artery or something. I'm all using too much blood, but it takes it too far. The weed jokes are a bit predictable, yet funny. And the way brotherhood reaches its end is more than classic. Overall, this movie rules, it really breaks out the exaggerated melodramatic pressure of horror we had so much in 2003-2005. The end of this move simply couldn't have been better. <br /> <br /> It is a definite must see for anyone who likes to keep their horror of various battles of gore and attitude.
