It is a "drama drama" of (mostly) the later years of KW's life, with virtually all the parts being played by actors (but playing the TV quartermaster himself!). It's made for the BBC4 art channel, but my guess is there will be syndication and DVD releases soon. KW is very much played by the excellent Michael Sheen, who repeatedly repeats his previous stage role. Most of the supporting role players are also very good, and a good touch is the relaxation of the era of TV appearances with the new actors. However, this is not a light idea. Anyone who is familiar with KW's diaries and general unhappy behavior already knows how he might be in later life. So don't expect 80 minutes of Carry On style buffooning, as the emphasis is definitely uncomfortable. Recommended, but it is indeed tragi-comic.
