It's great to see a new bundle of puppets that cause destruction in this series. I really enjoyed this chapter. In fact, this would probably be my second favorite in the series. This movie has very little violence and is only designated PG-13. This is especially different from the other R-rated puppet master movies loaded with gore and violent chaos. However, the lack of violence does not diminish fun. This movie also has especially better special effects than the last movie in this series. Good.
