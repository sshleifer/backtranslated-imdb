OK, I got the DVD series last week and I am finally going to post my reviews, but I liked it in many ways. <br /> <br /> Zombie Blood Bath 2: Craze of the Undead. OK. This one movie on a fast clip has some very good gore effects and some very well done atmosphere and style. I would actually say it would be one of the most beautiful DV kicks I bought. Most of the time I get very angry at DV movies because I'm boring and look like soup operas. Even a movie like Bones disease I love has amazing pieces of DULL. Not this movie. It never stops long enough to catch your breath. Although I wouldn't say I wanted it better than the first movie, I would say that Sheets certainly improved technically in the two years between the films. This one has better gores, the inevitable zombie feeding scenes, scumbag characters, and some backfire (though their roles are different), especially Jerry Angell, as a pretty good psychopath with a killer mullet from hell. The shots are more ambitious as well as the writing this time because you can tell that Sheets is trying to pull more than he did in the first movie. Some of it works and some of it doesn't work, but I have to say at least it's not just trying to make a bigger version of the first movie. There was no mention of a power station of chemical spill, just Satanism and the occult that bring the undead to life. So I say kudos to Mr. Sheets to try to do something else with this one. I give this movie two bloody thumbs up!
