I just wish I was eloquent enough to say how good this movie is. <br /> <br /> I ... it's hard to say. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'll just say what's going on. . <br /> <br /> I laughed. I really laughed. I could not believe it. I laughed, and it was not bitter. it was not cynical laughing. it was the laughter generated by real joy. <br /> <br /> Joy. this is a strange word for me. I don't often feel that word, but I did while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Sal. Maybe it's Will's face. He is a great person. "Smile on my face and there is a twinkle in my eye." The line in one of Will's songs describes him perfectly. He has "joie de vivre". Trey is a happy, happy boy to have a dad like Will. Jada is a happy, happy woman to have a man like Will. He's someone ... special. <br /> <br /> Happy. I really feel happy. It's a strange feeling. I don't feel very often. It's just fun to see, to see ... other people are really happy. I mean really happy. In this movie I did. As Will says in the movie, "Maybe I'm not happy with just" fine, "maybe I want" extraordinary. "You know, watch this movie make me think: so I do. <br /> <br /> Fun to be yourself We all know that we have to be ourselves, but we feel we are punished if we do, maybe it should be earned, maybe it is something that shows us long ago we have not been ourselves. That is why I just loved the end: Will, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, Amber Valleta, Julie Ann Emery, all dance at the wedding, dance without inhibitions. That at least I think I can (at least, I enjoyed it, happy and really happy). <br /> <br /> Ladies and gentlemen, I know nothing about relationships, but I feel. , I feel like connecting with someone, striving, pushing, being with someone. It seems to make life ... something else completely. I don't really know. but I felt something, watching this movie. I felt that that connection should be ... worth making, life worth it. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie it is. It's funny. It's CLEVER. This is TENDER. It calls for feeling. It made me think, maybe it might be, life is really a wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> Do you want to LET? Really want to feel good!
