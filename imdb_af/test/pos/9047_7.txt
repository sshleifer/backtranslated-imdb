Dexter (Kurt Russell) returns from The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes for a new adventure that can stand alone. Dexter, once the college student prone to the accident, has an idea for a formula to make things invisible. Dean Higgins (Joe Flynn) is less than impressed and hopes to win a lucrative science prize with the student studying bees. However, the bees hide the student and he appears to be allergic. There is a chance for a prize. But wait, Dexter does it! He is actually a fluid that makes him invisible. Trouble is, an unscrupulous businessman (Cesar Romero) learns about it and decides that he can use the formula, thank you, for something illegal. Can he steal the bottle from underneath Dexter's nose? It's a company movie to the TCWT, but one doesn't have to watch the first movie to enjoy this one. Russell is a brilliant trainer who comes through if it really counts. The rest of the role is also a dream, with Flynn, Romero, Jim Bacchus and others showing why their comic abilities are still highly regarded today. The writing is just innocent fun that is charming, with the special effects somewhat simple, according to today's standards but effective. If you want to sit down and relive a lost era or just want to share a G-rated movie with your family, it's a good choice. Although it is more than 30 years old, there is a great possibility that even your loved ones will even giggle the blues with a show of this fine movie.
