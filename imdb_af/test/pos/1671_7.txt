As for me, this film had two completely different things to it, unlike the film noirs I used to watch: 1 - the environment is Paris, France; 2 - There is a 28-minute scene without dialogue. <br /> <br /> Both make this movie a bit unique, at least to English-speaking movies. Actually, an American, Jules Dussain, shot the film, so it's not quite a European movie. Initially, I was disappointed in this after watching the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored. However, as soon as the silent segment started - the real lift (you already know what it is all about), the film picked up a lot and only improved and improved. <br /> <br /> In fact, I thought the best part of the story was what happened to the hoist. The best thing about the whole movie was cinematography. It makes the drive worthwhile. It is excellent film noir photography and a true travel record for those of us who have never seen Paris ... and this is Paris in the mid-1950s. There are many beautiful, but interesting, rainy Paris streets and buildings I have found fascinating to see. In fact, there were many more of those big shots than of London in the much better-known movie, The Third Man. <br /> <br /> The main actor in this, Jean Servais, thinks I'm also known to be interesting. Someone described his face as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton, making it perfect. A warning for those who don't expect a curse or nudity in a classic movie. It's France, not the United States, so there's a bit of both here. I appreciate the DVD which also offers the choice of subtitles or a dual version.
