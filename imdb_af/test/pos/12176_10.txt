I watched in the TV guide for movies coming from Germany and I have one called The Bunnwuards, so I watched it and I laughed myself lazily! I wanted the DVD, but it's not available here (I can order it from Germany, but it doesn't have captions). It's played again, so I paste it and watch it from time to time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I got information and found that his real name is Erkan & Stefan, but I know this by his Australian title: The Bunnyguards. <br /> <br /> Some people I know from Germany don't like Erkan & Stefan Because of their accents, but not German, I didn't notice anything. The jokes are good, but some Germans can scare off their accent. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is funny and if the DVD had English subtitles on all the extras (with a 2 disc release with only the subtitle function would be bad) I'll buy it at a time ! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a good story.
