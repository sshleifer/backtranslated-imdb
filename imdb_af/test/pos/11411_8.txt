The movie is about a girl who is not just going to a bonfire, because she is that night baby. Nothing strange about that, right? Until ... The phone rings. Until ... The phone calls again. And again ... And again. It's not a few stupid prank calls. It's for real. If you want to see how the girl responds, just watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Great atmosphere filled with scary sounds. Well done by young Camilla Belle who played the lead. I see in her a great potential to become a good actress. It's more than just a decent thriller, I have no idea why it is so underestimated. Anyway, in my opinion, this movie deserves more than just 4/10. 24% of all voters evaluated the movie by 1. Get serious, people. You can't get a better thriller for a title like this.
