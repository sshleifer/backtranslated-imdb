My friends and I went through a time when we were going to rent movies from which none of us ever heard. The only good thing about it was this movie, "Take it to Limit" Right when the movie started, we could tell we were in for a real classic. The music is probably done by rural white boys of Colorado, but it sounds like the early 90's rap. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad boy as well, especially to play a big session for the whole movie. This movie is based on climbing, and I'm not a climber, but even I think it's hilarious when they struggle to climb the climber and there's a guy in the background who basically walks on the "stone" . You don't want to miss this movie and you will see the same tracks over and over again. You will get surprises every turn. You will quote the memorable lines yourself. I recommend this movie to everyone. Take it snow. Disclaimer: This movie is poorly done, but it makes it wonderful
