When I first looked at Flatliners, I was surprised. It had all the necessary features of a good movie: the movie was excellent, the plot was excellent and in the case of exciters there was really a thrill. <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland presented a great show. as the male leader in the play, depicting a scientist who believes he can find the answers to life and death by killing himself and then resurrecting, to essentially steal the secrets of death. Kevin Bacon offers excellent performance as the more morally decent counterpart to Keifer, while Julia Roberts offers her most convincing role. William Baldwin portrays a student who is excellent in class and apparently intercourse. And Oliver Platt, in another excellent performance, portrays the voice of reason for the group and the most innocent. <br /> <br /> The story is relatively simple, but original, and the play is refreshing - definitely a lookout movie for the genre, and one that set the standard for measuring other thrillers for me. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
