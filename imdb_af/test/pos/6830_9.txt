The movie was good. Actually, the only reason I looked at it was Alan Rickman. What he didn't pull off the southern accent, but he did pretty well with it. Kent Emma Thompson did really well, she definitely pulled the southern accent. I love all the character in my opinion, none of them did badly, another thing I noticed. I've read all these comments and not one person commented on Alan 5-hour shadow. It made him look even better and he had almost one through the whole movie. I'll give the movie a 9 out of 10. Another of my opinions is that the movie would be better if there was no sex. Yet it was good. Love the scene where he says "Aw sh * t" when he is in his car and sees it in his mirror.
