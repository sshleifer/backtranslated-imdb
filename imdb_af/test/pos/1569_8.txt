As I understand some of the points that can be used with cinematography (I thought a more purposeful approach would support the lower fi, home movie feeling). I have to say I thought the WHAT ALICE FOUND script and acting was excellent! Dean Bell made a real gem that charmed Judith Ivey with character-driven joy. Her performance of Sandra is a pleasure - alternating, alternating, as diabolical and romantic. We were immediately intrigued and repelled by her actions ... and never gave more information than needed. Her and the supporting cast's efforts met Bell's postmodern fairy tale with arms wide open. Emily Grace's Alice is afflicted with a dead-eye magic. She looks like a clay in front of us, immersing in a beautiful, lost animal. Eventually we are in conflict with words, as she is, goodbye to her mother. Kudos must also be excavated to Jane Lincoln Taylor - whose mother offers the right amount of tragic historical weight - and Justin Parkinson - whose shy first-time John, Sam, offers one of the loveliest, if not, most uncomfortable sex scenes in film. Bell created a first-rate story and has an abundance of talent to make it.
