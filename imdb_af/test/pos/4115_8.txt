I really enjoyed this movie, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your chair. It was very well aimed. I think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobbys and showed them to people with emotions. Since this movie had to show Bobby as a cold and revenge-oriented person. <br /> <br /> I agree with another review, it was sick love, not true love. He doesn't have to go as much as killing to give his wife a baby. He had to be honest with her and told her he was sterile and decided to take a baby together. Some reviews say she was naive, I think she was when it came to adoption, but the best actors are everywhere. Great movie to watch !!
