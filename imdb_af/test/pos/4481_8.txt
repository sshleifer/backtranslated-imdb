I recently stumbled upon a TV show of "Passion ...." (missed the opening styles). Ms Currier is praised for the vision and courage to bring such a strange Balzac story to the screen. I am grateful for the entire casting and crew for their parts in producing such a thorough fine film. It had to be difficult to shoot so many scenes in the desert. And I can't understand how her coach coaxed such a fine "performance" of the leopard, Simoon. (This ad calls another exciting adventure, "Naked Prey"). Why is this movie no longer known? Hope I can find it on video.
