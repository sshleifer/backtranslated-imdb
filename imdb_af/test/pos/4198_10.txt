It's one of those movies where it's easy to see how some people don't like it. My wife had never seen it before, and when I repeated it last night, I waited for her to sleep. She may have been amused by a few small pieces, but I know she would have had enough in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> The chief has nothing like a conventional story. The film is solid in the psychedelic era. It can be seen as cinematic surrealism in a nutshell, or as a postmodern acid journey through movie genres. If you're not a big fan of those things - psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernism and "acid travel aesthetic" (if there is a difference between them), you should probably stay away from this movie. On the other hand, if you are a fan of those things, you should run and buy head if you haven't done so yet. <br /> <br /> Oddly, the film never received much respect. It probably has a lot to do with prejudice. The Monkeys - Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork - and The Monkees were a musical group of actors composed by producer Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for a child-friendly, bubble-gummy Beatles for a television series. In their era they had so much respect as Menudo, New Kids on the Block, The Spice Girls, and so on. As a co-IMDb judge rightly remarked, "Perhaps people in 1968, who have been thinking of the Monkeys as a foolish factory-made pop band coaching of the Beatles, refused to see (Head)." <br /> <br /> The Monkeys and Head have never been able to shed that negative public perception. It's a pity, because there was a lot of talent, both musical and otherwise, in The Monkees. It is probably nice that Rafelson, who works with Schneider here, and Jack Nicholson (yes, Jack Nicholson), who wrote the script and co-produced, decide to take The Monkees in this unusual direction. It is as if New Kids on the Block looked like an album similar to Pink Floyd's Ummagumma (1969) or Atom Heart Mother (1970). In fact, the songs in Head, written by The Monkees and regular associates such as Carole King and Harry Nilsson, have a Floyd-like quality, somewhere between the Syd Barrett era and the immediate post-Barrett era. This is much more prominent than any Beatles agreement. Some people have complained about the music in the movie, but to me all the songs are jewels. For that reason, some people like Barrett era (or others) like Floyd, who is just as difficult for me to empathize with. <br /> <br /> But what is that about? The basic essence is that The Monkees take a journey through several movie genres. There are war screens, adventure screens, horror scenes, comedy scenes, drama scenes, western scenes, sci-fi scenes, romance scenes, and on and off. Besides, in the film's reality, it seems to happen (if not exclusively) on a studio lot. At root we look at The Monkees shooting a movie. Of course, all the screens in the different genres have something surreal and self-referring to them, and they, and individual shots within a scene, tend to lead to each other using dream logic that is no different to the Monty Python television program. As a dream, the head tends to flee between a good dream and a nightmare, while it is often one that makes you sleep (something I do regularly). <br /> <br /> Technically, Rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to realize the above. There are scenes with extensive negative images. There are many very fast cuts (including a good sequence in which Davy Jones and Tony Basil alternate in a white and black room, with a combination of white and black inverted in each one which occasionally varies as fast as two frames once), there are many bizarre victories, there is an animated cowboy, there are strange editors, and so on. For my money, I wish these things were not just a remnant of the psychedelic era. This is the kind of artistic approach I enjoy. It seemed to be a good idea and I still think it's a good idea. I would like to use movies like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004) with this type of extended technique. Now it would make the movie surreal. <br /> <br /> Interpretatively, some people who are not so in line with acid travel aesthetic, complained that it basically b. Providing meaning for something intended not to have any. I do not even agree with such a pessimistic / nihilistic view; Head was meant to have a lot of meaning (s), and it's not just movies without conventional stands that have several interpretations. Nicholson, Rafelson and Schneider have many interesting things to say about The Monkees - the film's postmodern commentary on their manufactured status; popstardom - gone before Pink Floyd, Chief clogged popstardom and violence, from images of war to images of fans who break down their idols cannibalist; and naively US-oriented ideas of international perceptions and respect - well-armed aliens in a desert surrender to Micky Dolenz, just because he is an American, then they blow a Coke machine (again in the desert) to him because he thirst and cannot access. The film comments on many other topics - from large industry to police, recordings, spectators (especially in connection with tragedies), and over and over. Head is full of ideas, enough, with intelligent, multiple things to say about them. <br /> <br /> Head deserves to be considered a classic - basically shooting for the same atmosphere as The Beatles' Yellow Submarine. Both premiered in November 1968, interesting enough, and both were meant to be a summary of the psychedelic aesthetic. Yellow Submarine was not quite successful. Head is everything Yellow Submarine should have been.
