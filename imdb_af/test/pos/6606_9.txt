A dozen bored surfers, mostly children in Venice, California, not only realize the skateboard, but relive a once-off forgotten suburban whim from the 1950s into an action sports revolution. <br /> <br /> Story by Sean Penn, Dogtown portrays life in the more rounded "locals" beach communities in 1974, which mostly consisted of surfing in the early morning tide and laughter. The Zephyr team (or Z-boys as they are called) spend one summer against boredom by building their own boards with the help of a local owner who owns a surf shop. After re-entering emerging skateboard competitions in SoCal, they are all transformed into their own scene; one that generates a generation of skateboarders, consisting of sizes such as Tony Hawk, Shaun White and the creators of X-Games. <br /> <br /> Dogtown sits chronologically in skateboarding, and the on-the-boat streams history you've never known. <br /> <br /> by Andy Frye at MySportsComplex.blogspot.com
