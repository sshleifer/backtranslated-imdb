Hey, everyone you hustlers, you rock jackets, you mean dudes. Get out of sight Save is back in town! If you're looking for a bad ass, funky movie to watch a night, it's just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to make it easy. After his adventures in Mexico relax. But if you're a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you're bound to take revenge. Why I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Anyone who. The movie starts with the old "plane killing" routine. We all know that this is the most effective way to take one man in a picnic, full of people. Needless to say Slaughter survives the ordeal, but Cmndt. Eric Lassard, sorry George Gaynes, I mean, isn't that happy. SKIP !! Slaughters best friend Pratt is also murdered. This is the start of a great adventure filled with the latest, funniest music that James Brown has to offer himself. It's right 'The Godfather of Soul' has put his trademark on this bad boy. In addition to starring Jim Brown, this movie is filled with some of the biggest names the blax exploitation scene offers. What about Scatman Crothers, Dick Anthony Williams, Gloria Hendry and Brock Peters. In other parts we see none other than Judith M. Brown and last but definitely the least the fantastic Don Stroud as the evil henchman.
