Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensitivity. The success of the film depends on the finishing of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he manages control over his employees - until the Christmas spirit invades him. The role is a 'walk in the park' for Greenstreet who was one of the stage's Falstaffs when he was part of the Lunts company. Greenstreet entered movies five years earlier when he was a classic in the age of 61, the first and best film, John Huston, ever directed: The Maltese Falcon. 'Hugs' Sakall was probably never better in his traditional role than the embodiment of Middle European gemutlicheit. The attractive set used by most of the films is an eye-catching gem.
