This movie is not the scariest of all time, but it is a good example of a champion-like horror movie - low budget, no stars, many inventive deaths and enough nudity to keep the teens in their seats. The premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well. A good starting point for "Just Say" Julie Brown exposed her talents early in her career. This movie will not be seen by many, but for fans of 80's horror this is a must.
