I saw the "Death in Venice" in 1971 about 15 years ago, it moved deeply and often thought about it. I watched it again a few days ago, and I realized that it was near the top of the great work of the theater. With almost no dialogue, it captivates a viewer with beautiful cinematography, the fine acting, and especially the Mahler's music from which the film simply does not exist. <br /> <br /> "Death in Venice" is a beautiful Luchino Visconti's adaptation of the Thomas Mann novella to a well-known composer (in the novella he was a writer, but made him a composer in a movie It was a wonderful idea that Gustav von Aschenbach (loosely based on Gustav Mahler) who travels to Venice in the summer of 1911 to recover personal losses and professional failures, his quest for beauty and perfection seems to be complete as he Seeing a son of incredible divine beauty, Ashenbach (Dirk Bogard) follows the boy everywhere and never tries to approach him.The son, Tadzio, belongs to many rare creatures who possess a mysterious and unthinkable power that captivates you, conquers you, conquering you and making you the prisoner, Ashenbach became one of Tadzio's spellbinding prisoners, becoming addicted to him, falling in love with him, was it blessing or cursing for him? unattainable, impossible, but beautiful e love that was perfection itself. The last image captured by Ashenbach's eyes was that of the boy's silhouette surrounded by the sea and golden sunlight. Nothing can be compared to the beauty and charm of the scene, and taking it with you to the grave is the death you can only dream of. If he could, Ashenbach would probably have said: "I could see one of the faces of perfection, I couldn't bear it, but I was chosen to learn that it exists here, in this world and I can now die in peace because it happened to me. "<br /> <br /> Unforgettable music, Gustav Mahler's ghostly adagietto of his fifth symphony, has been perfectly used in a perfect movie. It reflects every emotion of a main character - it sighs, longs for it, begs for hope, and summarizes the idea that when you are blessed to meet beauty, you are condemned to die. I can come up with hundreds of movies that use classical music perfectly, but nothing will ever compare to death in Venice. I dare say Mahler's music is his main character - it will change and sound differently depending on what is happening on the screen. It sounded triumphant when Ashenbach returned to Venice, after what he thought, she would be lucky, but she died. It sounds gloomy when he enters Venice from the sea. You can hear so many different feelings about it and worship, confusion and self-pity, worship and melancholy, but always - LOVE giving purest happiness and breaking hearts (literally). The viewer movie is similar to what the boy was to the aging composer / writer / artist. We were captivated and captivated by its power and beauty as much as Achenbach was through the boy's mysterious charm.
