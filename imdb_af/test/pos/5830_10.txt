I admit I almost stopped watching TV shows. Why? Because most of them are about doctors, forensics or a girl / boy, who can predict a murder by sitting on the toilet seat. But I have to say I was wrong when I watched Oz's first episode, one of the most brilliant shows on TV today. Oz is a show about maximum safe prison and shows episodes in the life of every cellphone in jail and their frustrations. What I like about this performance is the fact that it has the courage to show real life in jail without any annoying characters, stereotypes and unrealistic dialogues. Even thought the characters in the show were not supposed to be heroes, you quickly attached them and their lives. Sure, they are a lot of violence in this show and some disturbing images of rape and drugs, but this is the point of this show; to indicate how brutal and frustrating life can be in prison ... hey, you can't show life in jail like a "clean environment" with "equal characters" right? Oz is perfect in all respects, the actors do an excellent job and the whole hour of this show is really going to be very fast. The only thing I did not like in this show was the last season of the show, I think it got too strange and brutal and the final was not satisfactory. But overall Oz is still my favorite TV show so far, it surpasses Sopranos and millions of CSI and Dr. House crap with just a capital letter. Brilliant display that the balls have to show which other shows take away from us; realism.
