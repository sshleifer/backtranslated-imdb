This movie does not have stereotypes or dance movements or line lines. This film is about the vulnerability of people's hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play in a convincing role, which Will Smith could do without action, and that such a wrinkled movie genre could succeed in such a way. I'm not going to sound too much with this movie - it wasn't a pioneering work in any way - but it was a movie worth seeing. Was it credible? No. New York couldn't be that simple and there was no one in the history of humanity who has Hitch's "hutzpah". Sure, there are bar-studs, but not those who can get any chick, at any time - except those that of course shelf in seven numbers. The thing that worked best for this movie was the real focus on the dramatic side of things, not just on the comedy. It was a funny two hours, no doubt. But it was also two hours of sitting in your seat, immersing in the characters and smiling.
