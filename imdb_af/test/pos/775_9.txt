I watched this movie on ITV and I enjoyed it very much. It was very viewable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters gets a special mention as she creates a wonderful variety of interesting characters to watch. Ben's character is a little shy and Stoic, but the changes he has undergone have been performed by Rupert Grint. I will definitely say he has a future to play with Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney is pretty good at her role as Ben's overall protective mother, the only thing they went wrong with was making her too. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast with his mother, and in the end he is also honorable. The only character I didn't pay attention to was Bryony, she was a little simple and unnecessary. I thought. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch. One of my favorite films of the year is easy.
