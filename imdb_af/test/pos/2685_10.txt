It is by far the funniest sitcom ever broadcast on TV. I've been on DVD for 9 seasons and could literally watch them over and over. Anyone who doesn't find this spectacle hilarious, heart-warming, entertaining, and laughing out loud hysterically, is crazy! Kevin James is one of the most talented comedians out there. My boyfriend and I love comedy shows in Boston (where we live), and once saw Kevin James and his brother Gary Valentine (Danny). They are both incredibly talented and just plan smart with their work. There are so many comedians out there who are just awful and Kevin and Gary really show the real side of the real comedy. Leah Remini, although a real-life snob and bitch (so I read) is a great actress and earns more credit than any other sitcoms woman. She really makes the show ... with Jerry Stiller! This show is a must see and you will become addicted within one to two episodes!
