If you haven't seen it, look out. It is available on DVD. It is a channel 4 (uk) production, possibly in conjunction with German and Danish TV. If you've seen the movie, it's basically the same graph. Several interleaved stories are linked by the drug trade. The story goes between the housewife (played by the excellent Lyndsay Duncan) to complete an agreement on behalf of her husband, which to her surprise is an international drug dealer (and generally dangerous man). <br /> <br /> A minister, embedded in his work to the detriment of his family, is investigating the whole state of affairs with international drug trafficking. He gets some eye-catchers for the reality of heroin when his daughter has a "problem". He then officially visits Pakistan, where he seems to have learned that the abuse (not just the drug or its accidental use) is the problem and can also produce some (an excellent scene at which he at the same time realizes the appeal) and why this is and why it is such a problem). In Pakistan we get the other side. The despair of farmers who can barely survive to turn to opium production and crime leaders. The useless effort to subsidize the system gets rich. And a country so drenched in drugs just a relative fraction of the abuse we have in the west. To this end, a customs officer / interpol agent tries to catch the 'Dutch' bond in heroin trafficking. Looking for justice for his murdered partner. It's really a masterpiece. Super, underestimates the actions of all the main players in a way that only European films can really do. <br /> <br /> Must see. Especially when you watch the movie, they compliment each other and offer subtle different opinions / attitudes on either side of the dam.
