Somehow, this movie dug it in the soft spot of my heart. Don't ask me how this happened, but I'm supposed to have the movie feature Ed. I'll sponsor something. McMahon as a tail hunter had a bit to do. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I was disappointed with Slaughter's first outing in 1972. Nothing more than a quick throw to follow Shaft mania. How's the sequel away from this? Big Jim Brown looks stronger than Slaughter here than in the first. Perhaps this is due to the fact that one year later he had something to work on instead of his simple "Be like Shaft" motivation. <br /> <br /> The outstanding part of the movie is the soundtrack by pimp dad Dad one, James Brown. Almost every scene is characterized by a touch of funk by the Godfather. An excellent time movie, for music, wardrobe, vehicles, lingo and hair. I should also point out that this film is also a great time film to propose a time in movie history when Jim Brown and Ed McMahon can actually grow. <br /> <br /> Double the chicks, double the double, triple the body setting, and factor in Ed McMahon and James Brown. You will soon be for one hell of a 70-year action movie, and one that eliminates the predecessor is no less. For my money, Slaughter's Big Rip-Off can play ball with any Blaxploitation movie ever made. Even Shaft. Chances are you won't agree, but Slaughter's Big Rip-Off has its own distinct feel. Something missing the original.
