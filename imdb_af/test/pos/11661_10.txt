I had seen this movie four or five times, and it gets better with each look. That's enough to say: This is the best movie I've ever seen. And I think I saw a lot. <br /> <br /> But I always wondered why this movie was mutilated in some reviews or ratings. For example, take the IMDb Top 250. Why does it only rank at # 216 (from today)? Certainly, the answer is not in the movie itself (because it is nothing but flawless), but in its reception. The film caused controversy in his portrayal of compassion for a convicted murderer and his anti-death sentence. And so, of course, the more conservative-wise user probably didn't look the movie (as you can see from some other comment). So DEATH MAN WALKING gets a position that is nothing but ridiculous about its quality. Those people didn't understand what the movie was going to say, and maybe they didn't want to understand because they were death sentences. So now I get it: it's all politics. You're pro-death sentence. You don't like (and therefore don't want to) hear what the movie has to say. <br /> <br /> I'm really sorry there are so many people out there who simply outline when a new perspective questions their beliefs. <br /> <br /> Mr. Robbins, your movie's edition, divides people's views. Some have reconsidered their views, some just haven't listened, but you've made a very important point. Your movie will probably never appear on any "TOP 100 FILMS OF ALL TIME" list, but it will be remembered long after films like Braveheart or Babe or Apollo 13 (unfairly elected to your movie at the 1996 Oscar) are forgotten. Congratulations, Mr. Robbins, and thanks for this important movie entertainment.
