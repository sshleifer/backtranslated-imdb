OK, I don't spoil that it's the typical gay love life, but since when is straight romance in real life as they are on the screen? This movie is well balanced with comedy and drama and I really enjoyed it. It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving playing a sex-obsessed gay property seller who uses his clients' homes for his prostheses with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander). And only after seeing him in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, the previous day, he's probably one of the most secure in their masculinity actors. :) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male bonding scenes were a hoot. Thumbs up! 8/10
