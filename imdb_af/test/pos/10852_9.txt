I loved this movie. Not because of the romantic story lines between women, but for the visualization of human power, despair and liberation. This movie is a must see. Entertainment Like! Emotional! Fascinating! All the characters are very well written and portrayed by many talented actors. This story is a story of self-discovery and sexual awakening. A journey of mind, body and soul. You find yourself identifying with the characters and on some points, even the storyline. <br /> <br /> I must say I recommend watching the movie first, then read the book. Once you read the book, you will be slightly disappointed. The performance of the show has cut down a lot and some things have changed. Some for the better and some for the worst.
