This movie gave me more than I expected, and I was fully prepared to cry. The play mainly performed this film, with excellent representations of Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, as well as the supporting role. These actors portrayed so intense characters that they were hanging with me for the rest of the night, and I had trouble shaking these war drama. The costumes and cinematography were also magical, but did not carry them away. They didn't focus, but added the whole effect. Cold Mountain can never be my favorite movie, since that title always belongs to the English Patient, but it is in the top five. The story itself was well developed and remained fairly unpredictable. I didn't guess what the next line was. A heartbreaking story about humanity and war. In fact, this movie was so strong that it was hardly noticeable in the 19th century. It seems to be applicable at all times.
