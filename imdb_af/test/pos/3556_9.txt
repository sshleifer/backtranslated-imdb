I hardly got 'Hi-De-Hi!' Not seen. I think it should have been the title that scared me off. In those days, Welsh language editions of 'The Radio Times' only used to print titles of certain programs without giving a scrap of information about what they actually were. "Hi-De-Hi! "showed me a bad quiz hosted by Leslie Crowther, or a weaker US import. But I managed to catch a later episode and was surprised to find it by Jimmy Perry and David Croft. <br / > <br /> As was the case with 'Dad's Army' and 'It's not Half Hot Mum', Perry relies on personal experiences, in this case his time at a Butlins holiday camp. Before cheap air travel in the sixties came, these camps along the British coastline emerged, provided entertainment for working class families and earned millions for their owners. <br /> <br /> (For the sake of interest I worked in One such a camp in the 80's as' a chef - Barry Island, South Wales - known to everyone and others as 'Shag Land' for reasons I don't go!) <br /> <br /> Set in the late 50's, it started with the university Academic Jeffrey Fairbrother (Simon Cadell) to take over as Maplin's entertainments manager, a job he was ill equipped to handle. His staff include resident comic Ted Bovis (Paul Shane), his sidekick Spike (Jeffrey Holland), miserable Punch and Judy man Mr.Partridge (Leslie Dwyer), snobby ballroom dancer Barry (Barry Howard) and Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves) Diane Holland ), and the memorable Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc), who listened to Fairbrother on every occasion. Bubbly Su Pollard stole the show as cleaner Peggy Ollerenshaw, whose management destination was a "Yellowcoat" (all the key staff members carried them). A number of sexy girls also occupied these coats, especially Nikki Kelly's 'Sylvia' and statuary Rikki Howard's 'Betty'. We have never seen the owner Joe Maplin. He communicated to his staff in the form of grammatical missions, which poor Jeffrey had to read aloud. "Hi-De-Hi!" was the campers' greeting, usually met with the equally ominous Ho-De-Ho!. <br /> <br /> One fan was the late Sir Fred Pontin, who told Perry and Croft that he recognized the most real-life characters. <br /> <br /> I've always found Bovis the best. as well as the most tragic, like Archie Rice, he had reduced the comedian whose big break had never come to entertain drunk late-night audiences. He made use of his position to enjoy some benefits, and in an unforgettable episode, Fairbrother's patience broke and he blew him: "Lies, Ted! All lies!". As with every other Perry / Croft series, the throw was excellent, especially Cadell and Shane. Ruth Madoc's fun 'Gladys' came to my nerves (no wonder Anne Robinson hated the Welsh!), But Leslie Dwyer's misanthropic' Mr.Partridge 'and Felix Bowness' jockey' Fred Qulley 'more than compensated. <br /> <br /> The visual gag everyone remembers is drunk. Patrick, who detects a pantomime horse riding a real one along the beach. He looks at the bottle of whiskey in his hand and decides to stick with it and throws away the banana he has eaten! <br /> <br /> With its foamy mix of 50-year-old nostalgia and bad gags, Hi-De'Hi was a big hit for the BBC in the 80s, making a massive increase in Butlins reservations and Pontins. It went downhill when Cadell left to return to that theater. I never took his replacement, the Squad Leader Clive Dempster (David Griffin). Worse, Leslie Dwyer's death robbed the show of one of his best characters. Kenneth Connor was introduced to replace him as 'Uncle Sammy'. <br /> <br /> The period sometimes caused problems. In one episode, Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to save Peggy who for some reason was dressed as a shark. The revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that era. Yet they looked good in them, so who complains? In another, Ted sang the Tom Jones hit "Delilah" for campers. It was not compiled until 1968 by Les Reed and Barry Mason. <br /> <br /> Maplins closed its doors in 1988, and the last shot was Peggy (now a yellow jacket) alone in the camp, jumping in the air and shouting (what else?) 'Hi-De-Hi !. <br /> <br /> I don't see it as high as Perry and Croft's other performances, but its popularity is unmistakable. It was probably one of the last British sitcoms to gain a great public love, mainly because it characterized similar characters in a recognizable environment. Good night campers!
