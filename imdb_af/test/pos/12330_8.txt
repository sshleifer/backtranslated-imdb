I can't describe the feeling if I got these crazy VHS rental cases in my hands about 20 years ago. Somehow I got my dad to rent it for me and I watched it twice with my little brother. Yes, we have nightmares. This film was originally regarded as PG in the US, in many other countries, including Finland, it was below 18 or 16 limited. The movie was aimed at teenagers, but it must be the prettiest PG-rated movie ever. There is no bad language or nudity in what ever it is. Originally made in 1981, it remained on the shelves for a few years before release. <br /> <br /> It's an A-Class B movie, a real, well-made 80's horror flick. A lot of college girls decide to spend a night in a mausoleum without knowing that a supernatural evil is waiting. <br /> <br /> You can almost smell the rotten flesh and feel the atmosphere of this movie. It's campy, totally stupid, but they can't make these movies anymore. There is definitely a sense for this 80's horror genre. This one is still effectively eager and entertaining after all these years. <br /> <br /> The effects are just the quality of Ellis Burman Jr. and Thomas R. Burman. The makeup effects play a major role in this movie, otherwise it would be just a boring teenage cat. <br /> <br /> It's now only available on DVD and it's a special edition DVD, including some extras. Note trace is interesting. <br /> <br /> (In fact, this version is not that special. Under the average DVD transfer, some glitches and scratches here and there). Initially, it will be released by the Blue Underground, but unfortunately it was canceled, so Shriek Show released it without restoring pressure. Too bad!) <br /> <br /> Great date movie! <br /> <br /> Recommended !!! <br /> <br /> Note! I only gave 8 out of 10 because of the "nostalgic values", otherwise 6 out of 10
