I love this movie. Initially I didn't expect much from this movie, as I didn't hear anyone talking about it and it looked like it was on video shortly after it was opened in the theaters. I also didn't think David and Minnie would make a good pair. (I expected many of the screenshots, as I saw "You've Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.) Personally, I think Joely Richardson should play Minnie's role and vice versa. I don't know, I just think Joely had to stay with David in the movie longer. They were perfect for each other. But it just shows that in a movie the girl next door always gets the man. :) (Like in "While you sleep".) However, I was very wrong. This movie was fantastic !!! Everything was done brilliantly. Bonnie Hunt had a good job of directing. The lines were perfect with the wise cracks everywhere. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING: SPOILERS START !!! *** <br /> <br /> I love how everything interweaves. For example, in the beginning, Elizabeth and Bob talked about Italy, and eventually Bob Grace met in Italy. Sydney (the monkey) does the deal with Grace as he did to Elizabeth is also an example. <br /> <br /> *** NOTICE: SPOILERS END NOW !!! *** <br /> <br /> One thing I didn't like about the movie was that it was a bit unrealistic. Well, I just don't think a man could come over his wife in a year if she was the only woman he'd ever been with his whole life. You'd think he'd isolate the world for years before he even came out of his house to talk to someone. Instead, he goes on a blind date a year later and immediately falls in love with a woman he has never seen in his life, but feels connected. <br /> <br /> Everything was a great movie. It cried me two or three times, and I laughed many times (the scene in the restaurant with Bob's discerning date for bottled water was hilarious!). It's definitely there with great romantic comedies like "You've Got Mail", "Sliding Doors" and "While You Were Sleeping". <br /> <br /> Get it today!
