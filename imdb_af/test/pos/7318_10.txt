This is one of the Stooges shorts. It was the only one of their shorts to be nominated for an Oscar. In this brief, the Stooges play doctors, which usually cause problems. These cards have non-stop sight-gags, words and jokes. The part at the end, where the Stooges breaks the machine apart. It's definitely a classic. I would briefly recommend these Three Stooges.
