A few less than inspired opening string music in spite of, we know somehow it's going down, it's straight to the "great fun" loading. By the time we observe Monica Dolan (in a real genius piece), it was cleared up earlier than Cora, but we were addicted, but it was only later when she revealed herself in her wonderful screen-making, confusing, twilight. an undisputed queen of murder and deception in the guise of the incessant girl. Gilchrist says she not only effortlessly steals the whole telemovie for herself, but merely includes the screen that someone who comes close to her, including the pleasing David Suchet, who herself looks a little bedazzled by her acting talents and, very gentleman , allow her to take center stage. Dolan is the real engine of the movie and her girlfriend. Gilchrist, a really well-rounded character in this Christie version, aided by a stubborn script and the fast track - and also by the rest of the role played by Geraldine James and Dominic Jephcott. everyone shows signs of sympathy for the given material and plays with it. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are as usual on fire, and if there are weaker links, they can be found in the relatively substandard music party. the majority of later Poirotte, and perhaps also in the absence of a genuine Italian born actor for the role of Cora's husband. Unlike this, it is half an hour of pure television delight that is just as offensive and entertaining as it is lovingly composed.
