I really enjoyed this movie. It's hard to find a star that can convincingly convince the physical aspects of any sports / dance theme movie and do a first-class acting work. In this movie you will find two stars that lead to the event. Both women provide warm, touch and sometimes humorous performances. The film also touched on several topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. And yet the approach was not heavily handed over. The production values ​​were also for a small budget film. I saw it at the Philadelphia Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and looked back to see it a second time. It was a real multitude of fun. Everyone I spoke to seemed to enjoy this movie.
