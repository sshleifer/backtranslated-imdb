An interesting piece for true documentary by John C. Holmes. Unfortunately, that's not what Holmes eventually killed, and it certainly benefited. Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg received the most praise for this, but I felt the right stars were Julianne Moore as the cocaine sniffing mom wannabe, Don Cheadle as a black man struggling with identity as a pornstar / stereo salesman in some wild herbs and William. H. Macy, whose wife is the ultimate slut. Not to mention an almost unrecognizable Alfred Molina. Macy's New Year's Eve and Cheadle's chance for a better life after a drug-match robbery went wrong is probably the two best scenes in the movie, or at least the two best shots. What this film does best shows how power can easily corrupt in its various forms. However, none of the characters learn anything about their dark downward spiral as they all return and return to their normal lives.
