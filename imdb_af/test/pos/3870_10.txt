The animation is still the slightly rougher style of the first episode, Simpsons Roasting on an open fire, but even with this first regular episode, Bart the Genius, the humor is starting to appear more "layered", faster and greater characterization already. <br /> <br /> This episode definitely sets Bart a slacker personality, and more subtly, Lisa's intellectual superiority to the whole family. Although it is the main theme of the entire episode (there is also a nice secondary theme of Bart and Homer's father / son relationship), it is first given to us in a nutshell, as the episode with the Simpsons Scrabble begins. Lisa comes up with "id" for her word - short, but something you need to know well. She should read the definition for the rest of the family in the dictionary, which serves as a way to set up the bank. Margin can only come with "he". Homer has "oxidized" already on his tray, but does not admit it is a word, so he offers "do" instead. Bart comes up with "kwyjibo", which he insists is a word. Similarly, in the main chart of the episode, Bart is cheating on his IQ test, leading to the fact that he is placed in a special school full of gifted children. We know it won't last long. <br /> <br /> "The Simpsons" have always had lots of fun with different characters of intellectual abilities among people through its characters, and more importantly, they have the way people with different degrees of intellectual abilities fit (or not) is accepted (or not) and is observed in society. Aside from the beginnings of Bart, Lisa, Homer and Marge's place in this context, this episode begins to reverence with the fun of nerds and geeks outside the Simpsons family. Through some of the students' dialogue at the special school, as well as some of the other references, including pure visuals, this episode also shows that "The Simpsons" will not draw any by writing or speaking to she heard. It can only be a cartoon, but it is a cartoon that will understand intellectuals, geeks and nerds more than anyone else. And the fact that it is just a very funny show is the key to the show's long life.
