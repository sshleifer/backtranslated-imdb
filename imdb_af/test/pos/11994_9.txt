Everyone is entitled to an opinion. The only critic who counts is yourself. I think it's a good movie. Much better than the original. <br /> <br /> In "Caddyshack" Rodney Dangerfield is funny but unpleasant. He was asked to do the successor, but things got in the way. Jackie Mason shows the saying that "less is more". He is funny, but a man with real family issues, a more rounded person. It's not a drama, but a movie that makes you feel. In fact, in some points, you feel sorry for Jackie Mason, especially if his daughter runs out on him. <br /> <br /> It has a good soundtrack, and overall, sorry. A good end to the series. <br /> <br /> In the TV show "Alf" Alf says he called out in "Terms of Endearment". The wife, Kate Tanner, played by Anne Schedeen, also says he cried at Caddyshack 2.
