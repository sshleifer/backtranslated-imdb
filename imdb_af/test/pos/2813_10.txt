When I saw the preview for this movie, I thought to myself: "Here is another silly TV movie written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera," but when I saw it, I was surprised. . Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and prove she can act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Eric near and again Eric), but loses confidence in him than A series of rapes are starting to take place in her community. Initially she was blinded by his assurance that he was innocent and her love for him, but over time she was still following him. <br /> <br /> While it looks like the setup for another boring melodramatic TV movie, it's much better than that, because the characters are well activated by Thiessen and Close, and the movie's script allows them to be much more complicated and intelligent than you would expect; It's not just caricatures or cardboard characters that just exist to move the plot together, but real, three-dimensional people, and we really care. And the movie is clever enough that it can provide an exciting, climax to the story without using silly action scenes, senseless clichés or cheap melodrama. Instead, we share in the main character's inner conflicts and fears and are given a realistic portrayal of how they can solve them and do the right thing. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to take a look at this one, please do so. The production values ​​are not exactly top (it's a TV movie), but if you look past, there's a great story to enjoy.
