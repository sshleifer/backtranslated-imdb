Crossfire is a fantastic film noir that is both a product of its time and a timeless classic. This movie achieves it by addressing issues that were not screened before the 1947 edition, and by being a high quality movie that up to now with a good screenplay, good looks and fantastic performances by its actors entails. The first American film to tackle the issue of the anti-Semitism head has been trapped in classic status by Crossfire. In the Second World War America, a rogue vodunit is being developed after a Jewish man has been killed. <br /> <br /> The story is wonderful, its anti-hate theme wrapped in a dark multiple-character crime thriller, and alongside the anti-Semitism corner are also some important post-World War II dialogue and themes. Unlike other riddles, the audience is warned against who the offender is almost immediately. However, the story of the movie is still seeing, because the battle of all the great characters involved goes through and tries to make sense. Outside the great overall story and themes, the entire script is just clever, complete with meaningful messages and razor-sharp exchanges between characters. <br /> <br /> The film's fascinating story is played wonderfully by its excellent role. Robert Young is fantastic as Capt. Finlay, the leading investigator of the murder case. Finlay is my favorite character of the movie, he is just a cool character - dry like bone and hard like a two-and-four and stop nothing to fix the killer. Robert Mitchum is also fantastic in the movie, very lively in his softly spoken army of Sergeant character because of his beautiful screen presence. Gloria Grahame gives a memorable performance in her little Oscar-nominated role; George Cooper also does a good job as the sick and distressed Corporal Mitchell; Paul Kelly gives an ominous portrayal of a bizarre character; and Steve Brodie, Sam Levene, Jacqueline White and William Phipps also give strong support. Robert Ryan ends up talking about the film exporter, who gives a cold show like Montgomery and is also nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Crossfire has a tremendous appearance. Director Edward Dmytryk does an extraordinary job of performing the movie and filmmaker J. Roy Hunt doing a masterpiece with his black and white picture. Crossfire's photo is as dark and grateful as its themes, covered in shade with an almost shiny overtone, but also very raw in parts. Ironically, the film's great appearance was not the result of hard work - or even intention. Mostly, I wanted to spend more time and money on the actors rather than the lighting - so he did. Less light, less preparation (about 6 hours working day), and this resulted in a fantastic movie. Not only a well-done piece of cinematic art, Crossfire is also a great example of a cheap movie that ends with a rich classic.
