Both of them betrayed their country for top secret information. <br /> <br /> Directed by the late Oscar winner: John Schlesinger (Believers, Eye for an Eye, Midnight Cowboy) made an interesting character drama about two boys. men who take the wrong path in life. Oscar winners: Hutton and Penn are both extremely good at the film. The movie is sometimes funny and disappointing at times. David Suchet almost steals the show as the man working for the Soviet Union. This photo has a familiar role in supporting roles. It was quite underestimated when it was first released. Despite some good reviews by some of the best film critics. This picture is actually based on a true story. There are some bugs in the storytelling, like these two main characters, but overall, it's a movie worth seeing. Based on a novel by Robert Lindsey. Screensaver by Oscar-Winner: Steven Zaillian (American Gangster, Hannibal, Schindler's List). (**** / *****).
