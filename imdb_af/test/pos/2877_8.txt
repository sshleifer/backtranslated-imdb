So the WWE did it. They surrendered in film, their first one being Sea No Evil, headed by their own Kane. I caught this movie and didn't expect it to be a good movie. It just clipped and looked like nothing new. To my surprise, it wasn't really bad. A viewer mentioned above is that it's a good B-horror movie fun, and it's honestly the best way to describe it. Now the question I asked myself was how did Kane stand ... Well, let's just say he made a very bad ass out of the 'Jacob Goodnight' character. He sold the roll very well, and really looked. But what can you expect from someone who is nearly 7 feet tall and weighs about 320 in solid muscles. The play was decent, and the story was nothing new, but we all know it. The directing as well as the cinematography was done very well and the hotel background looked really decayed and well done. Being directed by a porn movie director, I was quite surprised. I would recommend this movie if you are looking for sensible gore and murder and just some general fun. Think of this movie as a contemporary Friday the 13th movie. And save room for the end too, cuz it's a good one. And stick to the credits too ...
