What I got was something better. <br /> <br /> Just like many movies I've noticed recently, I've been looking forward for a while. Especially after watching one of Toshiaki Toyoda's other films, "Blue Spring" which is easily in my top 20 favorite movies. I loved the trailer for 9 souls, and I thought it sounded very good. I heard nothing bad about it. Now I know why. <br /> <br /> This movie starts out as a comedy, then quickly becomes something different in the last half of the movie. It becomes more dramatic as each of the characters faces their own tragedies. Each character gets just enough screen time, and you care about what happens to each of them. Although there are 9 characters, we need to learn and care within two hours. Toshiaki Toyoda pulls it brilliantly. <br /> <br /> After seeing "Blue Spring", I hoped the soundtrack was at least a bit as good as it was in that movie. I had my wish because the soundtrack to 9 Souls was also incredible. The music used in each scene, more specifically the more dramatic, is simply wonderful. I loved it every second. <br /> <br /> I wasn't sure I wanted to see another Toshiaki Toyoda movie, "Pornostar", but after I saw it, I'm going. Definitely. Also, because I read the plot for that, and I think it sounds very good. I'm looking forward to it. On the R1 DVD of 9 Siele there are two interviews with Toyoda. He says he has completed another film, and he wants to start writing the script for his next. I can't wait for both. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. You have to see it. Now.
