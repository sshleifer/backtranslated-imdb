I thought this movie was excellent, strange and different from the usual run of the 'uncoupled cop-catching serial killer' movie. Kiefer Sutherland was brilliant as usual - I really don't think I've seen anything he did where he didn't act brilliantly. The dialogue was funny, sometimes the mood eased, and the plot was tempting. Thanks to other reviewers for showing the link with Alice in Wonderland - I didn't pick up on that. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Kiefer Sutherlands (as I am) and to anyone who wants to watch an entertaining movie for a few hours. It was a pity that it was not released to the theater for a wider audience.
