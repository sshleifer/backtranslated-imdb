The slasher subgenre is quite exhausted. In fact, even in 1979, just one year after the supposed 'first slasher', Halloween (released seven years after Bay of Blood) was released. the subgenre was not far from the exhausted; but Tourist Trap represents one of the more original excursions. The movie follows the same basic formula as most slashers. Mrs. Madman kills a lot of children, but draws his originality from the fact that malman is shown from the beginning (as opposed to an invisible attacker or a man in a mask) and we actually gain insight into his character. The fact that this killer also has telekinetic capabilities, including the control of the washing mummies filling his home, adds to the originality. We kick off with a big opening sequence, which sees a young man failing to have a flat tire after finding himself in a petrol station. The scene is incredibly creepy, as the washing mums rush him and fly things off the shelves - and this gives the audience a good insight into what is coming; namely a very creepy horror movie! <br /> <br /> The acting credibility is as if it doesn't exist, as you would expect from a seventies, but to be honest; It's not that bad. The girls look warm, the boys don't matter; and Chuck Connors is more than adequate creepy in the role of the psycho. He is not exactly Anthony Perkins; but still good enough. However, it is not the play that starred at the show, and as you can expect - the creepy atmosphere takes that price. Wax models, as evidenced by the likes of House of Wax (Vincent Price version ...) are very creepy; and the film makes the best use of the fact. There are very few things in the movie that can be scary by just being there - but wax images are definitely one of those things. The killer's particular ability can easily have been in the atmosphere of the atmosphere, but the film makes the best use of this fact, even by flipping several things from shelves and the rest of the movie. In general, this is a very good movie. While Tourist Trap may not be absolutely necessary, it is worth seeing and I can recommend it.
