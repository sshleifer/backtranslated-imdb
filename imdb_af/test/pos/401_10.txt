The kind of "small" movie that the studio worked on, but rarely does more. Kind of a "soul" version of the more famous "The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells". Ian McShane is excellent as a DJ and aficionado of soul music that becomes obsessive with the idea of ​​uniting the members of a classical soul group, and the film follows its benefits as well as those of group members. A film featuring such a true musical talent as Isaac Hayes, as well as acting stalwarts Taurean Blacque, Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas. Not meant to be an email, it's a lot of solid gold.
