Corniness Warning. As many co-IMDb users already know, I'm not a stingy, cheesy person. If you don't want to read this kind of review then go. <br /> <br /> To tell you the truth, you hear it from a man who laughed at Titanic and almost broke his parents' band. <br /> <br /> --- Spoilers --- <br /> <br /> One day, with two friends, I went to the theaters to see Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, last August. The boring trailers rolled up until one started so quietly. It was for Radio. The moment I saw the trailer, I first had to watch this movie on the opening weekend. When that weekend rolled together, Scary Movie 3 was also out, so many teenagers were waiting there on Friday night. It turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie, they also sold out Good Boy and Radio. I couldn't get a ticket and the next few weeks, I was doing more important things. About 5 months later my friend Radio hired. He let me borrow and I looked at it in my room. I'll tell you now, this is the only movie I've ever seen that ever got me. When Radio's mother died, it just came out automatically. The next day I went to Blockbuster and bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> Well enough of my stupid personal story, let me tell you about the movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as a mentally challenged man named Radio. Ed Harris co-star and this movie is directed by Mike Tollin. Based on a true story, Radio is a teenager who has a life to spend most of his day alone. He goes around with a shopping cart that picks up everything he can and always carries a radio. He has his own collection. At the end of each day he goes home to his mother. He never went to school later. One day, Radio passed the local high school while the soccer team was practicing. A football flies over the fence and Radio picks it up and continues. Ed Harris plays Mr. Jones, the soccer coach. They meet and this is Radio's life. <br /> <br /> During the whole movie, radio and coach Jones spend quality time together, both teaching each other. It's great to see how the movie goes to the highest joys, the lowest lows, and just to see how Radio lives its life. You will laugh, cry and live the life of Radio with him. This movie holds a special place in my heart with Toy Story and others. It's a must-see for the whole family, by yourself, or if you are someone who just wants a great drama. Radio is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Radio will never be forgotten by me. Never. <br /> <br /> As Ed Harris's character said very near the end of the movie: <br /> <br /> "We don't learn Radio, Radio teaches us." <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> Eliason A.
