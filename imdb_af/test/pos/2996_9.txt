When I first saw this movie on video in a shopping mall, it made me irrational. In view of the fact that I thought I was in love and I was the same age as the youths in this movie (although I realize they are old enough to be my parents), plus the soundtrack by Elton John & Bernie written. Taupin just before they "made it" in North America. I thought I had nothing to lose it. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> So far I've shown it to many guys I've dated since, and to my current boyfriend ... of course, they didn't like it as much as I found. .. prefer to call it a "chick" movie ... but I still laugh and cry. This movie was overlooked. It's good to see that it's available at one of the local video stores here so others can share the magic. <br /> <br /> So maybe it's a bit far-fetched ... but it gives you a sad feeling of innocence ... and a renewed belief in love.
