This movie has the look and feel that it is composed in a matter of days, like plan 9 from outer space. Despite this, it's still a classic position under my favorite Creature Features. ***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS START ******* Count Dracula and Larry Talbot; aka Wolfman, joins dr. Edelman looking for a cure for their nocturnal anti-social behavior, such as killing people. Meanwhile, Dr. Edelman the body of the Frankenstein Monster. Being obsessed with bringing it back to life (a common trait among scientists, evil or otherwise), he goes against his better judgment, which causes monstrousness and madness. One of the final universal classical magazines (Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein followed 3 years later), it counts a 10 with this reviewer. Uncle Steven steals the performance as a good doctor who is bad after being infected by Dracula's blood and becoming a half-wolf / vampire, to a tragic end. At 1 hour 7 min. it punches quite a punch. A valuable addition to my video collection. <br /> <br /> Rating: ***** out of *****
