It was very funny, even though it was a bit disconnected at the end. Hitchcock - Owen (Danny DeVito) was lucky with a "Strangers on a Train" playing at the local cinema, telling the movie that it was the inspiration. <br /> <br /> DeVito is very funny, but also a little sad. He has no friends and all he wants to do is to write and have someone like his writing. His teacher, Billy Crystal, goes through his own writer's block and his wife stole his book and made it her own success, which also frustrated him. <br /> <br /> Best parts are The book proposal of Mr. Pinsky ("One Hundred Girls I'd Like to Pork") and all the scenes with Anne Ramsey, which is so terrible that even Mother Theresa would also like to kill her!
