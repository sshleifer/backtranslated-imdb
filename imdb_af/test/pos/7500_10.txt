36. HOSPITAL (comedy, 1971) A series of emergencies seized the Manhattan hospital. Patients die left and right due to crowded conditions, and a dissatisfaction staff. When a resident doctor gets caught in the death count, the chief medical examiner, Dr. Bock (George C. Scott) reported to investigate. After years of working as a doctor, and through his own life in his own life, Dr. Bock difficult. He decides to commit suicide. But then he meets Barbara (Diana Rigg), a hipster beauty. Whose insight into life helps the depressed Bock. <br /> <br /> Criticism: Black comedy has a tour-de-force show by veteran actor George C. Scott. He is good at playing high-play, serious characters whose rigorous moral seriousness is being tested. The first half of the film unfolds like a melodrama, giving a pretty good version of hospital life, and the rogue they are sometimes. But then, if things look like a dramatic climax, it's shot in a slapstick comedy. If Paddy Chayefsky's script kept his dramatic feelings, I wonder if Scott came out with another best actor Oscar (he won in absentia the previous year). His collapse (suicide) scene is one of the most gut-wrenchingly real in cinema history. <br /> <br /> NOTE: Dr. Bock: "... Last night I sat in my hotel room reviewing the shambles of my life and considering suicide. I said 'no Bock does it. You are a doctor, a healer, you are an essential person, your life is meaningful. ' Then I find that one of my doctors was killed by some nurses ... how can I face my sense of meaning? "
