I have never read the book, but have always heard good things about it. When the movie came out, I was considering seeing it, but never done it. Now it came out on DVD and I thought about renting for a few weeks now. Last night I finally picked it up. I'm very glad I did. <br /> <br /> Combatography was incredible in this movie. The scenery, etc. ... Everyone made you feel like you were in Kabul. The acting was very good, although I am sure some of the emotions in the translation were lost. And the story itself was good and clean and constructive. Yes, the story was very sad, but at the same time upset. <br /> <br /> And I'll be honest, as a white American, ... showed me of Kabul and Afghanistan I never mind in my photo thinking about it. Show me a Afghanistan before the Taliban. Show me a beautiful place. Show me a place with good people. I am a community that was like a family, apart from a few bulls. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend this movie to everyone. This is one of the best I've ever seen.
