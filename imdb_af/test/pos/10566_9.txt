BBC's 3 hour adaptation of the novel by Sarah Waters ... "Fingersmith". Life is hard without money, especially in Dickensian London. Dark deeds lead to despicable dilemmas. Is it really just a luxury for the rich and free? Elaine Cassidy as "Maud Lilly" and Sally Hawkins as "Sue Trinder" give both great performances as the top ladies asking this question ... FROM EVERY OTHER ... while Rupert Evans shines like the wonderfully bad "Lord". With great support from Imelda Staunton's "Mrs Sucksby", David Troughton's "Mr. Ibbs" and Charles Dance's "Uncle". The plot turns and turns and I wasn't sure I could be led to care for characters who could hurt and use each other this way ... but somehow ... I care ... and that's because of the quality of the performances ... love feel like love .. hate feel like hate ... betrayal .. confusion .. hopefully you get the idea and hopefully you will get the DVD and enjoy. (Elaine Cassidy is just wonderful in this .. beautiful In fact, I have to declare I'm in her fan club ... Hi Elaine :)
