I saw this mini-movie when it first aired and loved! It is advisable to see how far people go for money. It's also funny to see how much a boyfriend can be "beaten". "Beaten" enough to kill. I think the role was wonderful, especially the character Kristin. With her smooth talk and deceitful looks, the movie would not have been the same. <br /> <br /> I never use to see the US, but now it's one of my stations. <br /> <br />
