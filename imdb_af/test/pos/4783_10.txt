It was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound. It was based on a silent movie called "Steamboat Bill, Jr." starring Buster Keaton. Back in this early Mickey card, Mickey didn't talk and he also didn't have gloves. He can only play flute and music. The song he played was "Turkey in the straw" using various farming animals as musical instruments. He plays a cow's teeth as a xyophone and he plays a nursing saw's teats like an accordion. Captain Pete, however, is very angry and peels Mickey's potatoes into the kitchen. Pete's parrot flies to the window and orders him to peel the potatoes. Mickey throws a half-peeled potato at the parrot and laughs, closing the cartoon. I could get this cartoon on tape and I really like it. I think the Disney pants are much better than the feature-length movies.
