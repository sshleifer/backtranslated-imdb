I give it 8 out of 10 because it's a cult classic. It is also directed by legendary sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan, who also plays the role of Jarvis in the film. In listening to the recent blog talk radio show called the AARF show (Robert Morgan is a co-host), he tells it because it has become such a cult classic and does well at movie conventions and there are plans to ' a sequel to this movie. . I think he said two of the original stars have signed and he hopes to have another. Robert is a good man and I hope it's okay. He dedicated 50+ years of tireless work as a Sassquatch researcher (who is also one of my interests) and author. Look at his performance on the paranormal and may look for Blood Stalkers II somewhere in the near future.
