Batman Returns is a very dark movie, showing the Caped Crusader's fight against the Penguin and the sexy Catwoman (I'll come to them later). Michael Keaton works well as Bruce Wayne, and shows he's a good actor. Tim BUrton does this picture well, and the movie spots are impressive. The villains: Danny deVito is threatening as Penguin. A cruel but disturbed man who had a very difficult childhood. But Michelle Pfeiffer steals the picture. She's the best catwoman ever! She is threatening, and very sexy. There's a scene where she kisses Batman the cat way, which just warms the movie. The action scenes are also good, and the end is dramatic and tragic, probably the best end of a Batman movie. Tim Burton shows that he can really manage a Batman movie (he has already demonstrated it with the first Batman) and also gives Batman a darker nature. As much as he did.
