[WARNING: INSIDE SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> Written by husband and wife Wally Wolodarsky (who is also director) and Maya Forbes, this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memory. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr takes a break from playing smarmy weasels to be the nice guy who is confronted with the fact that his fianc√© wants to bed other people and he may also do so. Julianne Nicholson, who was so good at "Tully," plays spotty and vulnerable with great gusto. Too bad she didn't get the recognition she deserved. <br /> <br /> Good supporting actions also help great. Lauren Graham, who made a memorable last year's "Bad Santa", plays the proud, cynical sister to perfection. Bryan Cranston (the father on TV's Malcolm in the Middle) gets some funny moments and Andy Richter plays a brilliant man who falls for a single mom - Helen Slater in a credible, though well-known role as a mischievous woman . <br /> <br /> What surprised me most about "Seeing Other People" was how funny it was. There are some real laughs here. Ed's first attempt at meaningless sex gets some good lines, and there is a Monday a trophy that elicits one of the truest responses of a man, as the male fantasy is cut. <br /> <br /> The performance of the movie is not unusual. but I liked that it was Alice (Nicholson) who thought of it, much to Ed's (Mohr's) scam. Given the genre, you know that no matter how good her intentions are, Alice's plan is doomed. We see how the couple work through this strange situation. Initially Alice and Ed are switched on by the idea, but then the human element sets it. <br /> <br /> I don't appreciate Forbes and Wolodarsky turning it into a cheap sex skirt. Yes, there is sex and nudity, but there are also real emotions at work. The "other people" Alice and Ed's girlfriend don't want to be the objects of casual sex; they also have feelings. In one case, too many feelings. <br /> <br /> Allowed, some scenes run one joke too much, the Richter-Slater subplot is not needed and Alice does something really uncharacteristic. But it is forgiven because Mohr and Nicholson generate such a tremendous intimacy and honesty - watch the scenes where Ed is loading Alice's underwear or his response to her announcement about the end of the experiment - no matter how much we play their little game can enjoy, we root for this couple to succeed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie has little, if any, publicity and limited release. Hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often go on the careless, turgid and unpleasant, will do well to learn from this intelligent and funny movie.
