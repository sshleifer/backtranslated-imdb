It takes a lot for a movie to reach the already sensitive particles of my brain that have not yet been pulled out because of the overload and redoredoredocopycopycopy world of movies. But this movie made it on my "Magic Movies" list. To become a 'magical movie', it must let every string of my tremble into what I can only define as 'bliss' and 'complete satisfaction'. This movie was in the minds of my mind and if it wasn't for the deep personal band my head and the head of those stocks, it would look like another dead rave scene movie from behind the 90's with his Ecstasy craze. This is not how the movie came to my mind. It has reached me and something I have thought for a long time, pushed me so far that it gave me my own criticism. I forgot how long it has been since I saw something that made me feel good. I strongly suggest watching this movie.
