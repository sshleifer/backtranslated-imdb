A look at three geishas that are past their prime. Now they look back with their love and keep their gifts. Kin (played by Floating Weeds' Haruko Sugimura) swore men and made a good life as a lender; Everyone on the block owes her. The other two, Nobu and Tamae, wish they could land men, but were not foolish enough to believe they would ever want to. Meanwhile, their children - one has a son and one a daughter - both get married (not to each other). Tamae is upset about how much more beautiful her daughter has become than her, and tries to persuade her not to marry her husband. Nobu's concern over her son is more legal in nature, but they are also (understandably) self-serving. After her son leaves, she will be alone. A bit in the movie, two of Kin's former clients are looking for her, one a man who is so obsessive with her that he tries to commit suicide with him, the other one of her most useful clients. Unfortunately, he came for her money, not her love. The way I described the movie makes it unnecessarily depressed, but it's really not. Sad but not deadly. It's more bitter. Unfortunately, I just picked chrysanthemums. The story looks better when I look back, but it's very slow and boring. I actually cut it twice during the movie, and I wasn't tired until I started it. This is the kind of movie I can appreciate more than I want; it reminds me a lot of my reaction to some of Ozu's most famous films. 10/07.
