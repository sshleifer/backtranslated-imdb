When the first trailer for this movie was watched by myself, I was curious as to what angle the storyline would take. After all the plot to return your childhood to the present, many options open up. However, Bruce Willis does an excellent job in the role he has given. I was surprised to see how well he could act in this part. It is also a good career movement, as many others have said, but after seeing it, I agree. This movie is mainly about remembering the child you were earlier, and realizing that you are not the adult you planned. It's a wonderful story and a moving story that reminds us all. We usually mock "What if ..." movies. For example, Waterworld tried to answer the question: "What if the world should be covered with water and ...?" But truth, nobody cares. However, this movie affects everyone in the theater. True, young children may not be able to understand the idea of ​​growing up and looking away from all your dreams, but it has a huge impact on the adults and parents of those children. This movie is definitely worth seeing. However, it will be better the second time, because you will not think so much (about how the child came, and why and all those things). Just relax and enjoy. And take something with you when you leave the cinema. Take that piece of your childhood that you forgot and enjoy.
