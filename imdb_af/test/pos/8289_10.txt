To date, there is no movie that I have seen more than The Chipmunk Adventure, and no movie has brought me any more luck. It's not the biggest movie or even the biggest animated movie, but for an 8-year-old girl in 1988, it was the coolest, funniest and most exciting movie ever! Today I am just as impressed with the music numbers, each one with an exuberant song with wonderful dramatic lyrics in the epic tradition of the 80-year-old doll (think Pat Benetar on helium, just catchier). <br /> <br /> Controversy has stirred the blatant suggestive tone of the Chipette's song "Gettin 'Lucky With You", which was much more innocent at the time. However, if I regard it as a rational adult, I can fully understand the concern. you have three young girls in skimpy harem outfits who are passionately proclaiming "happy about it." The Chipettes are definitely sexually subsidized for this movie. <br /> <br /> But this controversial problem doesn't even come close to the Chipmunks' other fantastic feature-length animated adventure, but I encourage parents and childless adults to watch this movie. Especially if you were a child of the eighties / early nineties like me. :-)
