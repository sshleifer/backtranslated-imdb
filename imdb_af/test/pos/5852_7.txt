Sandra Bullock paints a credible picture as the troubled detective, although she regards her as a cynical man-eating victim-forced persecutor, requires a leap of faith (or two). The two creepy upset children are adequately portrayed by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. <br /> <br /> I have a bit of trouble getting Ben Chaplin in the equation (the same problem has arisen as "The Truth About Cats & Dogs" (http://us.imdb.com / title / tt0117979 /) I mean, if you put an Englishman in an all-American movie, there shouldn't be a reason to put him there? the fact that an Englishman serves as a detective on a US police force, shouldn't there be a dialogue suggesting that it is an obvious fact, or even jokes about him being English? <br /> <br /> He looks out here, as he looks out of place in 'The Truth About Cats & Dogs.' Growers really need to take notice, it leads and irritates the audience (at least I). with Chaplin's acting, it's just a matter of making an actor credible "out of place" and not without a good reason or a storyline to put him in. <br /> <br /> The movie itself: well, thrillers, especially those who require G to solve a complicated crime, suspension of unbelief. This one is no different; Actually, it takes a lot more effort than usual. In order to make Bullock smart enough to crack the case despite all the pressures it requires to release it, unrealistic assumptions are made about the evidence, and I am sure many people have watched it, have a few moments of "Come on, it's highly unlikely under the circumstances" or even "Hey, you can't brush evidence this way to wrap up this movie!" <br /> <br /> As I said: fairly entertaining and viewable. Do not use it only as needed for examination exams. There are no shortcuts there.
