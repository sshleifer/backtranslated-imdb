hello. hello and goodbye. but before I go, I want to talk to you. I just want to mention a few key points about this movie. the first is eroticism. especially gay erotica. <br /> <br /> Yes, well. Let's start. When a man and a man love each other a lot, they blend into each other in a spectacular, not to say, explosion of the theater we call the Venice merchant. <br /> <br /> The gay love was sensually worse. and even more sensual at best. it was hardcore and emotional. it touched me improperly and I'm pretty sure I touched it again. And when nobody looked, I touched a little. <br /> <br /> I laughed because Portia was denied. She was second in line with our friend, the gay erotic love. oh antonio. Antoni. not toni. I love you. more than you loved that man. whose name may contain a "B" or not. He was very ugly. <br /> <br /> Antoni was very greasy. He smeared his body in a sheath of his own hair fat and sensual juices and continues to write the screening and introduce him to the man by name. I like the movie that ends. Look at the movie if it's not for gay erotic connotations. for the love of a man like antoni. not toni.
