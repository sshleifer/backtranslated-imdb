For the late 80's, it's really not that bad. There are many beautiful, thrown-out one-liners ("It was great theft!" - "Thank you!") And Madonna gives a good performance; nothing worthy of here, but it also goes for Razzies and Oscars. I'm curious to know if the movie would have gotten better if she used her usual (pre-British) voice rather than the hyper-Bronxy accent used. Oh good. As a lace note, I met one of the actors who played one of the motorcycles through my work; He said it was a fun movie to work on, but gave me the sad news that the actor who played Buck the UPS delivery man died over a year. Who is that girl?
