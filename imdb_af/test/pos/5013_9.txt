Through many accounts, Stu Ungar was not a very good man. He spits on traders, stiff people to whom he owes money and was verbally abusive. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers can choose to make the man a sugar coat and make him into a sports hero that would triumph over indifference. But High Roller does not. And this is a difficult drive to whore. <br /> <br /> Instead, we have to look very closely to see that a man who is never outdated has passed the frightening little boy from the streets of New York, despite all his successes. And the only true approval he ever gets is from death itself. Very brave (because people won't get it) and touch a lot (when you do that). <br /> <br /> Whilst brave, using a Scorsese feel. "Aha! How distracted," people will say. Really? But there is virtually no violence. And Stuey LOVE gangster movies. Perhaps the feeling reflects the man Stu and not the director Marty? And if it's really a low budget movie and it looks good, bravo! <br /> <br /> Finally, the linear playback structure. Wow, it'll get hammer. However, it not only works, it works exceptionally well, even for those who do not see the "Seventh Seal". (PROOF: In SS, Knight plays chess game with death: In MH, Stuey says: "We can play hand cards because you know" ... Death says, "Never be good on cards.) <br /> <br /> No tricky effects or camera moving. No shaky camera. Nothing trendy. Just solid, stiff storytelling. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this makes the movie too basic and somehow But then again, so was the man, and that just makes it right. <br /> <br /> 9/10
