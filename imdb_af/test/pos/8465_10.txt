The fact that this film was shown at London's Barbican suggests that the pressure was enough for such a show. Now the question is, why is this lost and important movie not available in DVD (or even VHS)? A large number of people in Europe and the USA have been hoping to see this film for years, for no other reason than the wonderful music written by Sergei Prokofiev. What should one do to get such a wonderful production, as it is available to a wider public, not just the Barbican customers in London? After a dedicated listener of Prokofiev's music for many years and aware of this movie, PLEASE, someone out there does the right thing and brings it out as a DVD.
