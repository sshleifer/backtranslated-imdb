I just watched the DVD of this award-winning movie. One Life Stand is a dramatic drama which, by its pace, black and white shots and atmospheric music, forms a very compelling and honest picture. It's a story about life's dilemma around power, gender and control, highlighted by some sad lonely lives. The mother (very well maintained by Maureen Carr) has acted and drawn on herself. The father only appears on the sidelines, yet it is a powerful and cardinal part of the drama. Money is hidden in boxes and shoes. <br /> <br /> The writing was great, and I like the sensual close-up shots of details like nails, red lips, candles, mirrors, etc. The way the camera was used made it very intimate. It's a sad story, with sexual undertones, while the Glasgow drip on the dark streets adds to the despair of the sad characters. <br /> <br /> There are some unforgettable shots that are simply conveyed by a walk or a false shoulder - as Trise walks away under the bridge. And the astonished and hurtful look at Trise's face in the call center, hoping to help people by using tarot cards, as she talks to a caller of her own abuse. <br /> <br /> At first we see John Paul, wider and innocent, shooting photos while trying to modeling. Trise, his mother, is cheated and makes poor choices for him, in a way that pushes him away while trying to keep him. John Paul's modeling works in escort and Trise's boss offers her money, and eventually they go on a date. There are also moments of humor and subtle irony. One excellent scene is when they have a fairly normal meal, and start to open a little, when the father appears over everything with his dark presence and clouds. But this and other things offer moments of hope. <br /> <br /> I sometimes felt the pacing of the movie was a shade that was too intense, but it's a small detail in another challenging and memorable movie, and something a little different. This contrasts with most American films that are either the total fantasy or the true 'world', as seen by contaminated glasses. This movie shows life with all its rough edges and displays unforgettable images. <br /> <br /> It's not 'light entertainment', but a thought-provoking and real drama. <br /> <br /> One Life Stand is a truly engaging and emotionally honest movie.
