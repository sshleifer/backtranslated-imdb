I remember seeing this movie when I was pretty young and was rather disturbed. I found the storyline very disturbing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One of them was especially when the other schoolchildren spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoon. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. It was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. However, I have a feeling that even if he is good at games, he would be bothered by the difficulty of deciding what makes someone popular. For me, he is the kind of person who will always be picked up, because that's how children work. Popular kids are popular because they are somehow cool. Popularity is a difficult thing to define. So, even at the end when he is successful in his career, it makes no difference and he is still laughing. I found the end very upsetting because there was no decision.
