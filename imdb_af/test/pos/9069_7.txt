Peter Lorre gives one of his most bad performances as the owner of the title. The plot has a new government agent on the trail of Peter Lorre's character. When the G-man's contact was murdered by one of Lorre's agents, the G-man was sent to prison for the murder, although everyone knew there was more to the story. Lorre placed the man in his care and brought him to his island where he exploited diamonds. Lorre wants to know what our hero knows, but he doesn't speak and a will camp is put into operation. <br /> <br /> It's a good solid little thriller that doesn't show much of sense plot, but even the movie holds your interest. I posted the film last night to use it as something to drive off, but I found the story enough. I had an extra 70 minutes. Lorre is why someone falls into it. His proper attitude is unpleasant. He does very little, but it is clear from his instructions and the way everyone responds to him (see how they light his cigarettes) that he is a bad man. <br /> <br /> A watch is when you have to run over it.
