Many other viewers say it's not a good movie to watch, as they feel it's not realistic. How it cannot be seen realistically. They feel the wound part is not easy to maintain, it is not common. I can guarantee that you have met more people than you think there was a blood loss. Many of them will not come out and say, and mostly they are victims. Many people are also Gay, and are still in the closest, because it doesn't matter how much they want it, they know they're ridiculous and possibly even abandoned. And tell me how many kids did you go to high school with what had become pregnant or had an eating disorder? I bet a lot, and although the pregnancy isn't the most of the time, it's still easy to relate to. Who can't be related to an outcast or bullied? It happens all the time. and many viewers are probably concerned about education like Marcus. Being a stoner seems to be quite common today. so there are many things to relate to. More than the rest, however popular you can get, sometimes you feel invisible or alone, have not noticed or overlooked as the suicide victim. How can you not feel connected to the movie? I think the movie might be useless to others, but I would like to find it so important. This is an interesting way to show that suicide is happening and to be aware. It comes from people who do not show their unhappy thoughts, it is very surprising. The people who have problems there sometimes commit suicide, but when you hear suicide, it will usually happen through most people's minds. <br /> <br /> The end surprised me, I didn't even expect to be the girl who was mostly an extra in the end until the end. The story, even in his description, says she was about 6 years old when it was 7. My only real disappointment was that it wasn't one of the characters we had to learn about. It only seems as if the movie was useless to see if the right victim was just a random chick. until I thought more. It made perfect sense for a big surprise because it's suicide. plus, who would choose who had any of the other students for more than a reason. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has bad points, most movies have a few, but I will recommend this movie as long as you can handle watching the tragic moments of suicide and violence and curse see this movie.
