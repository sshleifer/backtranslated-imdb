Uh oh, impossible n'est pas gaulois. <br /> <br /> Good-natured, highly entertaining movie. Good command of the French language and knowledge of modern France (and history) is recommended. I don't think this movie really works in any other language. The movie is incredibly much better than the previous one (Looking for ...). Apart from big actors and skillful camera handling, it is the white and fireworks of play, word games, etc. That makes for a very good movie. The cartoon vorlage is recognizable, but the film is very emancipated. The cost of the film is well used. In fact, all the special effects fit 'naturally' into the movie, you never feel choked by them. <br /> <br /> Bref, oui, lesson 2CVs, you can also be a part of you, Imhotep! <Br /> <br /> - A neighbor on the other side of the Rhine
