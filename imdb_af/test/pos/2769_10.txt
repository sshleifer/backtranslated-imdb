I love this movie. and Disney Channel is ridiculous to stop playing. I think they should definitely put Susie Q at least one night on the sky so we can record it !!! but if not, does anyone know where to find it? my email is cristin6891@aim.com, email me if you know where to find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and I think they deserve it too. All these Disney movies that come out now are fake and boring. I need Susie Q back !! It was a good movie and has good actors and I don't see why it was taken out of the air. If everyone loves this movie, why is it taken out of the air? Please take my comments into account and all other comments made on this movie. Thanks, nice day.
