The opening night for the 'South Asian International Film Festival' (SAIFF) in New York was an event many of us waited for. <br /> <br /> Will I finally see Hari Om? I was tired of watching the "promo" on a loop and the urgent taste of the song Angel by Nitin Sawhney in the promo, prompted me to hear the rest of it. I was impressed with the footage? and incredibly curious about how the rugged car driver would win the hearts of the beautiful sophisticated French tourist! I remember being quite on the theme as I read a line or two about it in the newspapers, centuries ago! Especially so, since I was personally very fascinated a few years ago, by how flamboyant the rickshaw was in Jodhpur! The snow and the crowd outside the theater only made my anxiety rise. <br /> <br /> Once in the theater, I found that the SAIFF organizers just suggested disaster. I was uncomfortable and embarrassed about how poor the event was organized and I found myself in a difficult place and tried to apologize to my friends (of mixed nationalities) that I had invited to the VIP guest list. I was hoping to prove to them that the Indian movie wasn't always about Bollywood? Eventually and finally, the movie began to send fresh air. Or so I thought ?? Hari About ?? start with chaos and noise. Autorickshaws honking, traffic and a lot of chaos. I smiled as if I felt a "home" feeling inside me. <br /> <br /> So did Hari's journey begin? a car rickshaw driver in Jaipur ?? The director couldn't have made a better decisive call with this character. From Monsoon Wedding to Hari To ?? Vijay Raaz, despite his non-heroic look, wears this movie solely on his acting skills and picks up the character, full of all the nuances of a rickshaw driver in Rajasthan. He's the whole winner. But how and where he learned to speak English even so smoothly is the question! However, his character shows beautiful shades of humor and sensitivity. I love his innocent portrayal of a simple man from a village? Who has great aspirations to be known? and still know when to cut away from reality. <br /> <br /> Camille, on the other hand, goes into the film wearing clothes that someone would not dare to wear like that. However, it's funny that no one really cares about her so much. However, she looks very brilliant! Especially in the last half of the movie, when she changes to Indian clothes. However, her relationship with her boyfriend seems very vague. It probably adds to the reality of certain types of relationships. <br /> <br /> The movie takes us through the most beautiful parts of Rajasthan? The surprising part is that nothing of the places is anything but what they really are. You see the dirt, you see the primitive houses ?? you see Rajasthan exactly as it is !! Train ?? there is only one adjective that leaves you? a beautiful '. <br /> <br /> It is the first director who probably knows how to live India exactly - with the filth and noise and all the negative things that India is associated with! But it looks like one of the most beautiful places to be in. <br /> <br /> Kudos! for him for that. <br /> <br /> The only downside to the movie I could possibly see is the pass? I found it slightly slow on some parts ?? but be sure you will never be bored. <br /> <br /> Nitin Sawhney's background scores add a classic international but very Indian flavor to the movie. The song Angel, which plays in the movie for a very important time, mixes well with the visuals. <br /> <br /> I also heard that other than the main characters, all the other actors are just ordinary people. who has never faced a camera before! It is commendable, since most of us are so-called established actors? still can't display realistic characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a great experience to watch this movie? It is a pot pourri of emotions. It has romance, humor? realism ?? beautiful visions and places ..., good music, good movie ?? A PACKAGE! When I walked out of the theater, I felt proud to be India ?? A few days later I asked one of my Bulgarian friends who watched the movie with me if he wanted to watch another Indian movie? and his response was ?? "Is it better than Hari To? If that's, then I'll go, or not, I think I'll succeed. From now on, Hari will be the benchmark for every Indian movie I see." Mr. Bala, do you read?
