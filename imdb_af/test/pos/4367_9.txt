Making Isherwood's somewhat dark and completely brilliant novel in a light comic skirt could easily be a recipe for disaster, but somewhere it wasn't. The story moves at a very fast pace and the black and white images are beautiful, just as Harvey and Harris pour their way through a shaky Weimar Berlin. Fun!
