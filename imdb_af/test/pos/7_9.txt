Our family (and the whole chosen sneak preview audience) enjoys "The Guardian". Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fiction helicopter rescue swimmer character Ben and Jake. After watching this movie, you can't imagine how difficult it should be to graduate from the USCG helicopter rescue swimming school and one day participate in real life rescue. <br /> <br /> Though it is a fictional movie, it has shown total convincing virtues of team spirit, dedication and bravery by all members of the actual US Coast Guard. <br /> <br /> The special effects used to create the rescue panels were incredible. You felt you were part of a real rescue. <br /> <br /> I feel the movie could be made without the Hollywood bar scene (if you see the movie, you can agree), as the true Coast Guard doesn't condemn such behavior. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining, lots of action packed, definitely worth seeing. Thanks, S. Coast Guard and the REAL helicopter rescue swimmers, "So Others May Live". I would recommend this movie to everyone.
