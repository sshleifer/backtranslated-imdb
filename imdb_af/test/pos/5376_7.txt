I've been interested in this movie for a long time, especially after reading a few DVD reviews online; However, I continued to postpone its purchase due to the excessive price tag and the total lack of relevant supplements. When it was chosen earlier this year, I finally gave in - but the whole order (which included a number of other highly desirable titles) was lost! Fortunately, the DVD was reissued at cost - and I'm sure I picked it up! <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a strange movie, and a real sleeper: initially confusing but striking occultic story that manages to hit bullseye on its baffling small town atmosphere and the inherent honesty of the sinister acts - on. A small saucepan responds perfectly to a sharp, absorbent and intelligent script: Chief Lighter Martin makes the dialogue better than it really is with his nuanced performance as the city doctor / head of the witch context; L.Q. Jones and Alvy Moore (both also made the film!) Offer solid support as the no-nonsense sheriff and his comic strip-aficionado assistant. <br /> <br /> The plot mixes elements of several earlier films with witchcraft and the supernatural and not just the obvious titles: the fact that the town is being kept under control, which cannot even be identified. instantly bring the similar misery of one particular civilian household into Luis Bunuel's sublime surrealist THE EXTERNINATORY ANGEL (1962)! The 'modest children' angle may have been borrowed from DORP OF THE DAMNED (1960); There are many movies - especially from a recent vintage - where the satanic rituals of a witchcraft are shown: from THE CITY OF DEATH (1960) TO THE FALSE (1968), but since the proceedings in modern American (though It is in remote surroundings and turns to elderly witches (in search of a 'renaissance'), the film that reminds them most is ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968). <br /> <br /> The occult scenes (emphasized as many by foggy exteriors as by the shady lighting of the decorated house where the diabolic events occur) are presented in a very real way to make them disturbing and extremely effective - Especially the opening order that a lower tank concerns a car (!) crushes, a devil's puppet (a concept that has been killed over the years, but it brings an unmistakable frisson), a surrealistic dream sequence (inside the ice room where all the victims are being held, because they cannot be buried!), a sequence in which the witches fall into a dubious member of the covenant, a ban imposed by a horse-riding medieval knight (!) and the long black people's final (with the witches, accompanied by the particular child, they will 'take over', all dressed in red - except for a black dressed Martin who presides over the ceremony) who culminates in ritual mass suicide! <br /> <br /> The movie also has the void of delivering a cunning 'curtain'; It is so refreshing to enforce a title (though low budget production) from a major Hollywood studio, Columbia, which goes so completely against the grain (as I said, the movie is very funny. after editing and scoring)! It is also strange that such a classic - and cinematic - horror offer (sic) should come from a TV director who is mostly associated with Western and other family money! Incidentally, the same theme is handled almost simultaneously in the ninth Christopher Lee / Peter Cushing collaboration, NOTHING BUT THE NIGHT (1972; which Lee himself produced!) - a movie I missed foolishly over 20 years ago when it was shown on local TV, and what is MIA ever since !! <br /> <br /> P.S. This review of the BROTHERHOOD OR Satan will definitely contain spoilers, but then the synopsis and artwork that appears on the DVD cover can give away everything anyway!
