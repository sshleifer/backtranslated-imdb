Most of our children who grew up in the 40's or 50's were western buffs, but it was one that escaped me to see the Movies for Men Channel today. I have the movie's story, cinematography, as well as the excellent casting of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. starring alongside loved reliable Ward Bond. Apparently, this movie was the inspiration for the later television series 'Wagon Train' that Bond again reflected, as the boss of the wagon trains is westward. Johnson steals the film with his riding skills and it's nice to see an actor doing his own stunts as Ben does in this movie. Other notes include the sweet Joanne Dru as Denver and an early non-speaking role for James Arness who later became known for his Marshal Matt Dillon role in 'Gunsmoke.' If you like movies from this genre, you can't like this one.
