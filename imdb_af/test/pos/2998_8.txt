I'm not going to do so many "heist" comedies, and I don't care for this if it wasn't for the actors when it was made, and only after a few years later. It's almost too similar to "The Happening" (although of course it's a much less serious comedy than this one). Mafia figure takes over its own kidnapping, or turns it completely in a different direction. Of course Raquel Welch did not play the kind of sharp character Faye Dunaway played in The Happening, but it does not make it a sex movie either. She had almost a stock character, almost her version of a "moll"! But I'm completely biased - it's one of the first movies I've ever seen with her, and when I saw it, you couldn't turn around without seeing a poster of her (happy). I think Robert Wagner really was just right as the not well-liked or unsuitable leader of the group, such as Edward G. Robinson (of course) and Vittoria De Sica. And Godfrey Cambridge, an actor who has always managed to be funny.
