Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a patient with a mental hospital claiming to be indigenous to a distant planet called K-PAX. His psychiatrist, dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) tries to help him understand Prot and find out if he really is K-PAX. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't really fall into any particular genre. Much of K-PAX is drama / science fiction, another sub-fantasy, plus, adds a little comedy and starts to get what K-PAX is about. The story (as you see above) is not too complicated or deep, but it still offers some good twists and turns of the plot that can still surprise you as they did to me. No special effects or graphics accompany this movie, and it doesn't have to be, but the music in the movie is good. A techno soundtrack, along with a terrific piano piece, makes K-PAX sound sci-fi and makes certain scenes interesting. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing Alien (Prot) from Planet K-PAX, emotionally with great facial expressions, Spacey doing a great job in the lead. Jeff Bridges is Dr. Powell, it helps and tries to understand Prot. Bridges are also excellent in its part. Bridges and Spacey fit together very well, and they both need a lot of experience. The wife of dr. Powell is Rachel Powell, played by Mary McCormack. McCormack plays her part well, showing the frustration that her husband is gone and being so dedicated to his patient. Alfe Woodard plays dr. Powell's colleague Claudia Villars, we don't see much Claudia, but overall she does a good performance. <br /> <br /> K-PAX becomes PG-13 for a sequence of violent images, and short language and sensuality, "and it covers it. As far as" violent images "go, we don't see too much. A few people who have quite a bit of blood on them, but that's all, language is as follows: 1 "f" word (wow, but one!), 11 "s" words, and some uses of the name The "sensuality" part just comes from when Prot explains to Dr. Powell how reproduction on K-PAX works, nothing terrible, just feel something about it like putting your nuts in a shot Not so bad on the content level for a PG-13 movie, it could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> Finally, K-PAX is not a bad movie. murdered, but it is nice and fun to watch, it has some funny parts, sad parts, very sad parts, you know what I mean, it is a story of a patient with a mental hospital "What do you expect, all in all, a good rent for the dough one that is looking for a good drama that you can play and relax, is a good movie for K-PAX. <br /> <br /> Bonus! If you've already seen this movie, like that, and think of the DVD, I'd highly recommend it. It has a lot of extras to look through, and even an alternative finite and elongated scene. 8/10
