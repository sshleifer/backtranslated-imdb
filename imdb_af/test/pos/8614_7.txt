As selected in the Quinzaine des Realists, Catherine Breillat is partly masterfully divided this year from her autobiographical film, where her main actress, Anne Parillaud (La Femme NIKITA, Luc Besson) admires the film director of "Intimate Scenes" admirably. . <br /> <br /> It's a comedy of actors' ways. Make it? Film Genre? Pornography or Exhibitionism? Sex Is Comedy is a postmodern film, with its screenplay based on a film within the film. As an implosive story of a minimalist love image, the film is built with a constant solidarity of shapes and spirit, in which Breillat breaks and analyzes the taboos. Using visual codes and some sense of the formula, Catherine Breillat implements her clinical analysis of sexuality as an isolated problem outside the society that communicates through the heart. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Grégoire Colin Work, Nénette et Boni, Claire Denis, The Dreamlife of Angels, Eric Zonca) in the role of actor and Roxanne Mesquida (Fat Girl, Catherine Breillat, Marie of the Bay of Angels Manuel Prada, the actors she watches, she explains in an interview. Breillat watches the man in front of him, even a chaste man. While playing the shame and sexual mutilation, but also a great hope, a disturbing dimension of ecstasy, a nudity of feelings, halving the exhibition, playing as one to be one. The director is ultimately expected to lead the actors to give their feelings, their body and their soul.

But, which is a form of incredible exorcism, for an actor, Breillat poses many interrogations. At the same time, great suffering remains, the actors seem to be the ones looking for this lovely transport to be part of the eternity of their work. <br /> <br /> Breillat's art is from researcher, knowing how to engage in a dialogue aimed at hiding the boundaries of intimate scenes. Join makeup, prostheses in erection and syndicates are not without remembering what pictures and scenes of Jan Steen and Rembrandt can be in the anecdotal and daily characters on a shooting set. While the moral categories of Sex Is Comedy's background disappear, Breillat manages to reveal the loving imitation power of the actors in a landscape of formidable and dramatic humanity.
