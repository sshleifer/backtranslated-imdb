I'm amazed and scared by the number of reviewers on this site who didn't get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black / white relationships or old / young relationships, although I think director Craig Brewer has deliberately thrown both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, although Christina Ricci's character, Rae, characterizes it. It is not about religious religion in the black community, although religion plays a major role. It's not a love story, though there isn't one, but two happy couples in the end. And it's certainly not about the south, where "everything is hotter", although it's in the south and it's unthinkable hot; holy smoke, even the writers did not get the point. <br /> <br /> Black Snake Moon is a parable about the Mississippi Delta Blues; who do they feel, who writes them, who they play, what they are playing, how it heals them. <br /> <br /> It is as if the film producers were sitting and asking for an empty slate, "Okay, if we are going to help people understand what the Blues really are, how will it look?" So they put it in the rural south. Then they dream two characters, one of whom left his wife to live with his best friend, the other who went to war and his bad abused girl slept with everyone in town. Then we just throw the grizzled worldliness a little through the people's religion (they know that Jesus wants their lives, and although they respect Him, they know they can't give Him), some violence between men and women , and lots and lots of steaming sexual images, including - ready to go over the top? - A black man in a sleeveless shirt that holds a half-naked white girl at the end of a 40 lb chain. Fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, make it a true blues picker, use music as the main healing element in the plot, slap the clips of the blues man Son House on both sides, and Voila - you have a modern parable about what the Blues are all about. Even the movie's climax is not a conflict of character, but the whole city dances dance to hot, fast blues. <br /> <br /> Of course there's a bit of dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is cured by Lazarus' domestic religion and steadfastness (and does not forget the chain.) But then we are shown the restored Rae dancers to the blues. the end. Is it an expression of a restored, healthy life force, or more of the same trashy behavior that has ruined her in the first place? Brewer wants both ways, but blues are really about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I think he will say blues give healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without even loosing. I have my doubts. <br /> <br /> Not for the first time Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget to watch Samuel L Jackson; The man is incredibly good. He even selects some of his own songs in the movie, and his game is authentic, dirty and hot. Christina Ricci is usually not that good. Granted, half of her work is done by the costume that wasn't there and her skinny figure, but she's a wonderful combination of cynical lust, rebellion and vulnerability. Bravo to her, she arrived. I was impressed by the landlord, John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to make sure he was a professional actor and not a real land minister. <br /> <br /> Parents should be aware of what they get when bringing their children home. The language is pretty far from the cards, the first half hour is full of graphic sex, and women are violated in a dozen ways during the film (Lazarus means good and is decent, but honestly is a woman on the radiator? ) Plus, Ricci spends half the movie donated for sex; If you have teenage boys, they will leak the screen halfway into the movie. I do not recommend it for children of any age. Adults only, please. <br /> <br /> It is said, Black Snake Moan is insightful and accurate about blues, people religion and sexual abuse, and tells a story that is in many ways redemptive. It's unorthodox, but time is worth it. And, well, my soundtrack is warm.
