I saw this movie this weekend on the A&E channel. The riddle was okay, I couldn't guess the culprit before the end. But I enjoyed the characters and their development much more than the secret. There was a riddle about some of them, especially George Abernathie, performed by the wonderful Michael Fassbender, and George's cousin, Susannah. In fact, the story of those two characters left me to know more. From what I tried to think about the Agatha Christie book of the same title, I think this movie did not follow the letter. Very good performances by the actors involved, especially Fassbender and the lady who played Cora / companion.
