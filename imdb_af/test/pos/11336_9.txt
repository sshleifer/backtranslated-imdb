Having seen many of Wong Kar-Wai's other movies (Happy Together, Fallen Angels, Ashes of Time), I knew what to expect to come into the theater; cinematography will be eloquent, space and perspective will vary, the play will be wonderful, and at least one of the characters will be consumed by ineffective loneliness. It is exactly the techniques that make Wong Kar-Wai's art what it is. What I didn't expect was the extent to which I was drawn into a movie, which some reviewers reject as unfinished and forced by characters consumed by Ennui. <br /> <br /> I find it interesting how people can be so completely unaware of a movie that shows such fine emotions and settings that many of us take for granted or work hard to forget: the overwhelming sense of grief that arising from betrayal; The guilt is caused by the notion that it does not get better than the traitor; the everyday, but deeply intimate moments of relationships, where the need to express orally is unnecessary. That's what Wong Kar-Wai is trying to portray in the film and what he has achieved so well. <br /> <br /> Too many Americans are consumed by the need to have every moment of a film full of stockpiles; witty villain, bad sarcasm and renowned confession seems to be the culmination of the best American movie. Wong Kar-Wai sees things very differently. Instead of the character needed to keep the audience aware of every feeling, perception or belief, Wong's characters make their feelings and concepts clearly known by visual gestures, body positioning and, indeed, silence. <br /> <br /> As viewers, this movie only looks from the point of view of character development and action, then they may be disappointed with what it offers. If they are willing to let themselves be intuitive about what the characters feel, they may feel very different about what Wong has to offer.
