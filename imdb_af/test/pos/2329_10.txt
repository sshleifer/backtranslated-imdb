I love military comedies (Sgt. Bilko, Stripes, In The Army Now, Major Payne) and Down Periscope is hilarious, but it also has a heart. <br /> <br /> The Stingray SS-161 (The USS Pampanito) was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful, an artwork is alive. So it was a diesel engine sub, so what? I learned that the aircraft carrier USS Ranger (which stands for The Enterprise in Star Trek IV), a large ship, was "conventionally powered", which could mean that Ranger was also a diesel. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene: Pascal: Jesus, Buckman, this may have been on the stingray since Korea! It may expire in 1966! Buckman: (Fill your finger and taste it) What's the matter, sir? It still tastes like creamed wheat. <br /> <br /> Pascal: (Shouting) Except, it's CONSEQUENT HIM !! Buckman: That would be a problem. <br /> <br /> This is a story, perhaps a tense, probably observed. Winslow respected Dodge and looked after him, so he wanted to give Dodge a chance. He gave him a devastated but still seaworthy Balao class sub, and gave him the job of using the diesel sub to evade the nuclear fleet and 'attack' Charlston Harbor and Norfolk. 2-star Admiral Graham (with his eye on his third star, and a grudge against Dodge) assigned him the ragtag crew, hoping they would screw so Dodge would lose. Can Tom Dodge work the teams quickly and work as a team, and can he take an old, outdated part and beat the fleet's best?
