I enjoyed Erkan & Stefan? a cool and fast-paced story that didn't go into detail. Those two guys are great to watch and can constantly get new ideas. The high quality of the photo and cut support the film a lot. <br /> <br /> Erkan & Stefan show that the German film industry can convey successful Hollywood concepts with local satire in our theater farm.
