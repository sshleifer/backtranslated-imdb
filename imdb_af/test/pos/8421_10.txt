It is a film about a six-year-old child from a town in Maharashtra (a state in India) and his grandfather coming to Pune (a city in Maharashtra) to treat the child's eyes. Here the grandfather realized that the child had cancer in both eyes and that they had to be removed to save the child's life. The movie is about the main characters and their feelings and actions to the operation. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a typical Clich√© Indian movie, so thinly expected to see songs or romance or melodrama. This is a highly crafted sensitive film that predominantly considers quiet expressions rather than the top dial to get the point through. see the scene where the grandfather is told about the need to remove the child's eyes. The acting is great, dialogue breaks. Your heart goes out for the grandfather who has the unenviable task of telling the child and his mother about the operation. <br /> <br /> Handling the subject was excellent. The film was made under great hardship by the director, Sandeep Sawant, who had to beat many doors to collect the Rs. Six million (about $ 130,000) budget. even then the final product looks polished and has good production values. also see the subtle city-town contrast shown by the director by including some random shots of the boy's life in the village. Sawant certainly seems to prefer village life. <br /> <br /> Everything acting is excellent. Amruta Subhash as a social worker is able to add the required human touch to her role. Sandeep Kulkarni as the doctor is wonderful and shows perfect ways of a doctor. Ashwin Chitale as the child is natural. He doesn't seem to act. everything about him is natural and does not seem forced. <br /> <br /> But above all, Arun Nalawade is grandpa. He's amazing in his role. mere words cannot describe his work. It's a show to cherish forever. <br /> <br /> Shwaas is a sincere effort to make good theater. It should not be ignored just because it shows that if things are kept simple, the results can really be surprising. 10/10.
