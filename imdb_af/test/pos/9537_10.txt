Maybe once in a generation, a movie is perfect. For me, the "Railroad Children" is the movie - a timeless classic that is beautifully directed and executed. It shows everything worthwhile in humanity and climax in the conquest of love and faith over cruel injustice. Every show is a gem, though Bobbie stands out and, like Judy Garland as Dorothy in front of her, makes it impossible for us to put someone else in the role. <br /> <br /> The world is getting better for this movie and the kids today would be much better off viewing it. <br /> <br /> Of course, like many young men of my generation, I fell in love with Jenny Agutter and her hold was so strong when I was lucky enough to meet her a few days ago, the staggering smile and still like dripping honey still there to send me weak on the knees, as they did for the first time years ago!
