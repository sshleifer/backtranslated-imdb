It's a very sad and touching movie! It deals with the subject of child abuse. It is very sad, but mostly a true story, because it happens every day. Elia Wood and Joseph Mazzello play the two children or Lorraine Bracco, a single mother who just tries to make a home for them. While living with her parents, a man who likes to be called "The King" comes in their lives. He hit the youngest son, Bobby, but the two brothers promised not to tell their mother. But eventually she finds out, after the Bobby has been hurt. The end destroyed it for me, because it is so incredible. But, except for that, I love the movie.
