Gore dogs beware ... this is not your movie. This little nail bitter has very little blood and gut. It's basically a version of Open Water that is effective and worthwhile. But what makes it different is that we actually hold the three clues (other than open water) that find themselves on a tree when a crocodile guides their fishing boat flippers and their guide. We don't want any harm to come to any of them. So when they start getting dangerous situations, we really care. <br /> <br /> Now I like murderers, but I'm not impressed with Lake Placid until Primeval (although I'm still waiting to see Rogue and hope it's somewhere as good as this!) but this little bugger did the job and did the job well. It's scary, creative, and it just ends in the corridor of the mill, furiously crying and begging for short stalks of realism, so I never got annoyed. <br /> <br /> I remember reading the true story that inspired three guys to go fishing and two came in a tree while their buddy was killed by the crocodile. But the thing that always affected me that was left out of the movie was that the crocodile didn't eat the mate. No. For hours and hours he swam around the tree and the dead body still shaken in the mouth of the friends in the tree. To stay, if you come here, is what will happen to you.
