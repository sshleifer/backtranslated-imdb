Lots of action, cheese love story, unexpected actors and great fun. The special effect is acceptable / decent, some of the battles are neat and tidy with some interesting acrobatic movements. The overall story moves together, and is cute enough to wonder when the inevitable will happen, though there is a twist (just a small one). The overall naivety of the movie sometimes makes it very erratic. Nice enough chicks too, what else can you have. PS. If you are going to review a movie like this, try to review it in terms of the category that the movie would fall (not necessarily where it was going to fall). ie don't bombard good movies!
