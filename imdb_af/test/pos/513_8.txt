If you like horror or action, watch this movie ASAP. If the opening scene does not get your adrenaline pump, someone should monitor your wrist. Great action, excellent casting and top one-liners. This is the only movie I saw in a cinema where the crowd complains, kicks and punches. Not perfection, but who cares when movies are so much fun. This is a pure rush of dark comic book action. 9/10
