The battle at Elderbrush Gulch was Griffith's longest and most expensive short he had made up to that point. In it we see him trying to make the large-scale action scene needed in his full-length features. He tackles all the elements that made his previous action successful. <br /> <br /> Griffith uses the western format ?? All the perfect backdrop for pure, straight forward steps? as the institution for its first epic battle. Like many western of the 1910s, is the starting point a character from the east lying from the west? a device that might have helped relieve the audience in the desert, and here the oriental are a few children, which was important for the type of image it was developing. For Griffith, you can't do action without a sense of vulnerability and here he crawls it in, with the kids from behind, Lillian Gish as the disturbed mother of "the only baby in town" and even a few puppies which is in danger of the Indian menu. <br /> <br /> All this paves the way for an extremely complex and layered action series, which mixes the prisoner heroine scenario and the ride-to-rescue with the battles Griffith Since his earliest Civil War photos in 1909 depicted it. There is a phenomenal amount going on here, and Griffith does very well to keep the exciting pace right and to keep everything coherent and logical. However, juggling lots of elements in an action series does not necessarily make it so much more exciting, no matter how skilled they are, and Griffith created before and after this a better-stressed final. <br /> But even a Griffith image that is so focused on action would not be without its drama, characterization and atmospheric character. In the battle with Elderbrush Gulch, the emotional setup is briefly but economically handled. First, we have the scene in which the waifs leave their home. The car drives them away from the camera and uses depth and distance to move away from safety and civilization. An equally effective scene is the one in which we are introduced to the young family of Gish, Bobby Harron and their baby. The people from the village dome over the precious, then saunter off screen, reveal that two Indians looked at the background, adding a sinister note of danger. <br /> <br /> Of course, many viewers today have pointed out The Battle at Elderbrush Gulch's offensive depiction of Native Americans (as opposed to the more sympathetic Red Man's View), but perhaps it's not all it looks. First look at the Indian Head's son's jacket? It is black and covered with shiny white spots. It seems to me like a pearl shoe jacket, which may be slightly changed for the warmer climate. Now look at the "war dance" they later perform? It has a certain "knee-up Mother Brown" air on it. These are not Indians, they are hackies! It should not be offensive to Native Americans. Just chicks.
