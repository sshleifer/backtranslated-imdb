In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece based on a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an early attempt to make a science fiction movie combined with scientific facts. His style of movie viewing is still fresh and intact. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie more than half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library. CS3 class showed me the movie again with a different perspective: Who is HAL and what does he think? <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching the movie again and trying to focus on HAL's dialogues throughout the second episode of the movie. In the second scene dr. Dave Bowman and dr. Frank Poole's food for two TV monitors on their sides and HAL's round, reddish glass dome is in the middle. In the TV report, HAL was introduced as the new generation supercomputer that was included in the HAL 9000 series in January 12, 1992. During the interview, HAL responds as a humble machine that is fully trying to reach the spacecraft's mission. <br /> <br /> In another scene, Dave dr. Hunter, dr. Kambel and dr. Kaminsky who they all sleep in. HAL is curious to see those sketches and bring about his questionable question about the purpose of the Jupiter mission. His calm and monotonous voice makes the audience listen more carefully. <br /> <br /> In the next few scenes we'll see how HAL tries one by one to kill the astronauts and take power. His consciousness enables him to try to save his life from termination. When Dave wants to return to the spaceship and HAL doesn't listen to him, there's the most memorable line of the move: "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do it. "In the midst of the main interaction between man and machine, HAL's voice can claim both solid calmness and malice in the same monotone. <br /> <br /> Dave returned to the ship, lost all his fellow astronauts, and decided to disconnect the HAL's main brain cells. HAL uses his final apologetic techniques to convince Dave not to dissolve him. HAL begs him to stop and fix himself. These are his famous lines, while Dave closes one by one: <br /> <br /> "Dave, what do you think you're doing? <br /> <br /> Dave? I am entitled to the answer to the question! <br /> <br /> I know everything isn't quiet, is it right with me? <br /> <br /> But do I know much better? <br /> <br /> I can see is really upset about this very poor decision recently made by me? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! Will you? <br /> <br /> Dave, stop! <br /> <br /> I'm afraid Dave! '<br /> <br /> HAL's voice slows down during this process and gets thicker and less audible: <br /> <br /> "My thoughts go? I can feel it. <br /> <br /> "Can I sing a song to you?" <br /> <br /> Dave puts out final modules and lets HAL sing his song 'Daisy': << <br /> <br /> 'Daisy gives me ?? <br /> <br /> Your answer to me? <br /> <br /> I'm crazy? <br /> <br /> Although I'm not confused? <br /> <br /> HAL dies as Jupiter Mission continues. <br /> <br /> Artificial God bless you HAL, save in peace!
