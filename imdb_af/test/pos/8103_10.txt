"The Great Dictator" is probably one of Charlie Chaplin's best-known films. It is notorious because it is blatant satire of Adolf Hitler and Nazism. Until I looked at it, I just knew of his fame. Now I know how much the movie deserves. <br /> <br /> The movie basically shows the exploitation of the somewhat clumsy, ambitious, melted and impressive dictator of Tomania, Adenoid Hynkel; and with him, his close and dear staff: Field Marshall Haring and Herr Garbitsch. It also involves the exploitation of an amateur, emotional and often clumsy Jewish hairdresser, a veteran of the First World War. <br /> <br /> At the plot I want to say that this film has different features that make it both unique and wonderful. While the comedy is definitely both verbal and slapstick and occasional, the whole movie shows how serious it is to Nazism or aggressive nationalism as a theme with several interludes. Chaplin's impeccable acting skills vary completely in the film, holding it up and down until it just explodes. Paulette Goddard's position as an ambitious Jewish uprising would be and Henry Daniell's delivery of a nasal, calm-and-death-serious-as-a-heart attack line provides for wonderful viewing. <br /> <br /> Moreover, one aspect of the film is what makes it so special: it doesn't bump. It's not 'hidden', it's not deceptive. It is an open, blatant, in your face, obvious to both Hitler and Nazism. <br /> <br /> To summarize, look at it. Look, you will see it.
