Although I have seen this movie in Korea, in Korea, and therefore do not understand the language, images say more than enough. From what I can make it, it is the story: Two beautiful swordsmen become friends in their service as the king's guard. One of them finds himself against the king's ways and starts killing important men. The other must hunt him. This movie is visually good. The sword fighting is wonderful. And the movie has a gripping end. I just hope this movie will be marketed for western filmmakers. And, of course, is released on DVD.
