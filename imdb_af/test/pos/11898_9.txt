I just want to say that this movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> I loved it from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> The acting was wonderful. The director did a wonderful job and I want to see it again. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly did a very good performance. The guy who interpreted his father. (Manny) was another good actor, but I can't recall his name. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for El Padrino II. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa looks so good and I think he's one of the most talented actors out there. There is a plea by Latin actors who do a good job as shown in this movie! <br /> <br /> Rent it !!! Rent it !!! Rent it !!!
