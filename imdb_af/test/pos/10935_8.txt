An unusual, revisionist Western, worthy look. Despite a slow start, does the film build? with hardly any dialogue and no captions? an increasingly involved and intense, almost existential portrait of life in the harsh environment of the western desert. The growth of the main characters is worth the wait and the strong central throw brings a real sense of despair in the battle for ownership of the everyday horse. How interesting it was by a British director. I hope he smiles now: I get the impression the movie is largely ignored by contemporaries; But time is working its usual alchemy, and hidden gold shines as it must inevitably. One note threw me: revisionism is only carried on so far. Sam Waterston as an Indian? - awarded he plays his role with true emotion and intensity, but really, can't one American Indian actor be found doing the job? But his plays with Caroline Langrishe have an intimacy that contrasts beautifully with the vast landscape around them. <br /> <br /> Forget big, bankrupt Hollywood versions of the past, men with great chorus and swirling music; This one is about an ancient battle between protagonists who, getting rid of all the bumps of 'ordinary' life, understand what is worth fighting. Impressive.
