How would you feel if you only had a few weeks left to stay? This movie helps you know through the eyes of one guy who is confronted with that situation. It is told with sympathy and without too much emotion. Some may feel slow - but I think it adds to the realism of the movie. Some may see it as a love story, but I think it's secondary to seeing his last days through his eyes. The love of his life is part of the end of his life and gives it more impact. Low key and soft, the film rolls out the story as life does it. Without a click and with unexpected events against a background to pass. If you prefer to keep your movies emotionally realistic, it can be for you.
