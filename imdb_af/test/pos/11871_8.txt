This movie never comes up with a list of the top 50 movies of all time, but compiling a list of "fun movies" isn't a bad place to start. Liv Tyler is wonderful, engaging and fun, and everyone is dead for their parts. This is a 21st century counterpart for Tom Jones, in other words; just good, fun. I think it might be Tyler's breakthrough movie on the way to the main stars. With no nudity she puts sex in this movie. No wonder all the boys are giving her toys. How can they help but do it for a helpless, innocent like Liv's Jewel?
