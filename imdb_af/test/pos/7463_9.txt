I'm very surprised at how little known this movie was. I think it has to do with distribution companies and so on. <br /> <br /> Don't be idiots - if you're looking for a great pleasure, take this movie - it's a great movie to pass for a few hours and the music is BIG. <br /> <br /> It's about ..... good girls and boys and what's between them with not too much story but not all movies should be PULP FICTION as they ?? It's nice and cute and gives good time. The girls are also very nice and it makes the whole movie even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Why did I just give it a 9? Well, the story can be a little more convincing about the middle and up. At one stage, you begin to see fewer, less reliable events. SMALL SPOILER: The baby cries and the father enters and tries to relax him. now I'm not talking about a little cry, but non-hysterical crying and 30 seconds afterwards the father goes out and 'baby sleeps' - excuse me, when and how exactly did you calm him down and sleep and can go into his room 20-30 seconds. but ignore this kind of small pick because the movie itself is not Docudrama - it's fun and it must be overlooked.
