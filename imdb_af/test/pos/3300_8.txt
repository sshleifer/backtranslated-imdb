I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie capturing the essence of <br /> <br /> high-brow NYC, or any big city of Middle-America. The colors, the <br /> <br /> cars, the clothes and the arrival of the women's movement. It reflects the <br /> <br /> comfortable attitudes of relationships between men and women in the <br /> <br /> corporate world. In some ways things have changed and in others they have not changed <br /> <br />. Women still want what men have today, but they <br /> <br /> now have all kinds of laws and equality mandates to get them. In <br /> <br /> my opinion, beautiful women will still pursue themselves in men <br /> <br /> to achieve their goals! The laws we now have against harassment and <br /> <br /> everyone has been passed by unattractive women who had an equal chance to <br /> <br /> compete with prettier women who might be the positions get. /> <br /> based on their looks and protruding! The right competition is not between <br /> <br /> men and women, but women and women! I like the look and feel of the movie, but the world hasn't changed as <br /> <br /> far as it really is
