In a phrase, moral ambiguity. In the Soderbergh remake there are good guys and bad guys. Benicio del Toro's character is clearly the good guy, morally clean and invulnerable. His counterpart in the BBC original, Fazal, has changed the farmer's trader, is realistically flawed and contrary to his fate. The two relentless police are equally different. In the American one they win our hearts. In the BBC original, they are diligent, almost obsessive. <br /> <br /> The best moment for me in Soderbergh's was when college student rhetoric asked the drug czar: "What would you do if you were poor and black and rich white people came to your area for drugs "This point was illustrated by the BBC program and crystallized in Jack Lithgow's final speech. Both are excellent, but the BBC towers over the remake. My conclusion after seeing both performances is that traders are innocent pawns who just give a question, and that is the question that causes so much suffering.
