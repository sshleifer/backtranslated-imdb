I can't come across the quality of the score, the book, and the performances. It's the first production I've ever seen from Sweeney Todd, so I have no one to compare it to. But the impact is so strong, I just can't imagine anything better. <br /> <br /> First there is the music - take "Johanna" (Law II), during which Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna include a woven line of voice that includes the melodies of three songs. It's like a Bach coral in that sense - just a masterpiece of composition. And the underlying chord structure and voices are so perfect - a little melancholy, a little contentment, a little longing, all of which portray the three singers' views. <br /> <br /> Then - - the lyrics. The rhymes are so clever. The rhyme schemes sometimes seem random, but they always count at the end. (The DVD, which I watched, has closed texts, and it is essential to appreciate the dialogue and the lyrics.) Sondheim deserves a literary award for his poetry alone. <br /> <br /> Finally, those appearances. I can't imagine anyone better than George Hearn. Why haven't I heard about him yet? She sings, alone, is masterful, but the spectrum of his play is simply amazing. Angela Lansbury totally surprised me. The song about "you and me next to the sea" - who can do it better? Her timing is flawless, pitch is perfect, every beat of the score is accounted for; It's a dark story, but I found it to be nice; and the song to "Johanna" still plays in my head.
