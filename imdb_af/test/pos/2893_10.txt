"Rush in Rio" is undoubtedly one of the most exciting DVDs I bought. Although I have been a biased Rush fan for almost twenty years, I have found that this display is flawless. The music is heavy and sharp (it sounds good on any surround sound system), the band is energetic, the crowd has a constant smile ... it's as if they could catch every concert I was working on. For any Rush fan, this DVD is a must; if any, just to see the "Boys in Brazil" documentary (showing the travels of this rather isolated personal band). For any non-Rush fan, this DVD is a pleasant concert. Rush fans know the talent of these three Canadians. We stood firmly with them for years. I showed this DVD (or portions of it anyway) to those who have never heard of Rush, or those who think Rush is less than good because they don't call on the pessimistic masses of rock (ie sex , drugs, and a drunken madness. The bottom line is that this DVD is worth every penny and more than the time to watch it.
