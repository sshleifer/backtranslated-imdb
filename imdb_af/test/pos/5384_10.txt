Bwana Devil is allegedly the first major studio, full-length feature filmed entirely in the 3D process. According to alleged producer Oboler went to Africa to shoot another movie, but after the story of two lions that were nice, the railway builders became terror. It's also a good story, almost Hemmingway-like; fear, salvation, the great white hunter and all. It is telling the story that seems to be drawing, almost as if the filming in the new process was too heavy for the crew. The action scenes are stiff, almost to increase. But these technical issues seem small in view of the dramatic conclusion of the film.
