For his last film, John Huston directed his daughter, Anjelica, to adapt the story of James Joyce's "Dubliners" and he gave us one of his best achievements to remember. <br /> <br /> Joyce is about as impossible to roll as anyone, but "The Dead" offers at least a traditional story to work with. Many (indeed all) of the important information in the story lie in the spaces between the lines, in the characters' thoughts and expressions. There are big moments, but they are cerebral - these are not the things that make movies. But Huston gets it right, and he manages an almost flawless adjustment. <br /> <br /> Anjelica is wonderful, and the movie is haunting and powerful. <br /> <br /> Degree: A
