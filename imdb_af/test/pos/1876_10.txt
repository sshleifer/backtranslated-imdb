Well, no one will pick up a movie titled "The Man with the Screaming Brain" in their proper mind and expect it to be serious. It's an outrageous b-movie, which means a real hokey plot, weird characters, clich√©s, overall action and o-so-cute one linen. For that strange segment of the population (including myself) who gets a kick from that kind of thing, it's a jewel. <br /> <br /> The acting is better than expected. Stacy Keach is embedded in his character. Bruce Campbell brings a lively, convincing performance. His physical comedy skills are truly impressive in this movie and back to the "Evil Dead" movies.
