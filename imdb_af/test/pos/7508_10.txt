I have been waiting for a new DVD release of this wonderful movie for years to come. I own a beta recording with FRENCH language. Unfortunately, MGM leaves the French track on his recent DVD ... Only English has a French subtitle ... I don't know how MGM is advised: I wrote them emails, but of course no answer. If I insist, this is because the double track in French is exceptionally spectacular, funny, well-written, etc. George C. Scott is always outstanding and for people born in the fifties like me, Diana Rigg represents something very different from Madonna (for example). Thank you for your help ... Kind regards ...
