A group of young travelers who just ran out of gas are in a strange washing museum called "Saluesen's Lost Oasis" owned by a strange man named Slausen (Chuck Conners) as the dummies are controlled by a mysterious force and a crazy man with special powers they are dead. <br /> <br /> One of the most undervalued horror movies of the late 70's! This Charles Band (producer of "Re-Animator") production has become one of the frightening and most unique low-budget horror productions of the day combining a few psychological themes without having a bit like the ordinary treasure film. The movie keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats with tension and some horror stories. Since then, the movie has been a cult diamond for the genre. It's worth watching. <br /> <br /> Also recommend: "Pin", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)", "The Hills has Eyes (1977)", "Maniac (1980)", "Magic" (1978), " Dolls "," May "," Just Before Dawn "," The Devil's Rejects "," Sleepaway Camp "," Mother's Day "," A Nightmare on Elm Street "," Friday The 13th "," Halloween 1 & 2 ", "Puppet Master", "House of Wax" (1953 and 2005), "Jeepers Creepers", "High Spanning", "Evil Dead II", "From Dusk Till Dawn", "Waxwork", "Nothing But Trouble" and " Psycho (1960) ".
