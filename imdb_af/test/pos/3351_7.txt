Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll story is much better than you'd expect. Here, Alice is a virgin librarian who falls in love and learns to love sex and her own self-esteem. Made when adult movies were creative efforts with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, it's a nice movie that's more in keeping with the low budget films of his day. Despite what you may think, this movie actually has a good writing with funny jokes and good songs. It's a naughty adult story. If you're wondering if my recommendation is a good one or not, you think the movie wasn't quite available in its non-hardcore version for the better part of the past three decades, simply because the movie is getting up with sex, what is i seeing the movie on cable TV year ago. The relatively recent home release on DVD returns the generation (in extremely grainy pieces) which makes it clear that the removal of shots was the best choice. If you are an open-minded adult with a taste for something spicy, I can heartily recommend this little movie as a good distraction.
