Haggard should not even be graded as it was never designed to be graded as Oscar-winning movies, and it was never meant to win an Oscar (of course). If you just look at some things that Bam and Bran have tried, such as the fast shots, it comes as a movie that is more than just cky or jackass (although it's cool too). For pure pleasure I definitely give this movie a 10; Almost every scene made me laugh until my sides hurt, like the dragon's movie. If you haven't seen it, see it and buy it. Personally, my favorite character is brandon (falcone), he is just as fluent and natural and random that his hilarious, he freestyles big (with action characters) and makes the funniest thing lol a diamond mountain bike? haggard is definitely a movie that, in overall humor, is only competitive by anchorman and napoleon dynamite.
