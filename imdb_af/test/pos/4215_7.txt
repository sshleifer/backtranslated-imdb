I'll be honest, I rented this movie just because it was part of the "Child's Play" series. I expected a boring, dull fourth part of the series, but I was surprised. This movie was surprisingly good, and I found it pretty funny. There was a lot of dark humor, and the idea of ​​having two dolls was a great way to get things done. The two dolls worked well together and a bonnie and clyde type added to the film. Overall it was great for a 4th film in the series, with some gruesome deaths. Just look at the Marilyn Manson type being murdered at first, not to mention John Ritter getting a face full of nails. Applause for the authors to spearhead and end, although I left it a bit strange, still has room for another prosecution ... maybe "Chucky's son" !!!
