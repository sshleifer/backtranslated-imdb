Two sisters, Su-mi (IM Soo-Jung) and Su-Yeon (MOON Geun-Young) come back with their father (Kim Gap-soo). Eun-joo (YEOM Jeong-ah) welcomes them, but Su-mi's way is bitter to her. Su-mi hates Eun-joo because the father made her act like the housewife after the sister's mother died. When she sees her attitude, Eun-joo gets the sisters cold and treats them with a tense atmosphere. <br /> <br /> As it is being introduced through the atmosphere, a whole host of mysterious things are taking place in the home. When Su-mi hangs her dress in her wardrobe, many dresses of the same design have been hung. When she puts her diary in a drawer, she finds another diary of the same kind. When she sleeps in her bed with scared Su-yeon, a nightmare awakens her and finds a woman standing on her - and a hand hangs out of the woman's dress! <br /> <br /> Mysterious things occur to other people too. On the evening of next weekend, Eun-joo's brother and his wife visit the family and they have a meal together. Eun-joo cheerfully talks about a crazy man she met when she was a child, but no one was interested in talking to her. She said the crazy man irritated the brother, but he said he didn't know anything about the man. <br /> <br /> Listen to their talk, the brother's wife panic. <br /> <br /> After dinner, the conflict between Eun-joo and the sisters gets worse. Eun-joo draws Su-yeon in a wardrobe and closes her in it. Su-mi saves the crying sister and complains to their father who did Eun-joo to his daughter. But his response is unexpected. "Give me a chance." he says terribly: "Sir, please. Don't make me tired anymore." <br /> <br /> And the following words from the father's mouth are more shocking than they saw in the house. <br /> <br /> To tell the truth, I hate horror movies. Although I sat at a theater, because my intuition told me, the movie was something else, and I regret that my curiosity made me do it when it began to show. However, the regret was changed ten minutes later for joy. <br /> <br /> This movie is a tragic riddle more than an abomination - more painful than terrible; beautiful more than sensational. It may be a hard core gossip winner disappointed, but for a mysterious fan like me, this movie is a must see. (9 out of 10)
