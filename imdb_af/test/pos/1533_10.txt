I am very grateful to see this movie. The play is amazing, the movie itself is powerful and clear, and the issues involved are treated with subtlety and depth. <br /> <br /> It's an important movie. It can be deeply transforming. <br /> <br /> I'll pay good money, never see it again. Being * so good and so complex, it is extremely difficult to watch. I admit that my taste in movies is strong to light entertainment; The visual medium can be so powerful that I tend to avoid it for something really important. Those of you with greater strength than I have can handle it more easily. <br /> <br /> But I strongly encourage people to see it at least once. Preferably with others, so you can talk to each other and have someone to remind you that there is more to the world than the movie.
