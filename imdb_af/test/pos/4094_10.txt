The 1973 musical version of LOS HORIZON is the most beautiful and campus music films of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel on the mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mix of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of the only anti-war musical fantasy ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail. Very different and unique in its approach to film music, it earns much better credit than it is given. As a story, lost horizon is an incredible adventure and both the 1937 Frank Capra movie and these 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of the James Hilton novel. What I like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented. The film features a prestigious film and a talented director and filmographer. It's a BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La and it's a great place. Songs like the world are a cycle, share the joy and live together, grow together a happiness that Hilton wrote in his novel. Why shouldn't Shangri-La be a little goofy place? The two love songs, I HAVE TO USE WE ARE USED, and the extracted I COME TO YOU are the sensitive places in the picture. There is a peaceful and gentle spoken quality in both of these songs that adheres to the philosophy of the story. Furthermore, the things I won't miss are a good duet with a strong melody. This is a good exchange of different types of perspective and who can bump, sing and dance on tables with Olivia Hussey and Sally Kellerman? They are a great team and the number is good. <br /> <br /> I have always found it interesting in this story how the High Lama kidnapped someone from the outside world to take his place in Shangri-La. The character of the High Lama is a gentle soul, but somewhat radical in his view of man as a whole. He has no hope for the world outside Shangri-La. If this film were to be made again today, it would be interesting to focus more on the main character, RICHARD ONWAY's conflict with what he left behind in the outside world, as opposed to what he found in Shangri-La. <br /> <br /> Of course, to be credible for the film, the character of RICHARD CONWAY should be presented as a suffering at the end, as he was in the book. No movie versions of lost horizon were true to the novel in this regard. Did Conway find Shangri-La or was it imagined? Did they all die in the plane crash? Every man has his own idea of ​​what his Shangri-La would be. The conflict with Conway who wants to believe in Shangri-La and return to his old life in the outside world is powerful. I love the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy and Van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. Interesting how Conway does not want to leave paradise, but expressed by his brother. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both are successful at James Hilton's ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation. So in that sense it is anti-capitalism in the theme where money and materialism are not the motivation. Human friendliness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and harmony with one another are the rule. <br /> <br /> LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musical ones. It seeks to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and it is almost impossible to make them guilty. One should remember that LOST HORIZON was in CABARET post in 1973. It was no longer fashionable to break out characters in a musical, much less to be baptized by other singers. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for criticized critics. The expectations for that were high, almost unreasonable. There were two targets to be hit, the producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH and the critics were out to get both of them. Ross Hunter enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer. Lost Horizon was his follow-up movie for his 1970's solid AIRPORT. This film has so far been the universe's biggest money maker and the success of that picture has resulted in a decade of disaster. For years, AIRPORT was the most watched movie ever to be shown on television. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including the best photo. At that time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful songwriters in the country. The petty sentimentality of LOS HORIZON barely had a chance in the aftermath of censorship in films such as EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODFATHER. Sex and violence were a new frontier in the late 60's and the early 70's heard that they were movie on content movies that they didn't use to see on the screen. Lavisse musical is no longer well received, no matter how good they are. Today, lost horizon can be enjoyed and appreciated at various levels. It's the ultimate escapist movie with a strong story, great music, an expensive budget and a bit of impressive humor. It is unconventional in the sense that the music is not released in the movie for up to 45 minutes. It changes course halfway when the mystical valley is introduced and why not? LOST HORIZON '73 is a heavenly film to be rediscovered. A lost and legendary treasure earns much better than it's reputation.
