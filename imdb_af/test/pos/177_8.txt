In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of the animation with the release of the first episode of their "Silly Symphonies" series, "The Skeleton Dance". Iwerks and Disney have worked together since the early 20s, in Disney's "Laugh-O-Gram" cartoon; But their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted a competitor's offer to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. It was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued to develop his style and technique (and created the character of Flip the Frog). While his work maintained the same high quality, it wasn't really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed. Later that year Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures, and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance, this time in color. <br /> <br /> 1937's "Skeleton Frolics" is essentially a remake of the 1929 classic "The Skeleton Dance", the film that received him celebrity and fortune. Like that short film, it is on an abandoned cemetery, after which midnight the creatures of the night are alive and starting to play. The dead are rising from their coffins, ready for the show to begin, as a group of skeletons formed an orchestra and began to play a happy voice. Now it's not easy to be a musician of just bones, as some of the band members have problems with their body parts, but the group manages to make a good performance and start dancing another group of skeletons. A beautiful couple of them have the same troubles that troubled the orchestra: it's hard to dance with loose body parts. Everything ends with dawn, and just as the sun rises, the skeletons run to their graves. <br /> <br /> Directed and animated by Ub Iwerks himself, "Skeleton Frolics" follows the pattern presented by "The Skeleton Dance" years, though with a major difference: Iwerks did the whole movie in Technicolor. The shining tonals allowed Iwerks to create a more visually appealing movie and also to use the many new techniques he has practiced since he left Disney. He made even better effects of depth and dynamics than he previously thought. This is definitely a more experimental movie than "The Skeleton Dance", but unfortunately it doesn't necessarily mean a better movie. To start, the movie is almost identical to the one he did with Disney. The only differences are the music (more later) and the color effects. It looks beautiful, no doubt about it, but it definitely feels incredibly unmistakable. <br /> <br /> However, it is not the inconsistency of the concept that really hurts the movie (finally, Iwerks performs it in a wonderful way), but the fact that the musical melody by Joe DeNat for the movie created, is pretty uninteresting and lacks the beautiful elegance and whimsical fun of the one who made Carl W. Stalling for "The Skeleton Dance". In other words, while DeNat's voice is efficient and suitable for the theme, it's easy to forget it quickly, while Stalling's song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. Being a music movie is of great importance, and so the mediocrity of the music brings work to flawless work of animation. Personally, I think, with a better musical accompaniment, "Skeleton Frolics" is remembered as fiery as "The Skeleton Dance" despite not being so groundbreaking, as it is still a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Sadly, most of the work that Iwerks did after leaving Disney is now being forgotten because of his poor success, as if Iwerks are the popularity of Disney or Fleischer ( Miss Disney's main rival, he doesn't have the quality of those companies' films. It was probably just a case of accident that the man who played for Disney for the first time in Disney's life failed. Despite its shortcomings, Skeleton Frolics is a very funny and visually stunning movie, while it's not exactly the original and freshest movie (one can only think of "The Skeleton Dance" while watching), reminding us ruled that Iwerk's skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire us. <br /> <br /> 8/10
