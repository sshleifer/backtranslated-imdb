I watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer and didn't really start to love the show until Season 4 started. This episode "Hush" was opened by me alone in the dark just after midnight with my windows and the wind was raging by a storm. The authors of this episode have done an excellent job frightening my heel. I got rid of the whole episode I just completed 2 minutes ago. Amazing does not touch the surface of this episode with almost no dialogue. If you've never given this show, you should at least watch this episode. If it doesn't impress you, there probably won't be an episode. <br /> <br /> VAT My Heart is still racing ...
