is not a bad movie, but the play and the script can be better. I like this movie because I have a life that is a good part of the movie. It is difficult for a lost generation to find a life in Romania, and 90 percent of us choose something else, and that includes dealing with people with bad habits if you understand me, but it comes to area. This movie represents me and I like it. I have a rage in me talking to barley with people, I live in a mess society and I can't fit in and I don't want to, and that's also the story of movie, if you're like me, you can understand the true movie, if not, you will find it easy and cheap.
