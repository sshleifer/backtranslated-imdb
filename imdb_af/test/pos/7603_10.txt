This movie may seem superficial and teen-boppers. It looks like the stereotypical high school movie is. But it actually takes a fair and pleasant look at the high school experience. It does not represent an unrealistic end where the geeks and the popular children are reconciled. It doesn't change what happened in adolescence; it just tries to count on it. It's a very good, fun, heartwarming movie, good for teenagers and for those who still remember it.
