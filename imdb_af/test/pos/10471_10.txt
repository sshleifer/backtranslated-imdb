The French Babbette appears in the humble house of two Danish sisters, wet, cold and alone. Volatile revolution in Paris, seeking refuge in a dark religious community on the windy Jutland coast. <br /> <br /> Unbeknownst to those who take it so generously, she is a good chef, an artist of food. Babette gives herself to her adopted community through thrift, productivity and shared faith. She only leaves when she wins the French lottery - 10 000 francs. She goes back with an exotic load, claiming a single meal to celebrate the sister's father's birthday, the community's founder. <br /> <br /> This meal is dark in the mind of the pleasure-denying faithful, but its subtleties have been translated by an obsolete military officer who, as a young man in Paris, learned to experience the sensory experience unfold here, appreciate. The meal is the climax of the film, a community of love in the passing artworks of food - continually lifting art, love and the meaning of life.
