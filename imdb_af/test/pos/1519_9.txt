this movie caught me in the endless thinking about it for days afterwards ... allowed me not to be the snob that some people look around here, but I thought it was wonderfully well done and a powerful creation, like that not have a little subtlety in execution. I have admired movies that can effectively recreate the sensation of a play, creating an unconscious honesty that works well with this movie. I'm also a big fan of Alan Rickman, so this can be my bias. Personally, I have found the lack of spatial landmarks a good thing - it can actually be anywhere and probably. I easily say what a powerful experience was for me, and probably for anyone involved in any kind of political activity.
