OK, so maybe that's because I'm from the North East of Scotland and I'm talking to the guys in this movie, but I found this great pleasure. Cheap fun to be sure, but a lot of effort has come to make the movie look good and the actors definitely give it all. I was actually working properly when they died. In particular, when the Captain finally fell. The script? Well, it's a 2-half game. The first half of the film is well written and sharp. The last half hour is not so good, with many questions unanswered. It will undoubtedly irritate others, as it irritates me. But still, fun and a very smart first feature of Sturton.
