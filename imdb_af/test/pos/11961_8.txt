Skilled aspiring cartoonist Hoops McCann (a wonderful performance by John Cusack) and his best friend George (the lethal Joel Murray) go to Nantucket for the summer after graduating from high school. Hoops, George, and some new friends are Cassandra (Demi Moore at her most charming). A Sanger's family home is threatened with demolition by the greedy Beckersted tribe. Author / director Savage Steve Holland often offers a hilariously wacky and zesty nonstop, albeit broad and silly, but still very funny jokes. The constant madcap lunacy has a huge, malignant and contagious vitality to what is impossible not to hold or resist. In addition, the lively and enthusiastic play of a delicate game contributes immensely to the multiplicity: Bobcat Goldthwait as the spastic egg yolk, Tom Villard as his naughty brother Clay, Curtis Armstrong as the sweet Ack Ack Raymond, Mark Metcalf as an evil rich jerk Aquilla Beckersted, Matt Mulhern as the average Teddy, Kimberly Foster as the cookie, Joe Flaherty as the gung-ho General Raymond, William Hickey, as a fiery Old Man Beckersted, Jeremy Piven as a former bowler Ty, and John Matuszak as Hulking biker Stan. Isidore Mankofsky's shining cinematography, hip thrashy soundtrack, Cory Lerios cool rockin score, and funky animation are all uniformly outstanding. Single funniest scene: Egg in a Godzilla suit that makes a nice dinner terror. An absolute hoot.
