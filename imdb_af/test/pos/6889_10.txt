Hey Yall! The best drama each is now on Gospel Music Channel! Go to their website to see the schedule and find out what number it is on your cable or satellite. It was one of my favorite programs that grew up. It has everything I want a TV program to be, a clean family-friendly drama that doesn't exploit me. The story of a man who has lost his job decides to stand up for a wonderful long-haul adventure. Along the way they meet all sorts of interesting people and find them in the midst of all sorts of problems. This show was originally a touch of Touched By An Angel, another great family program. Make sure you check it out!
