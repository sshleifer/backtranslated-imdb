I saw this movie last night and it was one of the best made for TV movies I saw. It was very well aimed and the acting was excellent, very convincing. The music was good and cinematography was beautifully shot. Take the hopelessness out of Requiem for a dream and you'll be wasted. An excellent portrayal of the world of drug addiction and its consequences in a very open way. cudos to mtv for us a great movie for a change of! * $ *% as crossroads.
