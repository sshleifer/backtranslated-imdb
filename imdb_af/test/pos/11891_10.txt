I just finished showing El Padrino in Germany. A good movie. We are looking forward to more movies by Mr. See Chapa in the future. It was great to watch such a good movie with such tension and a story that is an immediate classic. The end with little ambiguity leaves the story open for a successor. Watching a good-quality movie sets Chapa's serious potential and skill as a writer, actor, director, and filmmaker. Chapa has been very impressed with his triumphant performance in "blood in and blood out" and now he has proven that anyone who has seen his work is his potential to become a critically-known movie maker with real artistic control. Something that few filmmakers can afford.
