Fantastic movie! Wow - it's really a treat. I can't believe I've discovered such a jewel of a movie. <br /> <br /> A fun young girl traveling south to Florida meets a friendly older couple with a RV, after having an apartment at a resting place. However, she learns that things are not as they seem and the couple get a little creepy after spending some time on the road with them. <br /> <br /> Everyone in it was just as perfect for their parts you just believe you look, it's happening in real life for you. <br /> <br /> Newcomer Emily Grace did a fantastic job than the very cute, but somewhat shy Alice. Emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing and you can only see how she is in the situation that develops in the film. I'm sure we'll see more films in the future. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what others have said, the lighting and photography were not perfect here. The editing is also well done - just the right way to compile images from the highway to give you the feeling that you are traveling on the road with your trip. <br /> <br /> I didn't see it on the big screen, but I can only encourage everyone to go out and see it. More movies like this are * exactly * what we need. <br /> <br /> SF
