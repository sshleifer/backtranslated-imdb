I didn't expect much from this movie and I was slapped in the face. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint, and Laura Linney play great as the main characters in this movie. Any teenager may be related to parental control and the urge to come out as you really are. It's basically what this movie is about. Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets with retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express her ideas with words. He slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less uncomfortable. Every viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theater is full of laughter 75% of the time. The movie meets everyone, and I hope it will soon be released in all American theaters, because many people do not have the chance to watch the movie unless they live in big cities. This is a MUST see!
