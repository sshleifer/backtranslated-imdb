Tobe Hooper (fresh mainstream success with 'Poltergeist') strives for the clouds this time around. 'Life Force' is an adaptation of Colin Wilson's 'The Space Vampires'. The script of 'Alien's Dan O' Bannon and Don Jakoby ranges from a bit of what I have been told: the futuristic storyline has been made contemporary and Hailey's Comet has been added to coincide with his real-life Earth a few weeks after the movie was released. read. <br /> <br /> The story will send a commuter mission (Steve Railsback commander) to investigate Hailey's Comet, as it passes through the Earth. Everyone goes without a heel, but at the comets it comes to mind that an alien ship is hidden in the comet's coma. The team explores the massive structure and discovers dried-up bat-like creatures. Looking deeper into the ship, a room was found that contained three humanoids (two naked males and one who only retrieved post-lady) in strange booths. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat in tow. <br /> <br /> A little later, the ship returns to Earth, but no contact can be made by NASA and another commuter is launched to the mission status. When joining the Churchill, it was discovered that a massive fire had killed the crew and all the flight information. But the three humanoids remain. But it is taught that an escape speed has been launched, but whose accommodation is unknown. <br /> <br /> Soon they will discover the origin of the stranger when the very attractive space vampire queen emerges from her sleep to easily seduce the life force. of the men around her. If you make her face, she will make you look like them, and if you don't feed after two hours, you will dry out and become dust. The purpose of the three is to drain enough of the people's essence to support them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to waste them too. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the Commander is over-subscribing to the podium (crash land in Texas no less) and now has a psychic link to her royal warmth, the queen and can use it to find as she and the surviving male attempt to dry London from their souls. <br /> <br /> Tobe Hooper (from "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" (1974)) does an admirable job that has to be his greatest production to date. The production has made many fine technicians from all over the film industry. Production designer John Graysmark (fresh from The Bounty (1984)) uses every four stages of Elsree Studios to create the spacious interiors of the ship. Combatographer Alan Hume returns to science fiction after a stint on 'Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi' (1983) and three consecutive James Bond episodes. Hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the big effects. Oscar-winning John Dykstra innovator of the pioneering effects of the original Star Wars (1977) again manages to push the envelope to create a very creative and spectacular effect using lasers. Even maestro Henry Mancini falls in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feel. In the acting department, it falls pretty much on Steve Railsback's shoulders and newcomer Mathilda May (vampire queen). Railsback always puts an edge on the characters he plays and can play nuts like no one's business. It comes in hand if his mind worsens when the queen's grip on his soul tightens. Beautiful French actress May doesn't have many lines (was there more than ten?), But her regular nudity never gets old and you have to give her kudos to pull the jingle bells. Almost everything the queen is to feed, and to do so, she must seduce you with her sexual presence. Work done and where do I sign up to be a victim? I really enjoyed how they tackled the old vampire clich√©s and still managed to make it fresh but still easily recognizable. Almost everything is accounted for here: bats (their true shape looks like a big bat), chests (the stasis fields look like this), transformations (they kick your mind and can be anything), massive sexual appeal (Miss May. speaking, they also include the old assistance, through the heart (this time a bit of a main cloud to the energy center a little under the heart). The only thing they didn't touch was religion, but I think The vampires that use the cathedral at the end as home base might just be a nod and a nod. <br /> <br /> In short (yes, 800 words later) "Life Force" is an excellent science fiction and horror combination that pays homage to the vampire theme, while adding some neatly different wrinkles.The effects and scale of the production is enough to keep the summer movie types over (at least at the moment) and horror and sci fi fans 4 out of 5
