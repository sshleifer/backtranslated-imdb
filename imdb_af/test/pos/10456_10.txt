I saw it in a theater in 1982. I expected a stupid T&A movie. That's not what I got. <br /> <br /> It's basically about three teenage boys trying to have sex. We get the expected sex jokes and scenes - but one day they are pretty funny! <br /> <br /> Yes, they are stupid, but I enjoyed them at all. There was also a surprising amount of male nudity. <br /> <br /> Then the movie, about halfway through, is a sudden dramatic turn, as one of the boys (Lawrence Monoson, played by Lawrence Monoson) falls in love with a girl. Then the jokes stop and things get very dark. I'm not going to throw away what's happening, but I was very surprised at the sudden turn in events. The movie brings up some very important subjects and deals with them realistically and with intelligence. And it has a real heartbreaking end. <br /> <br /> I give it a 10 because it's probably one of the best teen sex comedies / plays ever made. It combines fantasy and realism together and works! What else can you ask for? It also has a BIG sound track.
