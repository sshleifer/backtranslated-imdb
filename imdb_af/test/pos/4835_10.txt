I watched the premiere of "Road to Paradise" and came back and thereby surprised, dramatic license and all. I lived and lived in NYC (Brooklyn) for several years. Today, seeing links to groups like Al-Queda, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, I see it as a warning not recognized by our government. For that, I blame our bureaucracy and leaders. 9.11.01 was a new tactic to decapitate two of our government branches and there is no excuse for us to prevent it. "Road to Paradise" was but a dramatic view of the '93 preview, and no one cared. Now, nearly 3,000 deaths later and years behind, we struggle to find an answer that is decades to resolve.
