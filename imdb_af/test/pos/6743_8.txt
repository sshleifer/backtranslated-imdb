In April 1947, New York City faced an epidemic crisis. Eugene LaBar, a back importer who comes from Mexico, arrived in the city and brought the deadly cup virus with him. He climbed off a bus, complained of fever and headache, and soon died in a Midtown hospital, but not before infecting a dozen passers-by. The damage has already been done; For the first time in decades, smallpox has hit the streets of New York. The city's health authorities quickly maintained to isolate sufferers and contain the virus. They launched a free vaccination campaign that immunized more than six million New Yorkers against smallpox. Thanks to their quick response, the virus was with minimal casualties. However, the outbreak must have left an indelible point. A few years later, it was followed by two similar movie noir thrillers in which doctors have to find a single infectious carrier in a city of millions: Elia Kazan's 'Panic in the Streets' (1950) and Earl McEvoy's Army budget 'The Killer That Stalked New York' (1950). ' <br /> <br /> McEvoy's film unfolds in an ominous documentary style. Reed Hadley's narrative sounds as if it is being pulled straight out of a news line and reflecting facts as if he were reading the official police transcript. This technique sometimes feels a bit cheap, but fortunately, the story is largely confined to the film's books, as well as giving some explanatory fillers during breaks in the plot. The killer New York, in this story, is not Mexico's carpet importer, but the beautiful diamond smuggler Sheila Bennet (Evelyn Keyes), who has just arrived from Cuba. Within a few days Sheila has two parties who pursue her independently: a treasury agent (Barry Kelley) who arrests her for smuggling crimes and a team of doctors (led by William Bishop) who identified her as the source of the smallpox -uitbraak. As in 'Panic in the Streets', another routine man-chase is given an increased sense of urgency, especially when those in the pursuit initially have no idea about the identity or appearance of their suspect. <br /> <br /> "The killer Stalked New York," for the most part, manages to stop its low production budget, apart from a few rules of dialogue ("we must stop it!" exclaiming Dr. Wood at one point, as if it's hard to decide, makes the filmmakers and role-players unfold the story in a realistic, surprising way, in this respect, the low budget probably helps the film's intentions, which require a documentary style that adding the immediate outcome scenario Evelyn Keyes is excellent in the lead and shows stubborn resilience in the face of unthinkable torment; By the end of the film, she looks so brutally incompetent by her illness that it is almost painful to look at her face Aside from the virus, Charles Korvin is the biggest villain of the piece, as Sheila's greedy and adulterous man, assured, gets everything that comes to him, and if all nurses like Dorothy Malone look like it may not a bad broad k does not look.
