And I love it !!! Wonder Shows will pick up a cult and as soon as it is canceled, the DVD sales will go all over. It's a very funny show in its own way. It's a parody of children's shows, namely Sesame Street. Our puppet characters consist of Chauncy, a yellow hairy monster with a hat, whose host. Clarence is a blue lizard like something that does its own segments where it goes out on the street. He is a strange dog like something that refers to himself in the third person. Wordsworth is the smart whose brain always shows. Then there is the newcomer and the pink puppet. It's a very funny show, not really as filthy as you'd expect, but more the situations. They take 7-year-olds on the street, tell them what to say, and make them joke they don't understand. My favorite segments are Clarence's videos, especially if someone doesn't want to be filmed. I prefer TV Funhouse, which was a similar show, but it's still a very funny show I hope it will last for years. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** 1/4 out *** *. 30 minutes. TV MA.
