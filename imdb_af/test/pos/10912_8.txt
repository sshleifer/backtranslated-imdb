A beautifully constructed and brilliant performance. There is no one in the cast who does not release him (or herself) with hilarious distinction. The real star of the movie, however, is the invisible director, Frank Oz, who brings all the comfortable sensitivity and knowledge to this farce he is giving to me. Piggy's meetings with Kermit brought the frog. This is an unmatched movie.
