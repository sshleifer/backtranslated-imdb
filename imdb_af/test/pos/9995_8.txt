As you know, the biggest game ever played is about golf. I got used to the over-dramatic title, but through a great visual display credited to director Bill Paxton (better known for his acting in Twister and hilarious supporting roles in Aliens and True Lies), we find that much more meaning as a game. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is about golf, it seems the sport is just the framework for what's really going on. What is really going on is a story of individuals who are told that they cannot fulfill their dreams, be it age or social status. A conflict between a boy's wishes and a father's demands. An English golf legend wishing to host the title with the country breathing its neck. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf (even Stevens) plays Francis Ouimet, a caddy with a God-given talent who was never allowed to play golf in the first place. Despite the cruelty of the upper class "gentlemen," it was unmistakable that Francis had a gift. What posed a greater threat was the discouragement of his father, played by Elias Koteas (Sugartime, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). They felt that playing a mere game would never improve their poor living conditions. With the continued support of his mother Francis finally comes face to face with his idol, golf legend Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane). <br /> <br /> More impressive than the game itself was the movie's movie performance. This has proven that storytelling has been successful through pure theater. The whole movie could be told without dialogue. There are scenes in the movie that build strong tension and powerful emotion with only photos. In one particular scene Francis Ouimet swings and the whole crowd turns their heads to see the ball flying in the distance, except the face of Harry Vardon, without a rush to Ouimet. The way the golfers visualize the course offers more aesthetic pleasure. <br /> <br /> A pleasant supporting role play completes the whole. Peyton List plays the love interest and looks worth playing, and Josh Flitter plays a lovely caddy who focuses Ouimet's focus if the pressure nut breaks down. Golf fan or not, you will appreciate the movie for its beauty and its reminder that the cinema can be a good medium to tell any story.
