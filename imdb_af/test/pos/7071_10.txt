Excuse me if I'm wrong, but "Cronica para un desayuno" can be one of the funniest movies in the Mexican film history for many reasons. We can get a lot of ingredients for a perfect Mexican middle-class breakfast: a cup of Buñuel's surreal motifs with a small drop of Ripstongian devastated scenarios; a pound of phallus symbols around the movie and a difficult psychological complexity, more than Todd Solondz's luck and the dogma motion movies. There is a lot of sordidness, black humor, oppressed dreams (Teodoro's dream of flying), turbulent lack of control (the relationship between Marcos and Luzma), no meaningful parallel stories, a discrete violence, anachronism and <br /> <br / > A little bit of hope (spotlight in Luzma, the man's home return and "Un poco Mas" used for search motive). Marcos (Bruno Bichir) is a beautiful character (I think in a Buchosian way), the king without crown who doesn't expect anything but broken noses. Luzma (Maria Rojo), the lovely woman, had many faces, but the only thing that worried her was that her sons had breakfast; She is in many ways and sensual in a few moments, but you will fall in love with her. The soundtrack's dress (too many bushes) delivers the lack of technical merit, deliberately, of course: out-of-focus shots, over-exposed close-ups (in introspective scenes), dizzying cues and sudden release cuts. "Crónica" is difficult to digest, it gets stuck in the throat and everything helps with it. It tastes bitter, like a rotten orange juice and acid like milk that has expired, but you want to enjoy it. So I recommend getting Melox before the show, because you won't get hungry.
