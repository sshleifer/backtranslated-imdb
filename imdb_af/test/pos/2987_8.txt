Most of these reviews have died, so I'll be chasing another and answering some questions I've seen here. <br /> <br /> While the characters look and look young (hence the controversy), the actor / actress himself was 17 and 18 at the time and so obvious about the 16 barrier. Here in the US it is still somewhat controversial, but the simplicity and innocence of the film make it very rewarding. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I didn't see Sean anymore; In this movie, his expressions are at least demonstrations and obvious; You know exactly how the character feels whether he is angry, scared or confused. Anicee had a healthy career, whose life was unfortunately cut short with cancer at the end of 2006. She was a beautiful and talented actress. <br /> <br /> VHS FRIENDS tapes can sometimes be found at Amazon.com, but usually for a significant price; I saw it as low as $ 60 or so and as high as $ 152 (of these, two were for that price). The follow-up video PAUL & MICHELLE isn't quite as expensive and can be obtained (if available) on Amazon for between $ 16 and $ 70.
