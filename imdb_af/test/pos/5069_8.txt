I'm Egyptian. I have a green card. I have been living in the USA since 1991. I have a very common Arabic name. I am married (non-American, but non-Egyptian, non-Arab woman). I have children born in the US. I have a PhD in Cell Biology from the USA and I travel for conferences. I make 6 digit income and I have a home in the Washington DC area. I pay my taxes and outside 1 or 2 parking tickets. I have no gap in my record since I came to this country in 1991. I look more Egyptian than the Ibrahimi character, but my spoken English is as good as she is. <br /> A few months ago I returned from a conference / company business in Spain through Munich Germany to Washington, DC (Home). I was picked up in Munich airport by a German official as soon as I left the Madrid plane. He waited for me. He was about to question me until I just told him: "I have no business in Germany, I'm just going through." He let me down with the greatest disappointment. It was nothing compared to what happened in Washington, Dulles airport. (What wasn't nearly as bad as Ibrahimi did in the movie). The customs officer asked me some questions about the length and purpose of my trip. He then wrote a letter C on my modified statement form and let me go. After picking up my marked bag, I stopped at the last point of departure. I sat there with many different people from different nationalities for 3 hours. I didn't tell the reason for my detention. I couldn't use my phone or any other phone. I was terrible to ask first to tell the reason or to let me go, but decided to suck it up and just wait and see. I asked if I could call my wife to tell her I would be late, but I said. When I tried to use my cellphone and as soon as my wife said "hello", an official dropped the phone and threatened to confiscate it. When I asked to go home because my family was waiting, they said: "Three hours is nothing, we will make contact after 5 hours." When I asked to use the bathroom, an official accompanied me there. This toilet was funny; I think it was a prison style toilet that is already metal without toilet seat. Eventually they called my name and gave me my passport / green card and said you could go. I asked what the problem was, they said "nothing"! I know it was only 3 hours, but I was tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and children. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie is concerned, it was very well made. Unlike most movies involving Arabic and non-Arab actors who only speak gibberish, this Arabic was 100% correct. I assume the country is Morocco (North Africa).
