Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle Rouge follows the lives of two criminals: Bird (Gian Maria Volontè), a killer who gives the police the slip while being transferred by train from one city to another; and Corey (Allain Delon), a thief who has just been released from prison. The lot decided to join these two men to pull off a spectacular hoist. In the background there is Matei (André Bourvil), the detective Vogel escapes, relentlessly in his pursuit and sometimes relentlessly in his methods. Alongside the movie, the viewer meets other small but fascinating characters, the best being Jansen (Yves Montand), a disgraceful ex-cop and an excellent marker. <br /> <br /> Melville has such a unique style, I don't have to see many of its movies to catch up with. Le Samourai, Un Flic and Le Cercle Rouge are made of the same fabric: the symmetrical corners; the long shots; the silence; the coats and hats and cigars; the quotes at the beginning; the wonderful heists, the fatalism; the ominous and sincere criminal life. Everything that is nice in Melville is here in the best shape. <br /> <br /> And its shortcomings didn't bother me so much: the illogical, confusing behavior of his characters and confusing storytelling that made me enjoy his other movies are almost invisible here. As Le Cercle Rouge Un Flic preceded it, it did not mean that it had improved in time; Perhaps I just got more touched and reached a mindset that didn't bother me anymore. <br /> <br /> Melville made unique crime movies. As old as they can, they show more ingenuity, realism and grace than the modern techno-thrillers in which cool thieves use computer systems and James Bond gadgets to pull out impossible crimes. Melville's criminals are not cool: they are lonely, socially uncomfortable and probably aware that they are not much more than planning. They are society's unwanted, at night, always one step ahead of the police in a game they know will eventually lose. There is nothing romantic about them. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, for a movie of this kind, the police are not idiots. Matei is smart, smart, patient and even compassionate. He's not an unlucky villain or a cliché, he's just an old man doing his job and doing it right. He knows when to use force and when to use brain. Many movies can learn from him. <br /> <br /> It is this earthly, non-romantic style that makes Melville's movies such a joy to watch and puts him on a special pedestal as one of the major role players of the movie.
