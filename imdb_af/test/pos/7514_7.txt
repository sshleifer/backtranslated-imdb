May I never go to this hospital [or hospice, if I want to be politically correct] [Which ass created this asinine phrase anyway?], Anything but directions on how to get out of town. George C. played a masterful work that played the burnt-out, working synergist who concluded that his life was a waste, but was helpless to change his environment or conditions, even when he was a golden opportunity given [probably not so golden anyway]. I had a few laughs from this brutally black comedy, but at the same time was sober and often chilled to the marrow because I was afraid of this atmosphere, penetrating most homes of healing, even as I write.
