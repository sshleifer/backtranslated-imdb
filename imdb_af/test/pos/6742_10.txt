This is without a doubt one of Neil Simon's best plays. It's full of great characters and a memorable dialogue. Johnathan Silverman makes a big screen version of young Eugene (he was played by Matthew Broderick on stage). This is the first of Simon's autobiographical trilogy, followed by the wonderful "Biloxi Blues" and closes with the TV movie "Broadway Bound". If I had to say the movie has any shortcomings, it may be that characters sometimes speak in clear dialogue, but it's good because it's a good dialogue. Rent this jewel, you won't be sorry!
