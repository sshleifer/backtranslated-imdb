This movie gives us a history of World War II along with some romance, some fantasy and sensible emotion - and beautiful scenery. We never fail Nicholas Cage, and here we do a good job again. And so do the other principles characters. One key charater, the doctor / father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I have ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to actually be, but I excused it because I know it's partly fairy tale and fantasy. My wife and I were really of the movie. And it's nice to see people taking the risk of loving the enemy. One man who left the theater near us said to his wife: "Now it's the way to war!" I think you will see what he means when you look at the Italian inhabitants of this beautiful Greek island.
