A few days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death when a middle-aged woman returned after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl who saw everything, reported what had happened. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it started with a debate on the over-intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, all indiscriminately. <Br /> <br /> I'm just 15, but I thought: what idea of ​​wealth does Italy give to these poor people? How do they view us as the land of plenty? Last night I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer. If you just have a donkey and a few goats, the propaganda postcards that the United States as a country with milky rivers and big vegetables are displaying are such an impression. <br /> <br /> NUOVOMONDO is really a must-see movie. It balances an ethereal symbolism (milk rivers, gaze, hard and rocky mountains, name and character Lucy / Luce) and a cruel realism (the mass of hopeful people on the ship, the procedures on Ellis Island). There is a mixed throw, from angelic Charlotte Gainsbourg to realistic Vincenzo Amato, to a bitter and crumbling Aurora Quattrocchi as the mother. But was it really that difficult to enter the New World?
