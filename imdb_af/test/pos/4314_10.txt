For me, this is a good series. I'm so disappointed that Ana Lucia and Libby are dead but more upset that Micheal lied to everyone about who they killed. And if anyone can answer it, it was the name of the guys who were supposedly "Henry Gale", like the leader of the other (or was it Clue ??) anyway if you know his name. Well, try to think of what might happen next, they eventually didn't push the button. Did it break the whole DARMA project thing and I personally thought it was cool how they had that important thing underground that Desmond closed the magnet thing, and what was the whole point? I'm just glad they didn't hit the button at last, but what happened to the people in the hatch? Like Mr. Echo, John, Charlie and Desmond probably died, but what about the others? I think they survived, I forgot? Well, it's just my little thing about what I thought of this season's final !!!
