It's really the only chance to see the magic of James Joyce's writing. His novels are all filmed (in any true sense) and that is the only long story he has written. It was John Huston's last movie and didn't reach the screen before he died, and it's easy to see his touch of greatness. The Dead are poetic in their on-screen approach, telling us more about Ireland than any modern movie on the IRA and "the problems" we can ever tell. Hopefully more people will see this movie and experience the best of both John Huston and James Joyce. Perhaps you visit this story in your local bookstore (and discover that it's probably the biggest short story ever on paper).
