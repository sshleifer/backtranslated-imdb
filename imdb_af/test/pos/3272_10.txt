I remember catching this movie on a C4 show a year ago and I was totally blown away. I thought the film had succeeded in representing such a variety of genres; the supernatural, a love story, the intrigues of crime, and so much more. <br /> <br /> After a minute or so, I was quite up to date and very concerned about the characters. That made me frightened Jimmy for a moment and then I laughed at the gangsters in the next ... and all the time I crossed my fingers that things would work for Jimbo! <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger and Rose Bryne are excellent, Bryan Brown is of absolute quality and roused me, along with David Field, who was funny and was an evil git. <br /> <br /> Since I watched this movie, I managed to order it on DVD. Every person I show it is hacked in the same way. <br /> <br /> Perfect for a Sunday afternoon or a lazy evening, this movie is one that you really appreciate with your friends.
