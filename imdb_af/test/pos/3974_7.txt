(Overview) Graduating high school senior Bartleby "B" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He is able to speak and go out of his way with every problem he meets, but he couldn't make his charm capable. His mother and father were very disappointed that Bartleby was not accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he has no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation that they are rejected by all the colleges they applied for. To satisfy their parents, Bartleby comes up with an idea to start his own college with a website. They transform an abandoned psychiatric facility into the South Harmon Institute of Technology. They will be the only students. However, the site states that we accept anyone. On the first day of school they unexpectedly received a large number of accepted students who were also rejected by all colleges. With a million dollars in tuition fees, Bartleby has to make his false college a functional one. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as the College Dean. The fun begins when they design their own curriculum, make their own rules and share the whole night. <br /> <br /> (My Comment) The starting point for starting a college without a teaching staff is a bit off the wall. Since it was a false college, Bartleby didn't really need a staff. The film reminded me of the classic movie "Animal House", the college institution, the fraternity, many gags and pretty young women. These new college batsmen had a different idea of ​​what the college experience was. The movie doesn't have much humor, it also has a good message for life. People need to reach for their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not settle for what other people want them to do. The end was a bit unrealistic, but it's just a movie. The film is made for the young crowd to have some fun. (Universal Pictures, Duration 1:32, Rated PG-13) (7/10)
