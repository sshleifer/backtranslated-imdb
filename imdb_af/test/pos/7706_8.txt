Tracy and Matt, Michelle and Sebastian: these are the two couples whose lives of addiction, crime and squalor are brilliantly captured in this raw and honest HBO documentary. They are in turn, charming, repulsive, surprisingly stupid and dedicated: to the drugs and to each other. They are also very different: Matt is a working class boy who is clearly in his sobriety, while the pre-school fallout Tracy supports the couple with Western Union money from her cashier dad, who makes a surprisingly sympathetic komo to the end of the movie. . Meanwhile, widow Michelle (whose hubby died from a government) earned her daily bread as a NYPD vice-spokesperson who was prepared to prevent Johns from agreeing to avoid the prison, and the sad fellowman Sebastian lives off the proceeds. You will be drawn in their stories and will have the movie twice as long. Unlike most documentaries of this type, there is no coda that we provide for an upgrade of their progress (can Matt and Tracy really keep the Brooklyn apartment? Will Michelle go back to Bellevue for more detox? And can Sebastian be more pathetic be?). As a result, the movie seems incomplete, but it may be the point. Necessary viewing, as long as you are not quite oblique to scenes of shooting people.
