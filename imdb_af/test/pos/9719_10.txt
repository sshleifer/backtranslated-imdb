I remember my dad hired these episodes on video. My whole family loved them and now I move away from home and have my own life, I try to share these fantastic Jim Henson creations with my husband and stepson, but as I begin to find out, not everyone is a Henson fan . This is a pity because it means they just have to look for this series. But even if they don't find it interesting, I strongly recommend that someone get the storyteller. You will be lost in a world of stories of a time when people can only talk about inexplicable stories and how people should care if they are ever faced with these situations.
