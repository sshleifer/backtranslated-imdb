Based on the real event, this epic, is in the year 221 B.C and tells the true story of the unification of China. Action packed and filled with intrigue, passion, betrayal and unforgettable battle order, it took my attention despite its 160 minute length. <br /> <br /> The king, Ying Zeng, played by Li Xuejian, is obsessed with the uniting of the seven kingdoms of China and becomes his first emperor. His lover, Lady Zhao, played by the beautiful actress Gong Li. He plans a plot through which she will travel to the neighboring kingdom of Yan to set up a false murder which will give the king an excuse to conquer Yan. However, she falls in love with the murderer, as the king is becoming increasingly relentless. <br /> <br /> There are subplots, and tragedy and constant high drama. There are scenes of great beauty and rude cruelty. There is great cinematography and brilliant use of physical space. <br /> <br /> The deep characterization reminded me of Shakespeare. And tragic events that keep Greek drama in mind. And yet it is quite Chinese, as it relates to older questions or the ends justify the means. And raise the questions of life and death, good and evil and all the vague edges in between. <br /> <br /> This is the story of individuals against the background of history, a history formed by China for the past. two thousand years. I was staged in the story, as well as the moral questions raised. There are no easy answers and it was one of the strengths of the movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended. But be prepared for the violence and gore. <br /> <br />
