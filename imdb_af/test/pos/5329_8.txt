Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) committed an unspeakable crime, the strike of the retarded younger brother of his ex-girlfriend, Becky (Jena Malone). No one, especially Leland himself, can explain why he did what he did or pretended or spontaneously act out of hatred or love. <br /> <br /> In the detention center, Leland meets Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle), a perpetual novelist who sees a second opportunity in Leland's case. But Pearl also wants to understand Leland's motivation and take him under his wing as a confidant in prison. <br /> <br /> The movie is jumping from the past to the present several times, often allowing the past to act as a context. to the present and vice versa. Author / Director Matthew Ryan Hodge shows how Leland's crime - and its events - affect people in his life, from Becky to her family to Leland's mother (Lena Olin) and alienated father (Kevin Spacey) to Allen (Chris Small), a young man who lives with Becky's family after the death of his own mother. <br /> <br /> The main asset in the movie is Gosling, which is perfectly thrown as the 15-year-old pseudopigopate. Like Bartleby the Scrivener, Gosling's Leland only exists; He shows little emotion during the film, but his expressions rather believe an ocean of guilt, sadness, love and anger. <br /> <br /> Each of the lead players may have presented their best work to date, saving Spacey (who's not exactly a beginner). Special praise is due to Malone and Klein, two young artists who are better known for the light comedy show than the heavy drama of this movie. <br /> <br /> Another big advantage in terms of the story is that none of the characters is flawless; Nobody is heroes to save the day. It's simply not a black and white movie.
