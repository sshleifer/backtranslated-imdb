Empire of Passion begins to mislead - that is, if you immediately expect it to be a horror movie. It's like a riff on James M. Cain's The Postman. Always Ring Twice. First: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a mother of two and a conscientious, hard-working wife to Rickshaw manager Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But if he is not around, and she is at the baby's home, the fit and aimless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) comes to bring some sweets to Seki ... and a little extra. They soon sleep together, but after doing something to her (let's just say a shave, he knows he'll find out, and immediately suggest they kill Gisaburo. They drink him, sniff him, and throw him of course it will come back to haunt them - but it is literally, at least to them (in the first super-terrible Seki and only later skeptical to Toyoji), changing gears in the "Kaidan", a Japanese ghost story. <br /> <br /> It's a movie where the horror doesn't just come out of "oh, ghost, ah", but from the total fear that builds on the characters. a movie noir at work altogether, if it is only loosely translated by a Japanese village from the 19th century, as opposed to a US city or small town (eg, the snooping policeman, the evidence possibly being others, word surrounded, suspicions, etc.) It is compelling because Seiko was actually against the plan, manipulated by the lusty but bad Toyoji prepared, and her reactions to Gisaburo's repetitions are offensive to her. Take the closest to poetry: Gisaburo's ghost, light blue face and mostly silent, cold staring, Seiko's movements to get on the rickshaw. She does, hesitantly, and he pushes her on a road she doesn't know, in the early hours before dawn, surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghost stories want heaven, they can get this sad atmosphere. <br /> <br /> As it begins until the end of hysteria, there is so much here that director Oshima gets right to make it a unique job. Having grown up in the world of the world with In the Realm of the Senses (ironically canceled in his own country), he made something that, in his opinion, was even more than the "Senses". Maybe he was right; Empire of Passion has less graphic sexual content by far its predecessor (also Tatsuya Fuji, a wonderful physical actor with a great variety of teams), but she bravely lies in creating a world of fear. You can believe in the story in this story, but you also have to believe how far to their own personal heroes these two love birds will go. The snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries: the fate of their many souls is at stake. <br /> <br /> Taking Oshima that can only be juicy pulp in other hands. Unfortunately, it won't "surprise me if an American remake was already in the works" and shot crafts at a beautiful shot. With repetition she works his way to the miss-and-scene (ie the shots of Seiko and Toyoji walking on the road, the camera at a Dutch corner, tilting the world and surrounding them in a dark blue color), as well as some that affects movements that stay with me long after I finish it (ie Toyoji slowly throws the leaves with one hand in the well or how Seiko's naked body is revealed after she gets blind). It is bold lies to commit to a level of the spirit - not to confuse with the spiritual, although there may be something about it - about the lives and death of each other, inseparable. It is a classic wait to be discovered.
