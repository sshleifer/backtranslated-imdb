Choose your destiny: The terrific tikes of the fourth form, play practical jokes involving axes, or the ... ummm ... well-developed sixth-form girls who have time ago cigarettes, gin, sex and how easy they can discover men be deceived. The problem is that one set comes to the other. They are all there at St. Trinian's, the remarkable, easy-going English school for girls led by chief miller Millicent Fritton (Alastair Sim). Like me. Fritton would like to point out: "In other schools, girls are sent unprepared to a ruthless world, but if our girls are away, it's the ruthless world to be prepared." Miss. Fritton sounds like a story by Julia Child and Eleanor Roosevelt, and definitely has Sim's turd and deadpan comic genes. <br /> <br /> In The Belles of St. Trinian's, a clever, chaotic comedy by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat's team, is St. Trinian's as usual on the verge of a financial disaster. However, salvation may be on hand when a rich Sheikh sends his daughter to join the fourth form and receive proper English education. The Sheikh is also a horse owner and one of his prize-runners, Arab Boy, is trained near the school for a race. It is just a matter of time before the fourth-form girls form a race-coil and sit heavily on the Arab boy, with me. Fritton added to the pool, which funds the school has. (Many of the fourth-form girl's money comes from the gin they make in chemistry, then bottle and rope to Flash Harry (George Cole), a Cockney fixer, for distribution. "It has something ... I have do not know exactly that, "says Miss Fritton to stick the stuff, but send a few bottles to my room.) <br /> <br /> Miss. Fritton, however, has a brother, Clarence Fritton (who by chance happens to decide, also Alastair Sim), a bookmaker who has not only placed a bundle on another horse but also has a daughter. And he placed the former Arabella in the sixth form to keep him informed. Soon the sixth form kidnapped the Arab Son, the fourth form took the horse back. Flash Harry went with me. Fritton joined. The sixth-form girls are determined that Arab Boy is not the second floor of St. Trinian's, Clarence and his Homburg-bearing gang arrived, parents were riding for Parents' Day and the Ministry of Education arrived in the person of a very proper inspector. Total war breaks out at St. Trinian's. It's hard to say what is more dangerous, the African spears or the flour bombs. <br /> <br /> Alastair Sim as Millicent Fritton turns into a powerhouse tour. Miss. Fritton is a tall woman with a stately bosom, fond of long gowns with embroidered lace and Edwardian hats with many feathers. She's up for grabs, even a fourth former clash with something in the chemistry class, and after a few minutes later getting an explosion is the result. "Oh, dear. I told Bessie to be careful about that nitroglycerine!" She is strong to believe that St. Trinian's is a gay arcadia of happy girls. "Sim was one of Britain's great eccentric actors. Unlike the sheer chaos of all the little (and not so few) girls doing terrible things, he delivers much of the movie's pleasure.
