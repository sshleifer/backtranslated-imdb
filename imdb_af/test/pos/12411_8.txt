This "TFTD" episode of season one named ironically "Answer Me" is a pretty good done and memorable episode, and it takes a shocking turn at the end. You have Jean Marsh as a hillside and actress from L.A. thrown away after an audition to New York City and she lives in an apartment provided by an old friend. Strangely every night she was kept awake by a phone from the next apartment, but strangely enough, the house where the lazy phone is still restrained is unoccupied as the guests have been dead for years. Eventually she just has to give. She had to follow and not answer the phone with anyone's home, as it is bad to be wrapped up in a cell phone with her own life! Overall good episode a weird one, but about a supernatural phone, it's still exciting and it turns out well at the end.
