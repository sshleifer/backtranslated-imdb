My young lady is unique in many ways. First, it is Hui Ya-Hung's (Kara Hui) first action film. Second She actually did the fighting scenes after she did an operation for her a few days before filming. Third, this movie is off the chain. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Wang Lung Wei to take his brother's inheritance. His brother has Kara to marry him so Wang can't take the treasure. The story is pretty good and leads everything to its rightful place. <br /> <br /> Coming in action, what can I say, it's not yet said for movies like this, or Disciples of the 36th Chamber, the Victim, or even the Magnificent Butcher. The battle scenes are selling movie, and this one will have no problem doing it. Liu Chia Liang and Wang Lung Wei got involved in a fight you should see. Why didn't these two men fight each other, is more than me. <br /> <br /> I don't really want to spoil anything, but you need to see My Young Aunt to get the full thrill. My only gripe is that Yuen Tak was not as widely used as he was in 3 Angry Masters, or even Invincible Pole Fighter (8 Diagram Pole Fighter) to be great at watching movies. 9.2 / 10
