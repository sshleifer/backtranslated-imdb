All I can say after watching the DVDs of the first season is that I can't believe the NBC, with "It's so different from what is currently in vogue, except for Lost. Those who miss the X-Files may have a worthy successor. Not so mysterious or intense as Lost, I generally find it more entertaining. <br /> <br /> This kind of extended story is hard to make. I mean it can degenerate into childlike dribbling if most elements don't coincide. But they do it and I think the cast is excellent, writing sharp, the location and props first rate, and the special effects are very good for a television budget. Certainly, that pushes what is likely, but as it does, it never gets so stupid to insult your intelligence. <br /> <br /> Bottomline is that it's a great Sci-Fi drama for the whole family. I doubt it will be a classic with a long term like X-Files, but I recommend getting the DVD if you missed it as I did the first time. This fall, I have to see shows has just increased with another series! <br /> <br /> PS: I just heard it drove off NBC ... Here's the hope that Sci-Fi picks it up.
