It's not far from the dirt that Bollywood normally makes, but there's just something really good about it. <br /> <br /> The title song is one of Bollywood's best and haunted throughout. This is one of the films (with Baazigar - a must see Hollywood movie) that Shah Rukh Khan made and that's what you have to look at. <br /> <br /> Other reviews give away the story - it's a pretty basic idea - ShaRukh definitely stands out and one of his final expressions really made me end up making this movie an extra star give. <br /> <br /> It's pretty cheesy but definitely worth checking out if you're new to Bollywood or not! 8/10
