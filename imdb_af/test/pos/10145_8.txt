It's another fun and entertaining Hitchcock movie. James Stewart and Doris Day are incredible in this movie. Bernard Herrmann appears as himself near the climax. <br /> <br /> The scenery and places are excellent, except the one scene early where the backdrop was obviously fake, which didn't make sense to me, as scenes were before and after the same area and they were real location shots. I heard that Hitchcock did it in a certain way. <br /> <br /> The reviews for this movie seem mixed. I think it's a better than average Hitchcock movie. Very entertaining and it has a very light comic scene at the end. <br /> <br /> I evaluated this movie 8 out of 10. <br /> <br />
