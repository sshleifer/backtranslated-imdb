I have reasons to love the big users of a camera; liquid direction of action lends itself to quick adventure and comedy story; But such a skill, in the hands of a King Vidor or an Anthony Mann, can also be applied to idea-level work. This is the masterpiece of Paul Wendkos. The storyline can be sold in a few sentences. General Hector Cordoba is near-emperor in northern Mexico and steals a huge cannon from General Blackjack Pershing. He sends his crack mission unit, split, worried but determined, led by George Peppard, to get the cannon back and bring Cordoba back alive to put an end to the uprising. Charismatic Raf Vallone plays Cordoba; The ladies in the play are Giovanna Ralli and Francine York; with the group further consisting of Nico Minardos, Peter Deuel, and Don Gordon. Other stalwarts in the class include John Larch and John Russell. Also on an already dangerous operation is me. Ralli, and a stubborn Mexican Teniente (Gabriela Tinti) whose regiment was betrayed when Cordoba founded on its own. The danger is multiplied when Gordon's brother, as a forerunner, is captured and tortured while he is watching ... and he decides to kill Peppard. The attack that captures the cannon, when Peppard's orders are not obeyed by a regular lower-level, is one of the most electrifying visual and spectacular achievements in film history; The penetration of Cordoba's fortress, the revelations uncovered there, and the actions the mission team wins, are a chance of victory - or almost victory - presented flawlessly. This is a beautiful color adventure movie, featuring unusual strong costumes, acting, lighting, art styles and music by Elmer Bernstein. Stephen Kandel's script is probably his best ever for a feature film. It is probably the most underrated major at the moment, but I have always appreciated its heroes because of hard workers. But as Peppard reminds his group on the way home, "The trouble of being a" hero "is the next morning. To find out why he says so, you'll need to see "Cannon For Cordoba".
