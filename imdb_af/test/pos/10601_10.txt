I loved this movie and I watch it every day. I think that although the acting is not so good, it's really just a bunch of guys having fun with a script. I have been watching this movie for almost a year, and when I found it for thirty dollars, I just had to get it. It is by far my favorite movie of all time. It's about relationship failure, and at the same time joking. I loved all the parts with Don Vito, especially the one where Valo asked for a grape when they were sitting on the stoep, and he told him to eat the one rolling down the stoep. It really portrays him as he really is. The part of the "Making Of" really touched me when they addressed Brandon Novak's addiction to heroin and how much his friends and family tried to help him. A new film in the making, called "Dreamseller," is in production, breaking the story of Novak's dreams, breaking through his addiction.
