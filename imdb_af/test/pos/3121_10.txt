These little John Ford Westerns with no 'stars', but a movie character is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary feel as it follows the journey West of a Mormone party and it can be the most authentic view of all Ford's films (which is similar to "The Sun Shines Bright" which he made a few years later) . <br /> <br /> There's a plot of sorts (a group of bank robbers blocking the wagon train at one point), but the dramatic highlights of the movie are almost coincidental. The brilliant performances of Ford's stock company (Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr., Ward Bond, Jane Darwell, etc.) add significantly to the film's authenticity, while the closest to the movie comes to a full-fledged star performance, Joanne Dru's Denver . Dru was a much finer actress than she had ever been credited with, such as Bond and Johnson, who at least were awarded with the recognition of an Oscar for his work in "The Last Picture Show". As he said himself, "It couldn't have happened with a nicer fella." Add Bert Glennon's excellent location photography and you have a real piece of Americana that couldn't have been to anyone other than Ford. It's a movie that made America's pioneers honest and full of feeling and feeling.
