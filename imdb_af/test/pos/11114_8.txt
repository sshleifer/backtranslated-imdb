Although this movie at first glance looks like the story of your parent's high school life (and many people will try to tell you that this movie is out of date) ... and I admit it was my first impression .... but frankly, the 'lessons' taught by heroes / heroines are final. NOT obsolete. Who doesn't want to be known? And who doesn't want me to accept their peers? And the gay guy, isn't there a whole controversy about gay marriage today, blah blah? This movie, although released in the 80s, still speaks of the biggest problems in today's world. This movie does have a bit too much curse and nudity for my taste. (so the 8/10 rating)
