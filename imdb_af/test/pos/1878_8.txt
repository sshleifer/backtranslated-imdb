made a wonderful addition to the sci-fi channel film that far exceeded many poor previous efforts. Bruce Campbell is excellent as a potential investor caught in a bizarre experiment, led by a delirious professor, Stacey Keach, and his half-white help, Ted Raimi. The movie is pure b movie gold and it is great to see Keach and ram on the screen with Bruce. The fact that much of the movie just works on Bruce's comic slapstick scene is what makes it hilarious and asks me the question, why doesn't this man get his scripts? It is indeed a sick world. Worth a watch.
