where do we go from here? this is the dominant question of this film. And don't make a mistake, especially ETC. The 2003 effort of director John Jansen asks much more questions than it answers, but not as sharp or as powerful as this one. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking friends, and I'm probably many of the questions that the main characters you recognize on your own stock of drunk debauchery will recognize. But one of the many beauty of this movie is that we are rarely given an answer. Questions raised ?? everything from everyday to deepest? but chants force his audience to examine and answer these questions themselves, with little or no help from the characters. <br /> <br /> Side 1 opens with an increasingly complex and beautifully orchestrated array of non-linear segments to introduce us to the main characters. We meet them on the morning of April 8, 1994 ?? The day Kurt Cobain committed suicide. And this is the death of cobain, and the journey to his wake two days later in Seattle, which serves as the backdrop for the film. In exploring cobain's life, music and death, the characters - with varying degrees of success - try to understand and determine their own lives. <br /> <br /> There are a few aspects of the movie you can expect from a low-budget movie: the performances range from mediocre to outstanding, with the strongest performances of Jessica Scott (Holly) and noelwood (daniel); Some of the dialogue is a bit stiff, but never quite unreal; And there are a few minor audio problems, especially when we are on the move, which sometimes makes it difficult to follow the action on the screen. <br /> <br /> But despite its shortcomings, mainly ETC. is a solid, deeply influential piece of cinema. In the midst of moments of haunting comfort, laughing humor and intimate turmoil, all of them weave together and illuminate their own struggles while at the same time making them accessible and relative to us. and because we can reflect on one or more of these characters, we can identify with the questions and problems they are struggling with, and we can look back and remember where we were on that day in 1994 when many people changed the world. <br /> <br /> While jansen gets credit for writing, editing and directing the movie, kudos should also be given to his photography. With an incredible eye and great ability to catch and draw us in each of the characters' worlds, Jansen managed to produce a shot after shot after a shot that long after the credits were thrown. <br /> <br /> And no review of this movie will be complete without a nod to the incredible soundtrack. the music in this movie is used for great effect; Sometimes the action is subtly underlined, at other times in the middle stage, but never in the way of weakening in kitschy music video. the soundtrack plays like the ultimate biggest hits, although I suspect the label will probably not go well with the director. <br /> <br /> The new double-DVD archive edition offers some removed scenes, trailers, music videos and a cobain documentary. The scanned scenes offer insight into making the movie through alternative opening and closing sequences, and it's definitely a surprise to have the rare and beautiful Raining Child video. The cobain documentary is good, if it is a bit worse for wear, and certainly more extensive documentaries are available for the hardcore fans. Noticeably absent is a director's comment, and I can't help but wonder if chance plans to resolve it at some time with that nice treat. <br /> <br /> enough to say next time you're "Looking for a strong piece of work from a talented movie maker, I recommend you come on board.
