Right there Good, entertaining and accurate era feeling for most scenes. Enough personality variations to cover the real people around those days without story distractions from the exceptions. The credits show Peralta from Mar Vista, California. On the hill of Venice and south of Malibu. I stayed there in the Heartbreak Hotel days, before-Beachboys, next to surfer-child Bob Cooper on Wasatch Avenue, where the alley was used to burn fire boards that didn't work. Old skatekey skatewheels are used on plywood blends to roll its pavement waves. Things were different in subsequent decades, as the cool innocence of the fifties in the Sun's Heat broke out the whitewater freedom and excitement of the sixties, and then in the assertively innovative playtime and inventive evolutionary frenzy of the strange seventies. The movie gives you a piece of that kind of magical moment in time; in a place where the imaginary wave really was .. the source of culturally significant influences. And BTW, there's another movie that has a similar American street edginess to it, and has the same truly unique goodness with a lazy back reality that helps to refine that elusive eternal feeling of coolness. "Two Lane Blacktop" (with one of the best examples of the free attitude in West Coast California history .. Dennis Wilson). As Monte Hellman did with that one, thank you SP, because you really were with this one. GWR
