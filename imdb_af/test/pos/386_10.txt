"Aliens on a train" was one of those movie classics I've always heard of, but somehow I never died to really see it. I only watched it a few weeks ago and, as always with a Hitchcock movie, it has not only put it to the test, it has overtaken most thrillers today. You can see the inspiration for future action movies - the climate that ends with the out-of-control merry round and the two villains fighting each other reminds me of the big action series at the end of Jan de Bont's Speed. "Of course," strangers "are over forty years older than" speed "and contain no modern special effects, but the visceral excitement is there - Hitchcock was a real genius. <br /> <br /> The non-so - Subtitled gay side of Bruno (Robert Walker in an incredible performance) formed into several other psycho-stalker figures in future movies, considering him a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Single White Female." before he met him on the train, we almost felt that their contact was not coincidental - and was soon completely obsessed with him. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock loved the Oedipial elements in his movies. "Psycho" for more blatant undertones) and there are many of them. Bruno hates his father and wants him to die so that he can be with his mother. His eternal ways and obvious homosexuality should have slipped by the censors in 1951 However, when gays could not be placed on the screen, Hitchcock effectively got the message out When we see Bruno in the lounge on the phone wear non-male cloak, flirt with Guy and respond to his mother. <br /> <br /> The deep layers of this movie make it a quick thrill than you can return to. Unfortunately, it is again a big-budget Hollywood production, but after seeing the original, I can honestly suggest anything that surpasses the white white-knuckle excitement of this movie.
