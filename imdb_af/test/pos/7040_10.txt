Meatballs are a classic comedy with so much laughter that it is impossible to count. <br /> <br /> In what was just a forerunner of what would come, Murray governed the screen that could only be described as comic mastery. Tripper Harrison has been one of the greatest comedy characters in the past 50 years. Sarcastic, smart when he needs to be, strict when he needs to be, and cares when it suits him, Murray mixes Tripper with that SNL glint. <br /> <br /> The CITs are only in awe as they groan under the comic genius of Mr. Murray is. <br /> <br /> Summer is not summer without a viewing of meatballs. One of the best comedies to ever spoil the screen.
