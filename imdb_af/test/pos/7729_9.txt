Excellent movie in many aspects. Vicente Aranda succeeded in portraying the time (1830) with careful care. The light, the places, the feeling are perfectly observed from the beginning of the movie. And on the other hand - unlike what happened with "Mad Love" (Juana la Loca), a fairly episodic historical film - all this beautiful photography / music / clothing is a very fluid script that makes its climax possible in the only possible way. <br /> <br /> As far as the actors are concerned, Paz Vega is outstanding as Carmen: liar, seductive, aggressive, totally sexual, so beautiful Carmen. Sbaraglia is a little less convincing about hearing his foolish love for Carmen, but he manages to convey the right tragic mood to the whole movie. I recommend it to everyone: the best Spanish movie of the year.
