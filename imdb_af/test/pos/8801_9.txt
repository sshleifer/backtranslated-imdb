Big movie in a Trainspotting style ... It is billed as the Welsh Trainspotting, but then it was also Twin Town, although it is a street. <br /> <br /> Take a weekend in the life of Cardiff Clubbers, good debut movie of Kerrigan and some good performances in the cast. <br /> <br /> Look! then go clubbing
