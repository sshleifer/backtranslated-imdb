It worked! Director Christian Duguay has created a very clever action / spy thriller. Actors Donald Sutherland and especially Aidan Quinn achieved a top performance. What a pity we can't see Aidan Quinn in others like this so far. He was simply the best in the role of Ramirez / Carlos for what he had to earn the Oscar. The picture was very nice. The screens are fast from start to finish and the story doesn't let you get bored. The movie is underestimated and I recommend it to anyone else or you'll miss something good. Believe me, you won't be disappointed. That's why I give it 9/10.
