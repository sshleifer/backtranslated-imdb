I have so much fun reading the user's comments as I watched the movie! It seems that this is the classic or 'Love it' or 'Hate it' movie. And I have to say that I'm not just on the "Love it" side, I'm going on a limb to call it this FAVORITE movie, EVER! Thank you, I found it in the first place. Almost impossible to find, I was fortunate to record it on a late night UHF channel ten years ago. Of course, my salespeople can make me a little biased, but I can't see how anyone with a wheat ball, dry sense of humor (like me) doesn't fall in love with this movie. The plot is wonderful (but perhaps like a previous poster said, maybe the reason it's not a well-known movie ... upset the medical field?) The play is great (I can see why some might say that the play was horrible .. But that is what made this movie so good ... it's totally sticky and the humor is exhausted. I'm proud to say I haven't watched this movie 20 times and have memorized pretty much every line. This movie is genius !!
