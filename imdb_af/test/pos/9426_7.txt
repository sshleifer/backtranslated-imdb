As others complained about placing Sherlock Holmes in a contemporary environment, I wouldn't. Basil Rathbone could fit that voice in any era, preserving the fair. This is a nice compound puzzle based on 'The Dancing Men', one of the best of Conan-Doyle's stories. Instead of the original plot, it makes the men part of a Nazi plot. Holmes becomes a spokesman for the British war effort. His opponent is Moriarity, who regularly dies to conquer the central figure in the 13th film. He is definitely creative, but the Rathbone Holmes is inevitable. Watson is just for the ride in this one. He is not given much stupidity to spray into this film and it is a real plus. The plot is complex enough to keep interested. There is a closing speech that is almost a parody of himself. But then I cannot be critical of a time and nation that was under great urgency. If they had to call Holmes, it must be so.
