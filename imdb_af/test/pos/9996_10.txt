This movie gives golf a high point, it was well behaved and well directed. Give you an overview of the history that some non-sports fans will enjoy. The historical factor alone gives it a high rating, the Brookline golf course is really well done. I am in the northeast and have seen Brookline as a fan, and as someone who loves the game. The movie was good at all levels. A MUST see 5 stars. The acting was great, Disney still has a winner in his big movie bag. If for no other reason does the film give the hope and encouragement to young people who cannot see hope in their lives. I will tell you that the environment, while in the late 1800s and early 1900s, is very realistic. The costumes and dialect were also right. Over and above the calling for a gulf film. A must see for fans and non-supporters.
