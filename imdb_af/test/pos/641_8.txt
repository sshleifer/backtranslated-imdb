A few years before SCREAM played the slasher / horror genre with skilled, self-confident young things that tell every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a difficult situation, a small movie produced in Russia , the theaters have no grandiose pretensions. <br /> <br /> This movie was MUTE WITNESS. With the exception of a film of unknowns (except for an extremely short comedy by Sir Alec Guiness whose scenes are allegedly filmed eight years before the actual filming of this movie), it has the story of a mute makeup artist, Billie, said. a film on the spot in Russia, produced and directed by her sister's boyfriend Andy. She is unaware that the set is closed when she goes to regain her possessions and stumbles on a porn shooting that becomes extremely bloody. Overcoming horror, she warned the killers of her presence, a pursuit, and eventually she was rescued by Andy, who took her home while waking the police. The problem is ... there is no body, no evidence that anything of that kind has occurred. Yet it seems that a mysterious inspector on Billie's side of the story is. <br /> <br /> And to say more, will be criminal. MUTE WITNESS is the kind of movie that requires an investigation to look similar to the most complicated, smart thriller, because as much as it is a complicated thriller, it is one that pays its fees to movies like WAIT TO DARK and the best of Hitchcock in his choice of camera cuts, deadpan humor, Americans responding overseas where they are powerless, and nail-biting tension until something seems to be catching up. Even if the story becomes a little too unreliable due to the fact that the story suddenly becomes the focus of even greater conspiracy, the movie fails to try to deceive the public with cheap shots (for example, the sudden appearance of a person on camera accompanied by a clash of violets), but with the fear of the unknown and death is just a shadow away. Very smart.
