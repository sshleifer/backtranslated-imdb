In the late 1940s, there was a short film entitled "Flicker Flashbacks" in which silent drama plays with the likes of Mary Pickford and Blanche Sweet. Scratchy clips of outdated old movies were rearranged, projected too quickly, and provided an overhang of jangly music and lamb quips. The attitude expressed by this brutal treatment summed up the early days of mid-century Hollywood in the early days: a silent cinema was considered hokey, florid, a little embarrassing and just good for a crook. During the 1950s, this attitude gradually changed for various reasons. James Agee's famous 1949 silent clowns for Life Magazine was a factor, but television has played an important role in recognizing viewers with silent movies. While the TV networks sometimes handled the material as crudely as the "Flicker Flashbacks", the high-featured series such as "Silents, Please" treated the movies with respect. Another milestone was Robert Youngson's Composition Feature THE GOLDEN AGE OF KOMEDY, which was apparently something of a surprise report when it was released into theaters in 1957. <br /> <br /> I don't know if Charles Chaplin was aware. from Youngson's movie or his success at the cash register, but it was at this time that he decided to release a theatrical release of three of his best short comedies, A HOND'S LIFE, SHOUL ARMS (both in 1918), and The PILGRIM (made in 1922 and released the following year). These three movies have happened as a trio, as they contrast well in plot, theme and setting. In addition, all three have the well-known faces of Chaplin's stock company, some of which play various roles in each card. At the time of reissue, the films were not publicly viewed more than thirty years. Perhaps Chaplin was concerned about maintaining his reputation with a new generation of filmmakers, especially because his best work was seldom shown on television. the early days of the new medium. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Chaplin came to the conclusion that the movies were moving too fast at the old silent projection rate, and so it was decided to "stretch" them, which means every other frame was printed twice. . Maybe he wanted to avoid the 'Flicker Flashbacks' look, but that wasn't the best way to go about it. Aesthetically speaking, the results were terrible and destroyed the movie's action in practice. This is how the CHAPLIN REVUE was released to the theaters in 1959. This is the version commercially made available by Playhouse Video in the 1980s. . At the time I bought a VHS copy of the movie and was very disappointed with the jerk, stop-and-start rhythm of the movies. <br /> <br /> It's a great pleasure to find that David Shepard's recovery from Chaplin's compilation (originally made for the laser disk format) is a major improvement over the Playhouse Video version. For the most part, the projection speed has been corrected. The "ironing pressure" is gone anyway, although sometimes the action seems. For example, in a DOG's life during Edna & Charlie's awkward dance at the Green Lantern Cafe, Edna's bare arms appear visibly blurred; At another point, during the trench scene in SHOULDER ARMS, when Charlie is released from the military service, it seems that action is strangely delayed for a few moments, but this may be the result of a maneuver by the film repairers. to cover a little decomposition. All in all, the image quality is fantastic compared to the age of the movies themselves. <br /> <br /> Other bonuses: The REVUE starts with rare background footage taken at the Chaplin studio. It includes shots of an obvious jokey rehearsal session where Chaplin puts on small film Loyal Underwood, as well as Charlie's scenes at his dressing table, on his makeup and pruning the famous mustache. These scenes are accompanied by Chaplin's narrative delivered to a quick clip. Chaplin also compiled a new music score for the composition, and in his opinion his themes for the REVUE were rated with his best compositions, especially the pieces used in the A HOND'S LIFE cafe series. The only exception is the song written for THE PILGRIM, a Pseudo-Singin Cowboy number called "Bound for Texas" sung "Fifties style by Matt Monro (which sounds more like Gene Autry), which is distractingly anachronistic and out of place. Otherwise, in the rest of the REVUE, the music is perfectly suited to the action and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The CHAPLIN REVUE's image release feels like its long delayed debut, Presenting these classic comedies as they were meant to be seen long ago, in this form are the REVUE ranks with Chaplin's durable and pleasurable works.
