This movie is about a very delicate argument and if you are looking for something that reminds you here, you're right. Tim Robbins has done a wonderful job and the result is a kind of documentary drama that has to be shown in schools (for the strong themes being discussed). What about the actors? Well, they are simply big; Susan Sarandon is truly "the face of love" and Sean Penn is incredible like almost always. An absolutely must-see!
