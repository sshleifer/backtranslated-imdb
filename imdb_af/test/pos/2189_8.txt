Well, I'm not the world's biggest Sondheim fan, so although I have the album and I've listened to it a few times, I've never seen this show and I haven't seen the Tim Burton movie version either. . I felt I wanted to see something more faithful before I see the Burton one and just give it a movie. This version is not a movie at all, it's a filmed play with some of the original cast members, with Angela Lansbury's main performance as Nellie Lovett. It is one of those performances that is just like a canal at the heart of Broadway and the theater itself. She had so much fun with this role. Sweeney Todd himself is not played by Len Cariou, who originally did, but by George Hearn. Hearn does a fantastic job; his voice is not quite as good as Cariou, but it looks a bit wider. <br /> <br /> The only problem I really had with the Johanna character, as played by Betsy Joslyn, and to some extent her lover Anthony as played by Cris Groenendaal. Joslyn's voice cannot sustain high notes, but I wasn't quite sure it might be the point, because I'm not very familiar with this play. More importantly, I don't know if Sweeney Todd's story really contains enough weight to keep the music, but unfortunately the whole thing doesn't seem to have been taken seriously by its creators. As a lion, and a little comedy in the year of "Grand Guignol", it's pretty nice. I don't feel it's so important to be a piece of work as "Company" and "Into the Woods" or any of his other performances. Some of the music is pretty spectacular, but elsewhere it appears in a world outside the show. <br /> <br /> I won't say much about this because it's a movie site and it's not really a movie, but a movie shot. There were 3 or 4 scenes where they moved the camera, but it was. People will want to see it, because it retains Lansbury's legendary performance that deserves its legendary status, as it is a hilarious and informative show. George Hearn can also be proud of his version of Sweeney. It would be a good movie to show children over 5 or more so that they are interested in musical because the blood and cannibalism will really surprise them. To see a show that is so professionally and faithfully filmed, I wish that more efforts were made in this regard with musical theater, as I prefer the 20s to the 50s for these later era issues. However, Sweeney Todd is an exceptional show from his era, miles and miles above the AL Webber madness.
