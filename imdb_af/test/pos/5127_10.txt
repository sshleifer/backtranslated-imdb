I saw the movie "Hoot" and then I decided to comment immediately. The truth is, NATURE needs our protection because we are the dominant species of this planet. Some people think that if they have money, they can do what they want, which is likely, but if they think about the future, they think they would do something useful! This movie is not just about kids, this movie shows us that children are usually the ones who care more about them, then the adults do. When I was twelve, I saw some water lilies and I knew they were protected by law and didn't even dare to touch them, but not afraid of the law, but to fear that I can actually harm. (I'm currently 15) What ever was, the acting was good, the 3 main characters were well interpreted and we all have to learn from them. I hope you all think about what you saw in that movie !!! and enjoy!
