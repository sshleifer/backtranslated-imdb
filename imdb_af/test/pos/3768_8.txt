Better than it was right, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric, with others, biting satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde are mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, fraught with drugs and sexual humor, and reminiscent of some of everything from Woody Allen to "Everything You Always want to know about sex "at Mel Brooks from" The Producers ", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin Cheech and Chong. Watch it, listen carefully because some of the jokes are really fast, and remember a time when the comedy is allowed to be offensive hilarious.
