Next is a small well-known 1998 British film, made with a budget of Â£ 8,000 and has a running time of 70 minutes. If you see it, you will never expect his director to do it in Hollywood and become one of the most famous and celebrated directors of the 21st century? Well, everyone has to start somewhere. <br /> <br /> As you probably already know, the director of Following is Englishman Christopher Nolan, who will direct the next critically-acclaimed independent film Memento; A few years later he will be hired by Warner Bros to direct the new Batman series, which has further cheered him, and so on. My point is, everyone should start somewhere? even if it's not in the most amazing debut? and Christopher Nolan introduced himself in 1998 to the following. <br /> <br /> If I see that, I can't help making agreements with another director's debut, the adventurer David Lynch's Eraserhead. The following is not a surrealistic psychological horror movie in that sense, but the agreements are noticeable; most striking, it is shot in black and white and has an atmosphere that makes it unique. It is difficult to describe in words, but it looks like the smoky atmosphere you will find in the film's old age. It can therefore be said that the following is a contemporary film noir, or a neo-noir. Overall it is a fusion and psychological tension, and the story is best suited to these two genres. <br /> <br /> The main character is nameless, and the movie's title extends from an early obsessive-compulsive feature it owns ?? randomly watching people on the street and following them, sometimes even for hours at the end. During one of these stalking expeditions, the main character is noticed by one of the people he follows and is confronted. It seems that the 'confront' is a man who is willing to befriend our narrator, and he introduces himself; his name is Cobb, and he is a small burglar who invites the narrator to follow his burglaries. <br /> <br /> From there, the main character in Cobb's world is thrown up and becoming crime, passion and violence as he becomes more and more intimate with Cobb. The following is not so much a character study, but rather a film that follows the turbulent relationship between these two main characters and the devastating effects it has on us. Nolan manages to make the film look like a film noir, and emulsifies the respective atmosphere well. <br /> <br /> As a thriller, the next is stiff and atmospheric; However, as a movie in general, it's a bit of a disappointment. If not, you can definitely call it. The entire film is written in a non-chronological and non-linear fashion, making the story and film experience unique, to some extent? This style has been done so many times, now is it almost general technique? and the story itself is to some extent unique. <br /> <br /> However, the following is ultimately overwhelming for the whole movie, and is disappointingly unpredictable. The story asks for more ?? more action, more tension and more excitement? but it is also stimulated in its own storyline, rather focusing on creating a complicated story. Next, it succeeds in doing so, but without any other elements it is a film noir that doesn't really work out; It has a feeling of emptiness that is not big, but still noticeable. Furthermore, the film's shocking revelation at the end ?? almost a mandatory convention in film noirs ?? is one that makes us feel deceived; it is unpredictable and comes out of nowhere, but in relation to the story it is disappointing, as it makes the foregoing scenes and the whole movie looks like a big waste of time. <br /> <br /> But the positives far outweigh the negative, and ultimately it seems to be a flawed but satisfying movie. Yes, everyone has to start somewhere. Christopher Nolan does this with the following, and he does it well. A quiet, gentle but fine way. It's not the most amazing movie, and it's not quite worthy of the awards the director will receive in the next decade, but it's still a good movie. When you choose, you'll find a well-made, stiff and atmospheric thriller, one that lacks nude nuances or innovative style, yet still manages audiences.
