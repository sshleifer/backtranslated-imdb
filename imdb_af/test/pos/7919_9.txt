I believe anyone who enjoys Eisentein's Ivan the Terrible movies will enjoy this well-crafted movie. This film played like "Lord of the Ring: Return of the King", but without the special effect, but as a good and better drama. <br /> <br /> We have the German, who dressed like KKK, Novgorod of Russia. The Russian called Nevsky to lead them to fight the Germans to save Russia. Nikolai Cherkasov, who played Ivan in the Ivan the Terrible movies, was charismatic like Nevsky. The first 10 minutes of handling the transition from Mongol were fascinating. <br /> <br /> Many of the screens were beautiful, even in black and white. The expectation of the war does not require dialogue, such as "how many enemies we will kill", etc. In addition to some speeches, the movie can basically be played as a silent movie. The fighting scene can continue with that of the Civil War campaign of the Birth of a Nation. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the movie is the great musical score, by Sergei Prokofiev. The music has an epic feel for the movie in those scenes without dialogue.
