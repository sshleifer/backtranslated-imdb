OK, why complain about this movie? It's fiction. Handle it. If you want to see the biography, check it out. This is an original, fictional version of what happened in Wisconsin. People who are obsessive will complain about this, as they do every other departure from the facts. Sad but true. I think Kane Hodder was a good idea for the man named after the movie. I thought it wasn't that good, I'd be honest. But it just made it scarcer. If you like Kane Hodder, Ed Gein or real-life movies, I think it's a good movie. But if you're obsessive (like other people), stay away from this movie and all the others.
