Minnie and Moskowitz are the most pathetic and unfair love stories I have ever seen. Between Minnie, a disillusioned museum curator whose battered married boyfriend dumps her and leaves her even more excited and confused than she already was, and Seymour Moskowitz, a parking worker who is so desperate for the attention that he spends his nights and worsens people , There has been a chaotic and disillusioned game from the start. Just like many couples we see every day. <br /> <br /> In almost every love story there is a man and a woman, the man is confident, funny or classically warm or attractive in his own way, whose shortcomings are charming and the woman a wounded soul what any man can have that she wants, who chooses the man because there's just something about him. These movies make everyone feel so good, because the characters embody what every man and woman wants to be, not what they are. Minnie and Moskowitz, instead of a hint of fantasy in the kingdom of the Roman image, show people who may be more common than the handsome, confident people with so much experience playing the field. What is the story behind the love affairs of the ugly, disturbing, uncomfortable man with no life and no work that enters us all, or the woman so unobtrusive that it is difficult to talk to her? <br /> <br /> These films are not as fascinating as Cassavetes' faces or opening night, but it has that sounding quality that Cassavetes always fought so hard to deliver. It is an unbridled depiction of people under the ego who hide in virtually all other films behind him. Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassel, who initially deliver spicy people, are barely likeable. Moskowitz drives us almost angry, let alone Minnie. He puts himself so vigorously in her life, the dates are an explosion of the inner voices of us that respond to the terrifying improper anxiety on the dates we've all been, rejections we all swallowed, and arguments we all had What we know was our own mistakes. I admire a movie such as Minnie and Moskowitz because, as the brand is with the films that Cassavetes helped, it identifies with 100% honesty. Our egos do not play in the company of his characters, thus a tremendous performance by the actor.
