Just thinking about the movie, I laugh at myself. Anne Ramsey plays an unforgettable part as 'Momma,' probably the most nasty but hilarious matriarch ever captured on film. Danny Devito and Billy Crystal make a fantastic duo that brings a real warmth to the movie. Although not very complex, the cute story keeps your attention and keeps you going. It's a fun comedy to lift things up and even entertain the kids. I give it my full recommendation.
