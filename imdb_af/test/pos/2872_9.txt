Finally a real horror movie. It was the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I'm a horror buff and I recommend this movie, but it's a pity. I'm not a big wrestler, but Kane really took the whole monster thing off. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17-year-old dragged me over, but I'm very glad I did. During and after the movie I looked over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movie is enough. I think that's why this movie gets good reviews. This is a refreshing change and takes you back to The Texas Chainsaw (first one), Michael Myers and Jason. And no CGI crap.
