I watched this movie during a special advanced preview in Reading, Berkshire. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Michael and Rory, make a friendship when Rory is introduced to the care home where Michael already lives. Michael is surprised to find someone who can finally understand him, because until now, his salt ball has made palsey people think he couldn't communicate. <br /> <br /> Rory introduces Michael to the life he misses. Rory is a festive character who doesn't approach his condition (muscular dystrophy). <br /> <br /> They tie and apply for Independent Life, and find a beautiful apartment and assistant and have all the fun they can ever dream. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie if you go to some "Entertainment". Go and watch this movie if you're willing to see something else. <br /> <br /> The storyline is strong, the actors are fantastic and, despite the sadness that comes with the movie, the mood is exciting. /> <br /> I recommend it thoroughly. Although if you are anything like me and tend to cry, take tissue as you need it!
