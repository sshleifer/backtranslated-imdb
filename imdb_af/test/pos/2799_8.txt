The first thing I wanted to do after watching this movie was it again (see, I missed a lot with all the laughter I did). I am European and I have studied abroad and I have lived as well as with Spanish, French, Italian and German people. The movie was full of stereotypes, more often than not, p *** people, and reading some of the other reviews, I see it has p *** people off. But this movie gets the stereotypes so right I can't make it wrong. Except for the way the French man became a drunk party. The English man was the perfect "geezer" stereotype. Drunk, annoying, insulting but finally shining through. Apart from the stereotypes, the film also correctly corrects the emotional aspect of the study abroad. At first he was ashamed, nobody knew, missed home, didn't know his way. As time goes on, it becomes his home and when time goes by, it's extremely difficult. A sense of people can only understand if they have experienced it. I recommend this movie.
