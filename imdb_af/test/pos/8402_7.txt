I am a great Gone With the Wind fan, and I read "Scarlett" before it was a miniature and loved it. It is a sequel of sorts. As you did not expect, with the following: "Honest, best, I don't end." Timothy Dalton was great like Rhett, though no one would ever replace Clark Gable. Joann Whaley-Kilmer, on the other hand, can give Vivien Leigh a run for her money (although I feel almost guilty of even saying it.) Her attitude and presence in the film makes the character a tea, make you love and hate her At the same time, how do you feel most about Leigh's portrayal. The film moves slowly, mostly because it follows the book now and is not released as a feature film. Excellent choice on the producer's part. I think this film deserves some recognition for the great storyline, the revival of characters that have gone almost 50 years, and for something that even Margaret Mitchell herself could be proud of.
