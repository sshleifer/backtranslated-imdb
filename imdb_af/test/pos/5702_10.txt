... and my reasons why it is simple - there are so many great films being presented and discussed here (most of them by their own directors and stars), so many tracks of notorious moments in the 70's film history, and actually a number of movies I still have to see, that it would not be fair to rate this work. Through this logic I didn't have to give other degrees to other film documentaries like Martin Scorsese's personal journey through American films and my trip to Italy. But while the films were on the basis of one man's image of the cinema, Richard LaGravanese and Ted Demmes have been telling the movies and creators for themselves a decade under the influence. <br /> <br /> What makes 'decade' worth at least one watch for movie buffs, or just someone who keeps the movies of the late 60's in America, is the level to which it goes, which is covered in the uncircumcised version (three hours, not the theater version, of which I have no comment) enough land. Interviews include Scorsese, Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet, Julie Christie, Jon Voight, Francis Ford Coppola, Paul Schrader, Pam Grier, Bruce Dern, Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Dennis Hopper, Robert Towne, etc. flow from insight from beginning to end. The way in which the cuts and directors / actors appear, combined in a fast and fast style, is also fascinating. <br /> <br /> The one comment I made on the documentary version is that most of the information presented is in several books, such as Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, and although I'm not the movie version of that book, but I'm sure it had many of the movies and directors and incidents here. (The book is actually one of the best I've ever read. However, this documentary serves as something special for movie buffs and occasional filmmakers of the future. They can look at this and not just learn about such famous photos as Easy Rider, The Last Picture Show, Annie Hall, Coming Home, and readers like Scarecrow, Panic in Needle Park, The Renter, Joe, they do not shoot horses, and they can also learn who influenced them (new waves of Europe and Asia), who served them as influences and how the topic that created controversy continues to controversy as intrigue and chancy material for the contemporary crowd.
