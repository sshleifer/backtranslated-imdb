Wow, what a wonderful movie-up! Mr. I did it again! <br /> <br /> His last work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great movie, but this one is even bigger. This 66-year-old director is selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year row. He gets better and better with what he makes of a Korean culture. <br /> <br /> Simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up, who was regarded as a miracle art in the late nineteenth century. The basic story of this film tells the life of Jang, Seung-up, and the historical background of his time. He was an orphan, but in his teens he was admitted by a noble man, Kim, Byung-Moon. This Mr. Kim becomes a mentor of Jang as well as lifelong friendship and continues to support his great talent in the first place. With Jang's great effort and natural talent, his fame is quicker and faster than the strength of his country, Korea falls down. <br /> <br /> Jang's personality featured in the film is very complicated and one of the best actors in Korea, Choi, Min-sik goes deep into Yang's soul. Struggling eyes reveal the struggle of a great artist's life. He is sometimes very serious, but suddenly he turns into a wild maniac. He drinks like an alcoholic, and always sleeps with courtesy. Even in the movie he said, "I can't draw an alcohol and a woman." "Alcohol and women are my only inspiration." In the pinnacle of fame, to develop his own style, he travels all over the country, never giving out his pride as an artist for authority or money. I don't want to give all the details, but I think you did get some ideas about the movie. <br /> <br /> The most wonderful aspect of this movie is cinematography. It's just as awesome how they captured every beauty of landscapes. Yes, every scene is like a work of Jang's painting. And the writing is also perfect. It mainly deals with a deeper meaning of what a true artist does. For example, Kim advises Jang in the movie that one must first have a paintbrush, a purpose in life. It is a very moving and inspiring line, and there is much more. <br /> <br /> Go See this movie if you are going to be in the Canne Festival. <br /> <br /> Chihwasun will be the biggest. film ever made about the life of a painter in film history.
