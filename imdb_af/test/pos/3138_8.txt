It takes a while to adjust to the sound of the Pioneer's sons, but then you enjoy it thoroughly. If the soundtrack is played by an orchestra such as Max Steiner or Dmitri Tiomkin, it will lose its folklore character. The music performs the film, everything looks like its rhythm. The whole cast is excellent. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. are the young men who lead the caravan. Ward Bond is the leader of the Mormon and Joanne Dru is a flirtatious actress. Ford could make up for what a normal western would be, something completely different and original that shows us the music, the dances and especially the people.
