Sometimes a movie is so bad it is good. This movie was made in Germany and was dubbed in English, so you have to get past it. The play was also styled and forced, except for what was done by the right rats, which IMO did an excellent job of doing the part. Snaps to the gear wrangler. Anyway, the mayor of the city has decided to cut costs and the local garbage collectors are halting, leaving huge loads of waste in general. This storyline has been used before, not to mention, has happened in real life (too often unhappy) and the audience is not in for any surprises. But that's good. We know what's going to happen and when, and sometimes an audience needs a movie where many brain cells aren't needed to follow along. We have our hero, up to the chiseled face and body, the semi-hero (s) and of course our heroine, what the doctor is, but still in training, even though it is she who discovers what really goes on when so many people get sick and die, not just a rat. Of course, the villain must die (okay, all the villains who mean the rats), and the final scene is one of those who remind the audience that a successor is in the works. It's one of those movies you just sit back and enjoy for what it is and what it isn't.
