This is my first Deepa Mehta movie. I watched the film on television in his Hindi version with his "Sita" character presented as Nita. I also pointed out that it is Radha who has undergone the allegorical trial by the fire in the film and not Nita / Sita. Still, what I loved about the movie was his screenplay by Ms Mehta, not her direction. The characters, big and small, were well-developed and by the end quixotic - like the end of Mazursky's "A Unmarried Woman." They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. And one carton man (Ashok) seems to be alive in the last shot we see from him --- carrying his invalid mother Biji. Eventually, he seems to assume a future responsibility outside of celibacy and adherence to religion. <br /> <br /> Ms Mehta seems to be fumble as a director (compared to most Indian mainstream theaters, however, it looks brilliant), as she can't use her writing to go beyond the microscopic joint family what she offers except to offer. a look at the Chinese micro-minority in India's social environment. She even carries the film to her mother and daughter (not her father!). However, her Radha reminds of half-days with both her parents in a mustard field. Compare her with Mrinal Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Muzaffar Ali and she is intertwined with these giants - given her capable Canadian production team and financial resources! Mehta's two bisexual women's movie in an Indian middle-class household can be sacred to some, but just take the middle-class atrophy that doesn't look better than its immediate survival in a limited social space. Kannada, Malayalam and Bengal films have touched on parallel themes in India, but do not have the publicity surrounding this film and therefore not seen by a wide range of expert films. <br /> <br /> Me Das, Ms Azmi, Mr Jafri and Mr Kharbanda are credible but not outstanding. Ms Azmi is a talented actress who performs under good directors (Hansinal Sen's "Khandar", Gautam Gose's "Couple", Benegal's Ankur) in this film. Me Das burned because of her screen presence rather than her acting ability. All in all, the film's strength remains in the structure of the script that is above average in terms of international theater. I'm sure Ms Mehta can grind her writing talents in her future screens.
