Carly Jones (Elisha Curtberth), her bad son, brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki) and her friend Paige (Paris Hilton) and her boyfriend Blake (Robert Richard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams) travel to another city to watch a major game. They decide to camp halfway in a field and continue the next day. However, the fan belt of Wade's car breaks down and he stays with Carly to buy a new one in a nearby town where there is a house. When they get into the place, they realize that the place is a ghost town, and two hidden former Siamese brothers transformed people into wax sculptures. <br /> <br /> I loved this "House of Wax" and it's worth it. teenage horror movie. The story follows the standards of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and other slash movies, and it's well done, has a good team of actors and actresses and special effects and the deaths are great. Even if the movie wasn't good, it's worth looking at the sexy and delicious Paris Hilton. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Casa de Cera" ("The House of Wax")
