Kevin Kline offers a brilliant comic twist in the 1997 comedy IN & OUT. Kline plays Howard Brackett, a small town history teacher excited to see the Academy Awards this year because one of his former students (Matt Dillon) is a nominee. He is nominated for his performance in a movie where he plays a gay soldier and when he wins, he thanks Howard in his speech to inspire him because Howard is gay. Now these floors are Howard because he has no idea why anyone would say it on international television. Howard is even engaged to be married (to Joan Cusack, in an Oscar nominated show), so he has no idea where Dillon; s Cameron Drake has the idea that he is gay and finds he must defend himself all at school, but is shocked that nobody was terribly shocked at what Cameron was saying on the Oscar. Howard has a birthday party where he gave birthday gifts such as the soundtrack to YENTL and finally explained to his guests why Barbra Streisand FUNNY LADY had to make. His parents (Wilford Brimley, Debbie Reynolds) are shocked, but promise to support their son, though he's gay. He also gets a visit from a village reporter (Tom Selleck) who wants to do an article about him because he is also gay. The moment Selleck planted a big kiss right on Kline's lips, is a classic. But all these little things actually questioned Howard's sexuality and wondered if he was really gay ... much to the exacerbation and frustration of his fianc√©, Cusack, who is over. The scene where she's sitting in a bar in her wedding dress and standing in the middle of the street, screams about the lack of some straight men in the world, is a classic. But what I like about this movie is the way Kline is fully invested in the role and not afraid to look foolish or gay. There is a wonderful scene, probably the best known of the movie, where he buys a record, how to be macho, and the man on the record talking about how real men don't dance and it's a disco voice Will survive as memory) and the narrator on the record no matter what you do, don't dance, but Howard can't help himself and he ends shaking his groove thing about the room. It is hysterically funny and Kline plays it with sincerity and gusto. The movie is not pro or anti gay. It's just a fancy and amusing character study about a man trying to figure out exactly who he is. Wonderful movie.
