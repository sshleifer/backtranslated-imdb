If you are looking for an erotic masterpiece, it is not. If you are looking for a comic masterpiece, it is not. If you're looking for something hardcore, it's not. <br /> <br /> An example of the fine art of European erotic comedy from the early 1970s is said to be. <br /> <br /> I see many people complaining about the quality, please understand that it was made in 1974. Yes, the women do not meet the modern ideals of attraction. They are not ugly women at all, but they do not have the same look that is idealized in our silicone culture. Yes, the dubbing is not nice, but they speak German and anyone who speaks a German will realize it is quite difficult to rewrite a word with 12 syllables. <br /> <br /> Having watched the DVD before the latest release it is marketed with 2 decades of 80's and recently 90's adult stars. The film is an R-movie, so those who complain about hardcore must have realized it. The film is made from the original, but it has also been modified before it started in the late 1970s. <br /> <br /> I first saw the movie as a young man and judged by some comments. There is a lot in the same boat that has a look at Cinemax. Many people are upset when they do not meet their previous memories later in life. This is understandable in view of the racism and nudity that is packed into today's erotica. <br /> <br /> Comparing 2069 with a modern soft-erotic comedy, you might be disappointed. The movie while out-of-the-box is actually a lot of fluid and the jokes, while generally innuendos and double meanings, can still get a chuckle. If you compare it to a hardcore movie, you'll be further disappointed. Compared to today, you see very little. <br /> <br /> It is still one of the best examples with Bottoms Up and The Other Cinderella or European Erotic / Comedic Cinema of the 1970s.
