This movie has been sitting in a dusty stack of videos in my house for centuries before we watched it. We knew it was there - every time someone wanted to see a movie, it was suggested. It almost became a joke ... "I know, let's look, throw Momma out of the train." I don't know why it's always been fired, it was just. Little did we know what we missed. It still affects me why it took us so long ... I mean it stars Danny DeVito, Billy Crystal and Ann Ramsy (referred to as "The Lady of the Goonies"), an all-star cast that had to appeal to everyone in my household. But it's been there for almost ten years. Until one day it was suggested and we could not turn it off anymore. <br /> <br /> It was like finding the King Tut tomb ... <br /> <br /> No movie ever made me laugh so hard, and I doubt any movie ever wants. I had to rinse for almost every line because I was still on the line laughing and losing the ability to pay attention or attention. Not just laughing, either ... the kind of laugh that spends more energy than running ten miles in the cold. The kind of laugh you can't control, causes you to roll around and cramp, and tears and snot will turn your face off because it's just freakin funny. As soon as I learned the movie heartily, I would say this effect has diminished, but I don't think I will be tired of watching it and setting new features to appreciate it. I think that's all I can say. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you don't enjoy it, don't let me know, I'll probably be offended.
