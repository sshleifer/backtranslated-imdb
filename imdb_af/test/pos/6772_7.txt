Good Lord ... How it ended up in our DVD player, I will never know ... my wife thought it was a new version she had somehow missed ... Nevermind it is a few years old and in Danish (I think) ... She was looking for the English soundtrack ... Always ... the movie wasn't bad ... Good production values, better performances and a clever story that didn't come not too far away from itself, make neat, dark skies sail from the sea! The end will make you visit ... in fact, the whole movie is going. Incredibly quirky characters we are really interested in, make a movie worthwhile ... Without spoiling the plot, the movie's title and DVD jacket gives you a good idea where this thing goes!
