Dario Argento is a filmmaker I touch slowly, following the iconoclastic efforts of Deep Red and Suspiria; He is not a filmmaker to always be right about stupid things like plot. This could be one of her minors (but for my apparent) accountability: he would not drop a small thing like common sense, screwing his plan for his extensive lethal sequencing, as his killer could set up from any kind of extensive work. invisible, until the display passes the point of the POV track shot of the said psychopathic killer. But it is exciting to see that a filmmaker takes any such chances anyway, from a purely Italian aesthetic that is hampering its way into the soul of a Hitchcockian warp. Indeed, as an interest, if one recently saw the Scorsese short film where he took it. Three pages of an onfilmed Hitchcock film, which also took place in an opera, received Argento almost twenty years, probably without knowledge of the text. It's also unashamed 80's (CD players and heavy metal and the hair, oh me!) And with an absurdity that makes it more palatable to swallow. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: a Macbeth opera is produced, with high stylized fireworks and trained roves. There is even a talented upcoming star to be replaced in the last minute, Betty, played by Marsillach. But a murder takes place during the premiere break, but by a falling light - and now the killer is behind Betty! She can't go to the police (how can she find out that the opera is really cursed?) But will it matter in the face of a murderer who won't allow? One has probably seen such a place like this in another Argento movie chased by a killer - but that's how Argento, like De Palma, builds and exports his rows and adds a distinctive taste to his own to add bizarre humor. (the outbreak of the raids to attack the killer, and the subsequent version of the clue), a kind of overstyling ala Leone (the bullet through the pithole through the door probably inspired a similar shot in Kill Bill 1), and even sado-masochistic inspiration with the pins attached to Betty's eyes more than once! <br /> <br /> Argento puts his actress through the wringer, and she's all played for it, even though it looks like things are just going in the "what-the-hell" area (I almost throw my hands on me says I give up when she runs the secret passage of the little girl, as if we are suddenly in strangers. And through such a dark genre material, Argento keeps the violence thick and fresh, the tension about as much as opera music comes straight from a stereo speaker, and a kinographer who might have had a few drinks (and in some scenes the way they are shot and vibrate to a heartbeat. It should be considered as trash, but it is beyond any genre's limitations through the director's cute attitude, despite a foolish endlessness as anything that preceded it (thank you little lizard) - and " an attempt to break the Macbeth curse, which unfortunately does not occur in real life on the set Opera. 8.5 / 10
