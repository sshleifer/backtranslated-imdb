Oh! When good actors adopt mere material! If you think of this movie as a stiff police excitement, you might be disappointed. While the situations are very lifelike, the plot goes on a very predictable clip and you can see pretty well what lies ahead before the actors take you there. Many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion. Much of the dialogue is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> But! If you like to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it, you'll love this movie! Sam Elliott is nothing short of brilliant to use Detective Falon's one-note characters to live in depth and pathos. Those of you who have never seen Elliott emote are far beyond his normal wrestling tricks. He will be delighted with the series of emotions he portrays in this film. And even in his early fifties in this movie he looks fantastic! His bare bust gives hope to middle-aged men everywhere! Esai Morales does a wonderful job of raising his role as Det. Falon's eager beaver new police partner. He could easily have played it as a Robin after Elliott's Batman, but instead he played a authenticity and passion in this role. He makes it work, despite the lame lines he is given to say. <br /> <br /> Paul Sorvino is great to watch! He plays the eccentric police captain. He seems to know he is slumbering in this movie and has a ball that does it. He also makes it fun for us. <br /> <br /> This movie is a lot of by-the-numbers in plot, but does great with great shows! Sam Elliott fans should definitely get this one as it is a kick to see that he spreads his wings and does so much more than he usually does!
