After discovering the Ring Trilogy, I greeted all the other Japanese and Korean films running on or after the bandwagon. <br /> <br /> I don't have an easy definition of horror, but this movie I definitely pressed a few of my buttons, although I can't claim the movie makes much sense. I'm squeam so there were several points in the movie when I just didn't want to see what happened on the screen. The movie disturbed me so I became anxious to see things I thought I was going to see. <br /> <br /> This is an imaginative film presented visually. It also offers food for thought. And lots of material to argue about when the movie is over. <br /> <br /> The characters are well defined to say the least. Can they make such films in the West? <br /> <br /> So it doesn't make sense in the end, but if the appetite for the occult is, the supernatural, the bizarre, the other, then not the movie will make a final all-explaining discount .
