I like this movie. Many people call it "Sabrina the Teenage Feminist". They do it with many movies that Melissa Joan Hart is. Yet she really surprised me in this movie because she was big in the part of Mary fighting for justice when her roommate is raped. You can say that Hart was extremely determined in this movie and it showed. I also loved Lisa Dean Ryan as Maria's roommate. She was very effective in sorry for her character after she was raped. Josh Hopkins was good as the shark and selfish rapist. Lochlyn Munro played his character convincingly. The play in this movie is better than in most TV movies, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> However, the movie was pretty predictable. Also, I expected more from the end, it was too sudden. The delivery could have been better. But the performances and overall plot make up for these problems.
