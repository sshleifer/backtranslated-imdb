Alexander Nevsky is a series of excellent series of cinematic opera that pass from pastoral to lament and end in a triumphant cantata. The story takes place in 1242. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) defeats the Teutonic Knights in a battle on the ice of the Peipus Lake. <br /> <br /> The film is a wonderful historical spectacle that director Sergei Eisenstein puts on his most inventive picture, and climbed into a beautiful series of music instead of natural sounds. Several films have scenes heavily influenced by the Battle of Peipus, including Doctor Zhivago (1965), Mulan (1998) and King Arthur (2004). Alexander Nevsky has been brought out of circulation as a result of changing political winds, and then possibly anchored the most influential Soviet-historical film.
