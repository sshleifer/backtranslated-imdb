"Best in Show" follows the stories of a handful of human participants as they prepare for one of the biggest dog shows in the calendar. Any amateur psychologist will say that an unconditional love and obsession with a pet is a sign of something missing in someone's life, and each of the characters somehow fills this click. There is the former Hottie High School who is now married to a geeky man, the childless, label obsessed yuppie couple, the lonely outdoor man, the young woman of a rich old codger (along with her short-haired daughter) and the gay couple . <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so funny is the way it portrays these stereotypes in a completely credible way - almost lovingly, in many cases. Every ridiculous thing one of the characters does or says - with their dog as an innocent spectator - looks like the kind of behavior you'd expect to see in a dog program. <br /> <br /> The biggest laugh comes from the commentary team of an all-American style sports expert, who compares moments in a dog show with parts of a baseball game, and his English, dog-academic, foil. <br /> <br /> The trials of the geeky man as his blonde wife meet an astonishing number of men from her past are also good for a chuckle, just like the demented behavior of the yuppie couple, like the pressure. build, while their dog remains completely unconscious. <br /> <br /> Well watched - even though cats are your pocket.
