Well, where do I start? <br /> <br /> As one of the other reviewers has said, you know you're a great surprise when you see the opening shot - minutes and minutes of the movie time spent on a man who traveler. <br /> <br /> I will not repeat Rubin's excellent summary of the story. What I would like to say, however, is that this film has taken me more than any movie I can remember. I sat open-mouthed and completely on the edge of my seat. The camera work, soundtrack and * fantastic * performances (especially those of Tony Servillo) draw you to the screen and don't let you look away. <br /> <br /> It's Italian, so of course everyone looks great, but it's not just a cool style exercise. It's a movie with lots to say about happiness, loss and love. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
