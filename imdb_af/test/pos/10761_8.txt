To the eight people who found the previous FIERCE PEOPLE remarks useful "Psycolicious Me" and "Topdany" "useful" as well as future visitors they see before removing their authors: these negative criticisms are not only shorter than site guidelines mandate, but they are completely bogus, nonfactual, wrong, and misinformative. For example, Blythe's father is in a coma, not dead - Maya and Finn even visit him in hospital. Besides, it was estate boxer Dwayne - NOT Blythe - who had Jilly beaten the maid, etc. Etc. So if you have ADD that is unable to focus on the simplest details, please keep your condition to yourself by not pretending to be Siskel or Ebert. Otherwise, include a disclaimer with your comments!
