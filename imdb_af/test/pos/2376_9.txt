The third part of Miike's Dead of Alive trilogy is so unrelated to the first two parts as they were almost or less. Show Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi are back for the lead roles, but this time the movie will hit us 300 years or so in the future ... after the apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Riki plays a tough policeman, a stranger to the corrupt city's extreme police policy, and Show plays a drifter sitting with a bunch of city repressed rebels. The film should be shot in Hong Kong, as most of the role-players are Cantonese speakers. Terence Yin and Josie Ho are the most recognizable faces. There is also a HK stunt crew on hand for the films' sequels, which is very cool in HK-via-Miike style. <br /> <br /> It could be a very low budget B movie, but of course, in Miike's hands, it gets something more interesting. It is quite a slow, thorough film that hits next door and does not attempt to force the viewer's throat. Characters are rounded and interesting and the plot is an interesting but fairly loose framework for the story to be hanged. <br /> <br /> All in all, a pretty low key action to the action scenes, showing that Miike's increasing skill in directing and choreographing very nice action. Watching Mapping Show & Riki in Wire Streams is really fun - you can say they have a good time. <br /> <br /> The final of the film is trying to tie the 3 Dead or Alive movies together, which is pretty unnecessary because everyone is really independent. However, Miike's explanation of the connection is very funny and the series is very beautiful. <br /> <br /> Not as deep or well developed as DOA2, not as outrageous and intense as DOA1. Another good Miike movie. though.
