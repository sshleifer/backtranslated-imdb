An interesting comedy that takes place on a train from Stockholm to Berlin, December 1945. One cannot feel sorry for the poor writer / critic who leaves his job and jumps on the train to Berlin. His ambition is to make a difference and to participate in building the newly united Europe after the end of the war. <br /> <br /> I like the black and white format of the movie, as well as the closed landscape of an exercise in motion. <br /> <br /> Robert Gustafsson makes a classic "Gustafsson role" in this movie. If you're a fan of him, this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> The philosopher Wittgenstein, through his saying, "One can never assume anything is what it seems" is referred to several times. the movie.
