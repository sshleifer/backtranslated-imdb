here in Germany it was once shown on TV. Today, since everything is mainly, it is absolutely impossible to watch a movie on the screen again. Maybe it's the same in the US, or especially GB. The message is a cruel truth: Find friends to bring your ideas closer to reality, whether you become a loser or not an asshole instead. <br /> <br /> The whole movie isn't so simple it may look like this. Every little scene, every sentence, every behavior of the characters, shows a sharp look at what can happen if one person is not accepted into a sadistic crowd, which calls him normal. <br /> <br /> Well played by everyone this is a must see. Who is the main character? John (not Cox, people remember ;-) Niles Niles (who is still Bimbo) Decide and you'll get the plot as intended. <br /> <br /> A bitter look at what society is in a repressive system. Kind of Salsers Vanger in the rye and Goldings Lord of the flies thought to the end. <br /> <br /> The Final can change your own mind. word
