I was on my way out one morning when I found something on the T.V. checked and came across this movie. I never remember or hear it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well, my meeting was pushed back because I couldn't get out of this movie. It had some interesting things in it that marked time in history, and some fun things they didn't have in people's movie, because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it. The play was good for a 1954 film. Subtle and sincere actions of the characters that made me see what they are going to do next. That's why I watched it. I don't know why they don't show it more often. I'd rather watch it than some movies that they play more than needed. For history buffs, people who like period movies, and those in movie appreciation groups will like this. "The Egyptian" has a variety of scents that deal with many things to look into human nature that hasn't changed since that time. What does this say about us? Those who don't like movies that take their time to unfold and tell a good story ... aren't in film. <br /> <br /> I didn't have the time to rent it if it was available, but if I got a chance to see it again, I would probably have a 10 vote.
