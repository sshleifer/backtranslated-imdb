Beautiful little thriller from Hitchcock, with many beautiful shenanigans around a murdered spy, a kidnapped kid, a nasty church, a strange plot and some random taxidermists. Jimmy Stewart is once a great hero to Hitchcock, the story flows to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the alarming threat of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original. Yet another wonderful movie of the great master's stable.
