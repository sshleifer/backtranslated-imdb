It's really bad that nobody knows about this movie. I think if it just came a little up and if it wasn't that low budget, I think one of the big movie companies might want it. I only saw the movie when I was 11, and I thought it was so powerful with the huge but illegal lengths that Mitchell is going to just keep his family together. It then inspired me and it amazes me now. If you're lucky to find a copy of this movie, don't miss it!
