This is one of the best successors and a very good movie even though there were some errors, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. This time, Charles not only fights one or two muggers, but a whole army of them. Death Wish 3 has very good action scenes and I enjoyed it every second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to regulate a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page that provides the music. Producers Golan and Globus do something else and Charles Bronson still plays well for Paul Kersey. This movie also made it seem that Michael is trying to end the Death Wish series and I can't blame him and I love the Gun that Charles uses. Death Wish 3 is one of the big movies of 1985 and can't get any better than that. <br /> <br /> I give this 9/10
