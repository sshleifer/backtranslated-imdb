I saw it last night at the London Film Festival, apparently the shorter version. James McNally's summary of movie content is very good. Nossiter combines his exploration of the wine business with wider concerns about globalization, homogenization, the impact of mass media, the power of capital and the need for diversity. <br /> <br /> The movie is shot on the hand-held DV that some may find, but it allows Nossiter to capture people on a number of occasions, which would probably not be possible with more conventional equipment no. <br /> <br /> Despite the vast feeling of the movie, the editing is very sharp, not only to give us a parade of the world's dogs, but also to suppress a number of interviews with somewhat contradictory visual images, and to give others rope to hang themselves. To some extent, it has attracted Michael Moore's recent work (although Nossiter works in a more subtle way), but probably the roots of the film go back to Marcel Ophuls's "The Sorrow and the Pity", both in the way the film is built and In the rise of 'salt of the earth' French farmers than the stars. The Montille pears et fils were present at the LFF investigation and then answered questions. We all really need a little disturbance - well, Hubert! <br /> <br /> Overall a great movie with implications that goes far beyond the world of wine in the way we build ourselves as people and organize our world.
