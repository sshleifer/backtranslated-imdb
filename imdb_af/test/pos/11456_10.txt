I love these young people who are trapped in a horror movie house. Not just because I'm a big Linnea Quigley-Jill Terashita fan, but because it's a lot of fun and actually scary. <br /> <br /> The special effects are great, especially Linnea's lipstick scene and until the end almost everyone is dead and possessed. <br /> <br /> Lots of nudity provided by Linnea and Jill, lots of humor, cool soundtrack, high lift count, etc. By the way, if you've never seen this one, try and buy / watch the ungraded version which is more gorgeous and some scenes lack the rated version.
