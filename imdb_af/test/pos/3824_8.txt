No, I didn't see the original series and I wouldn't compare the two if I had it. This series was filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well written every week in a different story. Some are a bit out there, but most of the time it's the storytelling quality. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a program in a world where people became slaves to a lizard reptile species. It's funny, how the lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens like V, but anyway he has three days to program a man who is completely burned to serve the alien species on earth. The stories are usually a little out there, but very entertaining to watch.
