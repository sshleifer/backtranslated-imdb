As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrant husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) murdered by prisoner, Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised reality reality is completely in the fantasy world of her favorite soap plunged. opera. In a state of complete denial and despair, Betty escaped both physically and spiritually from her disgruntled, small town to search for dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of a reason to love hospital soap operation and manufacturing in Los Angeles. Immune to reality, Betty comes to L.A. and become "Nurse Betty" as she tries to belong to the hospital world of her dream lover. Meanwhile, anger angered Charlie and Wesley Betty, convinced she was a dangerous witness who also knew about their compromise with Del. Nurse Betty creates comedy and tension by contrasting his main character's extreme innocence and optimism. with the clear hypocrisy and violence surrounding her. Clearly defining the protagonist's difficult life, nurse Betty condemns his character's tendency to turn away from reality. So, while commenting on the popularity of soap opera in the film, Nurse also commented on the widespread addiction to television and his celebrities. In addition, nurse Betty benefits the effective manipulation of his main player's mental condition, especially in the scenes where she cannot distinguish between "Dr. David Ravell", the character and George McCord (Greg Kinnear), the actor who plays him. Betty's inability to recognize George as an actor leads to strange misunderstandings, emphasizing the extent of her madness. However, despite these successes, Nurse Betty suffers from the disturbing characterization that the narrative develops. For example, while Charlie and Wesley are consistently portrayed as a comic couple, the brutality of their actions undermines any sense of appreciation or acceptance that the viewer may have initially experienced. Likewise, although the initial scenes of Del establish as a horrible man, the humiliation and violence he experiences with his murderers, all the humiliation and violence he surpassed for his wife, surpassed Betty. <br /> <br /> Finally, by the end of the movie Charlie undergoes uncomfortable transformations while developing an obsession with Betty; an obsession that leads to noble feelings of love, and ultimately destroys him. Consequently, as the characters' roles as victims lack consistency, the story's victimization processes seem arbitrary and insignificant. Overall, nurse Betty's independence - rather than creating tension - weakens his characters and pollutes his plot. <br /> <br />
