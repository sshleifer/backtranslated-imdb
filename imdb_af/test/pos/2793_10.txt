I love this movie (don't know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a mess, and totally irrelevant name!), I have 8 months in Barcelona, ​​not as an Erasmus student, but with other foreigners, so it only has the same. It brings back so many good memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries and from the city itself. I really want to see the sequel 'Les Poupees Russes' (the Russian Dolls), I guess it won't be released here? My brother saw it in France and said it's not that good, but has a lot of the same casting (Wendy's brother is believed to be married). Anyone know anything about this movie? and whether it can be released?
