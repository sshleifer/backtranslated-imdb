This movie is important to those of us who are interested in Western history because it uses authentic techniques in production. <br /> <br /> The scene of the wagon train is particularly authentic; As far as I know, it contains the only scenes ever filmed to illustrate blue-crossing techniques for river crossings. The horses and mules should be lowered on the river surface and the wagons lowered by ropes and pulleys. The scene is so that I could see it again, just to get a feel for how a cross was. And the early travelers did it again and again when they crossed the country. <br /> <br /> Aside from Melodrama, this picture is so exquisite in dress and style, as it is worth watching it alone.
