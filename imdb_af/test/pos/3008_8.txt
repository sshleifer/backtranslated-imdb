I give this movie 8/10 overall. Visually, much of it is not surprising: an art director's dream mix of Hieryonomous Bosch, Salvador Dali, Frieda Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe - and a valid proof of the power of film as a serious art form. Beautiful use of color, shape, images, environment and fabulous decoration combine with the latest computer graphics. So, 10/10 for that! Wow! <br /> <br /> The plot line is, well, more predictable. You know they will save the girl and eventually get the killer, but the story is still interesting and enough to pull you in and out. 6/10 before. <br /> <br /> Squirm Factor ... I won't give it a score, but the movie made me sure, and I watched it on video on a TV screen. Of course, it will have much more impact on a large screen. Graphic violence of a distorted, erotic nature in a surrealistic landscape - even if it is beautiful - is highly unpredictable. The world in the killer's head is not - thank you! - my world. Watching this movie on video, I could play a few series and found many to admire the second time when I wasn't so nervous about where the scene was going and I suspect the whole movie would be worth it. a second time, just for the visual art. <br /> <br /> General suggestion: Don't take the children or conservative grandparents to this one, but if you're keen on the visual appearance of movies, such as surreal art, don't mind a little kinky gore, and just want to take a "thought journey", this one is a winner. Oh, and if you're keen on babies, Jennifer Lopez is pretty hot. <br /> <br />
