I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. It offers updates of technology news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you're a geek, gamers or anything, you'll enjoy this show. They have played their game since the man under my review (2006). This is the only place where I get my technical information. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments that refer to things in the game, movie, comic ... Universe. Knowing the universes will understand the jokes. Long story short, aots is a hilarious show that gives me and all the news about anything you care about. I look at it now as I type it, they are "in" San Diego covering the red bull aerial. Sweet.
