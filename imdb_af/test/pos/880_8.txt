Jewel Thief is * The * Bollywood crime thriller, and why not? It is directed by the largest exponent of the crime player art in Indian Cinema Vijay Anand ('Johny Mera Name' and 'Teesri Manzil'). I can watch this movie for any of the following reasons (in order of importance): <br /> <br /> 1 Vijay Anand's direction 2 RD Burman's music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Majrooh Sultanpuri's lyrics < br /> <br /> Even if Jewel Thief is not a Bond movie, it definitely has tire babies. Helen, Tanuja, and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and a few cameos.) But our sauvé Vinay (Dev Anand) is all but Bond. He is uncontrollable for most of the story and goes where the story almost always confuses us as we are. He even flashes with Anju (Tanuja) trying to hit her romantic nerve just so he can be employed in her father's shop. <br /> <br /> Dev Anand may be in a dual role - well, I don't want to spoil your movie or else I would have told you. That's what most of the riddles are about. Dev Anand works in a jewelry store and there is a robbery when he is supposed to be at work - although it doesn't, or at least is a perfect alibi. We wonder who did this, it is Dev Anand as 'Vijay' the person he claimed or is it 'Amar' someone we haven't seen yet, but many people claim his appearance. Coming "Shalu" (Vyjayanthimala) who even claims to be her fiancé in a tense situation, Dev Anand must prove he is Vinay and not Amar. While everyone is wondering if Dev Anand is Vinay or Amar, he is asked to remove his socks. Amar who told us has 6 digits on one of his foot. As we watch with exhilarating breath, the events that are about to unfold Dev Anand, we even find time to joke. <br /> <br /> The right brothers Director Vijay Anand and Actor Dev Anand have many movies between them. It's not the best of them, but definitely the best in Crime Triller. <br /> <br /> There are moments from Hitchcock's North At North West, but the movies are very different. Except for the confusion about who is who, a treacherous female head and many trips, there are not many similarities. Dev Anand can be very good Amar as Vijay. People saw him, they identified him where he was going. There are too many of these people because it is a fraud. Finally, Vinay finds it better to be with Amar to find out the truth, and it's a sad mistake. He gets too deep in it, just to be saved by turning Cinema. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie as a child, I was definitely not amused, the end completely confused me. Even now there are parts about the end I don't like, but I will recommend the movie anyway. <br /> <br /> Even as a kid, I enjoyed the songs this movie offers. "You dare ..." - a definite lover's song in Kishor Kumar's voice. I could hear 'Rulake Gaya ...' all day. It is set for "Amemaan ke neeche" which is set under the clouds of Gangtok (at least the storyline suggests it). "Raat akeli hai" under the sexiest song to get out of the Hindi theater, with Tanuja as the seducer. "Meri taraf dekho" - Helen's cabaret and we look at her. "Hothon pe ..." - now, there can be a better thriller of a song than this. As the song progresses, we are more tense than we ever were and the words "hidden in Shalu's lips" add to it.
