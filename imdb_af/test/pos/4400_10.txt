Having seen most of the Coen Brothers' previous films, I expected something else and little from the center. OBWAT is definitely those things, but it also has a heart as big as ... as big as the Mississippi. It is one of the most obviously pleasing movies that have emerged recently, intelligent, well-made, clever and beautiful. Characters are performed by a group of wonderful actors in their brilliant shades. George Clooney totally wins me with his Clark Gable-ish looks and character. Having ever seen him in three kings and his thin red line, I became a fan now. More comedy, please. George. <br /> <br /> John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson really help, especially Nelson. If ever "The Simpsons" is made in a movie, then of course he has to play Cletus the pockets. I don't think there is a show that is not quite the whole movie. My special favorite is Stephen Root as the blind Radio Station Man. <br /> <br /> Big old-fashioned music, a jiggy-type dance by Clooney I try to learn, and a feeling of depression in the south of the US, enhanced by sepia-like photography make it the best movie I've seen so far. The only downside to the movie is that it almost sent me out, broke down to buy the soundtrack, the DVD and a DVD player to play it .... it's so good! <br /> <br />
