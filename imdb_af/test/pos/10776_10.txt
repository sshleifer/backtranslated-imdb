This is a film about passion. The passion it portrays is largely wrong, even for the leading man. But in that lies the incredible power of this film: it shows us that what we believe can be polluted by nonsense and even lead to things that are destructive - to ourselves or others. In addition, those who are trying to escape from gaining passion (looking at the druggie visiting the studio) can also threaten self-destruction. <br /> <br /> The world needs to hear the message of this movie more often.
