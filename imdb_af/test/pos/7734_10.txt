I can't believe the low scores for this movie. Probable reason has to do with the low number of votes which meant that few people saw it. It's simply a fantastic movie! There are so many stories inside, but it's not complicated. Every character grows with the movie and we experience with their life changes. The scenery is just wonderful and the end credits are the best ever in any movie I've seen (just like a Shakespeare game). Yes, it is a bit dated (filmed in 1982), but the problems faced by the characters are very active. It could have been filmed in 2002 without changing the story. Raul Julia is wonderful, the best role ever in a movie - it's his signature piece. A young Molly Ringwald is excellent as she decays from girl to young woman. Susan Sarandon is perfect as a young carefree woman and John Cassavetes is the force that puts it all together. Do yourself a favor, find this movie, watch it and enjoy it. Return to IMDb and record this movie in the top 250 of all time where it really belongs.
