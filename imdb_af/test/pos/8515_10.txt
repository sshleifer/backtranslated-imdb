Background Information - The movie Octopussy & Never Say Never Again, was made in the same year 1983, and of course people compare it. Moore vs Connery. Bond vs Bond. <br /> <br /> I heard that many people claim the "official movie" Octopussy is much better. Well, I just looked at Octopussy. Bond drives an airplane at 100 miles per hour (impossible --- the wind will blow him off) by using his feet to drop the plane and then jump about 60 miles an hour (again impossible - try jumping off your car --- you will end up with a broken body. How is it in the sense that the octopussy scene should be "good"? Suddenly, Bond has superhuman strength and a titanium body. And he does all these stunts at the age of 56? Full crap. Unbelievable. Farsie. <br /> <br /> ---> Never contrast the above-mentioned scene with Connery's "unofficial" never again: it doesn't have the same Polish due to its independent movie status (less money), but At least you can believe that Connery is a real exploration in real danger. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Bond showing his age (he is 50, and he's 50) and is being returned for recycling. Absolutely credible. But of course there is no such thing as a "day off" for a world-renowned spy, and Bond quickly finds a target, even in the hospital. From that point on, the story turns into a different adventure, with Bond trying to track down his attempt at murderers and eventually attempting to steal nuclear weapons. <br /> <br /> As usual, Sean Connery did a brilliant job, avoiding the over-the-top / incredible stunts. This movie feels like a natural sequel to Connery's last movie, 1971's Diamonds Are Forever ... the old style of Bond ... before the franchise became stupid. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
