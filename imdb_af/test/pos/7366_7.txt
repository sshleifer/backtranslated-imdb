Good (not big) little horror movie with a high "creep" factor (not confused with a 1991 movie of the same name, or the more recent (2001) campfire STORIES). The central story of stranded teens who tell ghost stories about a bonfire in haunting bushes delights and captures the various stories that make up the bulk of the movie (Watch for Ron Livingston (Office Space, Band of Brothers) and Jennifer MacDonald in a live, sexy segment ("The Honeymoon"). Solid acting and some real "scary" moments make it an above average chiller. Good example of interesting story line, along with quality ensemble acting, which results in a much larger than the sum of its parts. "Surprise" end of the main story adds nice creepy twist, although some may see it coming. Movie is not available on DVD, but can be found on VHS.
