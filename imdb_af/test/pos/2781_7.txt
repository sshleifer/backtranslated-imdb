So we saw it on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much about what's going on in the movie that happened to us! I mean yes, it's a little clicked, but it's still true, know what I'm saying. <br /> <br /> I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I am more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a warm roommate like Cecile de France. She looks like a cool chick in the movie and for the real, after seeing her at the Cannes festival this month. <br /> <br /> Now I think I'm going to Barcelona next summer after watching this movie. I also need to see the successor who just came here in France.
