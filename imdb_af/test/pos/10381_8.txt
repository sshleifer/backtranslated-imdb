It's just stories, some of us wanting to happen to us, some that we never want, never happen to us, all about unfulfilled desire. The venues and naked bodies are beautiful, but after the second story, all I could think of, "it takes more than beauty to create a real movie." Then, of course, the film unfolds. The stories move except Sophie Marceau fails to communicate her story in this movie. However, Malkovich plays the story for both. The voice call fails to link the stories, but helps Malkovich to challenge a few thoughts. <br /> <br /> I want to say it's worth seeing and the best of Antonioni I've seen. Given its age - remarkable!
