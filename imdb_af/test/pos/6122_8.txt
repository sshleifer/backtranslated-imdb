For me, Pink Flamingos lived to its reputation as the shocking, disgusting, repulsive, trashy movie I expected to be. It really contains everything except the kitchen sink. We are treated to almost two hours of never-ending nastiness: rape, sex, sex with chickens, transsexuals, castration, murder, cannibalism and a terrible display of anus's singing. It's about a strange couple starting a competition with a trailer-garbage family, trying to steal their title as the "most nasty people in life". Divine (a fat man in the tow) is an incredibly dirty man, who is actually painful to watch. Trust me when I say that this movie cannot be forgotten soon, especially the final scene in which Godly visits the dog from the pavement. I always thought John Waters was overestimated and I can't say I like this movie, but it's an experience if you ever get the chance to see it.
