Okay, I marked this spoiler. Don't be so upset if I upload it. Now I went to the movie and expect to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every abomination I have ever seen, was predictable, but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I didn't expect there to be a "WHY" for Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy, you still have the idea and understand the madness. Now, of course, if you want something that will scare you closer, it's not the movie you're looking for. But if you are a Saw fan or some other movies that claim their fame thanks to sadistic content, it's a movie to watch. Now that I really throw a spoiler for a second warning. I give this movie a 9, maybe because I'm a fan of the WWE and a fan of Kane, but who doesn't feel a movie of a movie better if it is someone's love. However, this movie could have scored a 10 for my IF. . . (spoiler) ----> at the end of the movie when Kane showed death on the pavement. While a dog was pissing in his eye, "CUTE" was a classic with the Kane / Undertaker sitting fast and turning his head. A perfect 10 would be awarded if that happened. It was a perfect event, but either the WWE did not think it would start a future successor with the order I mentioned. That's all. (9)
