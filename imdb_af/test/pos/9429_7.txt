In the Universal series of modern Sherlock Holmes stories with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEOPON are not one of the top films - although entertaining. I think the problem is that many of the film's "dueling" between Holmes and his nemesis Moriarty (played here by Lionel Atwill) slows down the real point of the professor's work. <br /> <br /> Moriarty appears in Three of the Holmes movies with Rathbone. In the adventures of Sherlock Holms he was played by George Zucco, who really enjoyed the love of the villain for the sake of the matter. For my money, Zucco's performance as the professor was the best of the three (there is even a short moment of comedy in his performance, when he is disguised as the "Sergeant of the Police" - as he prepares to sings "a Policeman's Lot" by Gilbert & Sullivan). Next comes Mr. Atwill's action here - more of that later. Finally, there is Henry Daniell's intellectual Moriarty in SHERLOCK HOLMES and LADY IN GREEN. This is a typical cool, elegant performance by Mr Daniell, but his confrontation with Holmes seems to be a boring adoration to him. They keep him from completing the main plan. In the stories in which the professor appeared, he really felt that Holmes was a nemesis that would endanger his life. Yet, due to the intellectual tennis match between him and Rathbone, Rathbone (in his autobiography) actually felt Daniell was the best of the movie Moriartys. <br /> <br /> If Zucco caught the love of evil in the Professor and Daniell was apparently demonstrating the tired Oxford Don. In the stories, the professor is a well-known mathematician, whose volume on the binomial theorem had a "European vogue", and who wrote an intriguing book, The DYNAMICS OF THE ASTEROID. Atwill demonstrates the Professor as a pragmatic businessman. First, he sells his services (allegedly) to Nazi Germany. It never happened, but one supposedly (as it is before the Nazis really crash) he showed that they would win the war. Secondly, he is not a fool. Then dr. Tobel (William Post Jr.) Shown he is a state of near physical collapse due to the torture of Moriarty's gang, the professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists who help Tobel because he is so good a scientist is like Tobel and can build the bomb site. Somehow, I can't really see Zucco making such a meaningful decision on the spot, and if Daniell had to make it, he seemed to be even worse off delaying his plans. <br /> <br /> By the way, a trick used throughout the Holmes series about the professor is how to get rid of the movie. If you read the Holmes stories, Moriarty appears three times as the villain: in the last story of SHERLOCK HOLMES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE FINAL PROBLEM"), IN THE BACK OF SHERLOCK HOLMES's first story ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE LEE house ") and the last of the four novels / novellas (the valley of ves). It is incredible how many kilometers the professor received from so few appearances (he is also mentioned in two or three other stories). But because of his fate at the Reichenbach waterfall in "THE FINAL PROBLEM" and "THE EMPTY HOUSE", we always see him fall to his death. Zucco falls from the White Tower on Tower Hill. Daniell (with more imagination) tries to flee Gregson and the police, but is shot while he jumps, and wounded fails to hold onto the wall of an adjacent building. Atwill (here it is not seen, but heard) seems to fall a fall door, he is planted in an escape tunnel.) It is really boring after a while to see that the professor always falls into these movies. One turns to the Gene Wilder comedy (admittedly a comedy) SHERLOCK HOLMES 'SMARTER BROTHER, in which Leo McKern is a wonderful, villainous and villainous Moriarty (eventually, with an Irish accent), who is not killed, but only away is mulling - in a rowing boat - about how its careful schemes don't work out. I'd rather love it. <br /> <br /> Using the "Dancing Men" code here, like using the "Devil's Foot" in DRESSED TO DREAM, is part of a mystery from a short story at night. "The adventure of the dancers" appears in the return of Sherlock Holms, and deals with a Holmes client whose wife received strange blood-blooded messages in this code. Charles Higham, in his biography, highlights the adventures of Conan DOYLE. Sir Arthur can retrieve the code of a magazine game in the 1870s, but we really don't know. The code is basically one of the letter replacements for the figures of the dancing men. The story in the short story is dramatic, but deals with a triangle. The only innovation in the film is that Tobel makes a slight change that confuses both Holmes and Moriarty. <br /> <br /> The movie will be entertaining, but I still think the HOUSE OF FEAR, THE SCARLET CLAW, and SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH are better movies.
