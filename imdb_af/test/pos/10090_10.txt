Typically, a movie can have factors such as 'wake up', 'good feeling', 'purpose for purpose', 'plot' etc. There is always something that can be taken from movies, it's just a matter of how compelling the reason is, for me to own it in my collection. "Languages ​​of Two Sisters", as they call it when released in my country, has a tremendous feeling and an ultimately (mostly) self-explanatory plot. I love horror movies turning around a house. Titles to remember are "The Other", "The Haunting", "The Haunting of Hell House". This movie will be another good example I will remember. The movie has extremely rich color, in the way the home is decorated, in the clothes that the characters have worn, in the open dusky day-screens that contrast with most horror films, which usually use unsaturated sounds and gloomy surroundings ( think Honogurai mizu no soko kara, Dark Water, which is another show I like) that gives this film is a sense of aesthetics and joy when it is not in its, more gripping moments. The characters are extremely credible. This can be partly attributed to the well-known setting of this movie. Perhaps household problems are easier and easier for me. like the actors to identify with, and the actors bec ome their characters with extraordinary finesse. Directing toys with timelines, to give the audience the pieces in pieces, so that they can reach their own interpretation terms, instead of representing everything linearly. In my opinion, this is a positive aspect of this movie, and perhaps it is my interpretation of this movie that allows me to find it enjoyable. I will definitely watch DVD for that.
