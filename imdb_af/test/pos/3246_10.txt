This movie gives you more ideas on how Australians act. Although the castle is a great Australian movie, it's a little out there. This movie is by far the best Aussie movie I've seen (hasn't seen Dirty Deeds yet) and will probably be my favorite movie. The point is, if you haven't seen it, it'll see. If a crime / action / comedy is your thing.
