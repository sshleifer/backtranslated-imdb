What hurt this movie is everyone and their aunt Matilda compares it to his illustrious predecessor, who will always hurt any show. If you consider it western, this is a good performance. We find out how our characters in 'Lonesome Dove' pop up in the situations they start up (such as: Why are two Texas Rangers living on adventure arriving in a dead town? And how did Gus lose love? Of his life? ) The performances are very good, and we see exactly the same ways the characters will be on the go. The actors did a very good job. The cinematography was wonderful, and although the music was not the legendary score of nearly two decades, it was an impossible task and it was still good. <br /> <br /> It also helped us have three episodes, which you no longer see in a miniature. Heck, it's actually impossible to see a dual telephony today. <br /> <br /> Fans of the western, sorry!
