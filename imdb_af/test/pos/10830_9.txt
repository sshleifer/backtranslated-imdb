In Paris, a few months before the Nazi invasion, the manipulative actress Viviane Denvers (Isabelle Adjani) uses her former beloved Frédéric Auger (Grégori Deràngere) to hide the body of a man murdered by her. Frederic hits the car, death is found and he is sent to prison. When the Germans invade France, Frederic escapes with another prisoner, Raoul (Yvan Attal), and they become friends. In the runaway to Bordeaux, they meet Camille (Virginie Ledoyen), the young assistant of physicist Professor Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehlé), who tries to leave France with his heavy water research. Once in Bordeaux, the group meets Viviane with her new lover, Jean-Étienne Beaufort (Gerard Depardieu), and is being driven by a German spy, journalist Alex Winckler (Peter Coyote), while Paris falls and the population is confused. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful and wonderful romantic adventure "Bon Voyage" is! The excellent and complex script has action, romance, war, comedy, espionage, drama and many characters, played by a fantastic role, indeed a constellation of stars; the direction is beautiful; the music score is wonderful. I really loved this wonderful movie, and I have to complete my review because of my adjectives limitation to describe such a jewel. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Viagem do Coração" ("Journey of the Heart")
