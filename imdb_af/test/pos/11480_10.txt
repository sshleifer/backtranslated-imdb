I see this movie as a complete masterpiece. I see it as Fernando Fragata's best work and undoubtedly the best of all Portuguese films. I don't think you can make such a "zero budget" kind of movie as impressive and amazing as this one. <br /> <br /> The direction is done perfectly with incredibly fast pace and the music also compiled by Fragata is usually excellent. The story is both dirty and humorous at the same time, and it is certainly an advanced study of the old saying "Misery loves company" kind of situations intertwined with a wise mystery. A more than perfect recipe to glue the viewer's eyes to the screen of frame one to the last. <br /> <br /> It's called Neo-Hitchcock, and I agree. Like the best Hitchcocks, I guessed during the whole movie and most of my assumptions were far off, as it eventually turned out to be clever.
