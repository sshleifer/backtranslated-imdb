Pink Flamingos is a movie no word can explain. It was just as good as I thought. It expands films. Starting with a "multiple" start, ending with a shocking but clever end, Pink Flamingos is one of the best films of the year. Don't miss this opportunity to watch a good movie. Rent it on video or watch it at a late midnight as I did. But just watch it.
