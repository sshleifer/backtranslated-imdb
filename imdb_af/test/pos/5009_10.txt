I say remember when and where you saw this show, because I believe Fox is giving Talk Show a chance. Spike will be with Conan within a few years, as Conan is incredibly funny and just grateful to have his own show. that adds humor. <br /> <br /> So far the funniest bits of Spike have been The Idiot Paparatzi and Comedy For Stoners, and if you're not high, you get CFS what it says about you. <br /> <br /> In the summary, this show is 25 minutes less than SNL, so we hope Talk Show gets the attention it deserves, such as an extra half hour, more money and a band.
