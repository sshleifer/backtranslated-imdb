"The man who knew too much" falls into the Hitchcock middle ground that featured many of his films during the 1950s: not a masterpiece of excitement, but a great fun. <br /> <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day play a holiday couple trapped in a plot that is hard on foreign plot. The well-known climactic scene takes place at a classical music concert, where one will be killed during a particular clash of symbols in the score. The fearless Hitchcock obviously lets us know what that point is, so the race to stop the killer becomes a nail bite against the cymbalist. <br /> <br /> So much of this movie reminded me of the 1978 Chevy Chase / Goldie Hawn comedy "Foul Play" that I believe the movie was inspired by. No movie is a big problem, but both are easy to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Degree: B +
