This movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. The dialogue is sharp, the pace is fast. It's not just a smart comedy, it's an interesting look at what's happening behind the scenes in the television news business. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny lines ... some of my favorites: <br /> Ernie Merriman: (sarcastic) It must be nice to always believe you know better , to always think you are the smartest person in the room. Jane: (seriously) NO, it's not, it's terrible !! <br /> <br /> Aaron: He must be pretty. Jane: How do you know that? Aaron: No one invites a bad look to fool their room! <br /> <br /> The performances of Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks and William Hurt were absolutely brilliant! Even years later I remember this movie well. Often forget, the wonderful funny is Joan Cusack! I love the scene where the news personnel race to beat a deadline. There are so many funny scenes that it's hard to choose a favorite. I recommend this movie.
