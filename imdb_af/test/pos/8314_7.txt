This documentary about dinosaurs was undoubtedly fascinating and well made. However, I watched many of the pieces with discomfort. The movie generally had a fair amount of confidence about anything he said, but inevitably much of the behavior of the animals, their interaction with each other, how they looked, how they moved, what they ate, and so much. of course it is guessed - sometimes guessing with reasonable confidence, sometimes just wanted to guess. But the viewer is never made aware of it, but the film suggests actually realizing dinosaurs and their real behavior. It probably makes better performance than confronting the audience with disapproval mountains, but it makes it a little too populist in my estimation.
