Is it full moon tonight? OH! It doesn't matter that they can change when they want that drug cuz! What did I think as his full moon tonight? Geez <br /> <br /> I really like this movie, there's romance, excitement, horror and hot stuff;) I love the first half of the movie when the man saves the girl to kill herself by bungee jumping and catch her. It was really cool. The introduction of this movie is in the city of love that is Paris in France. The cemetery scenes are nice, it gives you cold fever and doesn't know what will happen or who is behind the walls. The scenes that make you jump out of your chair are really cool. Even they got me on those scenes. His friend who died and the girl he'd killed in the cemetery, but still showed himself to the main character (sorry I forgot his name), was really funny. The actors did a good job and the makeup teams did. The part when they all party in a deserted church party, I cannot believe that people would do it, because even though it is a deserted church, it is still God's house. I bought this movie a long time ago and I'm not sorry to buy it. I'm a horror movie lover. I give this movie 5 stars out 6. For those who are open and love movies, try it, you might like it.
