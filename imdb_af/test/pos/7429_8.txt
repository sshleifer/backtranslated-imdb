A young girl becomes a war person's pin, and when he visits the end, someone expects more "available" comic complications. Everyone finally works well, of course, but not before everyone involved, the landscape chewed thoroughly. Errol Flynn's impressive impression of Casphanca's Humphrey Bogart is a highlight, as are various calls from his own swashbuckling image (the "jumping" scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker being a riot). This is Tucker, who drops the movie under his arm "tucks", his head and barrels over the goal line. He demonstrates the comic flair that was developed in F-Troop twenty years later and gives a vibrancy and energy that Flynn repeatedly plays to increase his own performance. Eleanor Parker does a good job if the woman is pursued, and little Patti Brady charms as Tucker's real friend. A good, light-weight "upcoming home" competition in a beautiful setting where children and romantics of all ages will find entertaining.
