"Sir" played Lear more than 200 times, but tonight he can't remember his opening lines. In the mirror, his eyes looked at the king's madness. His dressing room asked him softly and spoke the words. There is an air of despair over both of these men. The great actor who knows that his strength is gone, his valet with great conscience with conscience with a surrogate woman - aware of his boss's decline in madness and knowing he is powerless to do more than make his passing easier. "The Dresser" is really a love story between the two. Over the years, they have become interdependent, to the extent that a future cannot become without others. During the Second World War, it concerned the fate of a first-class second-hand Shakespeare company, consisting of an equal number of chickens and wannabes led by "Sir", a theatrical knight of the "Old School". can be. Whatever he plays, he grabs the centerpiece and bellows over the footlights, closing his audience in applause. But somewhere inside him, most of the time was buried deep under the ham. He shoots out regularly. of its former greatness. It is a glimpse of this that his audiences hope. Mr. A.Finney concentrates a lot on the ham, often up to the caricature. And just when you are ready to dismiss his performance as mere hyperbola and blower, he will produce a moment of beautiful subtlety and vulnerability that will make you realize that a great actor is playing a good actor. The same goes for Mr. T.Courtenay. It is easy to write off his presentation <br /> <br /> of Norman as an exercise in stereotyping. Here we have a middle-aged effeminate rather than camping theater teacher. , enjoy the company of "The Girls" and love the wicked Insider gossip in "The Theater". There were - and I still strongly suspect - lots of men, just like Norman in The Profession.Infinitely child and patient, to learn more about playing than many of the actors, their running background with wisdom and love. I believe the vast majority of them will hear with the approval of the laugh at Mr Courtenay's portrait. I saw "The Dresser" on the London stage, where the Courtenay's "Norman", rather than the movie, dubbed the observable wisdom. "Sir" is by the great Mr. Freddie Jones played to the praise of the audience. was an unforgettable performance by Mr. Courtenay's shadow overshadowed and rather reduced it to a "run" as well as a level billing actor. The idea that "Sir" and "Norman" could be almost incomplete without the window. "Norman" was reduced to his puppet, which I'm not sure Ronald Harwood meant, but made awesome theater. Messrs Finney and Courtenay restored the balance in the film, restoring equality to the relationship. Both men have come a long way since their early appearance in the British "New Wave" pictures, when they became the guts of the vague Lefties, "middle class and ashamed of it". When the British cinema virtually dedicated Hari-Kiri In the 1970s, they quietly concentrated on the theater, apart from some roles to keep the wolf off the door. With the renaissance of more substantial movies, they reappeared and blinked in the unusual bright light. <br /> <br /> "The Dresser" has marked their returns, still shouting with energy and talent. "We're still here." It's not a big movie, but surely a wonderful.
