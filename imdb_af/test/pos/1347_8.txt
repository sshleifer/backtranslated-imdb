My friends and I saw the movie last night in Austin during a show for AGLIFF (a film festival). This movie was one of the best I've seen this year. It was a great comedy - very original and warm - and FUNNY AS HELL! Everyone in the audience laughed at the whole movie. Texas is a great state - with many small towns - and of course many teenagers who grew up as "fat girls." I know many people will relate to this movie on a personal level. Ashley Fink and Robin de Jesus were wonderful - they were so nice in these roles, it was like the writing with them in mind. And speaking of the writing, it was very well written (very credible), and Ash is a good actor (his facial expressions just made me giggle). It's an independent movie - but don't be fooled ... It's a good one! Seeing this caliber work of someone so young is truly inspiring.
