It's a kind of hidden gem. It has little or no promotion, no fanfare, no classic status, and it deserves all of the above! One of the great directors of the theater, Fritz Lang, has created a true gem in this excellent western. A great role led by Randolph Scott (probably one of his greatest performances), the always sturdy Dean Jagger, Robert Young as a surprisingly advanced man and many veteran character actors: Chill Wills, Slim Summerville, John Carradine, Barton MacLane and others in an exciting Zane Gray story of establishing the Western Union cable across the country. It has tense drama, sparks of humor and great effects. It reminds of DeMille in ways and yet Fritz Lang leaves his own seal on it. At least it's a damn good western!
