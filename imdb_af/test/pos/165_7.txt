Three children were born during a solar eclipse and ten years later somehow they grew up without conscience. As their simultaneous tenth birthday celebration approach, they become smart and calculate cold-blooded killers. The friend's local teenager, Joyce Russel (Lori Lethin), finds herself confronting these little horrors when most others fall for their angels. <br /> <br /> Hearing back on movies like "The Bad Seed" and "Village of the Forbidden", this film's portrayal of evil children may not be completely original, but it is quite astonishing. All three of the child's actors - Elizabeth Hoy, Billy Jacoby, and Andy Freeman - are pretty convincing. Director Ed Hunt and his co-author Barry Pearson maintain the unpleasant but compelling mood for the duration of the film; they go so far as to give the girl access to an unreliable viewing program with her older sister (future rise-comedienne and MTV personality Julie Brown, whose striptease is a real eye-catcher). <br /> <br /> Name actors Susan Strasberg, as an icy teacher, and Jose Ferrer, with hardly any screen time as a doctor, add to the proceedings at their presence, while KC Martel, one of the youngsters of the original " The Amityville Horror "is very nice like Joyce's little brother. Other well-known faces such as Ellen Geer, B-movie director Michael Dudikoff, Cyril O'Reilly ("Porky's", "Dance of the Damned"), Joe Penny ("Jake and the Fatman") and William Boyett Hidden ") can also be seen . <br /> <br /> Touching such parental fears as kids playing with guns they've discovered and locked in old fridges is 'Bloody Birthday' a little more than just a slasher variation with kids as antagonists This movie is supported more than some of its brothers in memory, but there are not many people to fall back on (although the arrow works very well through the eye). <br /> <br /> Pale, nasty and indifferent , "Bloody Birthday" is a look at the curious dignity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
