When I went to the video rental shop, I looked back at all the movies at the store I was interested in when the DVD was still unknown. Or so I thought! The man behind the counter told me that he had something I really wanted. He gave me "Plunkett and MacLeane". At first I doubted that it would be good, but I trusted his advice and ... man, I'm sure lucky, I took this jewel! This is one of the best adventure movies in years, if you ask me! Of course, with Robert Carlyle as an important part, how bad can a movie get? Certainly, Liv Tyler does what she is good at and nothing more: be beautiful. But still, you can feel very clearly that the role players have had lots of fun and make this movie.
