It's a beautiful little movie that, like many of its kind, derives its charm from the particular circumstances rather than the actual dialogue. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford shines (as always) into a great comic performance as the penniless Air Force officer, married just one day after the gold-digger showgirl Debbie Reynolds. <br /> <br /> After one initial wedding day of passion and a life-changing move to Spain, the two soon realize that apart from the strong sexual attraction they feel for each other, they have nothing in common. <br /> <br /> But when she decides to give their marriage a chance, it's sensible that it's just one month trial and sex is definitely not on the cards. <br /> <br /> Ford also falls foul of his new $ 40,000 Lincoln Futura Concept Car (the future Batmobile) he wins in a raffle that same evening, he meets his new wife. br /> <br /> The car brings him undesirable attention from the Air Force, which sees it as a vulgar slit of American wealth and brings suspicions of corruption and embezzlement. It also puts it in the 80-90% tax force. He is now busy with a tax account of over $ 17,000. Not the kind of money you have to pay if your wife is the kind of person who spends at a $ 1,000 shopping mall. <br /> <br /> Even when trying to sell it, it causes him to sell so much as a cigarette, or a few socks to the natives are made criminal by the court, so you can imagine that a $ 17,500 deal virtually the coaching team polishing their guns. <br /> <br /> His potential buyer also causes him problems as he is a disgusting, handsome Bull-fighting Spanish nobleman, whose interest in the car resulted in a stronger interest in Ford's wife. He was getting worse by the fact that a rich jet-set lifestyle is being offered and is what she was looking for. long. <br /> <br /> With Ford's sexual frustration rising and jealousy in his love-rival build-up, along with Reynolds's materialistic stance and flirtatious behavior around the enchanted Spaniard that drives the wedge deeper between the two, it seems they stormwind relationship is intended to end. <br /> <br /> But can any love and attraction that these two love birds put together in the first place shine and hold together? <br /> <br /> Not the best example of this movie genre, but because of its striking performances by its principles and enjoyable plot line, it's definitely a good one.
