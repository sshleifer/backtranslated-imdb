I have always been fascinated by ninjistsu, who would know that it goes beyond that. In "Ninja III", it's fun, creepy and intriguing. A Ninja is shot by the police and uses his spirit for revenge. The victim, a beautiful young woman named Christie (Lucinda Dickey). She falls to the police involved in the shooting. The love scene where she threw the V8 on her body poured me out! The ninja's death gets the attention of another in Japan called Yamada (Sho Kosugi). He comes to America, not just to save Christie, but to bring the ninja back to the grave. Simple because he protrudes Yamada's left eye with a shuriken (throwing star). The battle scenes were excellent. I like the part when the plywood falls on Yamada, and it splits it with its foot. And when he was caught, he told the officer Christie was involved, everything would be fine. Thumb Rule: Never treasure a ninja. He pulled out the other police without killing them. And he did his thing without worry. Of course, Chirstie tried her best to put the ninja in place to use her as a revenge tool. It was a great movie, ideal for martial arts buffs. 3 out of 5 stars!
