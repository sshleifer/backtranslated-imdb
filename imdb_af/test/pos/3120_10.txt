For my money, probably the best movie - or at least the most pure movie - ever made Ford. The dialogue is quick, cut, to the point. The story begins at the beginning and ends only with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but guides them and photographs them with a paint and a whip of epic proportions. Grim realistically, warmly amusing, brilliantly acting (Johnsonj couldn't be hard to believe), with the best photography and editing in any American black and white movie. It is very terrible for Sergei Eisenstein's editing technique, but never as cool or loose "scientifically" as Eisenstein often could. And a great musical score. A beautiful panorama of an important and poorly understood episode in American history. <br /> <br /> One small problem: it is not clear why the movie is Mormons, as far as I know, never the pacifists were the Quakers. and Amish was. This confusion leaves a little to taste behind. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is such a festival, it's easy to ignore. In all other ways, a true masterpiece of American cinema to be revived and re-watched (and again and again).
