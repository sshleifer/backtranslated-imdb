This is my favorite game for the Nintendo 64 platform. I have played many different first-person shots, and I have never liked many of them, but this game has a certain thing that I can't rub, which makes it a great fun. Perhaps this is the extraordinary detail in the game. Maybe it's the fluid movement of the characters. Maybe it's the gadgets and weapons. Maybe it's the pure character of James Bond. Whatever it is, it never seems to be getting old, no matter how many times I played it.
