It was Charlie Chaplin's first all-talking movie. Yes, there was a bit of sound and talk included in his previous film, MODERN TIMES, but it was still a silent movie. So, it was only in 1940 that the public heard Chaplin's talk on film. <br /> <br /> The movie is incredibly famous and has a star reputation. While enjoying the movie, I was almost not so impressed with this as Chaplin's other full-length movies from the mid-20s and 30s. That's because I had a lot of Chaplin's dull exaggeration when he played Adenoid Hynkel - especially when he gave his speeches. The silly pseudo-dialogue just looked like something a minor comedian would want to use (like the Three Stooges). In addition, it is difficult to play a funny Hitler. <br /> <br /> But when Chaplin played the Jewish hairdresser, he wasn't very funny (he wasn't really meant to be a funny character) but he was a tremendous voice for reason and decency. This film should not be remembered as a comedy (especially as it doesn't really shine there), but for its excellent acting and humanity. The last speech of the hairdresser (Hynkel) is brilliant and has almost brought tears to my eyes. Just look at the movie for this reason.
