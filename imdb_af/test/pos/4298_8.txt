SEPARATE LIES is such an elegant, intelligent and thought-producing movie and I could have watched Tom Wilkinson on the screen forever. The places in the English countryside, the wonderful London places, the interiors, the smart wardrobe and of course the writing and dialogue made SEPARATE LOVE an exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> Having said that, and maybe it's just an American view, as the British are so much more sophisticated in dealing with sexual escape, I found it hard to see Tom Wilkinson just stand , because his wife is happy on her way in a sexual journey that brings her very little joy. despair for her husband, with the cad that Rupert Everett is. Yes, I saw the shortcomings of Wilkinson's character - his pursuit of perfection, the desire for everything in his place - but in Emily Watson she had to investigate the true character and solid goodness in depth to realize what she had thrown away. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson makes SEPARATE LIES in a powerful movie by seeing him experiencing all the pain, embarrassment and despair on the screen as his wife goes with another man. And he himself made the journey in SEPARATE LIES by understanding his mistakes, embracing his wife, despite everything going on and leading her back to London. Bravo, Tom!
