- A group of convicts rob a train of the gold dispatch it carries. In their escape, the convicts split. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden becomes dead before he can talk. Three men have another part of the "clue" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit and the bounty hunter work together to find the missing booty? Or will they kill each other first? - The plot is a clear start from Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Various scenes in the movie are also lifted from other films by Leone, Corbucci, and more. But for me this is done in a way that does not show respect for the original work. Instead, Any Gun can play lovingly parodies some of the greatest films in the Spaghetti Western history. The opening scene of three men driving in the village and the final face between the three main stars is a wonderful tribute to the SWs who came before. <br /> <br /> - Castellari adds very nice touches of his own - the reflection in the spilled wine, the stranger's entrance with the bright red background and the playful way the gold is finally discovered. Although very unbelievable, a lot of the battle scenes have been performed and directed. Two battle scenes in particular (the market fight and the bathhouse battle) are done very nicely. He is also not afraid to try different things with his camera. Strict close-ups, overhead shots and shots around corners are common in Any Gun Can Play. <br /> <br /> - Another plus is the role Castellari had to work. George Hilton is always good in these movies. Gilbert Roland literally plays Gilbert Roland. And SW newcomer Edd Byrnes holds his own with the two SW veterans. Supporting role-players, including SW regular Gerard Herter. <br /> <br /> - Any Gun Can Play shouldn't be taken too seriously. Nice signs of humor can be found throughout the film. If it's possible with a SW, it's more of a "feel good" movie - much reminiscent of some of the Terence Hill / Bud Spencer movies.
