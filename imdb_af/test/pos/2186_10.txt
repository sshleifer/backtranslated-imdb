I saw this play on Showtime a few years back in the comfort of my home and when the final note was hit, I wanted to jump off the bench and give the production a standing ovation. As it was, I dropped a tear that it was such a bunch of great performances and songs. For my birthday my kids bought me the VHS version, as well as the play CD with Len Cariou in the Sweeny Todd role. <br /> <br /> I shared the play with many ... some to find the topic a bit sick, but no one has anything but praise for the songs. <br /> <br /> I've always loved the interaction in songs with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn as well as Hearn and Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin. <br /> <br /> I need to own the DVD.
