Aparna Sen's 15 Park Avenue is a film about the nature of reality. <br /> <br /> A young fiancee who tends to present things and hear voices, perhaps out of sheer boredom, is considered a schizophrenic by her educated father and controlled parent step sister. Controlled, pitied and treated like an invalid (even if it is from love and love), she has a chance to develop as a normal person. When a boy offers to marry her, her father and step sister try to persuade him to take such a step. A traumatic experience, mainly due to her sheltered existence, eventually takes her over the path of no return, and she lives full-time in a heartbreaking world of her own. <br /> <br /> The family and society around her are intolerant of her delusions, and want to suppress them with medicine, electric shock therapy, anything, though they all have some sort of disorder. <br /> <br /> Her mother doesn't see the irony of allowing a ghostbuster to treat her from the delusions. Her step-sister is a professor of physics, including teaching Quantum Mechanics, a subject in which a stream of experts accepts parallel multi-universes and many more dimensions in space than the 3 we see. A friend tells with admiration an experience with a holy person claiming hallucinating voices. Far away, George W. Bush has real or false fraud of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, and may invade Iraq. <br /> <br /> As some viewers have already pointed out, Aparna Sen has chased away the attack of the mother of all the delusion-stream religions, which is a pity. <br /> <br /> In other words, the accepted reality is what a majority or an influential minority believes. This has been the case since the beginning, and many more powerful people than Mithali in the movie, including Bruno and Galileo, have suffered as a result. <br /> <br /> The film's controversial and difficult ending was needed to show that it is a film about the nature of reality, not the case study of a schizophrenic girl. <br /> <br /> All the role-players performed well, but Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma performed extremely well. Aparna Sen made an excellent philosophical film.
