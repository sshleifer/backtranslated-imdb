This movie is on my top 20 comedies list. It's a unique movie. To the reviewer who said "I really must miss something." - You're right. You miss something. If you don't have that kind of humor, it's one thing. But don't give it a bad review, because you think it's "looney," but isn't meant to be. Loony is a suitable description of both what it plans and what it manages to be. I laughed much more and more intensely into this movie than I do with most other funny films. <br /> <br /> Michael Almereyda took the best in his role in his first major film, for which he was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for the best first feature. Crispin Glover, as usual, is absolutely brilliant in a very inexplicable way, and some of his very funniest lines have ever been mentioned in this movie. Glover is clearly the best comic actor now working. Harry Dean Stanton introduces an excellent comic show. William Burroughs is incredibly small. Dylan McDermott is ideally thrown, and Lois Chiles is absolutely excellent. <br /> <br /> All of the above are perfectly fun in their own perfect way, but it is one of Crispin's best performances - there with his performances in River's Edge and Willard. If you're a Crispin Glover fan, but somehow overlooked this movie, stop what it is you do and see it right away. <br /> <br /> Just remember to relax first, and maybe have a beer or something. It's a good movie, but it's very unusual, and I recommend setting up or watching a pretty crazy state of mind.
