Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better movie-based recipe than I could. What I usually remember is that it was just as beautiful, in all respects - emotional, visual, editorial - just beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you love movies that are great to watch and also have emotional content about what that beauty is, I think you'll have seen this extraordinary and unusual artwork. <br /> <br /> On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it an 8.75. The only reason I stay away from 9 is that it is a tuning piece. If you're in the mood for a very artistic, very romantic movie, then it's a 10. I definitely think it's a must-see, but none of us can always be in that mood, so overall 8,75 .
