During World War II, two Byelorussian (Soviet) soldiers are attempting to be captured by Nazis while searching through the snow terrain, seeking food and safety. If you don't like black and white "strange" movies, you can still enjoy "Voskhozhdeniye". Director Larisa Shepitko surprisingly surprised the film, despite being a largely introspective piece of work. Her unfortunate death, in a car accident, unfortunately has this. Shepitko's final film made. <br /> <br /> Once the opening mission has been declared, it doesn't seem like much in the snow forests, but Shepitko and a changing environment make it unexpectedly exciting. Leading players Vladimir Gostyukhin (such as the spiritually wounded Rybak) and Boris Plotnikov (as the physically wounded Sotnikov ") successfully avoid the ever-increasing symbolism. Their allegorical actions, under Shepitko's sharp direction, offer an unforgettable and thought provocation a well-known story. <br /> <br /> ******** Voskhozhdeniye (4/2/77) Larisa Shepitko ~ Vladimir Gostyukhin, Boris Plotnikov, Lyudmila Polyakova, Anatoli Solonitsyn
