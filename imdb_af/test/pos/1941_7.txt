I think it's a pretty good movie, but one thing makes it very interesting to me. It's blatantly obvious when you look at it: the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bulls on The Simpsons. Layne is Jimbo, John is Kearney, and Tony is Dolph. There is even an episode of The Simpsons where Jimbo uses the line: "I hit her with a stick." <br /> <br /> The Jimbo-Layne connection is obvious with the knitted hat and long hair and the voice. Kearney has the shaved head, unlike John, but is the big, stupid man. The Tony-Dolph connection is pretty obvious with the long, separate hairstyle and even the second-level status.
