My taste in movies remains astonished and probably readers of my reviews, but for each one their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and Sea No Evil happen exactly that and more !! I think the biggest mistake made by manufacturers and filmmakers of this movie is that they hype it as a WWE movie and "starring". WWE can have a big following, but it is a very, very specific group that follows the incredible cheesy and (sorry) kind of trailer sport and those who don't love it hate it! This will get them away from an otherwise typical gory slasher flick that people would come out of the forest to see. See No Evil does not break any new horror ground, it plays exactly the game of the typical horror with some of the frightening, terrifying bloody scenes that make your screen honest. They really drive it home and go for free violence. There is no psychological aspect, though it is being rushed through this monster, there are fear elements to it. <br /> <br /> KANE (wrestler), also known as Glen Jacobs, plays religious and physically tortured man Jacob Goodnight. He is the ultimate cross between Leatherface and Jason Voorhees. He is not an original killer and even his shooting is not really for the unique or original, with the exception that a girl is killed by forcing her to swallow her cellphone ... yeeeeah !! He does a good job and the man is really huge! He stands at 7 feet tall and without any special effects it is monstrous !! Tiffany Lamb, Penny McNamee, Samantha Noble, Michael J. Pagan, Luke Pegler, Christina Vidal, Rachael Taylor play the typical group of "think they are invincible" party teens who will be reluctant to hit the serial killer. The story is that in exchange for a month of detention for small crimes ranging from theft to drug possession, they are sent to an old hotel to do community service by settling it. It seems that a serial killer lives upstairs and he removes his eyes from the victims to clear their sins. Luke Pegler stands out as a scum bag that eventually becomes a hero who even saves his former friend who he used to store. The rest of them all play their perspective roles, but it's not a big record of acting ability. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, porn director ... yes PORN ... Gregory Dark, do a good job along with the contemporary shooter movie. He even goes with the killer in a little history and although his back story is not unique, it's actually a bit outdated, it's still interesting enough. And in the few shots where the filmmaker actually sees through the murderer's eyes, it's interesting to hear the voices and see things that are distorted like him. He throws the mandatory soft-core nudge, and the grotesque, blood-soaked scenes, and turns everything on a notch. It fits nicely and for a horror fan like me it's entertaining. Kane's serial killer is frightening and he bumps them all with brutal intelligence and silent horror. The movie is breaded and snapped and I don't blame anyone because it's pretty crazy, but isn't that the point? It's a horror movie and I thought that's exactly what it should be. It made me jump, it cut me, it even made me spin in several places ... impressive by any standards. It's entertaining, with a decent story, and much of the set up to serialize Sea No Evil to the 15th installment if they wanted to and I say bring it up !! It is true that the movie is full of plot holes, ridiculous details, but the deadly gore and horror about it all. It's all about loving horror movies? Really love them ?? If so, then you will think it is a tremendous treasure ... if not ... you hate it ... simply and simply. 8.5 / 10
