I went in "Night of the Hunt", not knowing what to expect. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> It's essentially a mystery where this girl, who can't remember, is 'saved' by a man driving past. The two become quick friends and lovers and together they try to find out what is happening to her. Through some vague flashbacks and grim memories, they eventually reach the bottom and the end is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy the introduction of this one: a deserted, postmodern Paris is the backdrop of many gray skies and tall buildings. Many metropolitan. Groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity. <br /> <br /> It was surprisingly made in 1980; looks somewhat ahead of time. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, kids.
