I saw this movie in Santa Monica on August 23 and it stayed with me. I want to thank the filmmakers for digging Harry's enigmatic, eccentric life. And also for the mistakes and failures of Nilsson the man. Thank you for having the good and the bad, the ups and downs, and uncovering the amazing BBC footage. The film is also a great representation of a large amount of Nilsson's music, really well placed by the movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good documentaries, especially if you are interested in Harry Nilsson or the music scene of the early 70's. Some reviewer on the website Is not It Cool wrote that it was the best movie movie they saw at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and I believe it. The film is informative, funny, sad, touching and full of music. It succeeds at all levels. Really, very good.
