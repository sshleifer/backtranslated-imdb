Now it's classic. A friend of mine told me about this movie and said it was incredibly lame, stupid, delayed and moronous. He also said I liked it. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I found it available from netflix and rented it simultaneously. I'm just shocked that I've never heard of it. If I could give it an eleven, I would. <br /> <br />
