In 1794, the second year of the French Republic, formed after the execution of Louis XVI, this film depicts the power struggle between revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu and his best) and Robespierre (a striking performance by Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak). The moderate revolutionary Danton returned to Paris from his country seat where he has been deposited by the team of the Public Security Committee's railroad leader for the past year. He is opposed to "The Reign of Terror" which led to the executions of thousands of citizens, mainly by guillotine, who are thought to be against the Revolution. Danton is confident of the support of ordinary people and is trying to convince Robespierre to curb blood loss. But Robespierre and the committee are worried that Danton's popularity will lead to being overthrown, and rightly put Danton and his supporters to be traitors. It was the first French language film that Andrzej Wajda made after arriving in France from Poland. His Polish film company was closed by the government because of its support to the Solidarity trade union, which was opposed by the Polish government in the late seventies and early eighties. In his previous film Man of Iron (1981), the Solidarity Union and its leader Lech Walesa acted. Comparisons between Wales and the Polish leader, General Jaruselski, and those between Danton and Robespierre are easy to compare. Danton / Walesa is the voice of reason for Robespierre / Jaruselski who continues dictatorial rule despite the support of the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish play "The Danton Affair" written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s. The film was criticized by critics for being static and theater. But what the film does is to concentrate on the back-screen meetings of the committees and screens in the National Assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of Paris.
