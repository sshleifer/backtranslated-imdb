It would be a pity if you had to look for more speeding, whether it was dipped or underboard (I prefer the print version (which is rare) because it was funny ... in a good way. What is great about speeding is that you are never too old to see it. go red and yellow! I only saw it when I was about seven and heard the pleasant opening. It has disappeared for some time and I've seen it a few months ago (I'm 19). Imagine the feeling of nostalgia coming in the song, singing "here he comes, here comes speed racket! He is a demon on wheels ~~~" over and over. Anyway, the concept of the machine 5 has created so many 'ultra-multi-function special cars', but no one could exceed its genius in construction. The other cars looked just too much. And it wasn't just the games or the battle between different bosses that made it interesting to me. it was racer-x's mystery persona and how the world of speed racket pretty much "happened" to turn it around. they tackled a few story lines of the manga, but it did all well. although I can't remember if the show actually revealed how racer-x looks, in the manga they did it.
