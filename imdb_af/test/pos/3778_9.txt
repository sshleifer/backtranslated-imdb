This film was one of three that was later combined by Chapin in a composition released in the late 1950s to the theaters entitled "The Chaplin Review". <br /> <br /> It was a strange movie in some ways, because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his movies emphasized peace and brotherhood. This film, by contrast, is a propaganda comedy intended to strengthen US efforts in WWI. It's really strange to see Charlie as the "super soldier", who takes 13 Germans with one hand, careless and cool in seconds as a shooter, and then goes behind the enemy lines to catch the Kaiser himself ! Surely this was an important departure for the Little Tramp, though at the same time it was very entertaining and funny. The movie is exceptionally good, well made and I certainly did a lot to support home troops at home (too badly it was a useless and expensive war).
