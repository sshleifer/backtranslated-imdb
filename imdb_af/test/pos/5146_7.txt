My family (two 40-somethings, an 8-year-old and my 71-year-old mother) saw a preview on April 29. We all enjoyed the movie very much. The story was a good one, and knowing it's based on real-life events made it so much better. Luke Wilson was a hoot (pun intended) to watch like Tim Blake Nelson. And since Neil Flynn is playing something different than "the average Scrubs keeper," it was nice. The children in the movie did well and I'm sure they would all call for a certain demographic on the heart. The footage was just great and Jimmy Buffet music added to the "Florida feel". OK, maybe the story was a little too neat and well packed for some adults, but hey, who cares? I can't compare it to the book, I didn't honestly hear it until the movie came out. <br /> <br /> It was just a NICE movie and it had a good message. Flat and simple.
