I neglected this movie when I went to the movie shop, but then the curiosity came to me and I decided to check it out. I loved it !!! The movie starts with Judy and Jay heading for a Halloween party at the abandoned cemetery Hull House. Then we meet some characters, Angela and Suzzanne (hosts), Frannie, Max, Rodger, Sal and Helen. Then of course they start and when they're really in the mood, they decide to have a seance that awakens a devil. The devil owns Angela and she starts her gruesome battle. Will they survive the Night of the Demons. <br /> <br /> The movie was overall good. The gore was good, but the nakedness of Linnea Quigley (Trash from ROTLD) screwed it back. I have never been a fan of her and will never be.
