All you can ever hope for is a Jackass fan. As always, Knoxville and his crew are life and limbs, just for our entertainment. If you are a fan of the series and of the first movie, you won't be lowered as most successors often do. The jokes they've done twice as funny, cruel, inflexible as ever before and the stunts & dares are twice as rough as any Jackass episode you've ever seen. If you don't waste a fan time, it goes out by itself, because on the Jackaass standards, this movie is an easy 10 out of 10 just for opening credits alone. I can't go into detail without spoilage, but you have to believe it.
