Ironically, what makes John Carpenter's "The Thing" such an entertaining sci-fi movie is his genre-defining elements of mystery, tension and tight plot structure. It shamed so-called "Aliens" or "Armageddon", facing the appearance of the viewer with special effects, while turning plots around stunts turning the butchers into laws of physics, testosterone-loaded one-liners, heroes with enough artillery to defeat Iraq and pathetic efforts to screen "meaning" on the screen with "emotional rows" that only serve to insult the intelligence of the audience. Of course, the highest tragedy is that these types of lobotomized films are also the most popular. I think there is a cause for this, though not very comforting. There is an increasing tendency in our culture to passively "surrender" to the media - to immerse in the images we see without using a single brain to understand the theorem that is trying to make the work. This mindset is becoming increasingly dominant in all arenas; even the like-minded media is thinned, thanks to the horrific reader response theory that permeates our schools and the tabloid brigade, reflecting our magazine racks whose mentality appears to be the once-off venerable mainstream press. Nowadays, we just turn the switch and put our minds on "pause." Is "The Thing" a "good" movie? For the rare individual who is still his faculty of reason, a more appropriate term would be "entertaining". His plot keeps one guessing, his end is uncompromising, and it has some redeeming statements to make about human paranoia. Subsequent views start a striking lack of depth in the play, but the sturdy story remains compelling. Of course, "Citizen Kane" it's not, but then sci-fi is never a thinker's genre ...
