Colonel Chabert is one of the best adaptations of the novel to the screen I saw in the movies. It combines the realism of the French film with excellent characterization, from Depardieu's lost Chabert to Fabrice Luchini's proud lawyer to Fanny Ardant's complex widow. The movie has a wonderful dimension, as you would expect from a top-of-the-range kinographer like Yves Angelo. The characters keep this movie in gear and although it's a bit slow in the beginning, pick up the pass and be a fine movie by the time it reaches the finish.
