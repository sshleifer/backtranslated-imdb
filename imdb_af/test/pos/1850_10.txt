I saw this movie with my mom and I loved it! It was such a lovely story, (Not funny because of the supporting role!) They never make movies like this ... ever! My favorite is when Grace (Minnie Driver) finds out about her boyfriend's wife's death, and that she has the deceased's wife, and she shouts, "WHAT GOD'S THINK?" I believe everyone (no matter who you believe) has such thoughts once in a while. But while it is very juicy, it can only make you believe in true love and destiny. (Soak) <br /> <br /> The comic timing between Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi will just crack you (especially in the aforementioned scene, it's terrible, and yet so funny!). They make a good pair, and I hope to see them again soon. 10/10 stars
