Fascinating and amusingly bad, Lights of New York is the first all-talkie feature and one that has hardly ever seen the light of day. <br /> <br /> Two naive herders (Eddie and Gene) from outside the town get involved with shooters and end a talk. When a policeman is shot by one of the boaters, the police begin to shut in, and the Hawk (who fired the officer) decides to fix Eddie's murder and ask his henchman to drive him. make. But it is the Hawk himself who takes the bullet in a twist that will surprise little. <br /> <br /> Shooting in one week at a cost of $ 23,000, "Lights" was originally intended as a two-reel, but Foy took advantage of Jack Warner's absence to extend it to six. When Warner discovered it, he ordered Foy to cut it back to the original card. Only when an independent exhibitor offered $ 25k for the film, Warners actually watched the movie, which made a staggering $ 1.3m. <br /> <br /> Now, it sees a very hokey piece, with acting ranging from the wise (Eugene Pallette) to convey (Eddie's Ouma in a particularly elevated scene) and much of the game is on the level of Vaudeville. Since it's an early talkie (4 parties preceded it), it's about all the characters, and very slow on it. The writing feels improvised, visual style is non-existent (apart from the shooting scene being done in silhouette) and screens sneaking unmistakably. Title cards are interchangeable, redundantly announcing characters and locals. <br /> <br /> Despite all these "lights" is a compelling experience, as we look at actors and crew who are struggling with alien technology and the changing film forever. /> <br /> Catch it if you can
