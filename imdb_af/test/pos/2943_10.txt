I don't like to watch movies while still in theaters due to high ticket prices, but I've seen a poster for some things that stay and I thought, "that young actress looks intelligent and secretive, not like the ordinary blonde teenager not BS ". So I decided to take the dive and see this movie on the opening night. <br /> <br /> I must tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this movie without any expectations. I didn't really know what it was all about, but Katie Boland's raw emotion and honest teenage experiences made me happy with my decision. Alberta Watson also did a fantastic job as the role of Tamara's sick mother and I must also add that I was very impressed with the comic style of Megan Park as Tamara's friend, Brenda. <br /> <br /> Gail Harvey's film is a great movie, and has come together in the kitschy 50's way of making you feel warm and happy, even if the storyline doesn't tend to be as constructive. I also thought the movie was well shot, and many beautiful images of a 1950's landscape will remain in my mind for weeks. <br /> <br /> This film as a whole was peculiar and wonderful. I found it to be unpredictable and although the story ends in a somewhat open way, I am still left satisfied. Whether you're looking for a fun but powerful comedy story, or just want to recall life in the 1950s, I guarantee this movie is for you. Even if you have no expectations, it's still likely you'll be most impressed. Give this one a shot!
