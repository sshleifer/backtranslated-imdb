I have never seen "American Werewolf in London", but this movie was very entertaining. When I rented it, I thought it was a horror movie, but it was more of a comedy with some horror aspects. I thought the transformation sequences were done well, but effects effect, the best scenes were those where the effects and the lighting built each other. The transformations reminded me of many werewolf transformations in other movies, but the werewolves themselves are very dear and not many dogs. Gore: I believe there is too much in this movie, which really takes away the horror, when every frame has blood in it, and the violence takes seriously, is difficult. <br /> <br /> J.Hurst (8th grade)
