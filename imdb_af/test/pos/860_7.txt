I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date, this is one of my favorites. The story was excellent, although the turn at the end was too predictable and I knew what would happen too soon. Usually when that happens, the movie is spoiled for me (like "The Others"), but even to know the outcome, I still enjoyed it to the end. Looking at others' comments, many people were impressed with the performance of Kelly Overton (Eva), I'm afraid I was. Her performance was the weak part of the film, as opposed to James Haven's great achievement (or characterization) (Don Wake). I hope we see him more. What a great movie, highly recommended for everyone!
