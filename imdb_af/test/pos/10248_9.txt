You want a movie that will take your places? Well, it's a good choice. If you were an adolescent in the era depicted in this movie - Motown High Day - or if you want to come back and see what your parents have made so much noise, I suggest you pick up this movie and give it a watch . At the risk of sounding clicks, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll remember and remember. You go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight. You will remember with love your best friends of the school. It's a good movie with a fringe of anxiety and pain and realism - misconceptions, losing friends and deciding what to do with your life. I think everyone, regardless of race, age, socio-economic status, can pull something of this movie and really enjoy it. So take a few hours out of a lazy day and watch this movie; There are many worse ways to spend your time.
