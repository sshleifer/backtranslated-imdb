Here's another pleasant surprise. When I hear a movie, it is made again. Movies like Gone in Sixty Seconds, and The Day of the Jackal, are made again and results are less than stars. So, when I heard that the Italian Job had been restarted, I expected it to be bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I had the opportunity to calm down, read some reviews and finally see the movie, and have been proven wrong. Granted, it's not original and predictable, but it's definitely fun. From start to finish you are taken on one very fun ride. The screens with the Minis are great, and the characters enjoy themselves. <br /> <br /> So, though there are bugs, who care as long as it's fun? <br /> <br /> Overall, 8 out of 10. The only points lost are perhaps the few details and a slight lack of realism. But you'll have so much fun, you won't even have a chance to quit.
