I'm sick of the series with young and clueless people, and always talk about their "problems", self-centered, boring and absolutely annoying (Popular; Dawson's Creek; Beverly Hills; etc.). "Hack" is a fresh air, with a great actor (David Morse), a completely different plot, credible people with real problems (thank God!) And very, very good history. I love it! I hope "Hack" is going on for a long time, because it's a big adult TV series, for a change.
