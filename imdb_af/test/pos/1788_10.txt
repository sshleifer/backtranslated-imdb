After the successful success of MY NAME, BARBRA, CBS television allowed Barbra to create an even more elaborate sequel than her second special. Streisand knew wisely to follow BARBRA in the pioneering success of MY NAME, that her second specialist must indeed raise the crown even more in ingenuity and spectacle. Not surprisingly, she passed again. Even more impressive, Streisand succeeded in storing this great production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of MY NAME BARBRA. <br /> <br /> Once again, the special is divided into three different acts. Filming in the Bergdorf Goodman store was so successful in the first special, that Streisand and the company decided to roll back into place for the first act of this second special. The definite place this time was the Philadelphia Art Museum, which allowed endless chances for Barbra to enter various artworks that match the songs being performed. In addition to the numerous artistic possibilities that made this place possible, the museum offers the ideal opportunity to take advantage of color filming. <br /> <br /> Following the recording of "Draw Me a Circle" set against The Opening Credits, Barbra, breaks the museum into a slave costume to the tribes of Kern and Harbach's "Yesterdays". She stops admiring various paintings and statues, often becoming the character depicted and singing a thematically appropriate song. Streisand performs a bittersweet version of Hammerstein and Romberg's "One Kiss" as Thomas Eakin's CONCERT SINGER, delivers a hilarious campy performance of Chopin's "Minute Waltz" such as Marie Antoinette, embraces abstract art with the frenetic rhythm of Peter Matz's "Gotta Move" and performs a devastating version of "Non C'est Rien" as a disturbed Modigliani girl. However, the highest point of Law I is when Streisand compares profiles with the bust of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti, while singing a tournament of Rogers and Hart's "Where or When". The Law II circus missive allows Streisand to communicate with various farm and circus animals, while singing several songs with farm / circus / animal themes. Some highlights include Barbra singing as a pig singer, the "Sam, You Made The Pants To Long", sang to a baby elephant. group of baby penguins, and Barbra compares profiles with an anteater while crooning "We have so much in general." Streisand also swayed on a trapeze and jumped from a trampoline to the chorus of "Spring Again", and then delayed it by a haunting version of "I met too long at the Fair" while sitting alone on stage. . Barbra also gets the opportunity to point out her pet herd Sadie in this segment, and even speak a little French. <br /> <br /> The Law III concert is again the highest point of the hour. Dressed in a slender white wool dress, the concert segment is presented in a unique design with a partial staircase that doesn't lead anywhere. Streisand opens the Act with a sultry performance by Harold Arlen's "Anyplace I Hang My Hat Is Home", before entering the hearty versions of the well-known standard "It Must Be You" and the rare "C'est Si Bon" So good. "Streisand then amazes the public with a breathtaking, powerful, octave-up performance of the Sweet Charity ballad" Where I Going ", of which Streisand's definitive version of Streisand also presents the newly-written Richard Maltby, Jr. -David Shire Ballad, "Start Here, Starting Now", featuring a passionate voice from Streisand that falls under the best vocal performances of her long career. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, Color Me Barbra was a showcase for Streisand's ever-increasing, mega-watt strength, and despite the presence of even more visual razzle blinds, Streisand is always the main attraction, her voice sounding as beautiful as ever, and this special was the first to show how strikingly his pictures depict in color. As with MY NAME, BARBRA, COLOR ME BARBRA was another rating-smash and created another Top-Five, Gold-selling soundtrack album. Simply put, COLOR ME BARBRA disregards tradition and emerges as a sequel that is almost equal to a classic original.
