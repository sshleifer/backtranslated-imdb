I just looked at another comment posted here, in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this movie use the body of their dead friend. One who is overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most disturbing of them all, no surprise that is what the crocus glover's character (layne) does. He is excited about one of his friends killing another friend of his, the murderer's friend. Not because Layne didn't like this individual, rather he was excited about her death because it gave him something to do. this poor boy is bored in life, and dead inside, that a murdered friend is something to get excited about, because it gives him something to focus on.
