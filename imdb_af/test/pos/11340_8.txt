For a long time I didn't know again. I like this movie or not. It's surprising because I usually know, but because the film didn't go anywhere, I was a little confused. <br /> <br /> Two people are moving in a somewhat common household environment. To keep their spouses constantly working or going away on business trips, watch their attention, from pure loneliness, to one another. After a platonic love affair, Tony Leung Chiu's male guidance revealed that he was a mistress. Su Li-Zehn, played by Maggie Cheung, is hurt, even though their love affair is not physically accomplished. Chiu leaves the country, only to come back later when everything has changed. <br /> <br /> For the synika's part, the movie is correct. By never touching the part of love or actually, but just approaching it, the film says more than so many others on the subject. It is also true, I think, that nothing could have been good if they did. At least it's the feeling I get. <br /> <br /> However, if we have to believe it, Garica Marquez writes that "... love is a status of mercy, not the means for nothing but the alpha and the omega, an end in itself," then fall this movie miserable short of it, just like everyone else. Or if you're prone to totally incomplete minimalism, hit it right. What movies in history have reached, approached or sustained, if only for a short while? My honest feeling in memory is about two. When Harry With Sally effectively suggests this romantic perfection; and the getting is all just to get there. Interestingly, in the case of Harry Met Sally, this is done in the course of wooing, rather than in reaching it. Can't anyone tell anyone about love after it has been reached by two individuals? Nicholas Spark's recent movie The Notebook may come closer to this than any other movie; should we believe that once love is reached, it will only fly from the radar to perfectly fit in another dimension, or, more likely, will latent vehicle be for other purposes? <br /> <br /> In the Mood for Love is an honest movie, with a beautiful and generous film art worthy of all the best Almodovar offers, but everything that it eventually says is that life is Sometimes like this. "Now it's not a difficult thing to say, especially if it is said well, but the problem really comes to the end of the last act when Kar Wai Wong is trying to round the film for a second time only. wider historical theme that plays in the background of the recently-established relationship, which is a worthy effort, and the variation on the music motif played by the film is quite brilliant, but the theme's relative savings performance is too small to much more than a superficial effect on the holistically inclined audience, so the viewer can divide the divide, disagree, an error in any movie, a director must know where he is going and how to get there. Honesty is just the wrong turn, but, as anyone knows, it's just a significant imperfection to spoil the perfect barrel of honey. <br /> <br /> However, the effort is definitely worth trying out. expand historical theme and film you It too round and elevate it above the micro-meaning of the couple, but without any real shadow, it is the critical mistake. In a word and unfortunately it is too late. I also think too much of a challenge for the non-Asian viewer who is not familiar with China's history of fully appreciating this terrible stroke.
