(Some Spoilers) In the early 1930s educational film about the horrors of getting a social illness and its consequences: blindness madness losing the ability to function as well as infecting other people with it, even the unborn children and finally death. "Damaged Life" is far from the time to educate its viewers about the dangers of Venereal Deasise. Being seen for over 70 years after it was released in 1933, is so good, if not better, then the many films on the subject are back in the 1940s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> Donald Bradley, Lyman Williams, is a senior executive of a major shipping company who has been studying for some time with his girlfriend, Joan, Diane Sinclair. Both were eventually planned to marry and set up a family. From an evening at a party, Donald Elsie Cooper, Charlotte Merriam, meets and they drink too much and before they know, they come together in Elsie's house. <br /> <br /> Think nothing about his one night with Elsie Donald marrying her long-time love Joan and planning to have both children, or so they thought. At the office, Donald gets a panicking call from Elsie to tell him to come to her place immediately for something very important. Rushing about Donald finds out of his horror that Elsie has a sexual infection she received from her boyfriend Nat, Harry Myers, and that she gave it to Donald, and that he had infected his wife, Joan. To tell Elsie that she's wrong about being infected and getting medical attention. Elsie shoots herself like Donald goes away soon. <br /> <br /> To get over Elsie's tragic death, Donald gets another surprise later on when his doctor, Dr. Bill Hill, Jason Robards Sr., comes to his office and says he should come to the hospital with him immediately to speak to Infectious Disease Specialist Dr Vincent Leonard, Murray Kinnell, about his wife, Joan, who was just admitted there. The terrible truth about Donald and his wife, Joan, strikes him like a bolt out of the blue and leaves him speechless just as Joan did earlier. Both are infected and the infection is the dreaded and unspeakable, back in the 1930s, infection called venereal disease. <br /> <br /> Leonard said it would take a few years for Donald and Joan to be completely healed. This leaves Joan in a state of dangerous suicidal thoughts. Later in the film, Joan, felt that she had nothing to live on, all the windows in her and Donald's apartment closed and the gas stove, full blast, to kill her and Donald who was asleep at the time. <br /> <br /> Honest movie about the destruction of the sexually transmitted diseases and the damage to those who are infected by it, both psychologically and spiritually, and how it can be cured if it receives immediate medical care, rather than sting keep it away from your doctor and keep it hidden, for fear of shame and embarrassment, until it's too late.
