When Wallace and Gromit erupted on the scene in their academy's award-winning Grand Day Out, they created a new new look at clay. After another two shorts, Aardman's dynamic duo returned for this enjoyable and entertaining movie. It has an excellent voice, humorous jokes and good animation just as Aardman can do! <br /> <br /> In this movie, Wallace and Gromit run "Anti-Pesto," a rabbit removal company. When a word "Were-Rabbit" comes out, eat all the vegetables in the village, come up with a madness. Of course, Victor Quartermaine, the city's attractive, toupee brandishing hunter, wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the beautiful Lady Tottington ... but can save our favorite Aardman duo the day before chaos occurs? <br /> The jokes, I have to say, were hilarious. One point, the villain, Victor Quartermaine's fascinating crack, showed that a character exclaimed: "BEWARE ... THE MOON !!!" Vintage Earthman! <br /> <br /> The characters are sharp and hilaries. Our favorite Man and Dog Aardman team will entertain us if only they can, they earn their second Oscar (remember a Grand Day Out?). Helena Bonham Carter was great as the lovely Lady Tottington, Wallace's love interest. Ralph Fiennes was especially funny and pre-warring as the cunning, portable hunter Victor Quartermaine. But the one who really stole the show was the priest, whose fianc√© was a spectacular comic relief. <br /> <br /> Hats off to Aardman for creating another Wallace and Gromit masterpiece!
