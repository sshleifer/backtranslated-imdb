This movie was very good, not good, but very good. It is based on a one-man play by Ruben Santiago Hudson. He played most of the parts. On paper it looks like stunting. Yes, let's pick up all the black people in Hollywood and sit in one movie. Halle Berry even produced it. The only name I didn't see was Oprah, thank you, for it will probably be a Hallmark movie. Instead, this movie wasn't a sentimental mess. It was moving, but not fake, the characters came and went with the exception of her husband, Pauline and the writer concerned. The film has been around Nanny's universe, Mrs. Bill Crosby and how she raised the writer and adopted people. He is now an old New Yorker, when he said she caught up with sick and parents and we see them going to a spiritual institution to pick up a man. I think the sister seems to have a medical scam. To get people's work done and to do the medication. But no, she explains Lou Gosset, she wants only $ 25 a week and didn't want the money ahead of time. I think the part was just loaded into the movie for us New Yorkers so we know she doesn't bump the poor people. (G) It was written by a New Yorker so he knows the deal. (G). She almost looks English and looks through a little boy's eyes I can see why. She is married to a ne'er doing well who is 17 years younger and foolish about her. Terrence Howard was born to play these parts. He was good, but I would like to see him play something else. Markerson playing Nanny is also very good. But for some reason, the person standing out for me played a small role by Jeffery Wright. Where are these men's Oscar? He already won an Emmy and a Tony. He was in Shaft and he stole the movie. I didn't even know who he was in this movie. He is never a chameleon the same. I have never seen him play a bad role. It was a 5 minute roll and he managed to make me laugh and cry. I braided the scene several times. Once because I didn't know who he was. His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent. I saw her in roles for mostly mousse things. But she's so good here. I actually know people who act like her. So it was really really my Macy Gray who had one of the bigger parts, was also very good. I was very glad they didn't kill Nanny. I thought she was a goner in the beginning of the movie. BUT she could go home and start her old routine to care for people. There are so many women in most of our lives. People who may know or even live with us. Thanks to them, I don't know how they do it all the time. I have a friend who has lost 2 children and done a lot of things, but if I feel sorry for myself, I call her and she always puts me in a good mood. This movie is a tribute to all the people. I just wish they told them what happened to some of the characters such as the one armed man, Pauline's boyfriend, played by one of my favorite actors on HBO's The Wire, Omar, Rosie Perez's character and Richard the lesbian and Delroy Lindo's one poor man, he was captivating in another small role.
