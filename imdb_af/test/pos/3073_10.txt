If you don't like Mel Brooks, you won't like this movie. It's a given. Why someone doesn't want his movies to be unknown to me, but to those who can't see the light, just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Everyone else: It's a classic. The whole film is perfect: Carey Elwes is a thin, clever, British Robin Hood, Amy Yasbeck persuaded appropriately like Marion, Richard Lewis is his usual distraction, annoyed himself, Roger Rees is a brilliant combination of fluster and violence as Mervyn. Sheriff of Rottingham, and Dave Chapelle, Eric Allan Kramer, Mark Blankfield, and the unfortunate underused Matthew Poretta are the perfect Merry Men. There are similarities with Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles ... and every other Mel Brooks movie. But why do you want him to change his style if it works so well? The pop culture references in this movie are old enough to be funny again ... from the view of a 16 year old, at least. It's complete and complete parody, every second a laugh for a laugh. Some of them work, but most do, and good. I saw new jokes the fifth and sixth time I watched the movie! <br /> <br /> Of course, if you're being bombarded by constant visual and verbal gags, it's not your style, you won't like it. It's not an Oscar winner, it's Mel Brooks. You know what it is when you succeed. If you want a ceaseless laugh, surprisingly well-developed characters, and catches to last a lifetime, watch it.
