"The Seven-Ups" looks like a repeat of "The French Connection", released two years earlier. Both late Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are performing, as well as stunt manager Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> But we're not dealing with French drugs bad things; Instead, we are dealing with a war against various hoods and criminals after a policeman has brutally killed. We see unpleasantness and a pre-1990s New York City. <br /> <br /> I love watching this movie because it's exciting to watch the action, and it's a reminder of a cooler time. That said, comparing car deals, Hickman joined the three most compared: This movie, Bullitt and The French Connection. Each chase scene has its own characteristics, and this one is just wonderful. <br /> <br /> And I'm glad this title saw the day on DVD.
