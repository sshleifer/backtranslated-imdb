As an adventure mini-series, it's about as good as it gets. I watched it when it was originally shown on HBO. Sigrid is completely credible in her role as Philadelphia, and the whole production was first! See all 400 minutes of it as you can. I recommend this mini series. Amazing that I can't judge it officially, but for your readers / users I will let you know it's a solid 10!
