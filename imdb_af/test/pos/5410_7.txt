It is difficult to judge 'Imaginary Heroes' without referring to the fact that director and writer Dan Harris is only 25. You can hardly believe that this film, which is not just an adult work, is professional and deep, but also with some of the deviations of routine specifically for older directors. <br /> <br /> The neighborhood is the American suburb, known for 'American Beauty' or 'Desperate Housewives'. As in 'American Beauty, the movie is a suicide, but here it is at the beginning of the movie, and we remain a middle-class family that overcomes the death of the gifted sportsman's brother and son. Emile Hirsch plays the younger brother, Sigourney Weaver is the mother, both are excellent at dealing with the loss to find the reason and motivation to survive. Harris drives his actors with a certain hand, and the first two sections of the film (there are a total of four as the seasons of the year) a wonderful tension, with credible dilemmas and real questions. This is the second part of the slightly deviant movie, it looks too tired and conventional. I suspect the producers could interfere with the work of the young writer and director, bringing him closer to the Hollywood convention. That's how this movie is not a bleak version of 'American Beauty', with a different focus. However, I'm sure we'll hear a lot about Dan Harris the following year.
