Ghillie's remake of the Telugu "okkadu" is fortunately a clear version of the original. It packs the same punch and Dharani where is its spectacular brilliance, offers it with style and panache. A Vijay's career with the entry of Surya and Vikram on the run has the necessary uplift with this movie. It may be the best movie Vijay has ever been, seeing the choices he has made since then. The hard-working actor has lost his carriers who are accepted by talented new entrants by both the industry and the public. <br /> <br /> The tight-fitting scrub that runs a neck-breaker revolves around Velu, a deliberate youngster who aspires to a point in The Game of Kabaddi (a popular game among boys in India). The events following the accidental encounter with Muthupandi, the rescue of the girl in distress and how he plays with the aspirations of his friends and his own, is the focal point and end of the film. Vijay, as a 'T' in the role and essays, fits a subdued and credible representation of the boy next door. <br /> <br /> Trisha has more than a stereotype Tamil heroine to play. The role is much more complex than just a girl in trouble. With limited dialogue Trisha uses her occasionally muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role. It's a classic case of a cover-up girl who becomes a professional actress. Trisha became my personal favorite after this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie ends on predictable lines, though one should give the director credit to guess the audience on many things, including Trisha's change in decision to leave the country. Prakash Raj deserves a praise for the perfect counterweight for Vijay's role. She is almost insatiable in the role of a villain and the seemingly kinky in the hero's armor is a perfect attempt to guess the audience. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie that at least earns a single show. I give it a clear 8 out of 10.
