From the crash of the opening theme, "The Man With the Golden Arm" is the classic 1950s entertainment. No subtlety here Frank comes from jail with a monkey on his back and goes straight back to the old neighborhood, where the old scumbags still hide. It is a story of his dark ride with all his emotional baggage intact. The performances are all a bit overripe, but it's part of the fun to watch. Darren McGavin and Arnold Stang are unforgettable, and almost steal the show. These and "The Manchurian Candidates" are, in my humble opinion, the two largest chairman of the board films. Don't miss any of them.
