I don't kid you. Yes, "Who's that girl" has the distinction of being one in Madonna's ropes that have been bombed, but I liked the movie more than "Desperately Seeking Susan". In "Susan", Madonna's character is rejected as a second violin for Rosanna Arquette and is not given much to work with. No respect for Rosanna, but in WTG, Madonna plays this zany, outrageous character, done only in an 80's style. Although it looks "cute" today, it's actually one of Madonna's best and one of her most underrated movies. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, an ex-con sent to the slam for a crime. she did not commit. She is released after four years of good behavior. Griffin Dunne, who is also a very underrated actor, plays Louden Trott, a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of getting her out of jail to take her to the bus station. Of course, when these two come together, it's when the madness happens. Sir John Mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a large house in central Manhattan with a rainforest (???) on his roof. <br /> <br /> This movie parodies everything. Rich people, the crazy characters living in Harlem, destroy Louden's Rolls-Royce, the gay cops following Madonna and Dunne in town, and Dunne's stuffed fiance, Wendy Worthington, allegedly with every New York City taxi driver. slept playing by Haviland Morris, who was Jake's friend Caroline in Sixteen Candles). Hilarious! Plus, Dunne is also in charge of a rare leopard reminiscent of "Bringing Up Baby". Plus, Madonna looked back at a big platinum blonde 80s in those days and the movie has a good soundtrack. Throw it all into the mix and you have the zaniness of WTG. <br /> <br /> Madonna is the queen of the death squad. There are times in the movie where she says a line completely straight and surprisingly, it seems to be funny! This is how some of the best comedies should be played - straight. Madonna had to do more comedy and it was a pity she didn't choose to do it. Later, she became much more controversial and has more of the dark, sexually charged roles in the notorious films "Evidence" and "Dangerous Game". <br /> <br /> Some people say Madonna can't act, and that's good, people are entitled to their opinion, but I believe the real problem is that people can't see the difference between Madonna's character on film don't play. see only Madonna and this is the main reason she enjoys more respect for her music than for her movies. It is still a fun, comical ball comedy of the 80's. Not for everyone, I'm sure some of you won't like it, so I'd recommend it to Madonna fans, but you never know, you might be surprised and loved! <br /> <br /> Interesting knowledge: One of Madonna's friends from her early 80s New York club days, Coati Mundi, who plays Raoul, was a member of the groups Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Savannah Band.
