It's one of Bruce's most underrated movies, in my opinion, it's a wonderful heartwarming movie, with a neat story and a wonderful show by Bruce Willis! All the characters are great, and I thought Willis and Spencer Breslin were just fantastic together, plus Bruce Willis is simply incredible in this! It's definitely one of Bruce's best comic performances (The waaaaaaaaamabulance thing was wonderful) and I thought it was very well written and made, as well as the finale is especially cool! It's good of course and it was cool to see Russell's (Willis) character change throughout the movie! plus the end was pretty good. I think it should be higher than 6.0 and this is one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen! plus it has many surprising moments. All the characters are very nice, and it also has a cute love storyline, as well as Bruce and Spencer Breslin both have very funny lines (Holy Smokes!). This is one of Bruce's most underrated movies in my opinion, it's a wonderful heartwarming movie, with a neat story and a wonderful show by Bruce Willis and I say it's a must see! The direction is wonderful! Jon Turteltaub does a good job here with very good camera work and keeps the film very fast. The Acting is excellent! Bruce Willis is amazing as always and is wonderful here, giving one of his best comic performances, hilarious, had wonderful chemistry with Spencer Breslin and Emily Mortimer, had some funny lines and was dead in the movie. He was one of the main reasons I loved this movie so much! (Willis Rules !!!!!!!). Spencer Breslin is fantastic as the younger version of Russell, he was very funny and didn't even get on my nerves, he's one of the better kids out there! Emily Mortimer is good like Amy and was very cute. I liked her, she also had decent chemistry with Bruce. Lily Tomlin is funny like Janet. I like her a little. Jean Smart is good with what she had to do, which wasn't much. The rest of the throw is doing well. Overall a must see! **** from pf 5
