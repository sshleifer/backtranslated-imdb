What Bergman got here is: "What if all the bad things here in Sweden happened to nice people like us?" And what he gives in Swedish language, with Swedish actors, in Swedish places (and actually Swedish military vehicles) is known with war films that occur in almost every other country in Europe - all the confusing invasions and counter-attacks, political lies , internment camps, forged confessions, summary of executions, torture, cloak, "co-workers" and so on. As in a modern short story, it's done in abstract, with no real names, cities or countries used. But the stronger faction is "Nazis": they support self-importance, and some wear shiny knee boots. You even swear with a row crop (ok, it's actually a sugar cane). The victim is Rosenberg. Aside from the shame, they feel they have more dirty ways to survive. And who wouldn't do what they did? What all of the above suggests is that the title clearly refers to Stockholm's de facto complexity with the Nazis. Indeed, what we have shown is how Sweden would seem to have asked Germany something more than mining concessions. <br /> <br /> The first half plays like a black comedy. We see the "miss of the war" from the point of view of a comic-passive couple ignoring the forces around, the long convoys, the bombed buildings, the news reports, and c. They don't even bother finding a working radio. They are the best in "Not in my backyard". They speak of wine and lingonberries; Meanwhile, friends are being secretly employed and growing troops appear in the town. They don't show curiosity about the war that has gone around them for years. <br /> <br /> The man (Von Sydow) is cultivated, struggling and a sprinter; The woman (Ullman) is somewhat more impulsive, passionate and outward. There is a beautiful scene in which the man talks about his violin: the manufacturer, he fought in Napoleonic wars, but discontinued his own interest with the cultural artifact in his hand - or more precisely what his own warm feelings about its possession and the security that accepts that ownership. Not in my backyard! But when the war finally breaks into their rural idyll, the man's crook, an irritation in good times, becomes a liability, one that he ultimately gives overpaid - as is often the case - as Bergman demonstrates subtly and beautifully. Definitely worth seeing.
