There won't be one moment in this movie where you don't laugh. It is Mel Brooks on one of his high points, and Cary Elwes carries out the part of Robin with convincing humor. Every time you watch this movie, you'll discover a new joke, but the one you've noticed before will never grow old. Highly recommended!
