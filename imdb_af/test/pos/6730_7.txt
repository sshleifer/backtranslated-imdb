So after years and years I followed this movie carefully! I went to see how it lived to my memories. Obviously I remember the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine, then waiting behind two planks of wood that had crossed into the mine, and just faced with a light white face. This single shot was probably the most different shot of my childhood, I remember chilling down my spine. Looking at it now, of course, it is nowhere near and scary, but rather unknowingly strange to see the same images again. If someone wants a copy, private message me. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty standard BCFF stuff. It is strange that the message about this is unclear - there is no real moral as such (except that "ghosts are here to help us?" Or "Do not harm spirits!") There was not even a greed / capitalist angle regarding the benefit of the mine. However, it is a massive act of captain's irresponsibility and encourages the two children to follow the vague implications of a ghost not only in a mine, but also in a completely new dangerous hole. The captain then encourages the children to climb a big ladder, deep in the mines, simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too. It's also a bit odd that the ghost chooses the boy to help the adulterated adults, and not only help lead the trapped adults. Oh good.
