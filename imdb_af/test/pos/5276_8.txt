Well, if this movie was made much later in the history of the theater, it wouldn't be particularly worthwhile. However, in 1898, movies were in their infancy and they were almost all duller and had no real story to tell - rather, ordinary ordinary everyday people were doing daily activities. If it is seen today, almost everyone is hopelessly boring and very, very short - often less than one minute long! And so in view of this, this short clip of a movie is pretty swell stuff and can just make you laugh. Two guys, a miller and a chimney sweep into each other and fall and throw flour and coal over each other while they are in a rush. IT'S ALL - the movie is over before you know it.
