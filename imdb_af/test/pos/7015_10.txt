As well, the acting, cutting, directing in it may not be the best ever, but the dance, the move, the heat and the passion in this movie are definitely the best (well ... at least for me ^^) It's really touched me to teach me dancing. I even registered especially on this site, just so I could vote on it and contribute my support for this movie. for this movie it literally gave me my jaw when I watched it. I love it. Jennifer Gray is so beautiful! Patrick is so sexy there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The first thing I will do tomorrow will be on the way to college to download the video store. I buy a copy of it. Look again until I'm old. I can't dance with the movie anymore. before as i need to learn all the dance moves there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
