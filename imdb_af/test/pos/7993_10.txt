I enjoyed this movie since I was a kid and I still do. I also kept Batman forever, but the real difference is that this movie didn't date when I grew up. I saw some scenes in this movie that didn't make sense: "Hhmm ... the crowd is angry. Hey! Where did they get the tomatoes? 'Then I thought,' Who cares? This movie is not 100% serious anyway! <br /> <br /> The original Tim Burton Batman was also good, but it was a bit cheesy on some parts and I don't like all the actors. This movie has improved on virtually every aspect with a wonderful cast, a more gothic style and no engagement of prince. <br /> <br /> Currently, many fans of the Christopher Nolan movies are not, like Burton, claiming that the Nolan movies are more serious and therefore more faithful to the cartoons. I don't think it's quite true: - There has never been an adjustment to the original concept of Batman that was a vengeance criminal killer with a gun. -Batman got many forms in the sixties (and a bit with Batman and Robin). A director is free to choose what kind of Batman he will portray for so long. <br /> <br /> My opinion: Batman does not necessarily have to be serious. It's about a man in a rubber suit with pointed ears. Burton managed to create a perfect balance between the folly and the darkness around the whole idea. <br /> <br /> I recently watched the Nolan movies, and I also love those (especially The Dark Knight). There's just something about this movie that interests me more. Nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth, and he looked at an explanation of almost every aspect of Batman. It's a little too much for me, I'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of Batman. The Burton movies are more theater and centered around the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> My conclusion is that you shouldn't compare the Nolan with the Burton movies. They're just different and it's up to you to decide which one you want better. My respect is for both directors.
