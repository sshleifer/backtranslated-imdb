The book is better than the movie, mostly because of the writer Ondatje's prose. Before I saw this movie, someone who saw it told me that the love depicted in this movie is not really. After I watched this movie, I can see how her suspension of unbelief in this regard can also deduce other filmmakers. Honestly, some of the intense shows of love were laughing and looking on the verge of parody. But in the end, everyone should realize it's a great message piece of art. It is not specific about love, it uses "love" to dialectically reveal the human divide or the arbitrary boundaries of countries that justify the wars and hatred. It's about misunderstandings and the blind result of the things we suppose. The critical scene for the right theme of this movie is when the heroes or antihero's pleadings for help for his stranded lover in the desert are ignored and ignored for the reasons shown in that scene. This film is also about hope and forgiveness. The hope is uncomfortable in the interracial relationship between Binoche's recovery character and the Indian minesweeper (in the Sikh's friendship with his white colleague who actually dies) in the Caravaggio's first hunt and then enforces what he thinks the hero's confessions will be for his war "crimes" (betrayal of the country). I think the movie can be made even better than it is. I do not know if a more realistic depiction of the circumstances of love made the right themes and points of this movie even more obvious, but I agree that this film is not about realistic romantic love, since People behind this piece of art or film imply in an early stage when the ultimate lovers first meet. The hero talks about how a new car, broken down car, fast car, etc. (I paraphrase) is just a car, no matter what adjectives you put it for. She answers only parental love, platonic love, romantic love, etc. Are many different kinds of love. This is ironic because this film is really about the one love that all people would want, which is the love of (or for) peace (not materialistic things that are usually the real reasons for wars, which in most of us "Cars," "Let's say. Otherwise, we might be stranded to die in a cave in a large desert with ancient wall art / swimmers' drawings, indicating that the seas and life-supporting waters there once were. but just disappeared, I believe "The English Patient" won the Oscar because of these great messages not specific to his portrayal of romantic love. Awards are likely to go so well. Involving the audience Unfortunately, this view of love can be obsolete in the age of divorce and so many individuals who do not occur at so many levels, so ridiculous versions of mythical love are hard to come by, even in daydreams, what movie love has always been, especially in good old Hollywood. The movie may not be more than expected, but a 7 out of 10 movie is also worth seeing.
