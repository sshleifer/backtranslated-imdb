The box at my video store is why I rented this one. It looks cute from the guys' face that was in half, so of course I had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised when I actually saw it as a "Evil Dead" fan. The Swedish makers must be fans, as well as many references in this masterpiece. A criminal is trying to break into the house. Evil Ed was modifying the movies that eventually made him insane and said "groovy" while watching his weapon, like Bruce Campbell, when he completed his chain saw in Evil Dead 2. There are also many posters of that movie spreading around the house and office in the movie. Not only do they haunt Evil Dead, because there is a Gremlin style doll that falls into Ed's fridge. My personal favorite is when he chases his wife around the house and says, "I'm going to get you Barbra." If you didn't know, Barbra's brothers star in "Night of the Living Dead". This movie has pretty much everything good, characters, funny stuff (Gremlin puppet), scary stuff, great effects (explosive head) and a good amount of female nudity. I just gave it a 9 because its kind slow before Ed goes mad, but it's worth waiting for the wait. So if you bought "Evil Dead 2" or any of the other movies I mentioned above, rent it and watch it with a friend and when you're done with "Brain Dead" because I hear it is similar to this masterpiece. <br /> <br />
