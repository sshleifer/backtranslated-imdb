The most wonderful movie I've ever seen. I didn't read the programming and I accidentally stumbled upon the movie. I thought it was a real documentary and I felt sick about what I saw. I just found out that it was a movie after it was finished and I watched on the web for more information on "penalty park" in the US. It felt incredibly real and it's easy to believe it's really been in the US if you're from Europe. I have to admit that I really felt anti-America after watching the movie and before I found out that it didn't really happen that way.
