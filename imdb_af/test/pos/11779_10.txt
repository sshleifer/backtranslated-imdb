I totally caught this jewel by accident in 1980 or '81. I was at a revival theater to watch two old, silly sci-fi movies. The theater was full and (without warning) they showed a lot of sci-fi short spoofs (to get us in the mood). Most were somewhat amusing, but IT went on and within seconds the audience was hysterical! The biggest laugh came when they showed "Princess Laia" with large cinnamon rolls instead of hair on her head. She looked at the camera, gave a grim smile and nodded. It made it even harder! You must see "Chewabacca" played by what looks like a Muppet! It was extremely stupid and stupid ... but I couldn't stop laughing. Most of the dialogue is drowned out because of all the laughs. Also, if you know "Star Wars" well, it's even harder - deliberately pleasing some of the dialogue. It really works with an audience! A decided 10!
