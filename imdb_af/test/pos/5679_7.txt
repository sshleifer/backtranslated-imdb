Like most, I thought 'another crocodile movie'. So far, we've had Primeval and Rogue for the past 12 months, what can they do what's new? Where both these films deal with action and violence, it is about fear and tension. <br /> <br /> The performances are not Oscar-worthy if nothing is going on, but in times of distress or terror, these people suffer so much from torture. There are holes in the plot and maybe Crocs is not as worn as others have said, but the fear is so effective. It's a piece to say you'll enjoy this movie. It will make you feel so uncomfortable as the passion of Christ.
