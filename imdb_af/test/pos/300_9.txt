First, I believe this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who read Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness", the book that was the literary base for the movie. Having said that, I believe this movie is amazing. It is an excellent war film that does not focus so much on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam conflict, but more on the psychological toll it has taken on the young, inexperienced "children" sent to fight it. Coppola has made real genius in the art of making movies, using lots of visual arts to tell the story. The play I felt was definitely all right. Marlon Brando's role in the movie is what really did me. His explanation to Willard at the end of the film rolls you in and reveals the folly of a man you have heard and wanted to see throughout the film. Those who will consider this just another war film should have a detailed look at all the literary elements interwoven with this movie, because there is a great deal of meaning behind it all. In my opinion, this is one of the most sought after and best movies of all time.
