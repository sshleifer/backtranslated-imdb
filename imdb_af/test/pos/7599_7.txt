Women will love this movie better than men. Of course, women like all romantic comedies more than men - average. I mostly like romantic comedies, but I consider it a 5.5 for the first 50% of the movie and about 6.5 for the next 40% and about a 9 for the last 10%. So, unwillingly, I'll evaluate it a 7. I stick and keep all movies with a 7 or better and no one that is 6 or worse - at least this is my goal. I have over 1200 movies, so why keep the dogs. <br /> <br /> My wife liked this movie more than I did, although I'm not sure why. I'm a bigger Drew Barrymore than she is. <br /> <br /> The whole point of this movie was about a young woman going back to high school today to write a story about high school experience. She was in high school for the first time and had to learn how to be cool the second time. Her journey to cooldom, as well as her in love with a teacher, is the story. <br /> <br /> What helped me for the first half of the movie was just how mangy she was watching. I wondered why they would choose her for this role until I realized how competent she was to look like a dog. So much so that I really don't think I'd see her in 15 years if she gets up in the morning. Oh no! Of course she eventually transformed into a pretty attractive (cute) woman and she became very popular. <br /> <br /> The end is about 9.9 on a very good scale so you'll keep sappers out there. Otherwise, it's not very memorable and easily missed.
