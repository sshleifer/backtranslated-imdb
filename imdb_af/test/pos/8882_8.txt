This movie is basically a spoof on Hitchcock's Strangers on a train, which I thought was overestimated anyway. The plot went to look at Danny Devito to strangers and then thought Billy Crystal would have to swap murders because Crystal had to kill his mother and Devito to kill his wife. Both Devito and Crystal are great and so is Devito's mother. This is Devito's director's debut and it's better than the war of the roses.
