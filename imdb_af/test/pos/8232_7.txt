After cleaning Dodge City (with some help from Wyatt Earp), Bat Masterson goes to Liberal, Kansas, where they have a nice little series. What's more, an interesting sharecropping scheme is. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is Bat Masterson and he is after villains Billy House and Steve Brodie who drive farmers out of their farms. The homesteaders they drive away are in a share scheme funded by Robert Ryan. Seems like he walks the various farmers to a parcel of land for a percentage profit from their crop. Ryan is planning to lose his shirt because of all the shenanigans. <br /> <br /> As depicted by Scott, Bat Masterson is an exciting Western hero who has a passion for going east and becoming a reporter we all know he did later in life. <br /> <br /> Anne Jeffreys and Madge Meredith are involved in a romantic subplot involving Brodie and Ryan, which is a bit stupid and detracts from the action. Anne Jeffreys does sing well. <br /> <br /> Of course, Gabby Hayes always offers great comic relief. <br /> <br /> A great addition to the Randolph Scott collection westerns. Also interesting because his later Western films do not wear him as a hat as white as one. <br /> <br /> This review is dedicated to Kasey Hayes of the Professional Bull Riders who is a proud Liberal resident. , Kansas, a village with a good tradition or Bat Masterson smuggled there or not.
