One of the benefits of my work is that when things are slow, I can put the movie into our downstairs theater (I am in a small screen theater) in the crying room and still keep an eye on the franchise stand. I saw 20 times Italian Job, and I'm not tired of it yet. The atmosphere reminds me of Ocean's Eleven, although the play isn't so good. Mark Wahlberg is okay, Charlize Theron calls on the guys, but Seth Green is AWESOME in this movie. I thought Edward Norton did a very good job of playing a garbage bag, though many disagree. I also enjoy Mos Def as the explosive expert who is afraid of dogs. I recommend this movie, and will always see it if I can!
