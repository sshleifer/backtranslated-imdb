I hired this movie with very low expectations but was pleasantly surprised. This movie is very good. And one would never guess it's a low budget. <br /> <br /> EIGHTEEN, directed by Richard Bell, centers on an 18-year-old Pip, played by the beautiful 'Paul Anthony' who leaves his home due to the circumstances surrounding the way his older brother died. He is found guilty of this event and falls into a hard life of a runaway teenager on drugs and alcohol. On his 18th birthday, his father traced Pip and gave a band he had left with his grandfather, after which he had to listen to his 18th birthday. <br /> <br /> The way the whole movie is told is with two simultaneous stories unfolding at the same time. The current life of Pip and the past of his grandfather during WW11 that Pip listens to the band. <br /> <br /> The three outstanding performances in this movie are those of 'Paul Anthony' as Pip and 'Brenden Fletcher plays Jason, the young 18-year-old WWII soldier, his grandfather. Also, the role of the WW11 wounded medication 'Macauley' played by 'Mark Hildreth.' Everyone has good performances. <br /> <br /> A few worries and scenes that didn't fit well with me ... the priest, Father Chris played by 'Alan Cumming' who is gay and broadly picks up Pick's up the local street hustler know the whole environment. And then we played the local store clerk Jeff, a loved one by the attractive 'David Beaszely' who just wants to be loved, and for some unknown reason is attracted to the very unattractive and sluggish ballroom, Clerk, sleeping with just about anyone and in all likelihood is a walking-toxic time bomb. In addition, he is not a very nice person. This part just didn't move. <br /> <br /> The parts I love most were the flashbacks of the War. They were so well behaved and very touched. There is a scene at the end where one soldier dies and the other soldier, "Jason," is there for him to comfort and show him love, as he is seriously injured and dies. It is such a wonderful and pleasant scene that has left me in tears. Beautifully performed. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. It is one of love, salvation and the power of the human spirit to survive.
