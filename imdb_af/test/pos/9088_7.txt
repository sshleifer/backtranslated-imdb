Countless TV shows and the unforgettable appearances of 4 of today's mega-stars (plus Hope Davis's screen debut) still keep Flatliners in caution. The plot is about a non-academic investigation of five drug undergraduate plans of one's crazy idea of ​​discovering the secret of death, and learning what is after death, and then coming back. However, the storyline is not as fascinating as the idea of ​​the plot design. <br /> <br /> There are popular stereotypes to develop a regular teen scraper in Flatliners. There is Nelson who creates the idea of ​​decoding death, beautiful, but introverted Rachel, David who cuts the Gordian knot, fortunately not to be dismissed from school, ladies Joe and finally the clever old Randy not school around my classmates No matter how disobedient they may be, "they are completely joining hands in an experiment where Nelson's heart will be stopped and reacted. Then they decide to do this experiment at night on the campus. long after Nelson's experience, everyone begins a race to have the wildest and longest death experience, endangering their lives one by one, yet soon realize that their daily lives are influenced by the experiences they had. the afterlife brings back their delicate feelings from their childhood memories, when they depolarize the deeply subconscious vigilance, they begin somatic atrocities and visual hallucinations. <br /> <br /> When the point comes where the statement of subconscious, director Joel Schumacher beats that everybody has a subconscious that they are not aware of. This inner personality likes the change in identity loss. If you lose or you depolarize this subconscious personality, you will definitely lose your identity instead of refreshing childhood. I wanted to add it as a movie bug, already mentioned by film critics in the early 90s. "It is clear that in this film Schumacher made the actors that it was the least affected. Why then do they hesitate to continue on the experiment after learning their lesson, as if death is detectable by God? David was introduced as an atheist, and he believed in God when he returned from childhood. Having seen this 180-disruption change in David, it is clear that Schumacher's film was so conservative and lily-alive; That's why it's never classified as a science fiction work. Sorry It had a good potential. It even tried to tell the unconscious maturity of a death experience, to start believing that death is so simple, and it is just a part of one's life. More than that in the movie, it was also memorable to remember what the movie is. Jan de Bont as the filmmaker, who has worked with Schumacher almost every time, creates a dreamy atmosphere as if it were a Gothic horror movie. The blue color schemes on the walls that reflect the actors' faces deliver first-class lighting that perfectly fits the movie. The close-up shots of the gargoyle statues in the campus buildings, Catholic frescoes in the walls, stop-motion cameras, and the dynamic camera speed were all belonging to Fur's skills. Flatliners have become a cult film in time with its sociological pen portrait of the X-generation youth, especially via its futuristic editing style with storyboard connectivity, such as being part of a video music clip so much aesthetically. These were the times when fast and multi-sequential video music clips were on the rise. This style was scarce to come to his pioneer Tony Scott's "The Hunger (1983)" in those years.
