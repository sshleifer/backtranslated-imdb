Much better than what is commonly assigned, this version of "Lost Horizon" has not only good music and beautiful scenery, but also beautiful mountain photography. A special edition laser disc was released a few years ago that added more than 30 minutes of previously deleted material, extra music, and lots of bonus material. So why isn't it on DVD? Difficult to find the studios sometimes. Certainly, the roles can be given to people who can sing better than Peter Finch, Liv Ullman, George Kennedy and Sally Kellerman, but what do you want in a movie, good acting or melodious pipes? Song and dancer Bobby Van is very nice, Michael York is a suitable tragic villain, and since Mr. John Gielgud is exhausted, Chang may be stupid, but actually works really well on the screen. Believe me, you have to watch this movie - if you can find it!
