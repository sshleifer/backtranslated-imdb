H. Cluozot had problems working in France after making "Le Corbeau" in 1943, which was manufactured by the German company and later judged by French as a piece of anti-French propaganda. Louis Jouvet, an admirer of Clouzot's work, invited him to direct a thriller "Quai des Orfevres" where he played an ambiguous police inspector who investigated a murder that happened in the Paris Music Hall. Without each other's knowledge, tempting cabaret singer Jenny Lamoure (Suzy Delair) and her jealous piano accompanist Maurice, who fell in love with her (Bertrand Blier, father of director Bertrand Blier), try to believe in their involvement in the murder. be? Enter stubborn policeman (Louis Jouvet) who is determined to discover the truth. Jouvet practically stole the movie with wonderful cynical and sentimental in the same time. "His character, his eagle-like profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable." "Quai des Orfevres", witty and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses was a great return from H.G. Cluozot, the fine director, "French Hitchcock".
