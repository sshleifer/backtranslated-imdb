I think Josh Duhamel is so good !! The rest of the show is fun to watch, but I think it's the attractive and sexy Josh Duhamel that makes the show "Las Vegas" really fun to watch !! In the days of "Magnum" I loved Tom Selleck, I thought he was the sexiest man on earth! A hunger on a television program is a must for women to enjoy watching something, especially just for the sake of harmless entertainment !! I would have done something to win a date with Tad Hamilton! Josh Duhamel is incredible and I will always have a super lover on him !! Josh is definitely a HUNK !! and I'll watch "Las Vegas" all the time, Josh Duhamel is also a big reason!
