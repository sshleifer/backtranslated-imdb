"Challenge to be free" was one of the first films I saw as a child. It was also one of the first VHS tapes I own. I didn't see the movie in years, so yesterday I decided to hold and watch the tape. Wow. The story is now as powerful as it was the first time I saw it. Now, I think I'm older, I can appreciate the values ​​implanted in the movie better. (Self-confidence, The value of freedom and the love of nature) This is a B-movie, but it is a person who has been remembering for years, especially if you see it as a child.
