Dracula's house was made until the end of Universal's horror cycle of the 1940s and I've seen it several times. <br /> <br /> A sharp doctor, Edelman, counts plants for a serum that heals people. Count Dracula comes for a cure for his vampirism and Lawrence Talbot then comes to see if he can cure him of a werewolf at full moon. Frankenstein's monster is then discovered and Edelman brings him back to life just as the villagers descend on the castle and set it on fire. Talbot, now healed and one of Edelman's female assistants is safe. <br /> <br /> Like many movies of its kind, we have a hunchback assistant and thunderstorm to move it. <br /> <br /> The film includes Universal Horror directors Lon Chaney Jr (The Wolf Man), John Carradine (House of Frankenstein) and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's monster. Also starring Onslow Stevens (Them!), Lionel Atwill (The Vampire Bat) and Martha O'Driscoll. <br /> <br /> The house of Dracula is a must see for all old horror fans out there. Great fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
