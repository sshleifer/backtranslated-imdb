Two people living in the same apartment find that their partners have a relationship with each other. As they try to work together, it also begins with an emotional journey that has a decision. <br /> <br /> Based on his previous success with Happy Together and Chungking Express, Wong Kar wai gives us rather old-fashioned and wonderful story of revived passions, longing and unrequited love. <br /> <br /> Possibly, in the mood for love is not for everyone's taste. It runs almost lazy at 98mins: not long for a movie, but it looks longer because not much happens. But this lazy feeling hides a fairly sturdy film. Most of the story is crafted to find a series of solid scrolls, where the characters work out supposed scenarios between their respective spouses, trying to figure out how the case started. I say cleverly because it makes it difficult for the audience (and the characters) to tell what is "in-roll" and what is real. <br /> <br /> If it all sounds like art and self-awareness, it's because it's. Unashamedly so. And it is perfectly played by two of Hong Kong's best, Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai, with excellent support from Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Pan. <br /> <br /> It is also a virtuoso show by Wong Kar Wai, who treats the audience to a sensory and sensual overload. Bringing Christopher Doyle (who later deployed his opulent style on Hero) and Pin Bing Lee (whose beautiful underwear style in a small town can be seen in spring) was cinematic genius. It has made Doyle's bravery, without honesty, the Athena poster cheesiness of his work on the hero. The music, as always at Wong, is prominent. Nat King Cole sings in Spanish, after the haunting strings of the main theme, fit it perfectly to the eclectic beauty of the images. <br /> <br /> All in all a top film, whether judged on plot, play, cinematography or soundtrack. Similar to, but more accessible than, Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, it is a beautiful, old-fashioned story about love lost and recovered. <br /> <br /> Look out for Tony Leung's hotel room 2046, which featured Wong's recent movie of the same name.
