Since Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry, I expected a movie that would have been a hagiography of the subject. On the contrary, the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible, a drunkard, a bad father, a lyre and a hypocrite, and perhaps a coward. Of course, one can argue that all these things are an advantage if someone is one artist and especially a poet, as one of the purposes of art is to undermine the standards of conventional morality, but still I do not do something positive. role model can not cut. from such a bundle of personality traits. Somehow I found the other male hero of the story Captain Cillic a more engaging character. The two female roles were played by actresses Knigtley and Miller and were especially beautiful, especially the first when she performed songs in a clever outfit to inspire London-bombarded London World War II. Another good point is the role that sexual jealousy plays in relatively progressive millions, which suggests that older conventions can easily be surpassed. The atmosphere of the Blitz was also convincing, as was the portrayal of the different views of people who experienced war. unlike those who talk about it, theorize it is possible political outcomes. I think one would recommend such a movie.
