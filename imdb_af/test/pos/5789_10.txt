I always knew the day had come. We all knew. There is just as much oil in the ground, and one day we will run short. But isn't there enough coal to use it? And wind power, or something. Things to worry about for future generations. <br /> <br /> Then this documentary hit me between the eyes. Oil makes the fertilizer the reason for the first time in world history, virtually no one lives on farms. When the inevitable oil shortages are hit, many things - air travel, many drugs, plastic, suburban life - will become impossible. But the craziest insight of the documentary is this: oil gives us so much energy with so little effort, that without it our lives have to change. Even if substitutes and custody are instantly implemented, they will smoothly smooth our landing in a strange post-oil world that documentary claims can now begin. <br /> <br /> Despite its bleak message, the documentary is often highly entertaining. It contains fantastic historical footage (sober images of dark urban factories, and campy funny stuff from the 1950s) that reminds us why we moved to the suburbs in the first place. It also offers hope that a massive effort is now starting to both ease our oil transition and make the world a better place. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the documentary is that it doesn't spend time on the riddle of why we find these things out now. How can this suddenly be a major emergency? We knew we had to prepare for a post-oil world in the 1970s - and we started preparing alternative energy research and smaller cars. If we did not implement our President Jimmy Carter initiatives 25 years ago, we doomed to a hard landing in a post-oil world, why didn't anyone shout about it on soapboxes? <br /> <br /> In the end I found the documentary highly convincing; and it left me with the terrible cold to be dragged out of a very sweet dream. It is for everyone who is not afraid to see a very likely near future, to see that we still have time to do something. <br /> <br /> - Charles
