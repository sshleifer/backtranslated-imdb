That was it! I would never have expected the end if I didn't know the behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> The one thing I hated was why Shannon kicked off and not Alyssa. I hate her, I'd rather die her Shannon's character. What was funny is that in the scene where piper goes to the hospital bed and Prue cries to her, I also started crying. By the time it was broadcast, I was about 10yo and my favorite character was Piper from the beginning, so I told myself if she died, I didn't see the show anymore! lol <br /> <br /> then everything goes back. The thing was a shocker and very good. I also blame Pheobe for Prue's death, because instead of being with her sisters, she had to be a gruesome bi and be good to no demonic boyfriend. <br /> <br /> But I think this episode will be now and forever one of my favorites and a CHRMED classic. <br /> <br /> ABOUT CHARMED! Blessed!
