I've remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what the power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It's up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early performances did a lot to them, which do not have today's cartoons for children. Today's cartoons seem to be the idea that someone needs something special, a magical formula or talent to succeed in the evil or dangerous circumstances. While the early cartoons didn't address much anger - it was a much softer and safer time - they allowed us to develop our own talents and character.
