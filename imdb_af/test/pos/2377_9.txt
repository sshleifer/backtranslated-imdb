OK, it doesn't compare to the explosive rate of the first part's opening sequence; or its visual shock value; nor for the melancholic tension of the second installment. No, it's surprising and refreshingly different (obviously, from the two main actors). The futuristic tongue-in-the-cheek scenario drives the characters to one another over genres and languages ​​with almost gravitational force. The moment of impact conclusion is your choice of: a) Shakespeare metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume; b) sublimation of violence in homo-eroticism; c) humorous explosion of impossible build-up. Everything so far is even less unambiguous. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for indiscriminate film buffs who don't mind following foie gras with a hot dog; Beware of those with more refined taste.
