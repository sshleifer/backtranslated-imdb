In 1961, this series was shown on local TV here in southern California. Many others have since put the BBC on tape or DVD. Now suddenly, here it is on Amazon. I ordered in advance in January and now here on March 30 it arrived. It was a long wait (48 years). Was this worth it? So far I've only watched Richard II (I only have the DVD for 2 hours) and I can really YEA !!! worth the wait. The acting, direction and production are wonderful and even better than I remember. The production is in B&W, but somehow it fits. The video is clear and very good, the sound is flawless. Further proof of how timeless Shakespeare really is. <br /> <br /> I've been giving these 10 stars, although I've only seen one of the 8 plays. I'm sure when I saw them all, I would change my score at least 12. <br /> <br /> It is currently available at Amazon (US 1) at a fair price. <br /> <br /> I'd better stop now so I can look back to look. Next is Henry the IV, part 1 of which is my favorite Shakespeare game.
