I've never seen a Bollywood movie, but I caught the first ten minutes of this, complained myself and hit the R + button on Sky +. I'm glad I did !! I hope I don't offend anyone (because basically the BF and I loved it!), But we couldn't take it half as seriously as the actors did - especially the obsession (which I understand is a great Bollywood star because we have seen him on the front page of many DVDs since and I even saw a doll from him today in Hamleys !! The BF keeps on this block. I start thinking he is obsessive! He says it is strange to be the traditional fun to be the anti-hero of a movie! But then we do like movies that are not your predictable Hollywood prize.) It was all over the top, but really nice. If all Bollywood movies are like this, we'll look more. I had the bloomin 'song in my head and I can't speak a word of Hindi! PS any recommendations would be appreciated!
