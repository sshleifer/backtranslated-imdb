O my God! I can really say that Maya Angelou is one of the world's most intriguing and important people, especially of my culture. She is incredibly inspiring and her story is the story of a wonderful woman! When I first picked up this movie, I thought to myself that the scroll was wonderfully compiled and let them see in action now! Maya Angelou is all my favorite PoetEss and now one of my favorite actresses and speakers. I believe she is the greatest of all time. This movie had me on the edge of my seat and reached for Kleenex while reminding me at the same time that no matter where you come from if you decide you will be great, then you will be great! And Ester Rolle played a wonderful supporting role ...... 100% AWESOME ... and now even "I know why the Caged Bird Sing."
