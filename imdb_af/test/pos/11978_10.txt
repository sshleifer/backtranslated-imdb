All the people who voted a mere 1 on this movie, that's all I have to say: You haven't had enough to enjoy this kind of kind. It takes some degree of dedication to reach that level of appreciation. And this is the segment of people this movie is about. Not your average moviegoers with any chance! . Back to the movie. This one was a gem and definitely included in the Bollywood Hall of Fame. I will give it an overall rank of no. 2, only surpassed by Kanti Shah's legendary Gunda. This movie had an impeccable storyline and created a beautiful blend of fantasy and sci-fi. Pan's labyrinth would actually have been ashamed of the balance created between the parallel stories. And now I have to name the star-stolen and even stars (that's a word from now on). (A special mention goes to Mr. Nigam for the best debut ever in any movie on this earth). Every actor in this movie is very carefully selected and the role has been adapted to them (and for their age I must add too). Manisha Koirala still looks as if she is 18 and wow man, with that figure I would have raped her too. Are you wondering where this rape case suddenly came in? Yes, a rape is where the premises of this movie are based. And it's not like your average Bollywood type of movie. If you are an atheist or agnostic, this movie is a must for you. Because this movie can heal your faith. I don't think it's too far to say that this movie can cure cancer. Only the people who needed it didn't appreciate the power, charm and immortal beauty. Tchch, so unhappy! <br /> <br /> Only error in this movie: In your dreams, baby! It was flawless. <br /> <br /> Only minor complains: The director also failed to die Mithun Da. <br /> <br /> I won't ruin it any more for you. Just go see it. TODAY. And if you like, here are a few more recommendations from me. Gunda, Desh Drohi, Aparichit, the old Ramsay Brothers horror movies, Loha, Indra the tiger and Sivaji.
