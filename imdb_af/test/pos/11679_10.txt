I love this movie. It was just before the LA punk scene changed for the worse. It retains the atmosphere and attitude of that time and place. I really feel happy to be present at the filming of the four ties at the Fleetwood that evening. The only part that doesn't fit well is the sections with Catholic Discipline and their socio-political comments. I didn't see too many people in that respect. The rest of the film shows attitudes that I have seen a lot; people who handle difficult lives, or swing at the music industry and / or common hippies. I don't think I've seen a documentary that is so authentic and personal about the subject.
