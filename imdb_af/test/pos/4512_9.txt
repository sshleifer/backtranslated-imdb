It was awesome. As a library and a participant in the New York Library Association's Vitality Fund Event on Thursday evening, October 18, I was fortunate to see a preview of the new movie, The Kite Runner. The release of the movie has been delayed due to concerns about the well-being of the actor concerned. I am grateful that the NYLA event is allowed to continue as planned. <br /> <br /> As far as the film is concerned, I feel it is masterfully done. For me, as much as Stanley Kubrik's A Clockwork Orange had so much impact on me, even though it is much less graphical - much less. There is no comparison between the terrible, shocking violence and rape shown in A Clockwork Orange and the small amount of violence that actually occurs in Kite Runner. only the subject and the implications for the human psyche are comparable. (I wrote more details about violence and child rape and how it was handled on my MySpace blog.) My overall impression was that this movie was fantastic; one of the best movies I've seen. The portrayal of the Afghan boys flying their kites caught on the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most of the world. The subject is very serious, and the film carries the audience's emotions to the subject, without being many Hollywood attacks that have ruined other movies. Although the overturned car pomegranates were an obvious symbolism. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must mention the excellence of the soundtrack. Exploring Rumi's poetry as two main characters, fleeing the country during the Russian invasion - under frightening circumstances - has really shown the power of those poems. I appeal to someone who looks at the captions in that scene, to the extent you can, and just listen to the beauty of the language. I don't even know what language Amir is quoting, or his normal Dari-Persian dialect is the same as Rumi's original Persian dialect. Also note the sound being heard every time a kite line is cut. I found it a deep, distinctive sound, though the librarians who were with me didn't notice it at all. I can't help but wonder if kites actually make such a sound when they 'cut' or if it has a sense of vibration / sound that the kite flyer experienced during the competition.
