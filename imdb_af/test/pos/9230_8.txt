Bullets may not have pushed his chest, but The Lone Ranger was the symbolic icon for me every time my other boy-hero - Superman. He represented the truth, justice and the American way in a classic TV-Western environment. He lived on the principle that he would never use his gun to kill, while wiping out the American Southwest with his faithful Indian companion Tonto to bring every single ban to justice. The advent of TV provided the perfect opportunity for a post-war generation to find it ideal in a mysterious masked man who stood for law and order. He offers unparalleled entertainment for five seasons stretching for about eight years. <br /> <br /> Today I got the opportunity to start the full episode of three sections for the first time without the default opening and closing sequences to interrupt the continuity of the story. For the Ranger fans, it is the great father of all Western saga, telling how Texas Ranger John Reid survived the Butch Cavendish Gang ambush and how he was returned by an Indian friend of his childhood. Tonto (Jay Silverheels) declares his companion a "reliable exploration" and calls him Kemo-sabe. I have read several interpretations of the origin of the term Kemo-sabe, but I am satisfied with Tonto's explanation. Reading too much in it just contradicts the story, just like the English translation of 'tonto' by Spanish, which I won't reveal, because it's just better not to know if you can help it. <br /> <br /> I thought it was very clever how the origin story created the mysticism of the Lone Ranger, like the sixth tomb that created the illusion that all the Rangers died in the box's canyon ambush. You never see the face of the man who becomes the Lone Ranger because it is always turned away or hidden to hide his real identity. Even the origin of silver is handled brilliantly; the voice of the story's narrator describing the stallion's sterling traits. Will it be related to sterling ... silver? I got the biggest kick out of it. <br /> <br /> Of course, over time, watch the Lone Ranger episodes today, presenting an image of how unsophisticated the show was beyond the original story. Some of them are almost embarrassing, especially when it comes to a Lone Ranger action when he shoots bad guys in the middle of a crowd to knock a gun out of the owner's hand. And how about the little wave he gives to Tonto when they go to ambush the bad guys - it's always the same gesture, but Tonto always knows what it means in different circumstances. Then you have the episodes where Clayton Moore takes the Ranger mask to make another disguise to personalize another character in the story. He even once acted as an actor, depicting President Abraham Lincoln to expose a villain, top hat and everything! <br /> <br /> Few fans I ever saw know actor John Hart Clayton Moore for a 1952/53 season in a contract dispute that Moore had at the show's producers. If you've ever seen the "Happy Days" section where Fonzie delivers his youthful hero, you will see John Hart in the credits. It's really hard to tell if you're watching a Heart episode or not, the key is to listen to the voice; Moore's is so characteristic of giving away a dead. <br /> <br /> If you ever get the chance to taste some of the final season color deposits, you're in for a surprise. The versions I have seen on VHS are absolutely beautiful, although I do not know if commercial prints are available. Most of the black and white episodes are repackaged by any number of distributors in different configurations, so getting your hands on them shouldn't be a problem. Of course, this must be the threefold origin, and if you look nothing else, it gives you all the taste and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the West's most famous heroes. Hi-Yo Silver, Awaaaay!
