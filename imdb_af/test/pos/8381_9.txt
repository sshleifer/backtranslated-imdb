I've been a little disappointed by Tarantino since the visit. But I insist that it was just a little bit because I can appreciate the amount of work in producing such a tribute to people stunts. Inglorious Basterds certainly drove Tarantino to the top ranks in my universe. This movie can be summarized (though insufficient) in one word: "RAW". <br /> <br /> There is an intense emotion in every scene. Revenge and righteousness seem to be the main themes. From the start of the movie, one feels compassion for the victims of the Nazis and is placed in Tarantino's fictional dimension of the WW2 historical context. <br /> <br /> Characters are unpredictable, fun, scary, brutal, sexy and other adjectives. I'm sure I will escape my thoughts that are just as appropriate and positive. I will not have an appreciation for each character, but the other comments by fellow users sum up the appreciation of the different performances. <br /> <br /> Dialogue has evolved from the classic Tarantino bad ass-challenging style as seen in Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. One can feel in the dialogue that Tarantino makes more open references to other movies. Indeed, many dialogues were close to the lessons in the film for the audience, the institution being partially placed at a movie premium; A reference to a movie is near every corner. <br /> <br /> It is nice to see that every language offered (German, French and English) is equally and naturally employed. I speak a lot of French and English very fluently and are often disappointed with how English-speaking characters in French movies act poorly, and how French-speaking characters in English / American movies act poorly. Surprisingly, Tarantino managed to pick up his actors with a natural and graceful performance from his actors. It helps the audience in the context of the historical context. Indeed; Soldiers, spies and civilians rarely understood soldiers / spies / civilians from other countries. <br /> <br /> The visual / photography is beautiful, with scenarios convincingly transporting Europe in the 1940s. The outfits are perfect, and the violence is transmitted orgasmically / realistically. No bumps are withheld, and the Nazis are often harassed to be tortured. It does not open the film to all audiences; graphic violence can shock the most sensitive demographic shock. <br /> <br /> Volumes can be written on this movie. But the movie is so good that I had to pick up at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal during the North American Inglorious Basterds premiere, but refused to miss a single scene. I hope the image carries the strength I feel about this movie, and I am a hardhearted to please.
