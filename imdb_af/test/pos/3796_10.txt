I write rarely reviews, but this film requires more attention than it gets as it contains the most hysterical kidnapping, comic wrong sequence ever filmed. <br /> <br /> I only saw it once and found it to be the funniest movie. I've ever had the privilege of watching. I laughed from start to finish. It is so sad that it is not on DVD or video. <br /> <br /> You can only compare his cinematography to that of a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or promise her anything. Only this storyline is not nearly as complex as Mad World. <br /> <br /> In the near future, I hope this movie will be released, as it would be a pity to lose such a comedy jewel among the dregs we have today.
