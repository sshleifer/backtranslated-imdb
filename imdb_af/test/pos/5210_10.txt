The people of my generation and those who are older know about WWII (or as it is called in Russia - the Great Patriotic War), not only from the school textbooks, but also from the witnesses and participants of the event. My grandfather was a soldier at Stalingrad and when I was a little girl, I listened to his stories how he defeated the Germans. He also told me a few anecdotes, not everything he told me was gloomy. But it was a long time ago, and no when I was consciously interested in what happened in the Stalingrad battle, I had to look at books and movies for information. Somehow, most of the movies I saw are made in the Soviet Union, just a few in present-day Russia. And "Stalingrad" is an exception. In the film, the war is described on the opposite side, and the fact is interesting in itself. All that is shown in the film is very different from what I am used to. <br /> <br /> The movie reminds me of many Remarque's "Zeit zu leben und Zeit zu sterne", because the war is shown by an ordinary German soldier perception. And this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed by repeating that he is not a fascist at all. The film heroes come from neat and enthusiastic Europe, from the Italian coast, coming into the snow-covered, hungry Soviet Union. They are doomed to die; It is clear from the beginning. <br /> <br /> After the elite debauchery took part in the first battle at Stalingrad, one of the soldiers said the phrase that reflected the whole idea for me; He said, "If you start thinking, you'll be angry." And in my mind it's also true for spectators. One might think, OK, I'll just watch this movie and it won't ignore me. I don't have to feel sorry for the people on the screen, because they were attacking my country and not the other way around. But sooner or later, but inevitably one begins to sympathize with the characters. Probably when the lieutenant shoots back his tears to see Kolya's performance. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" is hard to watch, all of these frozen bones, dirt, layoffs, snow, famine, destroyed illusions. <br /> As far as I know, Lt. Hans von Witzland one of the few films where Thomas Kretschmann played his star roles. I watched many Hollywood movies where he gave unimportant portions of little fries, such as "Next" or "Transsiberian" (why did he do it?!). And after watching Stalingrad, I can't ask the European actors to appear in American movies, even at any second-rate price. The fact riddles me deeply. I believe Thomas Kretschmann deserves better parts and much better screens than those he gave in Hollywood. And from what I saw with him, "Stalingrad" is the best, beyond the doubt. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the worst "Stalingrad" disadvantage is the way they speak Russian in the movie. Of course, I mean those who are supposed to be Russian. Say, the boy who spends time with the Germans or the girl with whom they were planning to escape. Was it really that hard to find actors who could express a few phrases without that terrible accent? Initially I agreed to watch "Stalingrad" just to listen to native Germans because I was studying the language. I didn't expect anything unusual about the movie. But it impressed me, cried me when I didn't go. I know I am 15 years old to see it, but "Stalingrad" is not a run-of-the-mill movie, and after 15 years it is still spectacular and shocking.
