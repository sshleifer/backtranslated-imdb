The influences of other science fiction and thriller films and stories are evident in this film. The movies that come up immediately are Alien, Aliens, and Starship Troopers. The story itself is fairly straightforward and not all original, chased by space, accident landing on the planet without apparent life and a "deserted" geological expedition - except when the lights go out, different kinds of people force to work together their mutual survival while the body counts. This kind of movie always tends to have fun as long as it's done well. I believe Pitch Black was well done. The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about the longer the movie goes on and I think people will be surprised by who does it and not. Vin Diesel plays Riddick, the stereotypical convicted criminal who has a murderous past, can see physical skill, high tolerance for pain and comfort in the dark. You know he will eventually do the right thing at some point in the movie, because it is covered by the movie that he actually has a conscience about things. <br /> <br /> Cole House plays the drug addict bounty hunter who is probably in many ways a very bad guy compared to Riddick, as his character makes him known through the film. It is likely that he is the bravest when the opportunity and fire are in his favor. A very self-serving character that ultimately gets what he deserves. <br /> <br /> Radha Mitchell plays the co-pilot on the damned vessel, which is tossed from the deep sleep, as the ship ran through a meteor swarm. or the tail end of a comment. If he finds the pilot dead in his sleeping place, she tries to scare the ship, which leads to our discovery of the character's potential fatal error - for responsibility, accountability and leadership. Her character in the short story of the story is likely to grow most, because she's actually got some conviction, takes control, and doesn't sit around waiting to be gobbled by night stalking strangers. In a strange way she connects to the everyday human side of Riddick, who ultimately respects her choices and her with them. <br /> <br /> The story plays in some cases if you expect it, but I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by what characters survive this annoying experience. This movie is an entertaining train wreck that is underway to watch. Go see it! <br /> <br />
