If you are a science fiction fan and you only saw this movie once, please go. And be yourself a second show. I just did and I was surprised at how well I thought the movie was, unlike when I first saw it three years ago. For the first time, I was definitely impressed with the astronomical views we are dealing with in this movie, but I didn't think much of the movie as a whole. It was an alien rip-off, and I thought the description of the monsters was a case of very bad science. Being allergic to light was something I found particularly ridiculous. Based on my first performance, I recently rated this movie a 5. <br /> <br /> But now that the successor, Chronicles of Riddick, is on the way and the movie poster for the one looks incredible, I thought I would spoil the Pitch Black again so I borrow a friend's video has. I'm so glad I did. There is so much of what I thought I remember about the first sight that seems to be inaccurate. I thought most characters died early in the movie. It wasn't. I thought Claudia Black's character was the first to die. It wasn't. I thought Riddick was the only survivor. It wasn't. <br /> <br /> I see now that the movie works * very well *. There is no excessive, tiring focus on the monsters. It's much more of a human drama. The main characters are attractive and capable of acting convincingly. And there are so many small details that make the Pitch Black universe coherent and credible, such as the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet in which they fall and the fact that the monsters have eaten everything on the planet. on each other. <br /> <br /> And I have to call the astronomical views again. I mean, we start to see the spaceship that goes through a comet's tail, with bits of space slipping through the hull. Then we come to a planet with three suns. Just as the shipwreck thinks it is going to darken, a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon, and everything is engulfed in a blue glow. As the eclipse approaches, we see the large, nearby gaseous giant rise over the air, and in the final scene of the movie we see the ship over one of these many rings. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, wonder and detail, and I don't think I've seen any other SF movie that really made such a point to include these things. I hope we see much more in the sequel. <br /> <br /> Pitch Black now gets a score of 9 out of 10. A cult classic? You bet !!
