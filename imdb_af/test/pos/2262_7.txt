Everything is illuminating a Jewish Jewish American search for the woman who helped his grandfather escape after Nazi persecution, while embarking on a cross-European tour with a few unlikely associates. <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber usually makes his direct debut with a playful fear associated with his acting ethos. When successful actors decide to sit in the director's seat, we usually get a biographical look at the souls under the acting mask-check. We usually get a mishmash of genres check. But what we don't normally get is an informative original film that is credible, intelligent and moving. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, a curious young boy who collects pieces of life as he goes. He's on a mission to get a woman on a photo. The sepia photo carries his grandfather (an unprecedented deal with him) and the woman. To make his journey easier he helps travel guides consisting of a hip-hop lovable break dancer Alex (Eugene Hutz), his apathetic and permanent grandfather (Boris Leskin) and his dog Sammy Davis Junior Jr! So what is essentially a comedy? There is an un-patronisingly simple introduction with voice-overs. Alex's is especially funny when he returns his younger brother in the year 1969, proving how popular he is with the chicks and breaking dance, and so sets him up as Jonathan's opposite. <br /> <br /> Schreiber begins breaking down the characters as they progress and the comedy serves as a deliberate veil for what is a story of three people who are not really familiar with the Holocaust. All three hold the film with gentleness and authenticity, something that Schreiber is unlikely to get wrong and as captivating and fantastic as the film, the horrors that are being broken, that is, the past is presented in almost palatable (accidental music cinematography) which upsets them more. <br /> <br /> Since the unlikely group eventually finds the town they are looking for, they learn about the real atrocities that have occurred and find out who they really are. <br /> <br /> Elia wood is as authentic as usual, bringing its ordinary innocence and power to the screen. Formally a resident good in Lord of the Rings and a resident angry in Sin City he plays Jonathan with aplomb if he is bombarded with cultural shocks and a search for the truth. Grandpa Boris Leskin also delivers his anxiety and frustration with the youth with great humor and conviction because his own past is unraveled. However, it is Eugene Hutz as Alex who makes the show. The director uses the old deal with translating misunderstandings to create and maintain a humor that is actually funny and not clumsy. <br /> <br /> Schreiber delivered an enchanting debut that has both heart and soul. The continuous score and beautiful photography create a fairytale eclipse around a story about identity, truth and family. If there was a complaint, it would be the speed at which the film changed direction; although it might be deliberate, it may not be good with everyone. Yet, it is a beautiful effort that delivers great comedy and bondage between an unlikely group and completely analyzes another aspect of WWII horrors. <br /> <br /> -Chi & Ojo
