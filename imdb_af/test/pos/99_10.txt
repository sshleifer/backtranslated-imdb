This movie, with all its complexity and subtlety, makes one of the most sobering short films I've ever seen. The topics it tackles are ugly, cynical and sometimes even macabre, but the film is beautiful in its language, beautiful with its camera angles, and beautiful in its style, once again the short story of the same name written by a master. to recreate. from short stories, Tobias Wolff. <br /> <br /> Not wanting to spoil the movie, but I won't go into any detail except to say that this movie in itself is wonderful. It is proud of what it does and does it well. It shows the most important memories of life, which can be wrapped up by the single most elusive feeling: unexpected happiness. This film, of its own, has created in me the same feelings that the main character (Tom Noonan) felt when words changed his own existence, and that is an impressive achievement.
