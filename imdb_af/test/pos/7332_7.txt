I thought it was a beautiful movie - very brave. Such beautiful images - and I like the use of applause with goggles. Also how did the best friend rule over ".. and she one year older than me ... Repeat." Showed that their friendships were revived and grown, but maybe there are a few competitions left. I loved the material of hands that knew the material. The dance concert was beautiful. The start was slow, though. It took a while to feel for the characters. The man could have been more offensive. He just looked absent, when other characters talked about him. It didn't really fit. The case stood. The best friend and husband was random. The doctor's meeting looked as if there was not much time left to live. So when the infidelity was revealed, I didn't feel so much sympathy for the character! the end was so great-the lines btwn. her and the man, and the scene to which she was drawn, are brilliant!
