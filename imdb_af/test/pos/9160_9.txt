American war film fans can be bored by this movie from their skulls, but boredom is born of ignorance. Guerrilla repression operations are always so. Sit around waiting, get some hookers, get drunk on the base, wheel and go with the businessman, kick a prisoner, cover the murder of the street trader by the green privately. Then, boom, there are two fuel trucks, and for 10 minutes a small-arm battle with a high-caliber machine gun. Then wait for the buyer to plan a way to knock out their stronghold, and eventually kill some civilians in the process of doing so. If reality doesn't work for Western viewers, there is always Top Gun of Rambo (Top Gun Realistic? No) <br /> <br /> The best part of Afganskiy Izlom's realism was the way all the planes flutter like confetti dropped. They had to do this because Carter and Reagan gave the Mujahedin so many missiles. The wave of Mi-24s was also excellent, a better helo attack, even than the Apocalypse. The view of their falling and shooting missiles was a scene of the impending "death from above" for which they were aimed. <br /> <br /> It is funny how the Soviet Union could make an honest Afghanistan movie within a year. they left, but it took the US six years. Afganskiy Izlom is just as real if you also apply it to NATO's profession. Someone will always pick up and shoot the gun because they care about the land. It's a movie that Westerners have to watch. Unfortunately I don't think anyone ever made English captions; I might have to make a few.
