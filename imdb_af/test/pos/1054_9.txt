I just got this movie for Christmas and already added it to my favorite list. A cute and simple story that makes a beautiful movie. Who can't love Uncle Felix or have their mouths watered on the sound of all the food. Certain points go to Sydney Greenstreet for his performance of Alexander Yardley and also Reginald Gardiner who played John Sloane, the impossible boring fiancee. Really a jewel to be watched every Christmas.
