Jewel Thief is a scarce movie figure - quite noir in his story, but nothing about the presentation. A young man, Vinay, who was superbly played by a new face, lifted Dev Anand at the age of 40, alienated from his police officer, and finds a job in a jewelery store. Soon, random people come to him and call him Amar. With only a few spicy moments, the presence of a "doppler" is established. Then a woman Shalini (Vyjayantimala) came forward claiming to be engaged to the named doppler. She is accompanied by her lovely brother (Ashok Kumar) who is so convinced that Vinay is actually Amar, he lets him take off his shoes and prove that he is not Aamr, the 6-on-one. The jeweler's super cute daughter Anju (Tanuja) is completely honored with Vinay. In the midst of all this confusion there is a Jewel thief on the loose and he is on the stalk. Slowly we learn from Vinay's encounter with a super hot nightclub singer (Helen!) That the thief Amar is the doppelganger. Many very beautiful women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) are after the hero. The police force, including Vinay's Dad, is completely frozen. Vinay slowly falls to Shalini / Shalu and her brother seems to bless the union. The action moves to Sikkim because that's where Amar's next lift will take place. The rest is for you to watch - the duplicate, the girls, the men who love Vinay's word, he thinks is their boss Amar, the dear brother sister duo - nothing seems right, and it takes the fine story translation (and direction ) by Vijay Anand to finish this story in a highly entertaining way. The movie has many moments that you will be wondering until they are delighted in a great final in a dance in a palace in Sikkim in a big final weave. <br /> <br /> I wasn't a big Vyjayanthi fan, but she's pretty skilled here, though with her chubbiest. She can subtly add to the confusion in the story, but is best when she is sad or dancing. Tanuja is cute as a button and I love her in this movie. I wanted her so bad to get the man. Dev was, Dev, Dev. If he did not deviate like a man with a congenital shoulder (one shoulder always lower than the other), I would wonder who found them to follow him! Yet his style, charm and charisma were infallible. In the song Yeh Dil After Hota Bechara, only Dev can look cool with a fishing rod with a large plastic fish attached! Ashok Kumar was simply fantastic - Dada Moni didn't miss the whole movie and changed it in one for history books. <br /> <br /> SD Burman has magic with numbers such as Baithe Hain Kya Uske Easter (Helen in a crimson cock simulation dance on a bar), Aasman Ke Neeche, Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera, and my personal favorite seductive number Raat Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diye. <br /> <br /> If you want a big story, With more twists and turns than a bunch of people who want to be played, but amused and entertained, go buy or rent Jewel Thief. Better to buy it, you can go back and see your friends again. This one is a custodian.
