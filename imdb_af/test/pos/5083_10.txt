I saw the movie yesterday and was shocked at it, but even more shocked by some of the comments I read here. One person wrote that it was ambiguous if the victim of torture was guilty or not - therefore ... One person wrote that since he was not an American citizen, so ... Some people say that the people in the Middle East hates us and searches us for death, so ... So we say it's right to torture someone guilty of a crime? Are we right to torture someone who is not an American citizen? Do we say it's right to torture someone we hate and want us to die? Do we say that, as written in the Geneva Convention, the Declaration of Human Rights and the United States Constitution say that "torture is wrong, but some torture is less wrong than others?" When does it become "right" to torture? Therefore, this movie is powerful - it is ambiguous, but not about torture. Torture is always wrong, and if we are willing to do so, even in the name of justice and "national security" or "freedom and democracy", then we are wrong and we are angry; We do exactly what we accuse our enemies of doing (and we call them "wrong" in the same breath.) My favorite line in the movie was "if you don't want to compromise on Amnesty International." Alright.
