I read most of the comments here, everyone just saw the mistakes of the movie. I agree, the director, it's not Kuprik, the actors aren't Oscar winners, but it has something that everyone can link to. I don't want to spoil, but tell more than the plot - rounding off the school and traveling to a great festival, or if you want to see outside the metaphor, choose the path through life. Remember those days of the youth? The days when you or our friend acted like the characters? Or do you think you should have acted like one of them and now you're sorry, haven't you? if you can go back in that time and if you can ask yourself any of these questions, maybe the movie is not that bad.
