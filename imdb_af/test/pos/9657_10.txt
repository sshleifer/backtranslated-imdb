I watched this movie for the first time on the Sci Fi channel and I have to say. It was simply fantastic. For those of you who love 'The Never Ending Story', it is one that would bring memories of that movie back. Although it is a 1996 movie, it has an inimitable setting and looks what makes it feel, it's a fantasy. The acting was brilliant and the music was wonderful, especially the starting song and the final song. For those of you who still have to see it, see it! I totally recommended!
