It is truly an Australian cult classic. If you are one of the lucky ones to see it - then you are very happy. It's released in most countries, but not in Australia for some reason. I have a copy on DVD from the UK. Not a good transfer, but I bought it after I saw it at a film festival before. The direction is up and the performances rock! It's a dark movie-and-spectacular movie, but often, very funny in parts. I encourage you to watch this movie, there is a coolness about this that you don't see in 99% of the typical Aussie prize. The script is very well-crafted and sends you on a journey where you know it's going to end badly, but until the last ten minutes you just can't pick that bad. Great work of the four leads, especially Lachy Hulme. <br /> <br /> When all this is said and done: Great work on each other!
