Ronald Colman plays a lost boy. While NOT a bad guy, he is a little flight and he has not done much with his life, except to travel the world and have a very good time. Now that his youngest African enterprise has failed, he is on his way to England. His wealthy upper-class father plans to throw him on his ears, though thanks to Ronald's winning style, he is reluctantly retrieved with open arms. <br /> <br /> At this stage, there are two women in his life-showgirl Myrna Loy and the rich girl Loretta Young (already engaged). How will it all work out and Ronald shows and acts like a responsible adult - these are the main themes of this pleasant little movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie and will definitely not change your life, but it is definitely very entertaining and fun. Most of this is due to the always genius acting of Ronald Colman. Heck, during the boom of his 1930s career, he could have played in REEFER MADNESS or another drink and still made it entertaining and enjoyable because of his charming persona. His seemingly effortless style in this movie makes it very easy to keep him and it's easy to see why both Loretta Young and Myrna Loy fall in love with him in the movie! Plus, the writing is very witty and makes it a nice romantic comedy.
