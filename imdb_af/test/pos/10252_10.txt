Cooley High was actually a drama with moments of comedy. It was a reflection of high school life back in the day. I have Coolidge High in Washington, D.C. from 1976 to 1979, and many of those in Cooley High were a commonplace at Coolidge. In fact, after the movie came out, everyone started Coolidge "Cooley High." On high shooting, chasing girls, cellar parties and battles, high school life for many in D.C. sum up in that day. I can't forget Motown, because Motown music starts and ends a day back in the 70's. The hits just kept on. However, Cooley High adds a layer of humankind to the madness, because when everything was just like Cooley High, my classmates and I had a lot of love for each other. And like the characters in Cooley High, there was life after high school, but there was nothing like waking up every morning and experiencing every day from home to seventh. Thirty years later we are getting ready to celebrate the good times. Cooley High is definitely a period that just gets better with time, because like that or not, the only thing that is off those days is memories, some good and some bad.
