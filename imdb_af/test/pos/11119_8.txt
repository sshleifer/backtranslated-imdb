Celebrity was released a year in the US before I was born; I was too young to ever remember the original version of Fame - yet I heard and read many things. Like the fact that it created a TV series and that its soundtrack was led by the Irene Cara, Giogio Moroder hit 'Fame'. <br /> <br /> Fame was probably the first of its kind to feature the world of performing arts in the form of a feature length movie. The lives, the struggles, the obstacles that the students and some of the teachers undergo were under the eyes of the viewers. <br /> <br /> The shows were great, but one that got my eye in particular was Gene Anthony Ray, who played the tough but promising Leroy. Upset, frustrated and initially rude, his character later becomes less angry and frustrated and more dedicated to his studies - not only with the practicality of the executive, but also in the theoretical. Irene Cara was good as Coco's scene with her blush off while a pervious director filmed her, was rather uncomfortable to watch - as well as Paul McCrane for his incredible portrayal of a vulnerable but dressed gay man who tried deal with life and write to an executive art school in New York after being kicked out of the army when he told him he was gay. Ralph played by Barry Miller was interesting, but sometimes his character dug on my nerves. <br /> <br /> The choreography was excellent, there were some good dance numbers involved and the 'hot lunch' in the cafeteria was worth watching. Another great scene was when the "Fame" song was played and all the kids started running in the streets of New York and danced wildly and without care in the world. It was a street jam like no other. <br /> <br /> The only star ever benefiting from it was and is Debbie Allen - she later became a manufacturer, director and star - although she mostly worked behind the scenes on shows like everyone hates Chris and the fresh prince of bel air. Paul McCrane later died with Peter Weller in the movie Robocop, where he played a villain and ER as the judgmental, unpleasant doctor Romano. <br /> <br /> British director Alan Parker really shot it well, he allowed the artists to dance, act, give their hearts content without affecting and influencing their interference. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film, we see the different stages the students experience during their 4 years - from auditions to man-year, to graduation in New York's High School for the Arts. <br /> <br /> Fame is one of those movies that caters for or is aimed at a particular audience that isn't. It's definitely not for everyone. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it for one because I have an interest in art - not technically as an artist, because I am None but as someone who appreciates creativity and artistic expression It is frightened by hard work, dedication and passion for what one does with their talents. So if you are an aspiring dancer, actor or just someone who is creative, you might be interested in a movie like this - even if the events in Fame are like being in an executive art school / school in the right life, then it is completely different. <br /> <br /> The 2009 remake of this movie was recently released and frankly, it looks virtually alike. <br /> <br /> As far as the original Fame is concerned, it's been nearly 30 years, but it's a bit dated, but it's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a true classic, but as an 80-year-old cult classic, in line with other 80's dance movies, such as Footloose and Flashdance, Fame hits the spot. Isn't it coincidence that all those dance movies start with the letter 'F'? <br /> <br /> Eager, moving and intriguing, this one is worth a watch.
