Considering all the comedies with a military situation done in history, someone had to be the first. One can make a case that invented the genre in shoulder arm Charlie Chaplin. <br /> <br /> It was hard to believe it was a brave move. If you believe some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope, Abbott & Costello, Laurel & Hardy involved, involve military service and have been made during wartime, this is just something you accept and laugh. <br /> <br /> In World War I Chaplin, along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, went out. He was a great supporter of the Allied case, unusual for someone from his left wing view. It seems like the Tramp will be set up and unfortunately, flummox will wander around and destroy everyone. <br /> <br /> Many things you want to see in the service of World War II comedies started in Shoulder Arms. Chaplin no longer has imitators, because within a few weeks of the release of the film, the war was over. <br /> <br /> But a comedic art form was created by one of the greatest geniuses of the comedy.
