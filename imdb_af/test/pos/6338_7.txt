Apart from being a clever and well-marketed variation on today's extremely popular horror genre and an excellent formula for attracting potential new fans in general, I have always regarded as a "supernatural" as a massive giant tribute to the genre. Although not always noticeable to younger viewers and / or people who are only interested in more recent horror movies, each episode contains some clear and subtle references to classic and influential titles. From this point of view, it was only a matter of time before the authors pay tribute to the "creepy vehicle without a driver's kind of movies, and even more specifically the 70's milestones Duel (Steven Spielberg's famous debut) and" The car " . Being an avid fan of these two movies, I enjoyed "Route 666" very much, even in spite of its shortcomings and shortcomings. The episode starts tense and atmospheric on a remote Missouri road, where a black man is being pursued and eventually killed by a threatening monster truck with apparently no driver behind the wheel. The victim's daughter, Cassie, is Dean's ex-girlfriend and she calls the Winchester brothers for help. The brothers cannot prevent two similar "accidents" before the ghost truck is discovered. Sudden presence goes back to a racial dispute of the 60s, involving both Cassie's parents as well as several prominent villagers. Some of my fellow reviewers here tend to call "Route 666" as one of the weaker entries in season one, mainly because the writing is preaching on racial issues and shows another and more emotional side of the Dean's character. He is usually the strong silent type, while confronted with unfinished past romantic affairs. At a certain level, I agree with the racism debate, but it didn't bother me that much. The writers eventually had to give an explanation of the presence of the truck, and racial conflict was so acceptable to me. As far as the Dean's emotional vulnerability is concerned, I can only say that it is wonderful to see how the authors constantly try to give the main characters depth and detail. Dean's behavior towards Cassie actually sheds a whole new light on him. Moreover, what is really in this episode is the miraculous sinister truck and its virulent attacks. It is an impressive and overwhelming vehicle that delivers shining light and flu engine sounds. When you worship the brilliant "Duel" above, you'll definitely find an entertainment in the compelling pursuits depicted in "Route 666".
