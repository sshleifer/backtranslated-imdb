A very good movie, with the emphasis on a very important issue. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is completely preventable. If more families saw this movie, more children might not end up like Adam. Jimmie Smits plays in one of his best roles ever. This is an excellent film that takes a very special family into account with very important needs. It is no different than thousands of families today in the United States. There are kids struggling with this worldwide. The very important point here is that it could all happen. More people need to see and take this movie that it has to say seriously. It's done well, with important messages handled in a graceful way.
