It was a rare treat to see "Check Out". I was touched by the characters, laughed a lot at the wonderful screenplay, and was deeply disturbed by the real emotions portrayed by this ensemble cast especially by Peter Falk. In fact, one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children telling of his experience of his life, his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life ahead is so deep that it is at the highest level. level of the best Oscar-winning performances. He is a perfect actor who did him in this movie. The scriptwriter offers a combination of literary knowledge, timing, a gift for dialogue and hilarious situations that laughed me out loud in the theater. I recommend "Check Out" to anyone who wants an excellent storytelling.
