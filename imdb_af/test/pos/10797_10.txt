In one of the more subtitled films of the late 1980s, at a time when Oliver Stone was tall with Platoon and Wall Street (and before his opus, born on the 4th of July), he wrote and directed this look. the world of radio, specifically one radio station in the middle of Texas. This man is Barry Champlain, in a one-time career of Eric Bogosian, who wrote the original play and also wrote the script. Barry is like a mix of Howard Stern and one of the pundits you hear on the radio stations can turn us off a lot. He has ideas about his thoughts, opinions, and he is not only afraid to talk to them, but also to stand up against the callers. The callers are indeed the driving force in the film, as Barry has to fight the stupid, obscene, racist and the pure absent. As this also happens, he must also fight with his boss (Alec Baldwin) and a hit or abuse countrywide, outside the borders of the southern road station where he is in. <br /> <br /> While feeling the movie I was curious to see how it would have been done on stage (I think it was a one-man show, as Bogosse had several on the side), towards that movie is phenomenal. Famous, almost typecast, as a fast-track director, the unlimited effects of montage, and effects with the style of camera work and other small tricks, giving his 90s films a distinctive, almost authoring look . But in the 80's he had this energy and feverish quality to the look of the movie, and was not as indignant as the other films. To add the proper intensity within the studio and the main space of Barry Champlain, he and DP make Robert Richardson the space that sometimes looks claustrophobic, eager, uncertain and definitely on the brink. The screens in the middle of the movie, when Barry is not in the studio, are fairly standard, but the style with the dust in the radio stations is one of the best I've seen from the Stone / Richardson combination. /> <br /> And one cannot misjudge the performance of Bogosians, who can be stupid, offensive, angry, passive and everything we love and hate in the radio station hosts. There is also a funny, almost distracting support role for Michael Wincott as Kent / Michael / Joe, who calls him one night, and the following are invited to the studio. These scenes are a bit uncomfortable for a viewer, but it gets a lot in the subculture main space of the 80s that Barry is so intrigued as he is critical. The stoner may not get it, but as he tells him, "this is your show". Indeed, it's hard to cover everything in the conversation, and there are a lot of them. But it's never boring, and like Champlain itself, it's not easy to ignore. And when Bogosian climbs into the air in his climate tirade, with the backdrop of a continuous 360-spin, it becomes intoxicating and a reason why freedom of speech is so powerful. Stone is synonymous with a movie maker of hot-button issues, who take on the subject that is still or is controversial, giving them a life-force that is not always wonderful, but is their own. Here his skills and ambitions are not in the way of the Bogosians. It is enhanced, anything, makes an extremely capable vision of what is essentially a close one-man show, which in itself is well written.
