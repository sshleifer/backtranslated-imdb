MY DINNER WITH JIMI is a look at Howard Kaylan's greedy and exciting ride with his 60's Folk Rock band, The Turtles. The Turtles were similar to a 'second-level' act in the 1960s, but the film clearly shows that they can eat, drink and party with the Titans or Hippie Culture. And not only that, they had the musical chops to make it up. Many of the star acts of the era are seen when they interact with the band at work and at stake. It is my only complaint about the movie. Almost from the start of the movie, one can see that it is almost impossible to find actors who can convincingly identify such recognizable stars. Too often during the film, I felt like I was watching an enticing exhibition of false wigs and mustaches. But if you are a fan of the music of The Turtles, or The Swinging 60's in general, this could be the movie for you. And don't forget to see the extras. There is a lot of funny (and insightful) bit by band members, Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan, about their disastrous experiences with managers and agents.
