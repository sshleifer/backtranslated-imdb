Music videos are often completely disregarded in any film discussion, with most people viewing them as a lesser art form. Although a large majority are merely a flashy cut to advertise a popular artist's latest hit single, a precious pair is really raised above the rest, and art works in their own right. Anything directed by Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry is always worth watching. While "art" is not exactly the word I want to use to describe Michael Jackson's "Thriller (1983)," it is an intense hybrid of horror and music, and a scandalous short film that stays quite remarkable 25 years later. The thirteen minute music video, both the longest and most expensive ever at the time of its release, is directed by John Landis, a filmmaker I am not very famous for. However, the Blues Brothers (1980) is a classic, and I hear that an American Werewolf in London (1981) is a wonderful entertaining horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> Whether Thriller really qualifies as a music video is definitely underway for debate. accounted for its extended length (although Jackson improved this effort with 1997's 'Ghosts', at 38 minutes) and the fact that the title song is less than half the total running time. The video begins with a short movie-within-a-movie, like Michael, on a quiet and bright night, revealing to his girlfriend (Ola Ray) that he is "different" from other guys, who are in a horrible werewolf changed. share the night clouds to reveal a full moon. As he probably discovers the unlucky heroine, we come across Michael and his girlfriend in the movie, and actually look at this drama in a horrible picture. When the girl gets scared, they both go out of the theater and go home, after which Michael sings the opening styles of his latest song, "Thriller". However, when a lot of bloodthirsty zombies come from the local cemetery (their access being informed by Vincent Price), the situation is starting to get interesting. <br /> <br /> My finger is hard to fix, Thriller is considered one of the biggest of all music videos. It can't be easy that the song itself is fun, and Michael Jackson ?? although he has since become the bat of all comedies' jokes for his peculiar personality and do? There is no doubt that he is an excellent singer and performer. Perhaps a decent explanation for the movie's popularity is the incredible amount of work that has to go into it; nothing like it has ever been seen, and it remains something of a stranger in the world of music videos. Designed by Rick Baker, the horrific monster-make-up effects are surprisingly graphic for a music clip, though all done with a good sense of fun. Several moments make for an exciting exciting thrill the successful recording of the atmosphere of the films that parody it (though always with a cheesy twist on the regular formula). Simply put, you will never look at a zombie movie again!
