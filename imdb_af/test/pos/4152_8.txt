It's a movie that isn't as much as it is. What is shown is the incredible poverty in Sicily as the 19th century to the 20th place, a lifestyle that makes people dream of the 'New' World of America. The Mancuso family lives in a place that is not even a hamlet, just a stone cottage amidst the hard, inexorable stones of a country that cannot even offer a single green lawn. An opening sequence sees the Mancuso males batting barefoot, on a rocky hill, rocks in their mouths at a sanctuary top in exchange for a "sign" that they must stay or stay for the New World where they are. It also shows life aboard the liner, gathered masses and the conditions in Ellis Island where their journey is not over, they are being questioned and examined to prove their "fitness" to enter America. What is NOT indicated is the ship in Longshot, or indeed any shot that will identify it as a major ocean liner; What is also not shown is anything that America, no clich√© face of New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty, will identify, so Ellis Island can be anywhere in any country. Perhaps the most remarkable shot is one of a camera faucet that looks at hundreds of people who stuck together; Alongside, almost imperceptibly, two-thirds of Screen Left's people are beginning to divorce the third on Screen Right and we realize that the left is actually aboard the ship, and those on the right are on the dock, a powerful composition that is fragmented by society. There is a strong documentary feeling throughout as if we are following a real ship full of immigrants, even though it has been carefully written and it is clearly a fusion of typical families / conditions. With almost nothing happening dramatically, it's not for the popcorn brigade, but for the rest of us it's a very good movie indeed.
