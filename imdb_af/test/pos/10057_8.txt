Nikki Finn is the kind of girl I would marry. Never be boring, always think positive, good with animals. Good, as one reviewer wrote, a bit too much peroxide, lipstick and eyebrows (only Madonna could get away with it). But that's why I love Nikki Finn, it's not your ordinary girl. She makes things happen, always exciting to be around, and always honest. Certainly, she steals, but she robs or kills (unless you get her out). She knows which rules can be broken and which one must obey. She knows what to take and what can't be stolen. If you need her, she is 100%. Bottom line: She knows how to enjoy life. Nikki is always loved (that's why she has a path with wild animals), and totally dedicated to those she loves and who loves her. <br /> <br /> Who is that girl? She's the girl for me.
