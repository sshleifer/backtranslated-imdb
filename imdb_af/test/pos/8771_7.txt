This is the second Hitchcock movie to appear on the list and the second Hitchcock movie I have seen completely, the first was Rope, which I really enjoyed. With Saboteur Hitchcock, more room was available for free, while the rope was all in one room. I didn't enjoy this one as much as Rope, but it doesn't say it's a bad movie, it just looks like an average movie that could be something more. <br /> <br /> It looks like a movie Hitchcock would make a break between its more serious people. As a thriller, I feel it doesn't really get me on the edge of my seat or is engaged to the main character running around the states. The climax of the film feels like a misunderstanding to really boost the tension. The sound design is almost non-existent. You can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them, but the important things are lacking, the sting of the sleeve, the need for music to the stress of tension, everything is missing. Intentionally no doubt, but it lacks the emotional punch you want from such a scene. Then it suddenly ends with empty inside. <br /> <br /> The movie also doesn't feel that it should be, they are almost globe from place to place, but it feels more limited. The script itself is very average and looks like the more blunt ways of moving the plot. <br /> <br /> The performances are there, but nothing great. Everyone plays their parts on written words on the page. The relationship between the two leads is poor and requires more work. The one who stands out is Otto Kruger, who pats that rich, ego, evil persona-down. <br /> <br /> In the end I wanted more of this one. I understand this is one of Hitchcock's least exciting movies, but I watched it well. I can recommend it, just not enthusiastically.
