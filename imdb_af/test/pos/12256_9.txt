... there was "Broadcast News," and what a good thing it was. This one simply stands up and sounds its barbaric yawp in a way that is two decades later. <br /> <br /> There are moments - especially when it comes to pruning grain - when this movie becomes a bit eighty, or a bit too "sleepless in Seattle." Fortunately, they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> One third social satire, one third romantic comedy, one third drama, with three flawed but engaging people in the core, it's clever and moving and almost impossible to funny. Holly Hunter in particular should never be more fun looking into a comic role. (And yes, I include "Raising Arizona," her other star turns out of that era, in this review.) <br /> <br /> A legal classic.
