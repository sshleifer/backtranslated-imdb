I got 13 when Elvis hit the big times in 1956 with his first RCA hit. A year later, Buddy used Holly to compete with the King. One of Buddy's great talents, besides his unique singing style and song writing ability, is often played. Buddy was also a skilled guitarist, who developed a unique rockabilly style on his Fender Strat. Gary Busey tries to capture this aspect of Buddy's persona. There were other contemporary master guitar players of equal caliber, such as Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins and Eddie Cochran, but Buddy's talent is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> As noted by others, Busey is driving the success of "The Buddy Holly Story." Not only does the writing play the facts of Buddy's life, but it even includes several anachronisms for the two years of Buddy's popularity, basically 1957-1959. One who comes to mind is the scene where Buddy and Maria watch a 3-D movie. Buddy is disillusioned with all this and tells Maria that it will never last. It's just a whim. In fact, there were no 3-D movies in circulation at the time. The boom time for 3-D was in the early 1950s. By 1955 the whore had faded. Another example where just a little research would be enough to make the story more credible. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is difficult to divorce what really happened from urban legends around Buddy's career. The story of how the Cricket got their name may or may not be apocryphal, but it certainly did not happen as it is presented in the movie. Another problem with the movie is how Buddy's parents are portrayed. Surely Buddy's parents were supportive of his music career. "Maybe Baby" is credited to Buddy's mother and she had input in writing the song. <br /> <br /> It's good that Buddy's biggest hits were used in the movie, but I don't miss hearing one of my favorites, "I'm looking for someone to love." I am proud that Buddy's music was released for a new generation because of this movie. His legacy is one of the best of the early days of rock and roll. Guess, Buddy, rave on.
