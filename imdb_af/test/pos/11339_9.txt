WHAT AWESOME MOVIE !!!!!!!! I felt out of the theater, stunned. The movie I just saw was one of the best movies I've seen in my life. I glued my eyes to the screen. It is very symbolic, visually pleasing, beautifully shot, and secretly said. It's basically about two people moving into an apartment living next to each other, along with partners, who are adopted to have a relationship with each other's partners. If we accept it, we'll take two heroes out of what they think their partners are. There is a clear suppression of feelings for each other, using vuristic camera work, body language and symbolic stairs. It's a visual feast, and hard to keep up with. Some of the story is slightly confusing, but it's nothing. The end is one of the most beautiful (and anti-hollywood) ends I've ever seen in my life, and visually wonderful. The movie spooky score adds to the mood. I recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and respect. What a beautiful movie.
