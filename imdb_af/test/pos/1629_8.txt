Symbol Eye Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to decipher the secret behind the Illuminati before a new science experiment raises the city. <br /> <br /> The Da Vinci Code broke records in 2006, but for the vast majority of Dan Brown's followers, he did not do his award-winning justice and while running on a good two and a half hours he behaved a lot. <br /> <br /> After reading the book, I was perhaps one of the few people enjoying Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou trying to solve the mystery of the Louvre murder, but the scales are for angels and demons once raised as chieftain and director. <br /> <br /> To ask, most people prefer Angels and Demons to prefer the Da Vinci code for an entertaining read. Critics and fans, while not quite justified, seem to prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 edition. <br /> <br /> This Howard photo definitely has more clinical energy and exercise for it than in contrast to Da Vinci, Tom Hanks's Robert Langdon h as just one night to the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican. solve and, due to the time constraints, the actions and desperation of the ante and a thrill that the Da Vinci code definitely beats, but also a lot of twists and nonsense. rows. <br /> <br /> The interesting factor of this 2009 issue is the constant elements justified for the murders.

As well as trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of electing a new pope, dealing with a new scientific experiment, and the power of religion being present again. All that is interesting to discover and listen to, if the debates and dialogue sometimes diverge, but as it is so much in the novel, was always likely. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard, who honestly maintains the ordinary type of role that plays in Da Vinci, may come back in the worst possible way. His slick moving camera styling does nothing to keep up the pressure, and we can never quite accept what is happening on the screen thanks to this frankly differently styled style. He's definitely not Paul Greengrass and that's not Bourne in any case. <br /> <br /> Slim and stylized, it's faster and more interesting than Da Vinci
