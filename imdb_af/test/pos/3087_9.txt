I remember when I first saw this movie. I was babysitting a friend of my mom and one of the kids suggested we see it. I thought it was the honestly laughable 'Prince of Thieves'. They were in the video recorder, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom. What I got came as a shock, a pleasant one I would admit, but still a shock. <br /> <br /> Now you all know that Robin Hood legend isn't you? I'll explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal and spent money here and there giving it to people who needed it while seducing the beautiful Maid Marion and keeping the Nottingham and Prince John Sheriff busy. These are the basics! Now, with the review. <br /> <br /> This movie was released in 1993, and is a decrease of the entire Robin Hood legend and a p --- in particular of prince of thieves. <Br /> <br /> After the legend, Robin van Loxley follows for the first time in an Arab prison during the third century crusades. And along with a 'Moor' as they are called in those days, he escapes a cunning escape with a cell mate, Asneeze. <br /> <br /> After escaping, Asneeze Robin found his son Atchoo, a foreign scholarship student in England, looking for him. These Robin vows to do! Robin swims back to England. <br /> <br /> He returns to his home, Loxley Castle to roll it off the back of the car through Bailiffs, and goes through his sad revelation that his father, dog, cat, and even the goldfish are all dead. Desperate for a familiar face, he finds the family's loyal blind servant Blinkin sitting on the toilet with a Jazz power in Braille. As with all Robin Hood stories, Robin must destroy the evil plans of Prince John and the sheriff of Rottingham, causing havoc and imposing excessive tax on King Richards' kingdom while he is away. <br /> <br /> Those familiar with the movies that Mel Brooks had previously directed will have some idea of ​​what to expect. After all, it is the man responsible for Dracula death and loves him and young Frankenstein. All the jokes, ranging from visual gags to wonderful, witty comments, are exactly the right places throughout the movie, with no more than a minute of laughter. <br /> <br /> Cary Elwes (coincidentally the only English man to play Robin Hood in a movie), who will get to know many of you from Princess Bride, brings his shaky, grinning shining eye to this movie, and Make a wonderful job. From extraterrestrial heroic attitude, to an evil sexy look, he is really wonderful. And the man looks better in slippers than I do! <br /> <br /> Richard Lewis is hilarious as the bright, arrogant prince John with the ever-changing mole. He gets the sissy-boy behavior into a tea, and his whinging American vocalisations are great. All the way through the film, a mole on his face constantly changes position: it starts on his left cheek, then over to his right cheek, then she knows, then his forehead, before going back to the original place. This is a subtle joke based on the mole on Alan Rickman when he played the sheriff in Prince of Thieves. Roger Rees as the messy sheriff of Rottingham is wonderfully clever and dirty and has some good lines throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There are a few faces here, and you'll be familiar with other Brooks movies. For example, Robert Ridgely, who played the wizard in this role, also played the hangman in Blazing Saddles, another movie by Brooks. He likes to add subtle references to his previous films; With some in this movie, the naughty Brooks fans can easily spot. Those who watched the history of the world part 1 will recognize the music by the song 'Men in Tights'. Also, as Patrick Stewart Marion enters, Mel himself (Rabbi Tuckman) comes out of line "it's good to be a king," one of his lines in the history of the world. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is great comedies, even those with just a few lines bring a great deal of warmth and humor to them. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so hot and funny is, in my opinion, all improvised scenes. Although there were a variety of manuscripts, some plays were completely improvised by the actors themselves, such as the scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) prayed for Rottingham in her bed, and he fell through the ceiling and landed right where she wanted him, what <br /> <br /> There are few special effects, and those there are small but fun moments of computerized cameras. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is unforgettable, with some very funny songs, and some cheesy love songs. You will sing 'Men in tights' for a few days or at least immerse yourself. <br /> <br /> The rating is Pg, which I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the film, except in the use of dual entender, and a statement by sh! T, and violence is minimal. In fact, I'm going so far as not to say, apart from some comedy battle scenes. <br /> <br /> A great fun movie that adults and kids will enjoy!
