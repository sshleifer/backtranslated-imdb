Lady and the Tramp II are very colorful animated, and the songs, especially those of the Junkyard Dogs, are pretty good. However, the family seems even too idyllic, and I can't understand that Scamp is dissatisfied if everything is forbidden. However, I'm also sorry Angel has never had a loving family until she loves Jim and met Darling. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is clear that the original Lady and the Tramp are better than this successor.
