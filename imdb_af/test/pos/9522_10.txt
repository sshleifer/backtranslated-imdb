I always loved French movies because I think they are filled with much more emotion and sentiment than the Americans. This movie is a gem. <br /> <br /> Start with the wedding that is so funny that you just want to join them, and in the end where the little family tells us who is with those who are very funny. Catherine Deneuve is simply warm and so good that it is absolutely possible for a young man to fall in love with her, and Vincen Lindon is perfect for that role. The best scene (except the wedding party) is in the family reunion where Antoine got angry and shouted his feelings to Lea in front of the family. It's so sorry I can't buy this movie from the French and not from English (so I have to learn in French to enjoy it) !!
