For those who appreciate the cutting of silent cinema and social commentary, it's a unique movie. Sharing tribute to German expressionism, sharing allegory, the film is full of visual symbolism and an artistic style that has seen everything since the 1920s. In addition, the attention to period detail and the visual composition of the screens as a tool for promoting the story, stunning. Apart from this, the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its impact on social voice, perception and opinion. In fact, it is not so much the silence that the film permeates, because it is the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and express thinking that inevitably follows. In short, this film is something that is not often seen, and as the film maker in the Q&A follows, reminds you of its meaning the next day.
