full of surprises, beautiful, cruel at times. just like life itself. Ask one for more. Of course, the best parts are the action scenes and pursuits. really wonder how much work these guys do to make some scenes (whale hunting, polar bear hunting, etc.). It's a great experience and shouldn't be missed by anyone diving, surfing or going to the beach. The music is alluring and the story is excellent and played extremely well. Definitely one of the best documentaries ever made and worth not less than a very respectful 10 (for its kind). some of the footage is very cruel and may not be recommended for people with poor stomach (every killer whale is cruel).
