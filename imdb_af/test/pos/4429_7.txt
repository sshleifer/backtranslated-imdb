I think the title of the movie describes it well. If you are looking for a documentary on Louis Kahn and its work, you will have to look elsewhere. although some are covered in this movie. Of course, I almost eat everything I fed, and I don't know much about family history. so i believed what i got from nathaniel and his dad etc is told. <br /> <br /> For this movie, I thought it was pretty good. a little slow and grabbed for attention on time, I wish that nathaniel would have a little more focus on his father's work than his family drama (although a lot of history was interesting, Louis was a bit of a player) . <br /> <br /> It's really a journey through someone's life, and I was happy to take along for the experience. a learning experience for me, and so it seems to the film maker. <br /> <br /> oh, and the footage of some of Kahn's work is * stunning *
