Yes, I'm looking at this show. Because my girlfriend obviously looks at it. Well, at least that's what I tell my friends. But as no one ever knows me, I can say it; I love it! It's excellent garbage TV. <br /> <br /> First there is the panel; Tyra herself, who does not miss a single opportunity to talk about herself, but must be taken seriously, as she is the businesswoman. Then there is Jay Manuel, a sober gay man, very serious and incredibly professional, and Mrs. Jay, an out-of-the-way 'queen' of the cat walker and a damn funny man, and Nigel, self-styled as the only man on the panel. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the performance is a profound look at a level industry, and we need to give it to the producers to show us the inside view, which can also be informative and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Finally, the issue is huge; there is just the right mix of everything; The girls gather in the ego house, their impressions on sets, the competitions themselves and the rating. All these things slip smoothly with just the right size. There are no lengths. <br /> <br /> Of course, there must be other factors that lead to eliminations that we don't see in the shows; The panel consists of capricious divas, extrovert and fast on the bitch; Woe to those who transgress them! But if that is said as long as one participant does not stop on their toes, their judgment is usually fair. I think. <br /> <br /> Give your brain a break; If you can't beat it, join them and enjoy the little reality TV with your loved ones. It will be looking for more, somehow.
