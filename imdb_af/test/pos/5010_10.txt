After watching the series show talk of Talk Show with Spike Feresten, I took a moment to really think wow there are really good performances after 12 after SNL and I was also sad to see that it was only 30 minutes long. His great writing skills helped this show a series of lack of money and helping hands. Electronic Lincoln was hilarious and I really think it would be a good Dark Horse Talk Show. <br /> <br /> I was very happy with the way he handled it and Andy Richtor gave good hints to work with. As you might have imagined, it was a bit shaky but for that time slot it was very good. <br /> <br /> Overall if you are not someone weed or even if you are and you have nothing more important to do than to watch this great piece and enjoy it.
