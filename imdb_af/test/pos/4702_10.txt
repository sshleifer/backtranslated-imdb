Oh so beautiful, oh so tear and so thin. <br /> <br /> Let everything look so superficial, so pale, so meaningless in comparison. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen is not a true saint. <br /> <br /> She is a true human - defective, raw and blunt, but passionate and with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> What I found interesting is that this handful of wretched, miserable people found meaning and laughter. <br /> <br /> What I love most is how the documentary portrayed the polarity of human nature.
