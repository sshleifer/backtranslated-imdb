What makes this low budget production one of my favorite movies? Not joking, I've been watching it 10 times or so and didn't get tired. Is it the soft melancholy throughout the whole thing? Is it similar to classic like "Niagara"? I thought about it for a long time. And found out: I think it is: there is no hero, there are only people. Some try to be good. Some have risen to be good. Some are hopeless cases, but still carry the point of being human. This is the story of a catastrophic night in a motel at the end of the world. One way the disaster is nothing but the end of a chain of coincidences. The other way this night reveals the logical consequences of these people's lives because they cut off the rest of the world in a certain constellation. It has something of a Dostoevsky story.
