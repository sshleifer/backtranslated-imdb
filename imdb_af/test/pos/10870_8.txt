Yesterday, for the press at the Roma film festival, "N-io e Napoleone" is easy to love. First of all, it can count on large production values, like many Italian films these days, with wonderful settings and costumes. The role play is also good. Director Virzì constantly speaks of the young head Elio Germano as a young De Niro. Now, of course, he is going too far, but surely the boy can act. I loved his performance, and he did a good job with the (Tuscan) accent. Daniel Auteuil is a good actor and performed very well like Bonaparte. It's really great to see him in Italian, and I hope to see him work again in Italy soon. The supporting role-play also worked well - people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore may seem unlikely, but they all performed well. Even Massimo Ceccherini, known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy TV reality shows, was well equipped and was actually funny. The lower point of the cast was the "Diva" Monica Bellucci. Certainly, she was slightly better than usual, but she managed to look (and sound) completely unnaturally, even in the part of Baronessa Emilia, in which she, with a good dose, herself used irony her own umbro accent. The script, by veteran Furio Scarpelli and Virzì itself, is clever, with very loud lines and a few very emotional moments. Sure, the end surprised me. The message is kind of ambiguity: the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hatred, but if you get closer, you will learn that the object of your hatred is still a small person like everyone else, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes pathetic, so it suddenly becomes difficult to hate him; then it has said in the last few minutes that it would be better to shoot him in the beginning. Personally, I like this idea a lot. "Io e Napoleone" is still a pleasant movie, the best presented at the festival so far (the other is Fur and the Hoax). My rating is 8/10
