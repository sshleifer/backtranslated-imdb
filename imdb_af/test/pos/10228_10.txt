I'd like to tie up a little between NightBreed, The Fury, and the X-Men Series, such as the way the second Outer Limit's Series would tie, especially stories and plot lines, to create a story. Arc though one was never intended. I also want to know if there is more information - anecdotal or otherwise, about the relationship and / or collaboration between Clive Barker and David Cronenberg. I simply can't think of David Cronenberg appearing as a mere actor in a Clive Barker movie. Is there additional information on the subject? Lastly, it's been 17 years since the film was released, and I was hoping there would be a sequel now. Does anyone out there know if there were any plans in the making that never came about, or if there were even plans for a sequel?
