I first played 98 or 99 when I was with my friends. I thought the game was really good and loved it. <br /> <br /> The game is simple. In one player mode, you go around James Bond and complete missions in different places like an Arctic desert or a city. My favorite was one with a tank. In two players, you and a friend choose from any character you want and go out with a fight. the area you are in will help you ammunition and weapons. From handguns to guns to lasers and even your fists work. <br /> <br /> Again with player two, there are many places to go and some to be unlocked. I find this game very nice, but also very exciting. Because you never really know where your opponent is, and it is amazing to see them behind a door where you are going. <br /> <br /> This game will be **** (1/2) stars or from ***** Very good! Go play it somewhere!
