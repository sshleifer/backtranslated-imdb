East Side Story entertain and inform about an unknown part of the Cold War history. What is the purpose of any documentary? To inform the reader by comments and footage. This one succeeds both. You will never get many movies the cuts come in here, because some of them are destroyed and some are inaccessible. <br /> <br /> You get music and music from East Germany, Russia, and other Soviet-controlled countries. It shows you that the people who made these movies, and the people they watched, all look at the same things a Westerner would look for. These are beautiful women and men who sing and dance with the smile and (hopefully) white teeth on the streets.
