It's really a funny movie. His dance scene done with the band is one of the funniest scenes I can remember. I thought the "I'm gay" scene at high school graduation is a bit surreal, though it was funny. While watching it for the third time, I started picking up on a tiny little segment I missed. One was when Matt Dillon's girlfriend, a classic dieter, tried to use a phone she had never used. Kevin Klein made this film successful with Tom Selleck. It was also the first time I could appreciate Debbie Reynolds; She proved she could be funny. She confirmed it in the TV series Will and Grace. One discovery I found after the third show is Lauren Ambrose of '6 Feet Under' fame. She stands out with her red bang, but it is clear that this is one of her first films. Bob Newhart is also very funny about the high school principle.
