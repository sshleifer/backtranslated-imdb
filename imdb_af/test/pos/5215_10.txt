This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the good performance by Cole. This is the story of a highly trained military man, unhappy with his wife and children, decaying his demise and leaving with the other woman. To support her in the way she is used to, he robs banks. Predictable but not a bad watch.
