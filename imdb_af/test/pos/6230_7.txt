"Tourist Trap" is one of my favorite late 70's / early 80's horror flicks. A group of young people are on their way somewhere, a few in the car ahead, and the car has an apartment and our movie opens with the young man Woody pushing the tires and looking for a petrol station. He finds a seemingly deserted place, but hears voices and investigates and ends with a piece of pipe through his stomach for his efforts. Together, the rest of the young people (in a VW Thing) and Woody's friend come up and find the same place, Slausen's Oasis, or something. And then Mr. Slausen happens while the girls dip into the stream. Of course, the VW Thing at that time died mysteriously, so Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors) offers his help. Mr. Slausen has a museum, with many wash figures, and he lives in the museum, but behind is a big house, where he says Davey stays. And who is Davey? Why, Davey Crockett, he says ... but if it were Davey Crockett, they would all probably be safer. The girls are left alone while Slausen is going to help determine the car, but of course the curiosity gets the best of one. She is going to investigate, and find the house full of creepy mannequins and a rather animated one named Davey. What follows is a terrible night of terror as one by one, they are captured by Davey, who says he is Slausen's brother. One girl (previously kidnapped) is treated to a plaster face, leading to her death when it covers her air supply. Anyway, there is a little doubt about this and kind (but strange). Mr. Slausen is not exactly what he seems to be. A good, creepy late 70's horror flick, and many mannequins make for a very creepy atmosphere. 7 out of 10.
