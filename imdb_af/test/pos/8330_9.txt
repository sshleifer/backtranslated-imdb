We bought the DVD of "Walking with Dinosaurs" and was almost ecstatic about the things that were done so well. <br /> <br /> Today, many DVDs offer the bare minimum ... the feature itself, and perhaps another language (which doesn't help the viewer at all, but makes it easier for the company to play the DVD in various markets. see). <br /> <br /> Not so in the case of WWD. There are so many great extras and well thought out vignettes that even look the * navigation menu * interesting. The intros for each chapter in "The Making Of" DVD are extremely funny. The quality of the audio and video is great. And of course, the story and content ... the more a dinosaur lover can ask? <br /> <br /> I watched most of the version broadcast on TDC (told by Avery Brooks) and then watch half the DVD (told by Kenneth Branaugh). As far as I can tell, the broadcasting version in a number of mostly American snake terms slipped into the narrative (ie in a section on T. Rex mating, Branugh says, "the woman is tired of the man's attention. "and Brooks says," The honeymoon is over ") and cut some of the closer-in-puppetwork. I prefer the Branugh version simply because it is more complete. <br /> <br /> Overall, great value and great production. many kudos to the BBC and the crew who made this jewel.
