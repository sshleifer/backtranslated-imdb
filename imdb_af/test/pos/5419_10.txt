Just went to YouTube and finally watched this Oscar nominated animated short story by Richard Condie. I used to look at his funny ones. In this one, Scrabble plays a few. The woman shook her eyes while her husband had nothing but E's on his side. The woman goes for a while to overpower her bed and bathroom (!) Before she sees her husband on her side. Shortly before that, the man catches a TV show called "Sawing for Teens" with the stars that saw something and the man got his own saw. The program is interrupted by a special report of a nuclear war that happens (the newman is a skeleton here), as everyone is panicking even though the man has fallen asleep at this time and thinks a parade is going on while He and his wife continue to argue about the game ... There are many other bizarre things going on before the touch comes. Very hilarious and worth seeing for any animation buff out there. Can't wait for more animated shorts from Mr. See Condie.
