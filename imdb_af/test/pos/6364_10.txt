does anyone know why this movie is called the bank trip? I just watched it and am still not sure why this title was chosen, the movie was very funny and it is probably my favorite Dan Aykroyd show, even the Ghostbusters' performance I have never heard before, I still have never heard of the movie before I saw it in a sears store. I read the back and thought it sounded good, so I bought it and when I finally got the chance to see it, I thought it was better than I originally expected. this movie prices as good as animal house and national lampoon's holiday in my mind i wish comedies that came out lately were written as well as this one was nothing sad happening in it and the bad things that happen happen also funny parts as someone else this way and would like to read a comedy script for a movie that doesn't have a sad situation in it, email me at killer2511@hotmail.com
