The third film of the Polish brothers is their best, most beautiful, imaginative film. Although many audiences will have a problem with Northfork's lack of traditional dramatic structure, "Stick with it, Jack!". The plot is hard to summarize, so just know the story includes: agents trying to evacuate a city, God in a cowboy hat, selling angel wings, and being sick (but it all works) . M. David Mullen's extraordinary photography makes almost every frame exciting and wonderful to watch. The performances of the actors, working with the Polish Brothers' inspiring offbeat script, are perfect and give the film its emotional punch. The strong-will-heard member will be moved by the mythology and people story of the story, the comic and moving actors, and ultimately the incredible courage and command that Michael Polish shows behind the camera. Again, all these incredible and seemingly diverse elements come together wonderfully in one of the most incredible things you need to experience and experience. A great, fantastic, movie !!!
