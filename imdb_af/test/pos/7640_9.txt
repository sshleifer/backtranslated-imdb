I don't see why all the people give this movie negative reviews !!! I loved this movie! Bled is a form of abstract art, and if you don't appreciate art, I can see why you don't want this movie. It was a great turn from the average, played vampire movie. If you're looking for a new, new and inventive new vampire movie, then that's for you. But if you want one of them to go into bats, wolves and melts in the sun, watch your old Dracula flicks. Sure, it's a bit on the low budget, but they did a good job with the budget they had. I am very happy to have found this movie because I was about to give up on the vampire genre for good. I thought this movie was brilliant! I give 2 inches to the author, director and everyone involved in the film.
