A brief overview without any spoilers. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at the Cannes Film Festival yesterday. My first reaction is one of wonder and happiness. I'm so happy movies like this are made in our age of blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Roy Andersson's new movie "You, The Living" is nothing short of a complete masterpiece. You, The Living are made up of about 50 vignettes filmed with a static camera. I will not give away the content of the screens here, because I hate to spoil even the smallest details. But yes, most of the screens absolutely amazed and surprised the 1000 people in the Claude Debussy Theater. When the film was over, we finished for a few minutes. We had no choice. <br /> <br /> So what's the score with "You, The Living". Hm, Andersson is not afraid to tackle the heavy questions; History, guilt, gand The Holocaust during World War II is big subjects (and these themes work very well together.) <br /> <br /> The images created are brilliant, the depth sometimes exceeds "Songs of the Second Floor". <br /> <br /> Well, sorry for this ranting, praise. Watch out for the Flying House in the beginning people! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars - a masterpiece (I never throw this degree out).
