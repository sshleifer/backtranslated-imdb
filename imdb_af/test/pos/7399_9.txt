Where to start, I like the terrible snow monster called Jack Frost. The whole concept works well for me, we thought he would be back and he was. Changing the local to a tropical resort works. See old friends and meet new characters. Scott MacDonald does a good job as Jack Frost, you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain, you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance. Yup, Jack Frost 2 is a welcome successor who is better than the first. I have one complaint, the little Jacks or the Jacklings as I call them. They looked like puppets. I think they could have worked better with the Jacklings, the mouth could have opened wider, but the CGI was good and overall the whole movie was worth watching. If you like JACK FROST, then you will keep this successor. No questions or debate, 9 GREAT STARS.
