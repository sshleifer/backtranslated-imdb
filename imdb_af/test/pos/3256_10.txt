So I switched on a Sunday at 1am on a Sunday, and expected to see crap and infomercials. This big movie just started, didn't know what it was, but almost pulled me off right away. That movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> There were a few things that didn't make sense for one. I don't get why the dead guy is talking about things to get yourself out of your bad situation, but then Jimmy does nothing but the basic things to survive what someone in his situation would do, in other words it wasn't she initiative that got him out of his bad situation. It was just luck. Secondly, I don't get to kill the thing about the girl at the end of the gangs, because the whole thing is partly killed by the thief, who steals the Panda's money, and then the other thief is dead, so they are money twice and kill him how is it good
