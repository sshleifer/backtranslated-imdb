Ignore the bad reviews here, this movie is great! "Just Before Dawn" is a good example of what can be done in a movie with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent writing and a cool idea for a movie. It's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it much more than most other 80's because the killer is so unique. "Wrong turn" ripped off this movie of something fierce! There is a lot of blood and scarce. My girlfriend was provoked and she looked almost everything with me and flinch. It has that creepiness for it. <br /> <br /> I want to say that "Just Before Dawn" is the best early 80's shooter. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, kids.
