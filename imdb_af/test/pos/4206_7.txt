Another pleasant Warner movie. I really liked John Garfield in here, but I wonder why Cagney wasn't in the role. Maybe it was too similar to ENGLISH WITH FIRE FACTS? I mean it is also another Dead End Kids story of all kinds, but I really appreciated them and this movie has a very nice comic touch with some good serious drama. The boys work well with Garfield. A good sequence was the whole "swimming" scene that started without caring, but the wind came too close to the disaster. <br /> <br /> One negative comment: Claude Rains was very displeased. As a detective, the fine actor was here as a nun in a whore house.
