It is a very pleasant, fluffy, glamorous 40s musical. 'Cover Girl' made Rita Hayworth (formerly the dark-haired Latin senorita Margarita Cansino) in a bona fide, all-American star. This confirms Gene Kelly's wonderful talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. It embodies the exuberance and color of the musical genre. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth is wonderful like Rusty Parker - it's her photo, and her presence is always at the forefront. Her song is baptized, but her dance is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with Kelly. I think Rita is highly underrated as an actress - she plays every scene excellently here. Gene choreographed the dance series (he is basically given virtually complete creative freedom here), and his 'Alter Ego' dance number is wonderful. Such works of art. The views are 'Make Way For Tomorrow', 'Put Me To The Test', and of course 'Long Ago and Far Away'. The plot is rather thin, but it does have moral. It's about the dangers of quick fame and quick money, and how any happiness with only these factors will eventually be doomed. It will arouse you, lift you up on your feet and make you laugh. <br /> <br /> It is said, "Cover Girl" is not the greatest musical ever produced - it has a number of errors that need to be addressed. One can say that a bit of Phil Silvers goes a long way. His character becomes rather boring. However, I was impressed with his dance ability and how he could keep up with Gene and Rita. Another big problem is that too many songs just aren't as good. The 'Cover Girl' number looks fantastic, but I'm not a fan of the lyrics or the song. 'Poor Tom' is a big downer. I think it's one of the worst numbers I've heard in a 40's 50s musical. It stinks. The grandmother's subplot boundaries to be ridiculous. But that's just my opinion. Others may like these elements. <br /> <br /> However, apart from the flaws, it's a very, very good movie, much better than most of the product being cut out today. The dance and singing are sublime, the production values ​​are excellent and the mood is contagious. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
