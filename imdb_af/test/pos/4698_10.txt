As listed and stated in many previous comments, this unique range has many excellent elements and ingredients to its credit. In fact, more than 20 years after it was originally transferred, it is still being watched and watched and has a huge worldwide fan-track, suggesting that the makers of this series have undoubtedly succeeded. <br /> <br /> The root of the series's brilliance and remarkable appeal, however, is that it is based on wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters ?? which are all brought to life by wonderful actors. The characters are especially wonderful because of their complexity. Contrary to many other Robin Hood adaptations, and indeed many other film and TV productions in general, the good guys in this series often make mistakes and can be seen to have obvious errors while the bad things, however, are and ruthlessly. , can be understood regularly and sometimes even look sympathetic. In this regard, Robin of Sherwood makes a story about multicolored, real people? rather than good and bad people? something that contributed greatly to his uniqueness and remarkable appeal. Even though it is quite an action pack series that contains many amazing stunts (which in itself are noticeable as it has been made long before today's computer animation, green screens, etc.), behind each of those endless guys falling down castle walls, horses and fire, there is actually a real person who has fallen off at a castle wall or horse or caught fire), there is always wonderful dialogue between the different characters in each episode. However, in the final analysis, is it usually the series' bad things ?? Nickolas Grace as The Sheriff of Nottingham, Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne, and Philip Jackson as the Abbot Hugo de Rainault ?? who gets the very best lines and who steals their shoulder more often than not with their arguments. "It's a wedding, not a feast!" is just one of their many timeless "pearls of wisdom" that one looks through life :-). <br /> <br /> Twenty years after the fact, it is indeed hard to believe that Robin of Sherwood was originally made for television ?? and apparently not with a lot of money? To briefly offer Saturday afternoon entertainment for small children in Great Britain. Filmed in beautiful places, with clever, wonderful scripts and with remarkable stunts and fantastic actors ?? Many of whom show their lives in this show? It has been made more professional in many ways and has more production value than many Hollywood movies.
