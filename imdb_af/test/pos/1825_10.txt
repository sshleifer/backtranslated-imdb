Valley Girl will always hold a special place in my heart: I'd say it's definitely the best of the 80's teen sex comedies, but it's a competitive compliment. It's a good movie, period. It's very specific in time and place - nearly twenty years later it's a wonderful snapshot - but its story stays timeless. (It is just Romeo and Juliet, minus death!) Nicolas Cage is wonderful and shows all the early promise that he seems to have disappeared on the remaining action krapa. Deborah Foreman is the revelation of this movie, and I can't believe she didn't continue to have a bigger career; someone rediscovered her QUICK. It is sweeter and softer than most movies of the genre. The required nudity is subject to contractual obligations. And while it's not groundbreaking, it's definitely nice to see this kind of movie that respects its characters and not its cross-level young girls to have fun - even Foreman's best-friends crew, deceived by peer pressure, never become villains not offered. (Indeed, her friend Stacy, forced to double with Cage's friend Fred, has a good time despite her protest and w / Fred in the back seat.) It will take you back in the early 80's if you were there , but it is pretty good today. Warning to those who are unfamiliar with the movie: do not look at one of VH1's seemingly ongoing performances - go into its unmerited glory. Otherwise, you lack the movie's most powerful, time-specific dialogue. And one can't write about Valley Girl and don't mention the fabu soundtrack of the 80's songs. Most of them are through striking wonders, which are not just an integration of the sense of time and place in this movie, but thematically favored. See it - wonderful little movie! Go shur !!
