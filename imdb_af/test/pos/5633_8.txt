I enjoyed this one because I can connect to it. <br /> <br /> Once in my life I tried to make movies, and I had a lot of the same problems. Mark Borchardt tried to make HIS film. And I also went through a prolonged period of self-absorbed arrested development, where I refused to grow. But then, miraculously, I married and had children. I realized it was a struggling movie maker, probably not feeding my family. So I got a decent job and did what I needed to make it happen. That's what an adult, responsible adult does. <br /> <br /> Mark has not yet faced reality, so he is a delayed adolescent in the sense. For this reason, there is a hopelessness about him. Like Don Quixote, he seems so improper and self-conscious that he doesn't realize how bad he is. The viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle. Mark has children and an ex-wife and accounts to pay, but the film shows him caring, but basically just to pursue his "artistic vision". <br /> <br /> Despite this, Mark comes in the movie as a beloved individual, surrounded by a very interesting family and group of friends. Unfortunately, Mark has many of the things needed to succeed in life as well as in a career: maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, prioritization, financial complaints, etc. Yet, like Ed Wood, he has no clue. <br /> <br /> I think we should be encouraged by the spectacle of the "never say" attitude of this noble individual who is struggling with the opportunity. And man, what chance is there! Kiefer Sutherland, Colin Hanks, Tori Spelling and Angelina Jolie are all descendants of big-time movie or TV people; No doubt, they will all want to lead a day if they are not already. How much room is there for an independent like Mark? It's like watching a man with a plate hit himself in the head, over and over. Think about it, it's pretty close to what happens to one of Mark's actors, with the kitchen cabinet door, in one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in any movie. <br /> <br /> Despite these concerns and apparent criticism, I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone. Uncle Bill is wonderful. I have a friend who met both Mike and Mark and he told me that the guys in real life did exactly the way they appeared in the movie.
