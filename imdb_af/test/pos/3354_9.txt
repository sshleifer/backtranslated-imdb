The first time I saw "Alice in Wonderland, an X-rated Musical Comedy", was in a movie theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember having enjoyed it very much, although we wonder why all the "goodies" were covered in different colored spots and why the movie suddenly jumped from one scene to the next and made us guess ... just missed us has. It was obvious that it was the soft-core (chopped) version, which left me with the desire to see it again soon, but in its original integral version. Well, over 20 years have passed, during which I forgot all about this movie and just a few days ago, with a great chance, I stumbled upon a heavily used VHS copy (which saw better times: ' some washed-out colors, scratches and some flaws), but guess what? This is the original uncut version and this time I really had a ball! Humor, music and pornography may sound an uncomfortable combination, but in this case, it really and unlikely that the vast majority of boring porn flicks are entering our screens these days. It's a very entertaining and entertaining sex fantasy that won't disappoint you. . The direction is smart, the quick editing makes the movie fly like a bird, all the famous characters love it or just funny, all the actors look nice, the songs are striking. sung by Alice at the beginning of the movie and the hilarious "What is a pretty girl like you do on a knight like this?", the dance numbers are well choreographed and staged (incredibly energetic Terry Hall proves she can also dance and she's enthusiastically dancing away, don't worry, she also does what she knew best ... ... the play, the song, the set, the costumes are of quality and then ... there is Kristine "Blue Eyes" DeBell, in the first lead of her career and (oh son!) She does have a few HC rows! Personally, I think they are absolutely not unpleasant, on the contrary, they are spontaneous and pretty awake. She is young and (ohhh! ) So beautiful; With the help of her new friends in Wonderland she discovers her body and her sexuality, she sings, she dance and ... what do you expect? She also experimented with sex! The closing order, when she finally made love for her son-friend is extremely well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the movie. I think her "physique du role" (the innocent blue eyes and captivating smile) and her acting ability make those explicit rows more acceptable and actually very enjoyable. There is a lot of sex in (this) Wonderland and everybody is eager to "get busy" with the first available boy (s) or girl ", which means a lot of hard work has to be seen. On the other hand, some close-up shots, clearly "spiked", just to make the "pornhounds" really happy, are a bit redundant for my personal taste. Generally speaking, however, the sex action is not offensive as it is handled with a great deal of humor and it mixes almost seamlessly with the music, the dances and the comedy. If you think you and your partner can handle graphic sex, watch it together. Take my word, you'll have an hour and a half very good time (maybe even an extra action after the show ...). This is 'Adult Entertainment'. So be careful, do not leave this video or between other children's videos. If you are 10 years old, he may surprise himself, but you will be forced to embarrass the reasons why "this" Alice behaved completely differently to the one he had in Lewis Carroll novel or looked at the video of disney I bet, you won't soon forget this "one-of-a-child" soon. It's a real shame they can't do that anymore ...! I give it a 9 out of 10.
