Don't look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bad rap due to its cheap quality and bad acting. Sure, this is not a masterpiece by anyone's standards, but it is a very fun B-movie with lots to offer and even a few Greek scenes that stay in your head. <br /> <br /> As I said, the acting could have been much better, but that's the case with the most exploitation so I can't really complain. The story is clever and has some great plot points that will make you guess. I thought the gore was fun too. There's just something good about older gore movies because they didn't have CGI back, so they had to set up everything themselves. See this one for a good time!
