I've never heard of this movie, but I love Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown and the story sounds interesting, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I found it very pleasant. Heath Ledger plays a 19-year-old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start a serious dough. So he's going to work for gangster Bryan Brown. I won't go into details, but things go bad for Ledger and get in serious trouble with Bryan Brown. Some of them on the movie are getting better and better, with one scene joining Ledger with a few bank robberies. And don't forget the beautiful Rose Byrne, who plays Ledger's love interest. I would definitely recommend this movie.
