This movie is good in its genre and that genre is of course action with a small / average budget. Van Damme seems to deliver much better performances if he is a good director who leads him. There is your basic bar noise, rose scene and mostly gun rifle. Some basic drama, but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentinee leads an OK action movie if you ignore the bad plot and the holes in it. But the person stealing the show is: <br /> <br /> Scott Adkins. How come, this guy is not a massive Arnold Schwarzenegger caliber action star I don't know. Director Isaac Florentine made a movie with Scott Adkins before calling Special Forces (2003), which has an incredible martial artist who will satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiastically. Another amazing Scott Adkins feature is undisputed 2. Go this guy out and make a noise, this guy needs a super-action star status and he has to get it now! <br /> <br /> What else can I say about the movie? Van Damme carries a notch out of his most recent work. No Oscars here, but you already knew it. But all the less it is a nice village and I can find worse ways to spend my time. So I give it a solid 7 out of 10 in its genre.
