Sam Elliot is brilliant as a tough San Francisco detective Charlie Fallon. When his mate is killed while hitting, hitting, with an informant, Fallon, the informant kills and drops his body into a river. The next day, Fallon is assigned a newcomer and the task of investigating the informants' murder. Sam Elliot does a good job of portraying a man who is tortured by the blame for his own murderous actions and saddened by the death of his mate who may have become involved in police corruption.
