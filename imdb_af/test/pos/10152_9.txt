This movie is the one in which you fall in love. Alfred Hitchcock will always stay on top of any directors of his time. The most influential aspects of his films are sheer Simplicity & Gripping Drama. The other best thing about Hitchcock's movies is a Definite & Gripping End. <br /> <br /> Anything that is said about "The Man who knew too much" is less. The Cinematography, Acting, Dialogs & Camera Works are beautiful in this movie. The song "Que Sera Sera" at the end will remain in our memories for life. The movie is so nice from start to finish that we never know when it ends. Hardly will Hitchcock include humor in his films, this film has comic scenes that fit the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely brilliant and as good as Vertigo.
