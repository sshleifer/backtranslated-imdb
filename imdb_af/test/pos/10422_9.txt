Wow, I saw quite a bit of Kelli McCarty tonight. I didn't know this woman made so many soft wings for the past three years. It's like seeing a future soft-flowered star flower ahead of me, as Michelle Hall did a few years ago. <br /> <br /> "Passion's Peak" is the third quality soft spot movie I saw in Kelli McCarty, with "Girl for Girl" and "House of Love" being the other. "Desire and Deception" was okay, but it wasn't spectacular. There are spoilers in this review, so just read if you want. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Christina (Kelli McCarty) coming out of the big city and the mountains. She inherited a house from her beloved grandmother, and plans to change it into a mountain home. Before she can even do her things, a woman named Kim (unreasonably in this movie, but the aggressive one) starts to book guests to stay there. Now she must get the house quickly in shape - in Chip (Bobby Johnston), a childhood, comes to the rescue. Chip helps her get the house in working order. She hires two local slackers to work in her home - Chip's sister Bait (Samantha McConnell) and her partner Hank. <br /> <br /> Now the guests are starting. The first is Eric and Linda (Flower), two stereotypical money-first lawyers. Linda and Eric are caught halfway through the film in a dinner, which leads to their actions; sad things there. Next is novelist Sophia, played by B-film Monique Parent. She uses the crazy alias Scarlet Johansing again and this time she has a very professional look - of course with blonde hair. It wouldn't be Monique if she didn't have at least one scene where she was playing with her - and she forced on one of Eric's and Linda's sex scenes. <br /> <br /> James and Shene (Devinn Lane - You, the porn star Devinn Lane) also show off for a little weekend. Unknown to Shene, James and Christina have quite a history. James and Christina have come to date, but Christina broke it to go to this mountain house. James comes to the lodge to get Christina back, but his plan goes back. Christina rinses the beans to Shene, causing Shene to step on him and to the local bar to tally for the locals. Shene ends up in the sleeping bag of the renowned Eric, and they go along. Aas realizes that she wants something more than just sex with Hank, and Christine finds true love with Chip, with Sophia sucking it all in and writing it in her next romance novel. <br /> <br /> In fact .... if you ask me, this whole movie was like a novel novel. I don't know if the scriptwriter went for it, but I probably got the impression. Sophia had some of the best lines in this film, and expressed the idea that it was a romance novel. She looks all the battles and boots going on. <br /> <br /> Now to the sex. There was a fair amount of it, and that was the usual stamping and grinding. Monique did her fair share of groaning in her two sex scenes. This film was inferior, and the story would really interest the audience between the sex scene. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Monique was simply Monique. From all the soft-actresses I saw The years she's best to act. She says she can really act and be sexy. keep her on the # 1 position in my Skinemax Top 10. Kelli McCarty is better off doing soft-motion films than she's the soap opera "Passions", I don't know why she's no longer doing this. Most in a limited role Samantha McConnell remains impressed and Devinn Lane is another hardcore actress who crosses Sex: B (It was good but not spectacularly spectacular.) Lots of moaning. rated. version, trust me .... most of the good things are pulled out. My grade is for the uncut version. <br /> <br /> Story: B (A solid story he throws in a confronted "Ooh, the building inspector is going to shut us down" subplot to the end that sets things apart. The underlying story between Christina and James was nice, and Sophia's dialogue, full of metaphors and images usually found in romance novels, was a fun touch.) Overall: B + (I found this movie It's not a sure fire. Softcore Hall-Of-Famer like Girl for Girl, but it is a respected addition to the Skinemax collection.)
