Pink Flamingos: A Representation of the Past Past <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos, a movie by John Waters in 1972, is a very disturbing portrayal of the negative impact a traumatized childhood may have on the future . Babs Johnson grew up in a very non-typical home. Blatantly, you can see the impact it has on society through its actions until the end of its dogs. Was this movie just a sick and twisted perversion of endless humming incidents, or was it symbolic of something deeper? The side of the first would be the easy way out and, on the other hand, the latter may look dementia but possibly true. The film does, however, have a credible deal with the real events of our society. Every leader we consider to be "terrible" as humans, has similar characteristics to those of Babs Johnson. Ivan the Terrible, Genghis Khan, Adolph Hitler, and Joseph Staling all had "difficult" childhood. Babs Johnson had a disturbing childhood and is therefore associated with the same class as all the previous rules. That's why many of her actions throughout the film can be regarded as disturbing. But her actions were her own fault or society to grow her as she did. Furthermore, each character in this movie represents either a previous leader or event. Another coincidence is Edith's obsession with eggs. With an open mind, it can be tied up in the genocide and Hitler's attempt to exterminate the Jews. Some consider Hitler as a genius, others are a crazy man. John Waters had seen him as a madman because his representation, Edith, was indeed mentally ill. Edith's son Crackers and traveling companion Cotton are symbolic of what was wrong in our own backyard, slavery. Both names are snake terms that represent a period that most of us will forget. Theses characters are essential because it indicates that our society in some countries sometimes was not better than what we often see as terrible acts of social onslaught in other cultures. The fowl ** king scene is the hallmark of what was wrong in this society in our society and is still wrong. Chicken, is a 1970s song term for woman. Therefore, it may be that John Waters is trying to bring the subject of rape through Cotton and Crackers actions. The antagonist family, if a single antagonist in this film can be determined, was the Marble's. Marble is often referred to as wealth. Therefore, it can be symbolic of the struggle between the poor and the wealthy who are still fighting today and will probably continue. Pink Flamingos is a monumental film for his disturbing scenes, but must also be noted for his camouflaged political agenda that Waters displayed so well in its entirety.
