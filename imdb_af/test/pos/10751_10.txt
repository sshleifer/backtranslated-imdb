I really enjoyed this old black and white talkie. Initially I didn't recognize Harold Lloyd as Mr. Cobb, a missionary to China coming home to find a woman. There were many twists and turns in Mr. Cobb's efforts to clear the city hall. His methods of making the punishment fit the crime will probably be illegal, but it's not a reality-based movie. It would be a perfect movie for kids, except that there is a female nudity (Grace Bradley only)! The old phones are captivating. The only mistake is a typical problem of the day - Caucasians are used to represent Chinese men. This is offset by the positive way in which the Chinese are portrayed. They are the wise, good and friendly guys. Trivia - A ruminant truck appears in the movie when Black Marias police are out.
