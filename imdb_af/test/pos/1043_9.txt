While it's not "perfect," it's close. Love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Green Street, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Superman's Chief of Police), Housekeeper, Waiter at Felix Restaurant, and Judge ...... I can continue. This movie has become part of my family's holiday tradition since I was a youth, and my children also grew up with it! "The baby swallowed the watch" was always my son's favorite line. <br /> <br /> Sexy Barbara Stanwyck in trousers and gowns joined the show with the hug, funny S. Z. Sakall. Dennis Morgan also has some good songs. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and suggest that you overshoot the remake (blah).
