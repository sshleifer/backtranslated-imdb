After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, nurse Betty is a fresh air. The movie is like no other I've ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can disturb more than photos of men and women and how they engage in sex (his previous two films were the brilliant In the Company of Men and the almost brilliant Your friends and neighbors). Ren√© Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when experiencing the brutal death of her asshole man (LaBute starring Aaron Eckhart), and in a fantasy world. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play the men who killed her husband and are now on trial. The trick for the movie is that Freeman and Zellweger are actually parallel characters. While Zellweger falls in love with the image of the attractive and polite dr. Dave Ravell on a soap opera, idealizes Freeman Betty. Nurse Betty is a brilliant movie, full of life, humor, love and graphic violence. My Grade: 10/10.
