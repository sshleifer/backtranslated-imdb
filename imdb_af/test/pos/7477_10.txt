This movie was excellent from start to finish. I was cut by the action, the black humor and the incredible accident our hero experienced at every turn. Thomas Jane is a good actor and I hope to see him in many more movies to come. Read through other people's comments, I have to admit I never ever thought about Tarrantino while I was watching Thursday, but now that I think about it, I think there are a few similarities. I think I don't spend much time relating everything to everything. The rape zone between Porizkova and Thomas Jane is one of the record books - the most sexy scene ever.
