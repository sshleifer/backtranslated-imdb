In a better civilization, this and many others of the David Suchet movies will be released in the theaters. The plots are fantastic (no, I have no idea who did it, but the clues were all there if I was more imaginative - the best kind of mystery), the production values ​​amazing, the acting (by Edward Fox, Sarah Miles, Lysette Anthony, Megan Dodds, and of course David Suchet as Hercule Poirot) simply perfect, the dialogue wonderful, the music and the sense of tension and tension just wonderful things. <br /> <br /> One of the fun of these Hercule Poirot movies for a man is how many beautiful women die in them! Here were two - the sexy, bad Megan Doods and the beautiful Lysette Anthony. <br /> <br /> You really can't go wrong about renting it - they're just wonderful - like the most wonderful meal in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind is constantly working because it's all There is and you are struggling, but by constantly thinking, everything can keep pace - and the institutions are beautiful. <br /> <br /> I can't think of movies that stimulate more thought than the Hercule Poirot / David Suchet movies. It's impossible to overcome them - and I've never seen one before a few months ago or read an Agatha Christie.
