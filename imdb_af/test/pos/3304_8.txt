Fun bad movie to entertain. One of Joan Crawford's latest performances as the driven successful editor vs. all the young beautiful eager beavers coming out of the elite Seven Sister Colleges. Big 50's New York atmosphere. Beautiful period costumes and hairstyles. Great art direction. Trite story, but red tearjerker. Interestingly came by Robert Evans as a rich Cad.
