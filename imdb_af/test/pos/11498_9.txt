Joline (Heather Graham) looks forward to her husband Carl (Luke Wilson) who has disappeared to relieve his head about himself and their marriage. Joline, who is dedicated to their marriage, begins her journey to find Carl, but on the way discover a lot about herself. On her journey she meets many interesting characters who help her unconsciously. <br /> <br /> In my eyes this is a classic road movie that just moves in the right pace (some viewers can also find it slow). In the course of the movie it remains humorous while Joline responds to the madness of the world around her with a warm, knowing, sometimes sad smile. All actresses and actors give great performances and the music count is immaculate. 9/10
