Okay, I'll admit that if I didn't have children, I never saw this movie and would never see it. But, seeing all the rotten children's movies I've seen (like SPY KIDS 2 or BABE: GIRL IN THE CITY), it's a significant improvement. And it had enough in that I was not completely bored of my skull or intended suicide (something I repeatedly did in the other two movies). Sure, the performances are pretty wide and the plot is a bit stupid - but it's a children's movie. And compared to other movies in the genre, it's definitely better than average. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bines are actually a bit of a talent and will probably continue to have careers after puberty - at least on infomercials or voice recording. <br /> <br /> So, if you're looking for a movie to see with your kids, you can definitely do much worse!
