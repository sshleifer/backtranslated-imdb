After going to sleep, Lestat is awake from a 100-year-old sleep to the sounds of a new music he wants to participate in and the band "The Vampire Lestat" is born. His desire to end his loneliness and his "living in the light" with his music rage his fellow vampires and awaken an evil who has been slumbering for thousands of years. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for those looking for a real book-to-movie adaptation. Those who have read the books and expect to see them on the screen are in great disappointment. This movie will appeal to those who really enjoy the "Interview With the Vampire" movie. <br /> <br /> There are a few plot holes and accidents, but as a whole, this movie was satisfactory. Stuart Townsend portrays Lestat with a sensuality and sexuality lacking in the previous film. The relationships portrayed in the film were very sexy and sizzling. <br /> <br /> As a movie, the story forces you and moves you in. Watering is wonderful. Love this story and movie. If you like sensuality and sexual tension, you'll love this movie!
