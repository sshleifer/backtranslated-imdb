When I was younger, this movie always broadcast on Channel 40 in the summer on Friday night (it was the years before Fox was a network and took over programming). I always looked forward to it. I go shopping with my parents, then sit down with my Swanson's TV dinner and a Lady Lee Cola (the only time of the week I had the opportunity to drink and enjoy cola. The script is predictably late in the 70's, Little Darlings), but it's a fun movie, and I loved Rudy and Tripper. Bill Murray kisses with little trouble in the movie, but he is charming. Gotta love Spaz and the burnt glasses (pre Revenge of the Nerds.) Chris Makepeace is almost the same character he played in "My bodyguard", but he does so well.
