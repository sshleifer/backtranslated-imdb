This movie was wonderful and I wait a long time for that. When it finally came out, I was really happy and looking forward to 10 out of 10. It was wonderful and kept my potential. The performances were large of the adults and most of the children. The only bad performance was by Milo himself. There was one problem I experienced with this (and other) movie. All the characters I wanted were killed. Overall, I give this movie an excellent 9 out of 10. Maybe we should choose better people to kill next time, even if it's good?
