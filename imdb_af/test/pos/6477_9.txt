It is difficult to imagine how old and how much of an impact a Norwegian immigrant and chemist had on the American public and how much of a national tragedy was his sudden death in 1931. But Knute Rockne was an extraordinary individual who made both revolution and popular college football and placed a small, dark Catholic college on the map. <br /> <br /> I heard clips from Rockne's famous pep talk and it's unpleasant how Pat O "Brien has the voice and clash perfectly. In what seems to be his career role, Pat O'Brien fits in with the integrity and Rockne's fighting spirit Rockne is well supported by Gale Page as Bonnie Stiles Rockne who complained that her home is a training camp for Notre Dame, but never threw anyone out of her house. <br /> <br /> Rockne 's first impact on football was not a coach as a player with Notre Dame, one fine day in the second half of a lost soccer match against heavy - favored army, Rockne and teammate Gus Dorais played by Owen Davis, using the prediction as' An offensive weapon Previously, soccer was just a game where you only had bigger guys for your side and ran through the defense, Rockne did not find the way forward but he became popular and soccer has a strategy of strategy and then he strung. <br /> <br /> Rockne has knew how to work the media as well. The well-publicized pep talk of her was not just to inspire his players. They were well known and it was in many of him that college football became a major sport in the Golden Age of Sport in the Roaring Twenties. <br /> <br /> Playing a small but key role is Ronald Reagan. Like George Gipp, the first player that Rockne coached to achieve greatness, Reagan not only achieved a good performance, but forever after a name that was useful in his subsequent political career. The deathbed scene that Rockne swore was a Republican screech, so much of an IDP suspect went out to win one for the Tipper. <br /> <br /> I remember another widespread picture in 1981, which was one of the first remnants of President Ronald Reagan at Notre Dame's graduation with his old friend, Pat O'Brien. Reagan has always credited O'Brien and Dick Powell of all the Warner Brothers stars of the time as the one who was the most beautiful and encouraging for a young player on the lot trying to make good. <br /> <br /> Notre Dame himself owes his prestige to rocks. It is quite possible that Notre Dame would be a dark, small Catholic College without the reputation of soccer. <br /> <br /> Although George Gipp and the later famous back ground of the Four Riders definitely had their place in the sun, Rockne was the one who had the reputation. It's no coincidence that Warner Brothers Amos Alonzo Stagg, Glenn 'Pop' Warner, Howard Jones and William Spaulding, Rockne's contemporaries and coaches, have their own reputation in their own right to appear in Knute Rockne, All American. This was the way to honor the man who was number one in their profession. <br /> <br /> I think more than soccer fans will enjoy Knute Rockne, All American. Although you may become one after watching the movie.
