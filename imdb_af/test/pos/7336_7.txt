... this one. What was immediately my mind was loving Annabelle because it has the same kind of mature mood and distant handling of the subject. We see just as the story unfolds, without using its sides, or confronting any "moral" issues (or of course we are, but are not spooned). Certainly, there were difficult facts to confront, and choices to make, but it just flowed. Actually, it was just like any other love story, in any other life, with any other generation. <br /> <br /> I personally found the girls to have a good chemistry and had fun on their night trips. The only thing I really could identify as a problem would be, it was just a kind of ... keep. Retained. It's not about the sex scene (or those who miss it), but since I felt the movie in its liveliest moments when they were together with a good time, it's similar to the rest. Lowkey is good, but it has never bothered much like Loving Annabelle, nor has she touched me so much. <br /> <br /> That said, I highly recommend it, it is by no means a waste of precious time on the contrary ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
