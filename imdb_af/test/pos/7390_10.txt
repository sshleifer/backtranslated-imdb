"It's funny, your worst nightmare is always so far away!" <br /> <br /> Dark Habour's characters, a couple (Alan Rickman & Polly Hunter) and a vagabond (Norman Reedus), slip into a game of hidden sexual energy and betrayal. Curious breaks increase the tension and give plenty of room for interpretation. Good acting and a story that, if you don't use the brain, will leave you confused. You should look at it at least twice. The strength lies in his unconventionality and in Alan Rickman, of course. Those who love him will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's not a typical first time movie, but it is done!
