What an original piece of work. I always enjoyed Liev Schreiber the "actor", but now one has to appreciate man on a multidimensional level. How did he find that area of ​​sunflowers? Was it computerized, it really looked real. And how do you audition a dog to know you're going to get that kind of performance? Does the academy have a category for animals? I think what I say is that I really enjoy this impressive, impressive, little indie movie. Out of the excellent movie (Eugene Hutz was never a pro actor) the music (the CD bought at the theater) and of course the two D's (direction and the DOG). All in all a "10". <br /> <br /> /
