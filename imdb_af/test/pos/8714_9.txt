Bridgette Bardot, who looks as sexy as ever, plays a spoiled but innocent daughter of a French ambassador. She puts in one of her father's top women (wife MICHEL) to marry her and it seems to be the best thing for them. Michel flirts with his old friends soon and to teach him a lesson, Bridgette whispers with a married PRINCE CHARLES. Michel is amazed at his jealousy. A cat-and-mouse game comes between Brigdette and Michel ("I'll have a relationship ...". "No, you won't" ...). And finally Michel realizes that she has only vows and vows to give the others. ladies in his life. Bridgette and Michel settle in their happily ever after Prince Charles leaves for England. <br /> <br /> It is a pretty light piece, but it is incredibly charming. While some might owe it as a product of his time, I found it quite enjoyable. Waiting for a rental.
