I believe there are two corners to the story. First, it is the world's satirical view, presented in an obvious Kafkaic way, underlining the sordid spectacle of some of the most common, but also pleasurable, comfortable moments and elements of life. It is usually enough to make humans function in society. Like: a good job, a good home, a good woman, a good car, and even a good lover. Apart from this so-called general happiness, there are some who cannot help asking themselves more uncomfortable questions, such as where they come from or again they can have another form of happiness, again there may be a reason for them or Again there may be something they missed, or even more sinister, again, there may be something that keeps the system down. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the most interesting aspect of this movie, I believe, is the fact that it is attacking this natural compulsion to dissect the world around us, through our personal judgment, and usually condemned because it does not serve us better because it is not tailored to us as a person. <br /> <br /> The symbolism behind the train accident suggests that our own will may be overtaken by fate or other universal power, even in the face of our so-called power to decide when we want. Instead, the man is dismissed by this greater force. Let's call it THE SYSTEM because the authors clearly avoid mentioning it. GOD, perhaps further underlining that the system was MAN-made and thus man-capable, unlike FATE, which is a concept closer to religion), in its own terms, not by killing him, but by showing him that there is a place for the man who asks or wants too much, that true fulfillment does not come from the outside world, but from within, and as the outside world "decides" to give you comfort, You must learn to accept it without questioning the substance of every aspect of it. <br /> <br /> Unsatisfactory, but revive some existential questions that have become predominant in the last century, as one can do in an increasingly drained world, a consumer-driven world in which humans can be exchanged. without making a difference to the bigger picture, but as long as it is useful to the system.
