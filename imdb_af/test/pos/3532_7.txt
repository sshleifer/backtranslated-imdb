I have postponed buying this one since his DVD release? for one thing, because I was a bit underwhelmed by the two other horror titles of this director (SQUIRM [1976] and BLUE SUNSHINE [1977]), but also that the film itself on the Media Blasters / Shriek Show 2-Disc Set! I have seen it as a rental feeling and am glad I did it? For it is not only better than previous efforts (at least on this preliminary assessment), but I also found that the movie is one of the better imitations of the Texas CHAIN ​​SAW MASSACRE (1974). However, this factor has only helped me to remind me to review another example of such an example? Wes Craven's classic THE HILLS HAVE EYES (1977), whose 2-CD R1 edition of Anchor Bay I bought some time ago, yet Halloween time is fast approaching ... <br /> <br / > Anyway, the movie manages an effortlessly disturbing backwoods atmosphere (it's shot in the woods and mountain regions of Oregon) ?? With very effective frissons throughout, but grateful, not too much violence (even if the last villains are sent in a scandalous way!). The main young role played here (one of them played by Jack Lemmon's son Chris) is not quite as stupid as those we usually experience in this kind of genre presentation? Despite free indulging in the shenanigans one associates with teen-oriented flicks and what, in general, continues to this day! George Kennedy appears as a sympathetic Ranger; Although he does not have much to do, his characterization is certainly enhanced by making him a lover of plant and animal life. Also known by the locals is well-known character actor Mike Kellin in a good role as the drunkard who first comes into contact with the murderous duo of the story ?? Of course his warning to the teenagers goes untouched, but he can lead Kennedy later on. <br /> <br /> The hermetic family that the teens come into the bush is finally revealed to hide a skeleton in their closet. While one of the girls is really curious about the invaders, the rest are openly hostile to them? and, in the case of the brave and uncivilized twins, properly creepy (one of them is even prone to manic laughter during his rampages); At some point in the narrative, the Ranger even offers an interesting explanation about the nature of their aggressive and general uncivilized behavior.
