Leos Carax made 3 fantastic movies: Boys Meet Girls, Mauvais Sang, Les Amants du Pont Neuf. In fact, these films were not so good, but it has the violence of the youth, the beauty of the young wilderness. Karax in these three movies was well aware of what the theater was, but he tried to make his own vision of the art without thinking about everything he saw but using it and melting in his times . Pola X is a very different film because Carax made Les Amants du Pont Neuf, a 20 million dollar monstrous, a film that has destroyed everything on its way. After such a movie you can't do the same one in the same view. So Leos Carax has to change, and he did it. The movie is not as beautiful as its first, it is more reasonable, no more studio, no longer dreamed of Paris, Carax finally entered. It's no longer clean, it's not poetic characters. Carax has become a romantic in the German sense.
