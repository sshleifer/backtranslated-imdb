For the first time, a movie by a director is an incredibly small movie, although I have to admit that it is a bit difficult to watch and it will probably hamper the sensitivity of many people watching it. the film takes a definite view of assisted suicide. But what I loved about the movie is that I didn't think that's what the movie was about until the movie was over half-finished and then I was addicted. <br /> <br /> In addition to the excellent how the subject was launched, I was amazed at the very professional style of the movie - with some of the best movies I've ever seen in a short movie. Plus, this camera work is so well combined with music and images that just made the movie. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's a controversial movie. I struggle with what I think of this debate, but the film has managed to make such a literate and intelligent statement. I must respect the team that made this movie.
