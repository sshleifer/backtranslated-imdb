The feeling of having to play the role of arbitrator of Public Taste and Political Correction always drives us skin. It appears that these self-appointed, self-superior, pseudo-intellectual types appear everywhere; be it in your family, church or bowling alley. <br /> <br /> THAT are the guys who will totally ignore society and ignore everything that has gone before us; unless, of course, whatever it is, do not fly in the face of today's "acceptable" language, mores and general "standards" of "proper" behavior. <br /> <br /> It is that this last day, high-tech book burners targeted much of Hollywood's greatest achievement; namely, their participation in our own allied propaganda through their self-proclaimed message and theme movies. <br /> <br /> COLS brutally in his generation, stretching out the forbidden code and the list of now unacceptable in the war magazines that do not meet the new, pleasant, socially manipulated 'official' attitudes; who fell upon us this "Thought Police". <br /> <br /> We were really surprised to see volumes of such animated short subjects appear. The majority we are aware of is from Warner Brothers' LONEY TUNES and MERRIE MELODIES; With Bugs, Daffy, Elmer & Porky, all in conflict with Hitler, Goerring, 'Il Duce', Tojo and the like. Surprisingly, we have found a generous supply of cartoons from MGM, Walt Disney, Lantz, Paramount-Famous Studios and the Brothers Fleischer. <br /> <br /> You are a SAP MR. JAP (Famous Studios / Paramount Pictures, 1942) is a good example of what we are talking about. <br /> <br /> There are virtually inconspicuous of the cartoons that were running the Studios of Max and Dave Fleischer before The 1941 business coup de-tat they brought out has the new name of the brought "familiar" studios, you are a SAP MR. JAP does not carry any of the mere plotting elements that will reduce the latter day Popeye Cartoons to the level of the ultimate formula short film. <br /> <br /> We all remember how we want Popeye and Olive Oyl. Type Bluto, usually the exponent of wool whistle and an acceptable screen version of a male response to female pulchritude. Oil falls for Bluto's less than honorable attention; until he gets a little too physical and always eliminates, "Hey Babe, how about a kiss?" At this point we hear Help! Help, Popeye and the diminished sailor show up to save the day, full of mandatory spins! Do we convince ourselves, Schultz? Only again is this JAP SAP cartoon nothing like that. Certainly, it follows the story of Popeye in the US fleet. The Fleischer Brothers commissioned the little man in 1941 to meet the mood in the country and as an open gesture of support for the men now recruited in the service. first and peace year concept in the history of the United States. Max and Dave even employ Popeye aboard the mythical battleship, the USS Pensyltucky. <br /> <br /> Our point is just this. YOU ARE A SAP MR. SPINACH FER Britain is not a cartoon vehicle for comic lighting in the Theater program. On the contrary, they are a sort of grouping of editorial cartoons, much like those of a large metropolitan newspaper. These animated shorts, much like those one panel illustrations, have charac ters who are highly symbolic and representative of nations, ideas and ideas, such as a just and lasting peace. In most cases, the hero (Popeye, Bugs Bunny or anyone) is alone with the enemy symbol. Both are highly exaggerated visual metaphors for abstract concept and thought; even dressed in humorous bumps for wider delights. <br /> <br /> Our liberal stupidgencia (the antithesis of intelligencia) cannot see themselves; but for this kind of behavior they are no more than neo-Nazi book-burners. <br /> <br /> PLEASE allow future generations to see and appreciate a view of historical and humorous events. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
