Came through the same Monty Berman / Dennis Spooner partnership that produced The Champions and Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased). The latter put My Partner the Spirit to the American market. Department S remains a classic example of the UK action adventure series. in bulk during the late 1960s. Like the two shows, the internal dynamics of two guys and a girl may indicate a progressive attitude towards equality. (Dept S also has a black superior), but it is mostly facade: the launch episode, "Six Days", is barely halfway through before Rosemary Nichols is called to parade in bra, underpants and one (yes, one) socks to free her from a dodgy situation. Still, it is an interesting time capsule, even though the character of Peter Wyngarde's character (which has been immensely degraded in the Jason King spin-off series) remained.
