* THIS COMMENT WILL BE HAVING SPOILERS !! I just checked the SPOILERS box in case, but it may not have SPOILERS, BUT ALWAYS BE THAT I SAY THAT YOU CAN BE A SPOILER AND I DO NOT! * Wow ... best game since Super Mario 64. I played it the first day it came out, and before I got it, I went on some gambling sites to look at his ratings (yes, they did it already checked before it came out), and I was shocked. I expected something like Sunshine because lately all the Mario games have gotten worse and worse. But this one completely beat the other games. The scores on this game even hit Halo 3! It's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> STORY: Not the best, Mario games are never known for their plots, and this one is not really a big difference. Bowser picks up Peach again, but this time the Mushroom Kingdom falls on a festival that is celebrated once a century and gets a flying saucer and it shoots lasers on the ground and then they put anchors inside the ground and jerk the castle and its foundation in outer space. <br /> <br /> GRAPHICS: Absolutely beautiful, the best graphics on Wii so far. The water effects are also very nice, if you ever see the water, it seems so because the effects put in it. <br /> <br /> MUSIC: Simply, the music in this game is orchestrated. Not everything, but even the one not orchestrated sounds pretty nice. <br /> <br /> Game: Very entertaining, keep playing more and more, and for me, usually I tend to be very frustrated with games when I die a lot, I mean, I'm definitely not only, but this game for me didn't have much. Now it has done quite a bit, but not like Mario 64 where I got totally crazy and finally turned off the game because it made me angry. It never did. SAFETY: There are two kinds of problems, because you can only technically beat the game with just 60 stars, which I think is easy, but to beat the game 100%, you have to get 120, as always, and that quest is much more difficult . , but at the same time very nice. <br /> <br /> LENGTH: Good length, definitely not too short. It took me about 15-16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars, but 120 took me over 45-50 hours. Now I haven't played it so constantly, one day I played a lot, the next few days, just a few hours every day, and the next two days I played all day. However, for me, I think the search for 60 stars was a little short, so if you want a long match, I suggest they get everyone. <br /> <br /> PRESENTATION: Now, the movies in this movie are great. As they are, it looks as much as something I will see in the theaters. They are the hands of the best movie scenes on any Mario game so far. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: This game is definitely a good game and I advise you not to wait until Christmas, get it as soon as possible. This game is also a good mix of old and new, you will have a few sidescroller levels where you just move from side to side, or up and down, because they will change gravity, but even the music has a some old classic players in it. So this game looks like a masterpiece. For me this is my favorite Mario game of all time, but others may not agree. But it's still a good game. I recommend every player who wants to play in a game to get it.
