I only saw this movie about hbo in 1983 and I loved it! I scoured all the auction sites to buy the vhs copy. It's a very good suspense movie with a few twists that make it more interesting. I don't want to say too much else, because if you ever get the chance to see it, you'll be glad I didn't say too much!
