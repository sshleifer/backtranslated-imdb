HBO created this show for the purpose of making us the most realistic view of jail and they did a hell of a job. Oz was created by the creators of the murder who wanted to show a raw version of the jail. This show starts off with the idea of ​​every other HBO original program such as Sopranos, Sex and the City, The Wire, Arliss, Deadwood and Six Feet Under. Oz is the nickname for the Oswald State Penetentiary, a fictitious prison in some US states never mentioned. Although with accents, crime scenes and racist distribution, NY is accepted. The chief prison unit looked at Emerald City, a seemingly ideal prison unit with more privates than others thought of by a liberal unit manager, Tim McManus. Overall, this show shows us how it really is if we want to survive in prison. <br /> <br /> There are about 10 gangs shown on Oz. First, we have the Muslims, a group of blacks who want to destroy the injustices of the criminal justice system and improve the living conditions for blacks everywhere. They are led by Kareem Said a black militant minister who wants to destroy everything racist about the justice system. As a group, they are not so much anti-white, but rather anti-injustice. Our second group of blacks is the Homeboys who are essentially street blacks who want to stop all the bad ghetto behavior and run the drug trade. Their leadership differs mainly because they always lose members because of violence. In this group is one character that is tremendously dealt with, Simon Adebisi. Adebisi is an African resident who is essentially the most terrifying evil character in life. This gang as a whole sometimes gets help from the Irish and is always in conflict with Latin and Sicilian for drug distribution purposes. Because the Oz is mostly black, the Homeboys have most soldiers in any gang. <br /> <br /> The Latin and Sicilian, like the Homeboys, have changing leadership due to violent deaths occurring during the show. The Sicilians have most of the insights into how any illegal activities are done in Oz. The Latinos make their presence known so they can at least shoot well if they are not in control. However, unlike the Homeboys, these gangs do not have so much internal struggle for power and are usually more stable in drug use. The Irish mentioned above are a smaller gang led by a manipulative and clever Ryan O'Reily. O'Reily always manages in good grace with all the drug forces and manages things to manipulate whenever he wants. They have no illegal control, but at least they are on good terms with everyone there. <br /> <br /> Among the whites we have the Bikers and Aryans. The cyclists are simply a bunch of tattooed drug users who help the Aryans most of the time. The Aryans are the most hated and hateful gang for most people who see Oz. They are led by Vern Schillinger, who is one of the most racist, sickest and sadistic characters one will ever see. Both gangs do not control anything illegal, they only see the darker prisoners see that they are a significant threat to anyone who thinks all white prisoners are soft. We also have the other. The other is a gang of outsiders who are not necessarily a problem for any other prisoner. In this group we see Tobias Beecher, a lawyer who accidentally murdered a young girl whose life is forever changed by jail. We also see Augustus Hill, a black man bound to a wheelchair to kill a police officer who plays the show and introduces the audience to every prisoner. The character's crimes are shown as they are introduced and August tells us how long they will be in jail. Finally, among gangs, there are Christians and Gays. The Christians are simply religious to remain mindful, and the Gays are a lot of cross-seekers who are often raped by other prisoners. <br /> <br /> This view is in depth on many issues dealing with the criminal. legal system and is more explicit than any film about prison. Since language is unavailable, here we have more racial epithets and cuss words than we would on any other TV show. Augustus Hill's comments provide a great way for us to really understand every issue involved with Oz. This show as good as it is is not for the light to medium heart. It clearly shows drug use and distribution in any way possible, imprisonment, murders, deadly stabbing and general gore than anything anyone else saw. In my opinion, this is the most influential and greatest show ever created, but at the same time I can see why other people will be disturbed by this show. If you are interested in all shows and movies about jail, Oz is a must see.
