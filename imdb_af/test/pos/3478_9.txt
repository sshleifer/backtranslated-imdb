When I was 10 (currently 14), I promised never to see a movie I knew wouldn't have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I did pretty well, except for Shakespere for the English class ... etc ... I just watched things that ended happily. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not good, but enough to watch. Having seen it several times over the two or so years since I first saw it, I grew to enjoy it, especially the music. So I did a search on her and found IMDb. I saw "Inside I Dancing" and accepted that she had done another dance movie. It was later on a photo search (by Rory, looking for Gilmore Girls dressing room poster). I bought a picture of this movie ... I then searched for a trailer, I got the trailer and when I saw the hospital and Rory heard say, "You have the future." I remembered my vow and realized it wouldn't be a good movie for me. But it just remained in my mind until we were at the video store and it was used for $ 5, so I continued and bought it. After I saw it, I just wanted it out of my head, because it was so sad. I didn't want to approach it until I had cerebral palsy as a vocabulary. Then I just had to see it again and this time I just laughed, even in the saddest parts I didn't feel depressed anymore, because I realized that all these movies were happy and constructive. I love it and it is now one of my favorites, I; m sure this is the worst comment you've ever read. But look at the movie, it's worth it.
