I watched this movie regularly for most of my life, and it never gets old. For all the remarkable remarks and insults (mostly from David Spade), "Tommy Boy" has a huge heart. Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) is the son of Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy), head of the auto parts, and has all his life. But after his death on his wedding day, Tommy learns that the company is in debt and is about to buy Ray Zalinsky (Dan Akroyd), the owner of a large automotive company. To save the company, Tommy has to be on his way to selling the company's new brake pads. Along with the ride, though not by choice, Richard Hayden (David Spade) is a former Tommy's classmate, who was the real man of Big Tom. <br /> <br /> The movie rides on the chemistry between the two SNL stars (and best friends best friends) Chris Farley and David Spade. The duo has enough comic energy between them to drive the world. It's the big, stupid guy, to the smart old man. It works, and some of their scenes are memorable. Farley and Spade are actually decent dramatic actors. Although the film is mostly a comedy, it has a fair share of drama, but Spade and especially Farley are as good there as when they make the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Forgive me, but I have a little more to talk about Chris Farley. I read his biography ("The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts," for anyone who cares), and to understand who Chris was in real life, this movie made me more special. Chris Farley was a really good person who struggled, and eventually failed to overcome his addictions. Although this was the first movie, he played a big role. It's his best movie. It really showed who he was, and just how much talent he had. Know Chris's story adds another layer to this movie, but it doesn't make it any less funny. <br /> <br /> Farley and Spade are customized with a good screen throw. Rob Lowe is well clever as Tommy's "new brother" and Bo Derek is solid as his stepmother. Brian Dennehy is big like Big Tom. This makes it easy to believe that their father is in the boy. Big Tom is just as crazy as his son, though he is smarter and more mature. Dan Akroyd gives one of his best performances as Zalinsky, and gives Tommy the hard truth behind advertising. Julie Warner is also good as Tommy's love interest, Michelle. <br /> <br /> For me, Peter Segal is one of the great comedy directors. He keeps the pace fast and energetic, but most importantly he knows how to make comedy funny. He doesn't do the jokes, and he understands that the funny actors know what they're doing and he allows them to do so. But Segal goes one step further. He gives "Tommy Boy" a friendly, almost nostalgic tone that both switches on the heart beats (really) and tickles the funny bone. <br /> <br /> Critics don't like Tommy Boy. Shame on them. A movie doesn't have to be super sophisticated or subversely intellectual to be funny (God forbid Farley and Spade were forced to do subdued comedy and "The Office"). It's a good movie and one of my all-time favorites.
