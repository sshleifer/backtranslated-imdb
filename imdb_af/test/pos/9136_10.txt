I decided to comment on this wonderful movie because here on IMDb is quoted as saying that John Woo, a mediocre director who made some decent films in his pre-American years, but completely destroyed his reputation, made the American movies, plan to restore it. Well, here are some reasons why this is one of the dumbest ideas for a remake ever: The movie's plot is simple and even split by today's standards, but what the movie makes a masterpiece is through the four lead, unique direction by Mellville, cinematography, music and his style. There is no way a director can make such films today. It's impossible to create such an atmosphere in a movie in today's Box-office-oriented movie business. <br /> <br /> John Woo made a more or less decent movie that borrowed from Melville's Le Samourai - The Killer, but remember, it was made when the director was not wasted and expensive by big budgets ( in salaries), but inexpensive (in acting merit) actors. So what I'm saying is that it's one of the biggest movies ever made, along with another movie by Melville - Le Samourai. Beware. And even if the remake will be made, try to avoid it before you first see the original.
