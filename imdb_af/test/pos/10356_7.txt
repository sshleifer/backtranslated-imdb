American-made final entry into the "Blood Island" series of Filipino horror films relates to Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley), ruler of a fictional country. He died of cancer, but it was figured out how to bring him back: put his brain in a donor body. The mad doctor in charge (Kent Taylor) puts it in a highly unlikely body: the face-shield giant slave named Gor (John Bloom). A chief of doctor's chief tries to rectify matters and put an end to the crazy doctors' plans. <br /> <br /> Film partners Samuel M. Sherman (producer) and Al Adamson (director) corral several actors I worked with Taylor, Adamsons sexy wife, Regina Carrol, Angelo Rossitto, Zandor Vorkov and Vicki Volante . They tried to feel the feelings of the previous "Blood Island" entries, but one could say it was state-of-the-art. Although not necessarily a "good" movie, it has a lot of amusing elements to add to an entertaining trashy whole. An unbelievable dwarf (Rossitto), gory operations, a pretty unconvincing makeup work on Bloom, the political plot subplot, hollow full spider web, etc. The narrative is actually quite coherent, with plot thrown here and there. I think it could have been a bit finished; drag some scenes. But it has its fun moments and a finite people can't expect. <br /> <br /> For this kind of thing, the play isn't bad. Both Taylor and Rossitto are fun; The latter seems to be a good time in his role. Volante is attractive enough, and Williams is O.K. in the heroic role. Anyway, it's nice to see all these familiar faces in one of these movies. Absolutely nothing special, but as a trashy B "horror" (I use the word loosely, nothing of this is exactly scary) movie, it's definitely amusements. <br /> <br /> 7/10
