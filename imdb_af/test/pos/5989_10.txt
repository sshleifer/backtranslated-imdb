I love foreign films and this is one of the best. I tend not to see it as a comedy as it is listed and find it a comment on how we see others around us. Firmine's main role in the film is not seen as she is a household in a big firm and people say and do things around her all the time they would not say to others. <br /> <br /> This leaves her with a glimpse of information that can kill or break the mere death. :) This actress is wonderful as this character and it is a pleasant story. There is an underlying story and almost many stories in the story in this movie. I just hope that if someone decides to make an American / English version of this movie, it's not the year of Three Men and a Baby that will definitely do a discomfort to this FILM.
