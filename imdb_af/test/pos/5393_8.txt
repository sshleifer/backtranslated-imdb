A throw back to the "old-fashioned" Western of the 30's and 40's (like DODGE CITY), DALLAS has a number of things going for it: Gary Cooper at his coolest, flashy Technicolor photography by Ernest Haller (GONE WITH THE WIND) and a pulsating Max Steiner (KING KONG, GWTW, DODGE CITY et al.) score. In addition, there is a masquerade, faulty identity, a fake death and more escape from the breath as a republican series. Cooper always defines what it is like to be a man under pressure. Forget the 50s Fear Western ... this is pure entertainment!
