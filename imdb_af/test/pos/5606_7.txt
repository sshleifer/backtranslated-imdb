Although not Hal Hartley's best work (my personal favorite is "Survive Desire"), there is still a lot to keep about this movie, especially for fans of Hartley's dialogues. Even for audiences new to Hartley, I would definitely recommend this movie to the sophomoric "Dogma." This movie is more intelligent, more meaningful for its source material (the Bible), and more fun than any other pre-millennium apocalypse movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually part of the French "2000 As Seen by." (2000 Par Vu) series; as such, it may even be a lower-budget movie than Hartley's other works. Although the need for simple digital camera-shot scenes is understandable in this context, the main problem with this movie is the unfortunate over-exploitation of the vague / shaky effect. I'll be glad to never see this effect in a movie again; especially at the beginning, it almost makes the movie inactive. But beyond this mistake, and you'll be treated to a fine movie. Especially striking is Magdalena (played by P.J. Harvey) related to how Jesus saved her to be killed. a short scene I found surprisingly. (Despite being NOT Mary Magdalene, it happened that the woman in the Bible was nameless.) <br /> <br />
