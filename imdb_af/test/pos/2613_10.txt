It's a talk, trigger happy, alcoholic ASS COP! I saw the first and second episodes. The artwork and animation fit very well (note the facial expressions, lol). The main character is a firearm, badge carrying, blunt cheeks, shooting at which he thinks offensive or "guilty". So far, the episodes have had simple and manageable plots that work well with Assy's investigations. Ass San's Don Sanchez plays is the sobering retort to the A.A. antics and random "I have a hunch" lead. Assy's lines are very funny and clever, here is one, for example: "I have one bullet and it has your email address on it, don't let me send" * Bang * "looks like your in-box only has a a little new post. "The dinka box at Assy Mcgee's headquarters is so far, consistent and up-to-date. Regarding sound, it's perfect, the sound effects and voice are 9/10. Assy sounds like Sylvester Stallone all excited, Don Sanchez, the mayor, head of police, all voted "Fit" there persona's very good. I recommend it to anyone who wants to catch a few laughs before going to bed, as it is swimming on the adult on Sunday night. Very funny, imaginative, visually different comedy. 10/10
