I love a cute, happy movie with a happy ending. This movie can be considered a drama, with two characters realizing true love, but the story is so touchy and so nice that it is a romance in my mind. Granted, the play isn't that great (it's not yourself given a 10), but they do the job and don't persuade them (thank God), but they're cute, but the story is powerful and simply adorable. some of your pansies will choke) !!!!!! It's a good look for a love story, but if you're homophobic, stay away! For everyone else, I loved the movie, it's so sweet! I felt a setback on a smaller scale, but with a happy ending .... so enjoy!
