The visual effectiveness of this movie is unmatched by everything I saw. And the work that is needed to achieve this must have been incredibly long and boring (don't just keep "Kodak Grainy Film" in your camera to get this look). Don't look at this movie to be entertained, see if it is visually stimulated, see if it is challenged and challenged in your mind on film and any other topic that is thought of to you. Religion will probably be one thought. <br /> <br />
