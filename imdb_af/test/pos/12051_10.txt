The movie is a very good movie. One of the best of Yash raj movies. The direction is incredible. The show is brilliant. The story is excellent. It tells of Rahul who of Kiran is his college friend. He's a full blown psycho doing things like talking to his mother on a phone (anyway she died 15 years ago). Kiran is engaged to Sunil. Rahul does everything he can to get her. He even tries to kill Sunil, but he survives. He even goes to the place where they go to their honeymoon. The movie is each nest. Creator is wonderful, Juhi is pretty good, Sunny is average, Anupham is good and so is Tanvi, Dalip did well. The film belongs to Srk. Dialogies are brilliant (Shahrukh ones and many, if not overworking and comedy). "Jaadu Teri Nazar" and "Tu Mere Samne" are absolutely melodic songs.
