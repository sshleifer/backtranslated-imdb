For me, the best and most memorable movies are often the ones I don't know at first. American Movie is a perfect example of such a gem. I saw television one night, and I saw the one good review among the dross. Thanks, I decided for a real surprise. American film is a documentary following the memorable Mark Borchardt (pronounced "orchard", I believe), a highly articulate and charismatic Wisconson boy, while struggling to write, live and produce "MidWestern", a vicious , low budget Horror movie on which he has been working for years. In Mark we discover a young man who is filled with contrast. His look is from the classic trailer-stereo trailer-skinny, bum-fluff mustache, 80-year-old heavy metal styling, mullet hairdo, etc. However, Markus reveals spectacular white and insight as he philosophises on life, love, movies and the American way. Unfortunately, as the film unfolds, it becomes clear that Mark's lack of discipline and heavy drinking ruthlessly sabotages his creative efforts. American Movie is a beautiful watch, full of hilarious moments and vibrant characters. Head under this is Mark's beloved friend Mike Schank, a soft-spoken reformed stoner, who has now gained a scratch on scratch cards, now relies on soda pop. I loved absolutely American film. It generates real empathy between the viewer and main characters and offers hilarity without feeling exploitative. I would recommend it to everyone.
