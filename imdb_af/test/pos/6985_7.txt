* POSSIBLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I thought Pitch Black is pretty nice, with some nice effects. I like the bigger animals, though they are not a patch on the Aliens of the Alien series. It had a good atmosphere, which I felt Vin Diesel helped to contribute. <br /> <br /> One thing that struck me was how it rained. If the planet has three suns and is in almost continuous daylight, where did the moisture come to form clouds and therefore rain? <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that Fry died in the end - it reminded me of the New Hollywood movies of the 1970s, with the main heroine not making it to the end.
