One of the genres that flourished in the decade of the 30s was the variety of crime fiction known as the "murderous mystery". Adding sound to movies helped make a more faithful translation of the movie the audience experienced in the original play. And since horror movies were very popular in those years, the killing movies almost matched what they enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre are produced) by improving the horrors of the plots. Aspirational playwright Charles Belden was given a chance in this renewed interest in murder mysteries to make a name for himself after Warner Bros chose his three-play, The Wax Works, to create the 1933 horror movie, "Mystery of the Wax Museum ". Belden joined independent filmmaker Frank R. Strayer to keep films, and "The Ghost Walks" was one of his best. <br /> <br /> In "The Ghost Walks", John Miljan plays Prescott Ames, a young playwright who wants to impress a well-known Broadway producer named Herman Wood (Richard Carle) with his new play. Ames takes Wood and his assistant Homer (Johnny Arthur) to his mansion for a reading of his play, but his car ends in a terrible storm in the mud. The three men are asking for refugees in an old mansion that is owned by one of Ames's old acquaintances. In the house, Wood and Homer see the strange relationship between Ames and the homeowners. However, it is a plan designed to impress Wood: everyone in the house is an actor who plays a role in his murder mystery. Unfortunately, the murder has been committed to the real, and while Wood and Homer think it's all fake (after Ames's original plan was discovered), the player knows someone in the house is a real killer. <br /> <br /> As Expected, Charles Belden's script for "The Ghost Walks" contains the classic elements of the murder story stories of his time, as we are the stormy night in an old dark house as institution, the compulsory group suspects and the comedy of comedy. But what's interesting here is how Belden makes the movie a real spoof on the genre with the many twists he puts in his story to play with the crimes of murder mystery plays. The dialogues are excellent, full of white and light charm, and while the plot certainly loses much steam at the end (it does follow the murder mystery routine anyway), it never gets interesting and entertaining thanks to its cunning twists and especially its quirky characters. Interestingly, there is a clear gay subtext that, while stereotypical, is never characterized and sometimes funny. <br /> <br /> By 1934, Frank R. Strayer, an experienced craftsman, was already an experienced man in the poverty line of the film industry. , but his partnership with author Charles Belden would give him some of his most interesting films, and "The Ghost Walks" was one of them. While apparently being done on a spectacular budget and the typical production values ​​of independent films of his time, Strayer strives to take advantage of his set and create an atmospheric film that suits the mood and tone of the story. The pace is sometimes too slow, but Strayer knew the power of his film was on Belden's screenplay and made the best of it, and made his player the best of their characters with excellent results. The performance is definitely a bit typical and unimaginable, but Strayer makes an effective, though work-related, movie. <br /> <br /> As noted above, the script is filled with good lines that make the strange characters shine, and fortunately, most of the cast plays with this to their advantage. Richard Carle, veteran character actor, is remarkably funny as a fiery producer Herman Wood. He added a lot of charm to his character, especially in his scenes with Johnny Arthur, who plays the flamboyant secretary Homer. Arthur is the one who gets the best scenes, and he gives and hilarious performance as the cowardly but witty assistant. John Miljan is just as effective as Presocott Ames, nothing wonderful, but nothing really bad, and the same can be said about June Collyer as Gloria Shaw (the mandatory love interest), which is not good. However, Donald Kirke is really enjoyable as the malicious Terry Shaw, and it is a pity he didn't get any screen time anymore. <br /> <br /> As usual with Frank R. Strayer movies, the low budget makes the movie bad, while Strayer does the best he can, sometimes the movie feels temporary. The main problem, however, is the very slow pace it has, because even when the film is full of spooky moments of witty dialogue, it moves at such a slow pace that can become boring and boring for moments. It should also be said that Miljan and Collyer are effective in their roles, but compared to Arthur and Carle, and one wants the film to be more focused on the comic couple they make than on the main pair. Finally, as mentioned above, the end is poor and not the high standard of the first and middle parts, although credit to Belden must go to prevent creative plot twists to the end. <br /> <br /> One can say that Charles Belden is an ominous hero of the murder mystery genre, as it is among the many horror and riddle films called the B movie studios called "The Poverty Row". "The Ghost Walks" are among the best (alongside Strayer's previous film, "The Vmapire Bat") despite his shortcomings. And even when it's definitely not a masterpiece of the genre, it's a great way to spend an evening and enjoy the way it makes fun of itself as a murder killing game. A lot of recommended movie if you want the genre. 10/07
