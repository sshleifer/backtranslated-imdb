I was lucky to see a show of this remarkable short film by Joshua Leonard before his premiere at the Sundance Festival 2005. In twelve short, but beautiful minutes, Leonard takes us on a life-changing journey, exploring one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues that our society is. The film embodies elegant direction, moving performances and a heartbreaking story. Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas radiate as the two lovers. And in his first dramatic business, Leonard proves to be a director with a prosperous future. I feel this short must be extended to a feature film. It's hard to describe talent, but like this debut movie, you know it when you see it!
