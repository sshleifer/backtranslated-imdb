The only pure life is one that ends with a signature in blood. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mishima says, a young protected boy who becomes a well-known author. The life of one of Japan's most celebrated literary voices is taken from three perspectives, his life just before he and four members of his private army, a Japanese army base and commits ritual suicide (changed color), flashbacks (shown in black) and white), and screens from his novels (which come in a kind of dream-like Technicolor style, are somewhere between the traditional Noh Theater and The Wizard Of Oz. These stories are often told at the same time, but are edited to strengthen, slow the fiction of Mishima's life with his fictions to the end (or the beginning) when he, like the old samurai he so admires, will have a balance between pen and sword (when his words and actions are the same and he is full and 'pure'. <br /> <br /> Paul Schrader wrote the screenplay for "Taxi Driver", and director "Cat People" (a bizarre erotic horror movie that left me as a boy strange impressions ), and in Mishima he comes closest to a very good movie make. <br /> <br /> What is of interest is to look at the poet, the homosexual, the shy and uncomfortable man with a low body image that overshadows his tuberculosis to come from World War II (of which he is always ashamed) , a physique, samurai obsession, a sexual, media phenomenon, still writes plenty of novels of novels, plays and short stories. <br /> <br /> A short and sweet version is to say that Mishima has no father and is obsessed with masculinity, beauty, sex and self-destruction, in a tragic effort to feel connected with something bigger than himself, that he always misses. To see him with his fellow suicide cadets, you see him happy, deliver his great paternal speech, give orders and love the control ... to the speech itself, the point where the pen and the sword meet? Of course, it ignores the subtlety of the story telling craftsmanship that makes this transformation so natural and remarkable. <br /> <br /> Although the story, fascinating at times, is not really the movie's greatest success. The cinematography, performances, editing, music (by Philip Glass), and designs are really what it is worth seeing, and more than a traditional bio-pic. <br /> <br /> One day I will pick up. A Mishima book, he seems to have an ear for prose, and for drafting ideas, but for now I'm happy with the movie. <br /> <br /> Those interested in Japanese literature and post-war culture should look. Fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions should also enjoy.
