Ben Marshall, a teenager from a religious background, is made aware of the financial situation at his home by his dominant mother, Laura. She proposes to find a temporary job to contribute to the household. In fact, the family took a widower to go with them. Father Robert Marshall is a pastor at the local church; he would rather be in the country to look at birds than to give to the souls entrusted to his church. <br /> <br /> The work Ben applies to an older actress, Evie Walton, who wants him to do things for her around the house. "Lady" Evie, as she calls herself, is a woman of a certain age whose career may have died because she was not so good. In fact, the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera that was popular, but she'd rather forget it. Evie, who is a squire leader, tells Ben she is dead, just to forget about it later, later when she comes clean to the boy. <br /> <br /> Of course, Ben is in awe of the greater than life's personalities of his employer. He takes management lessons. Evie asks him to take a camping tour, which he does against his better judgment. He knows that it will provoke his mother's anger. Not happy with that, Evie decides to go to Edinburgh, where she is invited to read at an arts festival. It is this journey that makes their band solid. Ben meets and enjoys the flesh with a sympathetic Bryony. <br /> <br /> When Ben returns, everything gets crumbled at home. His mother, who had a relationship with a congregation, decides to leave the family in favor of the young man with whom she has a relationship. Ben and Evie's relationship survives the test of time. He also began to see his own father in another light. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Brock, the author of "Driv Lessons" and other memorable English films, takes his first legal services with this engaging comedy. The mix of show business and religion, loyalty and friendship is being explored in his screen processing that makes it a fun time at the movies. We have seen the similar situation before, as in "Billy Elliott", where Julie Walters plays a nurturing role with a younger man. We read the movie is based on Mr Brock's own experience while working Dame Peggy Ashcroft when he was young. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, who plays Evie Walton, may be the best excuse to watch the movie. She always delivers. Mrs. Walters is a welcome presence in any movie she appears and she wonders with her fake "lady". Laura Linney, a light player herself, does not get much sympathy for her icy mother. Rupert Grint, famous for his Harry Potter movies, plays Ben, the young man who sees a kind of soul in Evie. Nicholas Farrell is the betrayed father. Michelle Duncan has a small role in which she shines.
