Zeppelin is my favorite band, so when I heard that this double DVD came out, I was understandably excited. I'll just cut in the heel and say if you're any kind of Zeppelin fan, run it and buy it right away! It's absolutely spectacular! It completely blows 'The Song Remains The Same'. Why this material has never been released before is beyond me. The footage presented here really shows Zep the highlight of their game, which I never really felt "Song" really did. Jimmy Page is best without a doubt, and these performances make Jimi Hendrix a bunch! Watch out for the live jam "White Summer" ... Wow! <br /> <br /> Viva Jimmy Page! <br /> <br /> Viva Led Zeppelin! <br /> <br /> 11 out of 10
