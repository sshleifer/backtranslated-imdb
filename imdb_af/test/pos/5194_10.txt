Describing Stalingrad as a war movie can be a little inaccurate. Certainly it is centered on the longest and bloodiest struggle in world history, in the most comprehensive scene of the most expensive war in terms of life, money and material that ever took place. Yes, it contains action scenes that depict bitter fighting and terrible destruction. However, the visceral storytelling and harsh images make it more than a war movie, even more than an anti-war movie. Stalingrad is instead a film about absolute and unmistakable hell. <br /> <br /> The film is full of visual descriptions of the worst kind of war, one that is very personal and close, where days are spent taking one city block. just to revive it in a surprise attack. The early form of modern urban warfare that the Germans called Rattenkrieg is portrayed in brutal and uncompromising terms. The characters war in sewer tunnels, railways, and from building to building in the sacred bombing of destroyed Stalingrad, which is only defeated by the unforgivable Russian winter. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the issue of Nazism and the destruction of Germans during that time in the way many other films from Germany and the rest of the world do. His characters are a group of soldiers engulfed by the winds of war and just trying to make it out to themselves and so many of their comrades alive. The characters do not fight the Soviet Union from any ideological hatred between National Socialism and Soviet Communism, not for any great dream of Grossdeutschland or racial superiority. They only fight because if they do not kill the enemy, and if the enemy does not, their own officials will certainly refuse to fight. This painting adds another layer to the stifling envelope of imprisoned hopelessness that permeates the film. <br /> <br /> A kind of land-based companion to Das Boot, Stalingrad rams the epic battle of World War II in a personal light and from the unexpected perspective of the ordinary German soldier as a kind of hero tragically affected by circumstances and a brutal government that would distort his offering.
