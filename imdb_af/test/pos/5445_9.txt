I totally disagree with the other comments! I also saw this movie on an early screen and found it to be quite nice. Robin Williams is in top form. True, the tone is well-known, but it is Williams or Good Morning Vietnam: smart, funny, on the point. After too many dark turns, Williams is finally back to what he does best. The supporting actors give great performances, especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. Chris plays himself as usual, but as an agent for the next president, he was a delight every time on the screen. Lewis Black only plays himself basically, but he is very well used here. There is also a fun turn by Jeff Goldblum. The movie is more than the trailer suggests. The movie is funny, but it is not a pure comedy. It has some tension, which everyone should seriously consider, especially if you pay attention to the newspaper.
