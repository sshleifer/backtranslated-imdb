First I played the second monkey island game, and I kept it despite the low quality graphics and sound. Then a few months later I found out that a new game was made. I tried it and enjoyed it very much. The first thing you notice is the wonderful graphics. The areas are large, colorful and detailed, with lots to explore. The game requires you to use your brain, many, as always. The game is challenging, with all point and click games, frustrating. The jokes did not grow a third time. The animated tracks are also a great addition to the game. This is the best HI game there, maybe the best P&C game too! If you like cartoon-like games that play like a movie, you get this game!
