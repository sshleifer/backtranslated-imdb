I am a professional musician inspired nearly 20 years ago to start playing guitar after hearing Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin II. While not playing in the same genre or style, the impact of that man is great. Now, almost 20 years later, I finally got something more than the not-so-good. The song remains the same. Again, I saw how many tires perform, a little small - some of the current 'masters'. No tire, no where ever, never signed out the magic you can actually taste through the DVD. <br /> <br /> Robert Plant can sometimes be a bit, and you can forget the page's annoyance for him lyrics, but it doesn't matter - especially for the era. Bonham's genius shines more on this DVD than on any album with Zeppelin, the Band of Joy or Lord Sutch. JPJ is pretty ordinary - but the magic of this DVD is how well the four work together. The world liked to imagine being in black magic (k) etc. Was - it was just a matter of importance to Page. The magic (I see it very much I say) is that this DVD has a scant look at the mystery of 4 young boys who can play brilliantly, no matter how messy they actually play. It does not matter. <br /> <br /> A quick collapse. The first of the two DVDs is where the true magic is. You must be able to recognize the power and ability that Zep had in their early days. By the end of the second DVD, he was struggling with his common sense during the Knebworth songs. (It's no secret that he was seriously addicted to heroin by this time). So, I would recommend the first disc to any music lover, and the second to the only true Zeppelin fan. <br /> <br /> I can go too much here for some guitarists, but I will say after watching it, Page is definitely more creative and inventive than Hendrix. Yes, I said it. And if you disagree, watch the DVD.
