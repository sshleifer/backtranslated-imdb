I just saw this movie and it made me cry. It's a beautiful drama about two brothers who fall in love, and I think it's a good idea, especially for the closed, to watch this one. I came to love the short film genre after I only saw a few, because they have to impress you so quickly, and I have to say that this one has definitely put the point. It described a few things that I never really thought of that way. Unfortunately, I have to admit that I don't care too much about the end. Just once I would like to watch a gay-themed movie without killing myself to wards. They are always in tragedy. However, it was "cute," how it had to be together, even though it was dead. <br /> <br /> I gave it eight stars, and I recommend it to everyone, because I think it gives an 'inside look' in the world, which makes this movie to enroll you. <br /> <br /> Thanks for listening, enjoy.
