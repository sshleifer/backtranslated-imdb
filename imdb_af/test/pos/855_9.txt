This movie is a mystery. It's not scary, it's ghostly. You will probably jump on some points and for some you will scratch your head to figure it out. It unfolds its riddle by the main character Eva and her psychotic college project on a mad asylum, Don. He needed her to look for some clues to condemn herself to murder his mother. And when Eva committed himself to helping him, his pandora's box opened completely, releasing some strange things, including Malachi. I won't go to Malachi, but I thought the way it was playing was a complete genius. I know movie movies will not regard this movie with the same prestige as other classics because it doesn't know anyone much. (Angelina Jolie's brother was excellent, but maybe he had asked his sister to show her face as well. Movie could get some recognition), but I think the way Malachi's end works is something to do with talk. I recommended it to my friends, definitely worth the purchase or rental price.
