No doubt the Indian movie Eddie Monroe is one of the better independent movies I've seen in the past. The highlight for me was the performance of Paul Vario. I saw Paul for the first time, or "Big Paulie" as he is mentioned in Danny Provenzano's hit indie, "This Thing Of Ours". Fortunately, the "Eddie Monroe" filmmaker (s) did the same and used Paul's unmistakable skills in a principle (head?) Role. Out has a show (on camera and voice transfer utilization as well) that is worthy of big-budget studio roles in the near future. It is refreshing to see a trained actor who is committed to the trade, proving the same to the audience. Stop the good work, Big Paulie, and we'll see you soon in Hollywood! Not bad for a child of Canarsie, huh?
