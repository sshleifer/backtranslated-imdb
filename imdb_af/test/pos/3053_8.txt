Please be aware that this movie has nothing to do with Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist, the Music Hall is. I know what is and is not associated with New York City. The movie's Theodore is just the "Music Hall." No Rockettes are in the movie. Only wonderful ice skaters plus great actors and fun. Just think you'd like to know. Actually a great movie. You will never guess who the "killer" is while watching this movie. To the end. What a beautiful plot and beautiful ice skating. You never see such achievements again. The Roxy Theater and the Center Theaters, in New York, performed ice skating on stage!
