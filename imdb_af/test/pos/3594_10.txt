What I enjoyed most in this movie was the scenery of Corfu. Greek, I love my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story in the years when Greece struggles to stand on its own two feet by war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love, but times are hard and they have many sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looks good in a uniform, giving a passionate version of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love. I worshiped Christian Bale to be Mandras the heroine's husband, he looks very good like a Greek, his personality looked one of the Greek patriot! A real fighter in there, or what! One of the movies I want to buy and keep in my collection ... forever!
