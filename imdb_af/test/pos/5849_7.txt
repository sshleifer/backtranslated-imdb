This thriller has so many twists and turns that it has me on the edge of my seat. I saw it on the video, some of the scenery at "the bluff" might have been a little more spectacular on the big screen. Cast off Sandra Bullock, Ben Chaplin (from "The Truth About Cats & Dogs"), Michael Pitt (Henry Parker at Dawson's Creek) and Ryan Gosling (???).
