I was originally a Tenacious D fan of their first album and of course listened to some songs by The P.O.D. and was rather disappointed. After watching the movie, my view changed. The movie is pretty funny from start to finish and has found my confidence in it, even though it was really a stupid story because the attitudes that KG and Jaybles portray in the film. <br /> <br /> Much more entertaining and enjoyable than movies I recently watched in the theaters. ex. Case III (sow and drag), Casino Royale (way of gay eroticism) that I enjoyed in previous installments. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Borat, you'll enjoy the story of The Greatest Band on Earth.
