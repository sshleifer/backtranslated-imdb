This is a very good film showing the lives of international students during their "Erasmus Year" in Barcelona, ​​which is by far one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal place. <br /> <br /> The idea itself with all the different languages ​​is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are a few clicks across the countries, but most of them are true! The characters couldn't represent their different countries better. <br /> <br /> After I experienced "Erasmus" on myself during my exchange semester in Italy, I can say that the movie is incredibly authentic. I had many experiences that were similar to the characters (except that I wasn't so often). The movie is also quite funny, but not like all the stupid American college movies. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film also becomes important issues such as changing student after work. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (I may not be very objective)
