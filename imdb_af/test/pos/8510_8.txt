I'm sick and tired of people complaining of Never Say Never Again, it's just a bad remake of Thunderball. Yes, the film's influence is unmistakable, but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of reshaped films is reserved for such ungrateful and inexorable films such as the 1998 Psycho Redesign. Although it is true that the opening theme of the twelfth (and Connery's last) Bond film is one of the worst of the whole series, the film itself can stand independently, despite many other weaknesses. In addition, even the poor title song was created to nicely join the closing dialog in the movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, Sean Connery has become a bit obsolete when this film is filmed (at least by James Bond standards), but there is plenty of evidence in the story that makes it clear that it's not completely unknown. was not for the filmmakers. James Bond is almost retired before handing over his assignment. He has learned most of the recent times, not done, and there is even the tongue in the cheek of M that he pay more attention to his health, diet and training and get more exercise. and what not. Besides, this is James Bond, remember? This man is supposed to be a kind of super-man, and all his fans are all upset because he has gray hair. When this man retires at the end of the film, M sends the poor "Small-Fawcett" (in a hilarious comedy from Rowan Atkinson) to tell Bond he is without worrying about the safety of the free world and all of You can't come to the fact that he's no longer a strong young man. Come on, Sean Connery can play James Bond as well as he could ever, or at least better than anyone else could. <br /> <br /> The majority of the film deals with the comprehensive plan to steal nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage (as Dr. Evil would say, "Oh, let's just do what we always do?"). So there is clearly not much new there, but it is one of the Bond films that had the better one liners. There is the amusing scene where Bond is asked for a urine sample? "If you can just fill this cup for me? "From here?" There are many good one-liners, but the sexual innuendos aimed at being Mr Bond are especially common in this installment. But later he happened to throw a lot of urine into a villain's face, and shouted as if his face were burning. Not a very good attempt at strip lighting, especially since this guy kicked Bond's ass with a kind of super-spring device that could cut almost everything. And of course, Kim Basinger stars in this movie as one of the best Bond girls in the whole series. <br /> <br /> It's no secret that Never Say Never Again has been badly dated and one of the things that have dated the worst is the special effects ?? with one exception to the flying missiles, which was apparently fake but still impressive for 1982. The colored contact lens at the beginning of the movie was completely ineffective and the laser watch was one of the worst things in the whole movie, second only for those damn sharks. Apparently, Fatima Blush put a kind of device on his dive floor that attracted sharks (granted, they had peculiar guidance mechanisms of their own), in a scene that inspired the classic line more than likely: "I have one simple request. And it's to have sharks with FRICKIN laser beams attached to their heads! "And then there is, of course, the explosive hotel room scene revised in an episode of The Simpsons, followed by another mandatory and excessive one-liner from James. <br /> <br /> The Domination video game created by Largo, the movie's villain, is a particularly memorable scene, and the movie also boasts what is probably the best motorcycle hunt in the whole series (far from the best in Tomorrow Never Dies). strengths the film's weaknesses at the end of the film are more clearly given in the audience, mainly due to the anti-climatic underwater conclusion (one of the more obvious parts borrowed from Thunderball, and inferior recreational). the fact that Largo gave Bond some important information when he put him in the tower (Dr Evil's brilliance, again, "I'll just leave him there without first seeing his death and just to accept that everything is going to be planned . What? ') The climax of what is expected to be a quick action film should never be in a subdued atmosphere. <br /> <br /> All in all, Never Say Never Again is very high on the James Bond scale, and Connery's end-of-movie wink (as well as the two closing lines) have suggested at the moment that he may still come back for another turn than Bond. Obviously this is no longer very likely, so we can only hope.
