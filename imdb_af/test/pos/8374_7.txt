An unusual movie for an audience outside the US. Lena Horne looks fabulous and also Ralph Cooper. There is no background of crane steps as added to other musicals, so you don't hear the beating of the taps that are realistic. Music is muted to hear what dance steps are there. Acting is a bit stilted and the casts speak slowly so you think the movie is older than that. Costumes were ventured for the time in the dance routines at the end. Often you feel like you're part of an audience on a stage show. What furniture you see is very modern, which adds to the movie feel of other worldliness. A must have for all movie buffs.
