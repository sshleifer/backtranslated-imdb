The Cure is a fantastic movie about a boy with AIDS. I cried about 4 times to watch this movie and it is just as sad. I can't promise everyone will cry to watch it, but it will have you. Very emotional and very sad, The Cure is a must-see movie. It shows you the meaning of friendship and love and is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> Initially, I didn't think it would be that big and wondered why my mother was always crying to see it. But now I know it's an amazing movie that's so original and so close to real-life situations, unlike most other movies that don't make sense. Words cannot describe the greatness of The Cure, you just have to see it.
