*** May Spoilers contain *** OK, it wasn't exactly as good as expected. In fact, it was very different from what I thought it would be, but it still seems to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> I usually don't care too much about that kind of music, but in this movie it worked perfectly (I mean, he is a rock star), but at least I loved Stuart Townsend in it and Aaliyah, although she was a little part of the movie was wonderful. <br /> <br /> And while Tom Cruise played Lestat in the interview with a vampire, I have to admit I'm glad he turned off the role, although I normally hate using different people to play the same characters as successors and things. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was great and I enjoyed watching, even though there were parts that could have been better. Great vampire movie.
