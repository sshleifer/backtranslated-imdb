Guests of the Future tell a fascinating story of time travel, friendship, good and evil - all with a small budget, child actors and little special effects. Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grade Kolya "Nick" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a remote building and travels 100 years in the future. He discovers a nearby, utopian society where robots play guitar and write poetry, everyone is friendly to each other and people enjoy everything technology offers. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that makes it possible to read thoughts of humans and animals. The device can be used both well and badly, depending on whose hands it falls. When two evil space pirates from Saturn fall the universal attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of the 20th-century schoolboy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by pirates and Alice. Chaos, confusion, and funny situations follow as the happy pirates try to interfere with the earthquakes. Alice writes in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in the PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know how Nick looks, while the pirates do it. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and literally change into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator ...) Who gets Nick and Mielophone first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and good soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made children's movies like this one.
