From today's point of view, it is very ridiculous to judge this film 18 (or X in the US). The movie has a sexual but sublime erotic story to tell, but the photos are quite innocent. During the film, you feel the spirit of the late 60's and early 70's in fashion, dialogues and typical experimental cinematography and lighting. And that's exactly the part that makes it worth seeing.
