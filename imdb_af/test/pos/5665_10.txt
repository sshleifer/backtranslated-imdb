Giorgino is a long, ominous journey from bad to worse in the life of the protagonist to whom the film is named. Young, demobilized, gas-poisoned First World War lieutenant of very delicate health, formerly an orphanage doctor for children with some spiritual hardships, is looking for their new place and find much more than he ever planned and much of a different kind. Depressed atmosphere of ultimate despair, where the insane is much less terrible than the healthy, where the madness is a kind of poetry, keeps you from the very first frames of this movie to the last. And all the beauty: beauty of winter and mountains, beauty of snowy landscapes and wild forests, I do not even know how all the grief and sadness of the last days of war could be so beautifully made.
