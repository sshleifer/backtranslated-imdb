I must admit I slept in the theater while watching the first Asterix movie ... but this one is simply FANTASTIC! It's really funny and it leaves the first one mile away. It has many gags and funny situations that made me laugh since the first few minutes and I just stopped laughing when I got to the car to go home. I repeat: this movie is spectacular ... Obelix is ​​really funny and Cleopatra is a real babe !!
