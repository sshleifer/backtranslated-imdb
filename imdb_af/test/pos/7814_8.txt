I caught it on television for the first time a few days ago. I expected to just agree for a few minutes, but I was fascinated by the movie. I finally looked at everything and found it to be surprisingly compelling. The actions of the three US leaders were pretty good, especially those of Alex Cord. He plays a gunslinger with some vulnerability. Very different from how most of them are portrayed in the western world. He ended up in several situations where he was the bounty hunters' grace. The last shooting between the three leaders and the bad guys was very good, just like the scene where the doctor digs a bullet from Clay McCord. Something horrible, but realistic. I must admit that, despite my initial concern to watch a "spaghetti western", I enjoy this movie a little. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Westerns.
