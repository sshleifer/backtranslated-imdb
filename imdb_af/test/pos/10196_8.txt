The Robocop writer seems to be wholesale, The Vindicator. It is a very solid horror / action movie about a man who was accidentally set up to be used in a cruel experiment. Anyone who saw Robocop knows the story. Watch out for Pam Grier as a bitchy and darn beautiful killer. This highly effective, violent and bloody horror movie may not be for everyone, but this Canadian outing is worth looking out for anyone who is a fan of the genre. 8/10
