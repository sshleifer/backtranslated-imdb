The comments of the previous user are indeed hard. One wonders if they even saw this beautiful sweet movie. Like being so nasty about it before the author / director. Well, it's just rude! For those who grew up in the eighties, it is an artful piece of nostalgia and a lovely story has been well done and produced. The Irish film makes sure that there are many bitter evil people involved and the mildly debunked commentary on this is proof of that. As people we have a choice; give out and moan about the people who are actually going there and making things or making something themselves. I know which one is easier ... Do yourself a favor and look at this movie and watch a short movie being made ... you won't be disappointed
