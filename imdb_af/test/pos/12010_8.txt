I was surprised when I watched this movie, how much it caught me. No, the actors didn't act like a Hollywood actor, but it's not always bad, as this film proves. Quite different from the Disney standard, it's a refreshing turn, nothing less! They also give you a taste of what it probably was without being 'educational'. A movie that everyone should see and enjoy. Many people like to argue in a movie of this sort of 'accuracy', but just to get the basic idea has a lot to offer. Soft grip; East and West Germany, which is viewed on any map, will have West Germany on the left, east to right. The movie at times puts you back slightly, because about half of the screens have West Germany on the right side of the screen, and other times on the left. Even on the same occasions, they move back and forth. Perhaps, just a little more consistency would have avoided this gentle distraction. Go see it!
