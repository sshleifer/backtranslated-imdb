This film is a good example of why the Shaw Brothers are among the best directors (probably the best in the Kung Fu category). The film is well played, the story is excellent and intriguing, and while humor may not be in your face, it is nested in character interactions. As soon as the story builds up and the characters begin to assess the situation, the entire tower falls into one of the best battles (tiger, crane and crab Hung Gar is very present). There is even a scene mocking the 18th century Western social events and ending with clever and entertaining battles. The movie ends with a sudden, cute moment, but if you're a fan of the Shaw Brothers, you'll understand that the cheese is just a topping and not the lead role of the movie.
