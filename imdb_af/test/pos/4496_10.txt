OK I didn't read the book ???? And maybe the book is better ????. WHO KNOWS ??? // But I loved the movie. It was entertaining, not a bit boring, pleasant and especially heartbreaking. The friendship between the two children was so pure and innocent. These children did so well, especially the servant's son. O my God, it is like the form of God on the face of the FIRST. ARGHHHH he steals our heart so easily. ********* Spoilers ************* The other friend the rich man is a child and his confusion and frustration can be understood. BUT I got angry when he left his friend and ignored when he needed comfort. Anyway, he was just a kid and a little stubborn. I wish the movie would also have shown the older version of the poor child. Arghh it's just pain to think at the end. This movie is sad. I felt terribly sad at the end. Tears dropped my eyes. Yes, the background scores are fantastic, the screens are WOW. The kite screens are fascinating. And it does get some adventure in the middle. Wonderful action and excellent throwing. The children performed so well. GREAT direction. don't know why this movie did not fail the critics of WOOO. But it made me sure. 10/10 must-see ??????
