Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action-tension movie. I'm not a particular fan of her, but I have to convey him: he knows how to make entertaining movies. This is another example. It also didn't do to have John Malkovich as his co-star. Now there's an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin, and he is fascinating to watch, thanks to his various disguise and the tremendous dialogue he gave. He also has an interesting voice. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo is pretty low key (for her), but it's good and Eastwood plays the regular one-off roll, not appreciated by his superiors, but shows them everything in the end. I think he can't stop playing the "Dirty Harry" type figures, but he played them well. <br /> <br /> There were some negative films, namely: credibility in parts like there were Some times, if it were, the killer would have settled with Eastwood. The climate scene in particular had too many holes in it. There was too much abuse of the Lord's name in vain here. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, it's a good, escaping price.
