A few years ago, for the first time, I saw this repetition of the sixties classic with the Mini Coopers and I remember it a lot. Now, about two years later, it was shown on television and I just wanted to know if I would still like it as much as I saw in the theater. Well, the answer is yes. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a team of robbers who will do a final work in Venice, Italy. The plan is flawless and the execution is perfect. They escape and will not have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is one problem they did not consider: Someone in their own ranks does not like to divide the loot, but wants to keep it all to themselves, even if it means killing the rest of the crew . . But all but one survives and they are out of revenge. One year later, in Los Angeles this time, surviving team members create a clever and ominous plan to steal the gold and take revenge on the traitor ... <br /> <br /> The story in itself is not very original, as it is a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has many things to offer to forget about it. It's a typical heist / action movie, but it's definitely one of the better ones of its kind. The action is very nice, the landscapes and Venice are a real eye-candy, the story is right and the special effects are stunning. Even the acting is very good, something you don't often see in action games. I have to admit that I really like what I saw and I give this movie a well deserved 7.5 / 10.
