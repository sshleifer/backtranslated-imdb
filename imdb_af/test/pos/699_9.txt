Glenn Ford is hired by a crooked bank owner and a solid, stable owner, Edger Buchanan, to catch a fake robbery while the banker hides the real booty. With Ford a no-show, the two instead of a faster-fortunate second choice, leaving Ford in the mood for murder he didn't commit. <br /> <br /> Columbia Pictures's first color feature, the Desperado's looks great with sets and costumes made to take full advantage of the Technicolor process that accentuates tons of well-established western spectacle. <br /> <br /> It has the irresistible teamwork of a young Glenn Ford (third billed but essentially star) and a Prince Randolph Scott, who plays an incredibly supportive movie of great character actors in colorful roles , including the play counter Edger Buchanan, as a good but light villain who is not as stupid as he seems and has some unforgettable lines. br /> <br /> A fairly complex script effectively mixes amazing action sequences, melodrama and comedy, well directed by Charles Vidor. It is one of the great westerns of the nineteenth and forties and is highly recommended.
