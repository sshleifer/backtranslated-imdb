I don't think I'm alone when I say that 2005 wasn't special for the horror genre. While "Cursed", "Hide and Seek," "The Ring Two" and "The Amityville Horror" all show an interest and potential summary, there was more to miss than hits. For proof, see: "White Noise", "Boogeyman", "The Jacket", "Mindhunters" and "Alone in the Dark". Imagine my surprise as 'House of Wax', written tightly by brothers and sisters Chad and Carey Hayes, seems to be ... well, a surprise. <br /> <br /> Carly Jones (Elisa Cuthbert) is a young woman, traveling with her troubled brother, Nick (Chad Michael Murray), and boyfriend, Wade (Jared Padalecki). They are with Paige (Paris Hilton), Blake (Robert Ri'chard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams) hoping to sign tickets for the final football match of the season. Along the way they walk in a motorcycle, and are forced to enter a deserted town where nothing seems to be happening. <br /> <br /> At the trial this is a repetition of the classic Vincent Price B movie, I roll my eyes. I didn't even want to think about what the disaster's warrior director Jaume Serra cooked for his audience. At a time when most high-profile horror movies are disappointing, latent with bad writing, static direction, and amateur performance, I consider myself happy that Serra and the Hayes brothers have taken it upon themselves to make a good old-fashioned ghost festival . . Contrary to the disappointments I mentioned earlier, this movie does not pull, and use every movie in the book to give everyone exactly what they came for. <br /> <br /> I'm delighted that the Hayes actually took the time and efforts to create beloved and credible characters, making events so much more urgent. It also gives the young actors a little to the touch. As she did in "The Girl Next Door", Elisha Cuthbert proves to be audiences who are a skilled actress she really is. In the 2003 remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", Jessica Biel silenced naysayers by delivering a raw and emotional performance, one that the viewer sat right with her. Here Cuthbert does the same. Chad Michael Murray (a Cinderella Story), in one of his first adult roles, is not slacker than Nick, and Murray pulls out charisma and a hard edge, as well as an impressive athletics on top of it. Cuthbert gel perfectly sound, and has tangible, family chemistry. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, the press and the American public made a field day about Paris Hilton's main acting debut. Hilton is not herself, in fact, she is just as good as anyone else in the movie (doing what you want.) Like Cuthbert and Murray, Hilton has screen presence - she is sexy and playful. Why she got the worst of the movie's hard reception, unlike just picking her up. Jared Padalecki (TV's' Gilmore Girls') manages to overcome his underwritten role. Robert Ri'chard (TV's' Cousin Skeeter ') and Jon Abrahams ("Meet the Parents") don't have much to work with but get done the job. With just one scene, Damon Herriman ("Soar") makes an unforgettable impression, and his presence hangs over the rest of the movie. Finally, Brian Van Holt ("Basic") is fantastic and threatening in a dual role. <br /> <br /> Again kudos must go to the authors to avoid clich√©s as far as possible. Despite popular opinion, "House of Wax" is quite unpredictable for a majority of its current time. Take it for example: It looks like the killer is for the score and Carly bends to take some of his pockets. What do you expect to happen? See the movie, and you'll understand what I mean. It is also refreshing to see a horror movie showing the characters even a good mind. <br /> <br /> Contrary to most horror scores, John Ottman never distracts his exciting work. However, as with Dark Castle's other releases, the visual aspects of Wax are commendable, highlighting the film above its genre stairs. The talents of the film, Stephen F. Windon, production designer Graham Walker, art director Nicholas McCallum, and editor Joel Negron, highlight the ghoulish images. I speak of imagery and believe that the gore dogs will be excited with the many makeup effects and tricks in the store. Every dying scene is more stomach-like than the last. Considering his past in music videos and advertising, it is clear that Jaume Serra has a good eye for style. His "in-your-face" approach is a great benefit to the success of this movie. Just when you think the camera will turn away doesn't mean it. He is also particularly good at a building that is thick and fearless. One striking shot is our introduction to the killer, as he slowly comes out of a trap door. <br /> <br /> In such a case, I'll usually recognize when I'm in the minority (Shut up, okay? love "1000 Corps House!"). In this case, I'm stuck that the opponents got it wrong. I'm not sure why people are so hard on this movie, as it is much better than recent genre entries. Perhaps they are afraid to admit that a horror movie with Paris Hilton may well be worth watching ... Who knows? It's a horror movie, and a commendable stylish and effective one. As a lifelong horror fan, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoy "House of Wax" in all its lurking and sadistic glory. I regard it as a good performance in modern horror, as well as (along with Sin City) the first complete satisfactory version of 2005.
