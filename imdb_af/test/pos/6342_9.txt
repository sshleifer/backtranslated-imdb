At first glance of this mini ... I was disappointed that Tommy Lee Jones and Anjelica Huston did not return. Both John Voight and Barbara Hershey have done commendable work which has replaced many important characters for the ongoing saga of this legendary Epic Western. <br /> <br /> Cherokee Jack Jackson (Haysbert) played an excellent bad guy, and Louis Gossett Jr. was as always true to form with his excellent acting. <br /> <br /> The drama that has been seen in many scenes of life, including one of the best, where the brave shooting ended when Ranger Walker was murdered, I felt I was actually in the movie. Back to Lonesome Dove was, to me, almost the quality of the first of the series. The following 2 sequels with James Garner as call made it just for me. And that Lorena married pet? How did the naked got in them? It was a total mismatch of characters. The first 2 of the series made the Epic story, the next 2 were in no way the same quality. <br /> <br /> Now, if the first 2 in Dolby Digital and an Anamorphic presentation could be remastered, the movies could be where they should have been like the movies of today.
