Barbara Stanwyck probably didn't think about it, but it was a relief to see her in a more dark hairstyle (if it wasn't a wig) than the one she had to carry in "Double Damage" the previous year . The film, while the premiere "film noir" and an all-encompassing movie, gave her a big role, but oh that hair. Here she is more chic and definitely not femme fatal, but she is definitely a woman of 40. She got used to life without men, as most of them are in the war. And as a successful Martha Stewart as a columnist, she writes a homely column describing her country house as the camera about what it really is. We meet her boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea she's a lie, and when he pushes away for a Christmas at her supposed Connecticut home, she needs a man (Reginald Gardiner) and baby before we "Jingle Bells "can say. Hungarian chef S.Z. Sakall comes in to help and ends in a cutsey pie one-on-one with Irish Una O'Connor. "It's not Goulash, it's Irish Stew". Sakall simply took the paprika, took most of it and said, "Now it's goulash", completely changed what she prepared for lunch. Then, when it comes to the flapjacks, he flips and kicks. For years, a few friends of mine and I will use that line every time pancakes enter a conversation. "I don't flip. I kick!" She won't even flip one for Greenstreet and say, "I've never reversed life in me." O'Connor can touch the nerves when she screams over and over in some movies, but here she loves beautifully, and her connection with Sakall is very charming. <br /> <br /> It is clear in the romance section that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwyck's cup of tea, especially if she meets Dennis Dennis, who is a bit obscured when he baths the baby, which causes Stanwyck got a little. He must immediately suspect something, but not. But it does not matter. The film is so beautiful with the rural environment full of snow, an abundance of folding chairs, and a dog running towards them as the sled comes up. After 25 years in Los Angeles, New York, after growing up in a small town west of the New York State, I missed this Christmas. While Central Park is beautiful after a first snow and the Christmas at Rockefeller Center is also beautiful, there is something to look out for at a snow-covered field of trees, and occasionally a look at deer, rabbits or others life. <br /> <br /> It is a wonderful holiday movie that can also be out of season at Christmas, making a great combination with another Barbara Stanwyck farmer's festival, "Remember the Night," a subordinate jewel. . Add to the big city Christmas of "Meet John Doe" and you may have found one of the busiest stars of holiday flies.
