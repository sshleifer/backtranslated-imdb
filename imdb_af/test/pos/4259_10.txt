This film has just about everything one could wish for when it was originally seen at the end of the 1960s. It was incredibly entertaining and gave a contemporary image of the many changes that occurred during that period - and was still going on - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam and the volatile movement that followed the quieter, pre-war 1950s. <br /> <br /> All this and one of the funniest movies, then or now. <br /> <br /> Seeing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as surprising as it was originally seen. His humor is so funny and his message so strong. <br /> <br /> And if you see it now, you get it all, while at the same time enjoying the added pleasure of being a "period piece". and a wonderful chronicle of his this historic, turbulent time.
