Even if I had never seen or heard of Georgetown, CO, it would be a lovely movie. But my father was born and raised there, and it's my uncle's horses you see to pull the sled! So this movie is very special to me. Many of the interiors are shot in buildings and homes that I recognize and are very realistic. The story is a little hokey, but Georgetown is that kind of magical place where things can happen like that. John Denver was a better actor than many people give him credit. Mary Wickes plays the kind of "healthy sinful lady with lots of sasses". She has played so well in many other films, especially "White Christmas". I don't usually go out there in winter, so I like to watch this movie at Christmas to let me over "until my next trip!
