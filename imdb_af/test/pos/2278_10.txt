You have to keep baseball, and you should at least be like Tom Selleck, but if you meet the criteria, you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. Selleck plays former main star who finds him (?) After Japan as his career win. Really well thought out and fascinating about Japanese customs and behavior. Great supportive performances by Selleck's manager ("Japan's Clint Eastwood"), his girlfriend, Takanashi, and his interpreter. The chemistry between Selleck and Takanashi works very well, it's really a very nice romantic movie, apart from the baseball. Search Haysbert as a fellow player before becoming a sustained shill for Allstate. Movie wraps very nicely. Easy in my top fifty movies and maybe my favorite one on baseball.
