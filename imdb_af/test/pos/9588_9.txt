Tweety is sent on a train by his old lady owner in his loft. In the same luggage car, also in a cage, is Sylvester. <br /> <br /> In no time did Sylvester grab hold of Tweety, but a train man came back and hit the "sneakin" kitten, "as he calls him back in his loft. He puts Tweety in a safer place, "High up and tell the cat," Now remember: no tricks! "Sylvester puts his halo on and looks innocent. Yes, right. <br /> <br /> I found the funniest things, but didn't involve Sylvester versus Tweety, but the "visual dog" in another cage next to Sylvester. The cat gets abusive with him and pays a great price in a very funny way. Sylvester just doesn't learn, but that's one of the reasons we love him! (I know a number of IMDb reviewers don't like Tweety, but I love both main characters - they both cracked me!) <br /> <br /> The train and passing scenery are also beautifully illustrated here. - very nice visual
