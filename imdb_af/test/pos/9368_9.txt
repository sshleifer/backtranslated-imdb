A movie like Crossfire puts another film that spreads over its social consciousness - ie, the recent movie Crash - almost too shy. Not necessarily because one expresses his message of intolerance, but it is more rotten (although I want to throw Crash, the hammer throws a lot more pounds in comparison), but because of how storytelling and relationships never go much in the way crash. Perhaps it is not really necessary to compare the two, since Crossfire is deep in the film noir's core, like going out of style. It was interesting to see what the director Edward Dmytryk said about the DVD interview. He mentioned that the budget for photography was significantly lower (so that it could be spent more on the actors) very fast, quick pace. But then, what happens, as if it is incredible about the picture, is that you would like to think of much of the lighting setup that it did a lot. Just for a small scene, such as when Robert Mitchum's Keeely first enters to interrogate Captain Robert Young, the contrasts of shadows are seamless in the room. That there are many other lighting that go even further with so few points as something essential in the kingdom of just the appearance of the noir period. Just look at a shot of characters on a staircase, the bars that are lined up against them, and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> But back to the substance part of the movie, it's really a story that consists of a murder mystery, but one that we as the audience don't take long to answer. figure not. It is more about something other than the mind and soul of a murderer who is not found in a common crime photo, since there are no criminals. There is a very calculated risk of characters being too thin to compile the (valuable) message against anti-Semitism. But Dmytryk's direction of his top shelf, along with a wonderful screenplay by John Paxton, stares at the characters, the least of which does not seem to be too short of the message. And what would a noir be without an attitude to go with it? Mitchum helps it together, even in scenes such as between him and Young, where it is very much based on the situation of the story's moment (ie a detail in the plot), by injecting a little slime white into some of the dialogue. . It may already be in line, but he helps the character with a good edge for his scenes. <br /> <br /> There is also Robert Ryan, who comes to Montgomery as a man you know, I don't like much, just by his bs attitude, but you're not quite sure either. Then it is only ironically seen by means of a subjective view of the suspect Mitchell (George Cooper) at the apartment of the Samuels who has passed away soon. His performance is a great balance between being full of shit and scary in his blind road. This is a good performance when confronted with Cooper, who has real personal problems that he faces, and with regret and humility. This is really after the movie ends, one of which is thought of, and while watching the movie, it's about dialogue and the flow of the screens, and in the sometimes sharp, overwhelming camera moving on the actors, so the message is in a way secondary. Not that it is not an important one, especially for the period (coming right from World War II), but years later they see the actors, even those who do not have the great exhibition status such as Gloria Grahame as Ginny (the femme fatale of the photo, if it could have time for one not doing it) and William Phipps as Leroy (the "hick") work off each other, which is very strong in the compacted script. <br /> <br /> It is also very wise to decide that the musical is limited, too powerful. As for many parts, we hear nothing, and mostly when it comes, it happens to be the character's environment. He could just as easily have gone with more musical notes about dramatic scenes for emphasis, especially the opening of the audience grab in the movie. By making it clear, and getting and throwing the right attitudes and nuances into the camera, it raises standards in genre material to a very fine, memorable level. My favorite scene is probably going to Finley's story about an Irish immigrant he tells Leroy, where all such elements come in handy. It may not be very high on my favorite noir - and I will throw Murder My Sweet as the director's masterpiece in this kind of picture, but it's probably better than quality on the B level.
