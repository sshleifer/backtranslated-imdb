I thought this movie was highly understated. The subject looked like it would be a bit strange, and I was down, but when I watched the movie, it didn't look strange. I was intrigued by all the different possibilities the story had to offer, and I couldn't wait to figure out how it would end. Once it was finished .... I thought about it for a long time. I was happy with everything about K-Pax, the acting and the story and the scientific elements and psychological issues to the end. It's not a particularly positive or happy movie, although it makes you hear from time to time, but I found it to be especially entertaining and enticing. I own it now and intend to look it many times.
