It's the underestimated Kellie Martin's best role. Based on a true story, it tells the story of Fusia's effort to save the members of the Diamond family and other Jews she meets over time. One of my all-time favorite movie scenes involves a heroic act by Fusia's little sister. All children should see these scene role models, as these are very few and far between. The movie was well written and performed. I'm a movie lover and this movie I give a 10 on imbd's rating system. It's on my top 25 movies of all time and needs to be put on video. <br /> <br /> Mike Porter
