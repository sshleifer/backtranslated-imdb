Hallelujah !!!! ? Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border (s) to show how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage who is sick and tired of seeing Colombia as perverse and unfamiliar with Hollywood and others. <br /> <br /> How many of you know that Colombia is the second oldest uninterrupted democracy in the world (to the US), or that it has a lively film and television industry (to say nothing of Ugly Betty), being the capital, Bogota (Pop 9 Million) is the "World Book of the Book" or that This beautiful city hosts the world's GREATEST International Theater Festival? I hope Doug Liman, Simon Kinberg (Mr. And Mrs Smith), Robert Zemeckis, Diane Thomas (Romancing the Stone) one day go to Bogotá, to see how wonderful it really is, and focus on Bogotá's cultural vitality and diversity , instead of producing myopies films such as Maria Full of Grace, of which Joshua Marston has greatly benefited (for this immense movie) without ever thinking about the ontological damage his film would help to continue on "unfairly" withered image "of Colombia. /> - Anyway, you'll at least enjoy Bluff! -Oh, and thank you IMDb for your valuable / good work !!!
