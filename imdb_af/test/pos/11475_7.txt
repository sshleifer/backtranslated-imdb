Since frame number 1 do you know the good man in the suit and strap is doomed? He has no luck ("Black Nula"), or he believes with the music on the car radio and the dubious talk by his best friend and company co-worker who takes him to unknown parts through a desert road. Alberto just wanted to be left alone the next day with a flight abroad, with? Well, somebody who's left us guess. <br /> <br /> The movie goes a long way? what will be short? after a closing ring with the man who hears the same music on a taxi to the airport. In addition, a number of happy people have found various ways out of the story, some have died, some are born, others have fallen into frightening distress. This time he's really doomed? Or is he? The film is a kind of one-man show by director Fernando Fragata who has just left the sound recording and special effects to other capable people. Those who usually reject Portuguese films due to sound problems and unclear speech recording should look for other topics to criticize this time. The car accident (it's not spoiled, the movie is too smart for it) makes for a wonderful scene, and apparently done with cheap equipment. (US Studios note: you can save a dollar or two by hiding competent Portuguese directors!) <br /> <br /> The rest was done by Fragata, from scripts to dialogue, from camera work to editing. As part of the ad-libbed dialogue, he must once again be congratulated on acting, and the decisive role with mostly inexperienced actors. A large number of non-speaking parts are credited, but most of the people are used to the music video and its making, which is used in the film's promotional wagon. The cast has a dozen actors and actresses, of whom ten are relevant persons, and a large number of relationships? It is uncovered step-by-step in an exciting, exciting way, reminiscent of the best genre writers. 'Alfred Hitchcock' (qv) and 'Claude Chabrol' (qv) are remembered by the cat-and-mouse game between the director and his audience and the character of his characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this ghost and comedy to Portuguese language speakers, and if the film gets a decent translation of his conversation dialogue, to anyone who enjoys those genres.
