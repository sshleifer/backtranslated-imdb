"Crossfire" is a well-known 1947 noir that is a murder mystery with a strong message. These are Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sam Levene and Gloria Grahame, and are strongly led by Edward Dmytryk. We see at the start of the murder in the shadow and for the rest of the film, Young, as the detective, Finlay, in charge of the case, trying to find out which of the three soldiers is responsible for death, and just as important, why. The victim, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene) is someone who meets the soldiers in a bar; they went up to his flat to continue their visit, and Samuel died. <br /> <br /> I don't know about 1947, but today see 'Crossfire', one knows who did it and why the moment we see the suspects. I don't think it was so clear, as these actors just started. Nevertheless, the film packs a great punch with its powerful acting, good direction, violence and unsparing anti-Semite language. <br /> <br /> Characteristics are lively, including those of Gloria Grahame in a small role - she is a woman who meets Mitchell (George Cooper), one of the suspicious soldiers, in a pub can provide an alibi. The big show in the movie belongs to Robert Ryan, but everyone is excellent. Robert Young is especially effective as a tough but intelligent police detective. Mitchum is very nice as a soldier trying to make his confused friend Mitchell, a lonely man uncertain, whether he still has feelings for his wife. <br /> <br /> Very good, and a must see.
