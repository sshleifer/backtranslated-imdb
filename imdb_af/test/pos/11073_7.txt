This film keeps in mind: "Boys a Hood," "Menace to Society," "South Central" and others of his ilk and even share actors with some of them. The film's "us against the law" mentality is accentuated by the black-black environment versus the almost all-white police force. Here the police are so bad that they look like caricatures and in one scene they even hide the boys while driving in a car they have just freed from their owner. It's like a forest that deviates from an old Western, but the contemporary environment makes it all too true. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on young Jason Petty and his friends, to whom the school is just an inconvenience that takes time away from their "real profession" of promoting cars. This is happening to Newark, N.J., a city of rusting belts at work, but notorious for crime. In fact, the problem is so bad that the police all have "Car Theft" on their backs to show that a whole unit should be dedicated to this crime. <br /> <br /> The boys use a slender Jim "To break into cars and drive with joy, as if it's not a big problem. They just run into real trouble when the police ambush Evil Nazi Lt has a vendetta against the boys and does not see them as worthy to earn salvation, but as human targets, in fact he is a little reminiscent of the sadistic Nazi officer Warsaw ghetto, who shot the Jews for pleasure in the movie "Schindler's List." When the boys steal a police car in retaliation for the ambush, things are going predictably fast, they are seriously beaten by police and Jason ends finally in jail It is clear that it is "bad boys" that will steal your car in a minute, but the movie wants us to see them as heroes, Jason protects his sister and his friend cares The film surprised us and asked whose side should be e one whose sadness must be: the boys whose lives are in the drain, the honest citizens whose cars are stolen, left and right and caught in the crossfire of a shooting moment or the city of Newark itself, the spirit whose law is betrayed by brutal, soul-dead police. <br /> <br /> Despite the over-the-top portrayal of the latter, the film offers a realistic display of the ghetto, of the protagonists and their families and of the culture of car theft in a city where there are only 2 careers - law enforcement and crime. Oddly enough, the whole subject of drugs has never been mentioned. <br /> <br /> Of course, the filmmakers (including producer Spike Lee) are biased against the Newark police, which we hope is not so bad, they are portrayed here. Nonetheless, they gave us another strong, influential story about the city center and the black youth went wrong and Sharron Corley is good as Jason.
