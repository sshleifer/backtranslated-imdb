I would probably not have bothered to respond to this movie if I was not disturbed by the constant references made here in North America as a porn movie. Our obsession with what or should be regarded as pornographic remains a remnant of the "guidance" provided by the Hayes committee many years ago to filmmakers and it is now really time we rejected it in the past. So far, we have not gone much further than establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now call "soft" and "hard" pornography, with both the same pornographic label. It's time we all admit that the version of R is not rated (soft porn?), Or the unprecedented (hard porn) version available on DVD in any way pornographic. <br /> <br /> In legal terms pornography is defined by its ability to deprave or corrupt. Many classic books such as Lady Chatterley's lover, Fanny Hill, Women in Love, The Story of 'O' or Moll-Flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content, tested by the jury and cleared under this definition, but in practice the Most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal equilibrium, and apply a simpler test applied to books or movies that are very close to the line, but serve to remove most others quickly from any pain of pornography. Although the Hayes code AIW considered unacceptable for both nudity and sexual imagery, most people today in practice accept that the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to develop long-term stable family relationships. encouraging. in which the participants find real fulfillment, it cannot be considered pornographic (this does not mean that works that depict unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognized as pornographic, only that it requires a more sophisticated assessment). In AIW, we have a film about a young female librarian who had a fairly sheltered education and kept her warden at his arm's length because she felt it required morality. After being frustrated and threatening to leave her, she falls asleep and dreams are being transported to a Wonderland (now based on Lewis Carrol) where everyone she meets is completely unhindered about their sexual needs. She is shocked but is a friendly person who takes things as she finds it, so long before she gradually finds her own prejudices. She wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break down their relationship, but her attitude toward him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored and the movie ends with those who "stay happily ever" with their children in a home with a white poster fence and a family dog ​​- an end to the romantics who are very young at heart. <br /> <br /> Pornographic? - Rare! <br /> <br /> Suitable for children? - Well, probably not quite, unless they have many progressive parents. <br /> <br /> R Grading? - PG would be more appropriate today. <br /> <br /> Entertainment for viewers in most age groups? - Yes, but the film has its faults. This is discussed in many of the comments here on IMDb, but most commentators appreciated and enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I believe the only pornography associated with this movie was reported by an anti-pornographic activist of "scientific evidence" that a Kristin deBell magazine photo has a photographic montage of images of the a 10-year-old face with different body parts of adult models. These and other remarks have seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress, but today it seems the film is on its way to becoming a cult classic. Several home video productions are released in VHS and DVD format. the latter was a DVD that contains both the R-rated and unprecedented versions of the movie, which was released in 2007 by Subversive Cinema. Copies of this were readily available up to a few months ago, now they are almost exhausted and the posters still having copies In stock, they often sell their original price - a situation that usually quickly leads to a new DVD edition that appears. This continued interest nearly 35 years after the original film was released, indicates the near classic status. <br /> <br /> Commentators on this database are expected to provide co-viewers with helpful guidance on whether a movie is worth watching or even collecting - My comment here was aimed at the ongoing damage emphasizing the industry that continues to come from pressure on large studios to respect self-censorship recommendations of the Hayes committee. On this database, such general remarks are quickly tagged by readers as "not useful" and I rarely make them; but fortunately I still have room to add that this film is, in my opinion, quite unusual and worth watching or even buying. It's wrong, but Kristine deBell gives a good performance and the movie offers a fairly unique and rewarding viewing experience. Overall, I will rate it on 7 stars and will buy a copy of the following DVD edition as and when it appears. If Me deBell is still alive today, I would like to hear her comment on the efforts to suppress this film and the late recognition it has gradually achieved.
