Trilogies are very interesting. Some go out with a bang (Lord of the Rings), some are progressively weaker (The Matrix), some get lost in the dark (Blade, Back to the Future), but some maintain the genius, the apparently ever-growing bright light which drifts beyond the surface of its flawless exterior. Case and point: "Three colors Trilogy". This chapter in the trilogy, which is the last one, is the most philosophical and thought-provoking. In "Blue" we had a more visually stunning, more character-driven plot. In "White" it was more of a light, story-driven story where we listen more to what the characters say than anything. "Red" is, however, focused on the "what if" and "how come". It demands our own fate and focuses mainly on the past and the future as the present. <br /> <br /> This chapter deals with a young model walking across a dog and bringing him back to his owner. She soon finds out that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on his neighbors' phone calls through advanced espionage equipment. All three films in the trilogy have many basic lines, but bring much more to the story. Consider in "Blue" the story of a woman who handles the loss of her loved ones. We are constantly thinking of ideas about contemporary French society and how it reflects the character's behavior. "Red" is not just about a young woman who finds shelter in an older man's life, but it is also about coincidence, hope and fate. <br /> <br /> Irene Jacob dies as Valentine Dussaut, who initially finds the old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant), whom we never get the name, very self-centered and disgusting. Although she learns through self-reflective analysis and her voyeuristic intentions, the judge would be the perfect man for her, even though he was only 40 years younger. Irene lives from another, younger judge, who looks very much like the old man. This is the "what if" moving around in the movie. What if Irene was born 40 years ago? The old man would have been her perfect match. But what if the younger judge is actually her perfect match, as he looks so close to the parent. Valentine does not know, just us do, and Krzysztof Kieslowski subtly puts it in almost every frame in which Irene is. We are constantly faced with his presence in the face, as almost a suggestion of Irene's fate. <br /> <br /> I mention that the old man didn't have a name for a reason. The reason is because it is very symbolic of the overall theme of the story. We have to compare the old judge to Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit), the younger judge, in more than one way. We learn that the old man once had someone he loved, but she got away. In another scene, we see Auguste sad because the love of his life comes with another man. There are constant memories of whether Valentine will ever meet this man. Although they pass each other without notice every day. There is also the motive of the phone, for Valentine it is a way to stay healthy and update her life, until Auguste leads it to his grief, and to the old man this is the only thing he has left. These three elements serve to shadow the characters' own psychology. It's a kind of statement about what they are and who they are. <br /> <br /> All three "Colors" films stand for a certain principle, the most common in France. "Blue" stands for Liberty (the personal being), "White" stands for Equality (accepted by more than one), and "Red" is brotherhood (to socialize, to learn). And although this last chapter is a clear focus on the fraternity principle, Kieslowski makes sure he also brings in the other two to connect all three stories. For example, we see the old man trying to reach out to Valentine and relieve her with his espionage equipment, which is a reflection of the equality principle. We also see near the end that Valentine is looking for a little soul and that she is more concerned about herself than others (not taking the phone when Michel calls), a clear example of Liberty. And with all three established principles, Kiesskiski now also chooses all characters in the final and most cordial scene. <br /> <br /> "Red" is where you were when you were older or younger. It's about whether someone is perfectly perfect for everyone, and whether one person can change your life or not. The final chapter in the most awesome trilogy ever made breaks these films into both directing and storytelling. It's not just about our modern life, but about where life in our modern times can and should be. And while the film is more subtle than both "Blue" and "White", it boldly calls out a statement of love and compassion. <br /> <br /> It is hard to imagine that "Red" was Kieslowski's last movie, and that he died at such a young age. Nevertheless, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that is entirely with Bergman, Fellini and Wenders as a remarkable director who has never been awarded an Oscar. Kieslowski, you missed!
