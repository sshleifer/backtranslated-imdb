Anyone who enjoys the Lynchian weirdness of Twin Peaks, or any fan of HP Lovecraft, who knows the most terrifying things are the familiar stuff, will really enjoy this movie. Don't regard it as a horror movie in the "traditional" western sense, but more like a Grimm's fairy tale. It is stingy and definitely for 16+, but as soon as you start to look it will be found in the vortex. Definitely one of those movies to hang on to you for a few days (I'll never look at my snails again!)
