Tipping the Velvet was released in the UK just three weeks ago and I am already looking at numerous letters to national newspapers and TV guides, claiming it has a thin plot, poor performance and even a weaker writing. <br /> <br /> You find me furious. It is heresy. <br /> <br /> I would like to dispel many doubts by first congratulating Andrew Davies on enabling Geoffrey Sax to create this wonderful dramatization of Sarah Waters's novel by pushing him with such a fantastic script. Kudos. But I fear I should change branch now. <br /> <br /> I saw one of the premier TV guides here in the UK (which is nameless). If they are, and I assume they are trying to promote interest in the movie, then this is quite the wrong way to go about it (apart from the phrase that is a disappointing inaccurate description). By saying something like this, they are either a) those who would instinctively be absent by "that" subject or b) a class of people who would just look to see a serious "girl on the girl". Buy a video! Through this display of serious consideration, these and other magazines are cheaper, which is a brilliant adaptation of one of the greatest works of recent literature. Tipping the Velvet is a story of love, passion, movement, loss and sadness. It's not a lesbian love story. No siree. <br /> <br /> The end result is an attractive affair, with excellent performances everywhere (especially from Stirling, Hawes, Chancellor and May). Direction, it is intoxicating and immersive - sometimes, fast, sometimes not - but it never stops less than compelling. As a whole, it is seasoned and well delivered, the generation is undertaken by gentleness and delicacy - and while many do not classify it as a real "movie", it will remain in my favorites a few times.
