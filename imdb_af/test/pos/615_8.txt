There is no dull moment in Francois Ozon's "Robe d'Ete". It's amazing how much is packed in this short movie. While sitting on a deserted beach after a naked swim, a young gay is approached by a girl looking for a light for her cigarette. She invites him to love in a wooded area near the beach. Upon returning to the beach. they find all his clothes stolen. She gave him a summer robe to cover his nudity and requests that he return the next day. He drives his bike back to the holiday cabin that is dressed as a girl. His gay companion is sexually excited. The next morning the young man returns to the sea and greets the girl whose holiday is over. She suggests holding the dress as a souvenir of their summer novel. It is a light film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea, but perhaps not for those who are ashamed of nudity or homosexual themes.
