A very 'alternative' comedy in Britain in the 1980s was insulting, deceptive, overly political and unfunny, and the worst of the Strip Strip listing ... fell into this category. <br /> <br /> But it's on the other hand - a remarkable film that works at different intellectual levels. <br /> <br /> Is Dennis a criminal mastermind or is he lying? <br /> <br /> Is he telling the truth, bluffing, double-barking, anti-double-bubbly bluffing what? <br /> <br /> I probably watched Supergrass 20 or 30 times, and I still can't decide 100%. This is the wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> And also Ade Edmonson, there are big roles for other early comic strips - French & Saunders, Pete Richardson, Alexei Sayle, Keith Allen, Nigel Planer and Robbie Coltrane, though remarkably not Rik Mayall. <br /> <br /> All the cartoon story - although I didn't like the hidden agenda of some of their members - is convincing actors, and turns out to be pleasurable performances in this big screen outing, while the Richardson Richens writing team does so regularly pure genius is, with fine little detail. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is a study of crime, criminology and human nature, in all its wonderful complexity. And very funny with it. You won't be disappointed.
