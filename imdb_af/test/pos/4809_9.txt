I just bought a Zhan on DVD and it was a great movie to say. Not really action packed, in terms of weaponry, but definitely exciting and witty. I don't think I saw Andy Lau in better shape. And the editing on this movie was done very well. Now check out if you are a fan of Lau or HK thiller / action movie!
