I thought this movie was pretty good! OK, so maybe it had some scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but I saw much more pathetic movies that have much higher ratings than this one! Many movies are now being restored to a more modern version and there is nothing wrong with it, it keeps the story alive. I don't think this movie was pathetic and I don't just say this because I'm a big Chad Michael Murray fan, but because I enjoyed it. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends and I really enjoyed it and we talked about it completely! I'll tell my other friends to watch this movie. I'm not saying it's the best movie ever to touch the box side, but it's much better than some people describe it. Everyone has their own opinions, so if you really want to know if it's good or bad, look at it and decide.
