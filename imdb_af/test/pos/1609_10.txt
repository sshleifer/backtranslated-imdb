Story of a strange love and a fall desire. Poem about beauty and its perfection, fear and touch. A Cut Visconti, Mahler and Mann. And an agonized Venice. I don't know if it's a masterpiece, a poem or the reflection of a film director world. It is absolutely a "memento mori". and an exploration of illusion. An old mirror of borders, signs and death ladder. A trip in an old space, nostalgic, cruel and beautiful. "Death" is an Orfeu's travel copy in immediate reality. And the essence is the music. A soft, sweet music, like honey or winter's fire. Like every regret and every sadness. Like a refuge in deep loneliness. Gustav is accidentally gay. He is the researcher of the last form of God's presence. The beauty, that beauty that gives life's meaning, who is sin and virtue at the same time, the gift of expectation and suffering. He dies because he has the right to hope, to believe in the reality of miracle and in his way. A victim? Not at all! Only Tadzio can give freedom as a negligible sacrifice. Who has seen the sun hope to live in the same state?
