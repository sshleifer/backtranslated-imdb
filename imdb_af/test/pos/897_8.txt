The main reason to look at this one is to see Laura Gemser in all her glory. <br /> <br /> That's enough for me. <br /> <br /> Its heads to Africa as guests of another rich guy It seems to be about these movies. Large house near the jungle. Hunters stay around for parties if they are not zebra. And said parties are getting drunk orgy. <br /> <br /> All the high society types in the Emanuelle movies seem to have fetishes out of control. And Emanuelle beds most of them. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato did not order this one. He just ripped it and used the same cast (s). And did anyone see the 'subliminal' sexual images at the petrol station? And why did most men wear sex scenes? <br /> <br /> Coherence? Hardly any. BUT GODDESS GEMSER IS BEAUTIFUL.
