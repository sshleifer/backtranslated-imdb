*** Contains spoilers *** <br /> <br /> A lovely movie it, with Brad Renfro and the wonderful Joseph Mazzello. I love Joseph Mazzello, from all his movies I've seen so far, I loved each of their different loved ones and The Cure is no different. Brad Renfro is also doing very well in this movie. The Cure is a drama / upcoming lifetime film from the point of view of a sick child and his friend. <br /> <br /> The basic idea is: Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) has AIDS. He ends up befriending the baby next door (Brad Renfro), but Erik's mother is very meticulous, poorly informed and a little "thick" when it comes to Dexter's disease. She thinks AIDS is contagious like the Common Cold, and doesn't want her son to be anywhere near Dexter. <br /> <br /> After many attempts to make their own healing without success, the boys are heading for New Orleans to find the cure after reading a pamphlet on it. After getting their kicks from Playboy magazine, Dexter's health goes to the south and if his health deviates, there's still plenty of life in the boy next to Erik for two pranks to stop breathing. Unfortunately, poor Dexter dies of his illness, after which poor Erik stays to wonder why he couldn't find the drug. During the film he ended up more with Dexter's mother as his own. <br /> <br /> It's a very heart-warming movie to watch and isn't quite perfect (movies are rarely), but you won't care less about it. as you become more involved in the movie. A must have for Joseph Mazzello fans, one of his best achievements ever. Highly recommended should-watch movie - if you can find a copy :)
