Like many other reviewers here, my memories of this show are universally warm. In fact, the sad memories I bought recently bought the DVD set to regain the happy and indifferent period of childhood, after which I was always interested, as I am pursuing Monkey, Pigsy's constant quest, Sandy, Tripitaka and later Yu Long a horse / dragon / man (you really should see it to understand), when the beloved show was initially broadcast on BBC 2 on Friday nights, as I remember. <br /> <br /> Well, it's nice to say that even though the years and now with adult, more cynical (!) eyes, see the performance has lost nothing of its inevitable charm. <br /> <br /> Simply wonderful entertainment, from the magical characters and their comic interactions with each other on the possible not as special effects (which actually serve to increase the fun) and of course not the extremely memorable opening title sequence of the first season don't forget, over time Not in any way, shape or shape diminishes any of Monkey's spell binding. <br /> <br /> If Monkey himself would probably say, 'Oh! You there! Go out and grab yourself some nostalgic fun. '
