I'm not going in too much depth, but Showtime was a nice, funny movie. There wasn't a funny spectacular spectacle (I can't remember), but it had moments. The role play is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a very funny show. Rene Russo was just fine in the movie, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy) partner at the gym played by Ken Campbell. I suspected he was just a friend of Trey, but I wanted to know more about him. The other character I liked was Mr. Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) co-cop / partner played by Nestor Serrano. I think he was just another cop working with Mitch Preston, but I wanted to know if he was his or her partner. I think maybe I thought too much about a movie, I mean it's a comedy ... who cares for the characters? I think though. I was delighted to see it run by Tom Dey, who also directed Shanghai Noon. Since I saw that movie, I look forward to his next work. I think he did a very good job with this movie, and I look forward to his next work. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a good movie, but I wouldn't recommend paying the full price. a ticket unless you are a tough Robert De Niro / Eddie Murphy / Rene Russo fan. It was worth seeing in the theater, but not for the full price, I would recommend seeing it at matinee prize. <br /> <br /> Here are some movies for you too. The man who played the camera man, played by Juda Friedlander, is the man in the music video Everyday by Dave Matthews. He was also the clerk in "Meet The Parents", also starring Robert De Niro. ... And he also plays Derek Zoolander's brother in "Zoolander" (both Zoolander and Meet the Parents star Ben Stiller). Just a useless trivia for you. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy the movie. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
