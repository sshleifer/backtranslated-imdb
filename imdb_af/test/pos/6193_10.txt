a dramatic drama, there is no other drama out there that deterred the crap from me as it has, the characters are not your typical Islamic terrorist, you have a blonde haired blue eyes man who is so stupid as he looks, he's a converted Muslim. A respected businessman, pretending to be Jewish and a Frenchman who converted to Islam, but clearly took the word of the Koran at a whole new level. The hero of the plot is Darwyn, who is an FBI agent who has a shelter that infiltrates the terrorist cell and has to do all sorts of god to prevent terrible things. The first episode is a small taste of what to follow. Although dealing with Islamic terrorists, the drama has a unique way of pointing out that not all Muslims are extremists. It is encouraging for those who worry about racism. Half of the terrorist cell is Islam converts, it makes you think they are the one. to be scared. The most different drama I've ever seen. The reason it is so chilling is because you never know who your friends, husband or neighbors really are. Terrorists can be anybody anywhere, anytime.
