Peter Falk shines as 90-year-old Morris Applebaum, the patriarch who decided it was time to "check out" after holding a final blow-out bash. His three children, Lauran San Giacomo, David Paymer and Judge Reinhold are notified / invited by letter and come straight to their doorstep to handle their eccentric father. There is a great father / daughter chemistry with Laura San Giacomo, whose character is experiencing the most growth of the ordeal. It is a well-rounded example of your average, dysfunctional family and their memories, pain, growth and ignorance / tolerance towards each other's lives. The musical score is one that you will enjoy and the one linen is well-timed and hilarious. Although I got the actual "Check Out" party, it's a slack, the rest of the movie makes sure you laugh, cry and leave the theater with a smile on your face. Move over "Big Fat Greek Wedding" .... the "Big Fat Jewish Suicide" has come.
