Ninja Hunter (AKA Wu Tang vs Ninja) is pure entertainment from start to finish because of his outrageous characters, stupid plot and lack of any pretensions whatsoever. The creators of this film have given us a true OTT masterpiece, to be seen as believed. <br /> <br /> The plot centers around Wu Tang villain, Abbot White, who wants to destroy and become the Shaolin monks. martial artist. To do this, does he use a clan Ninjas, led by three masters? gold lama ninja, white mustachioed ninja and black ninja ?? and succeed in destroying the Shaolin temple and most of its inhabitants. However, there are some survivors. It is their job to defeat the knowledge of the Shaolin finger jab for a new generation, which must defeat the Ninjas and Abbott White as restoration and peace. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Abbott White is a tough enemy to beat, as it can make itself virtually indestructible by sucking out the vitality of warm naked chicks (an excuse for some welcome free celebrities!). <br /> <br /> Other viewer treatments include very impressive battles (though speeding up), some amazing outfits (the former golden lama ninja, Abbott White's Yin Yang suits and even ' an assassin wearing Swastika tunics), a ninja that changes into a flying carpet, plus a little cheesy gore for a good friend. And I almost forgot to show the really impressive eyebrows on the screen in this movie? definitely a good reason not to succeed on this gem.
