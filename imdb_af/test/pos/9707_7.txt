Johnny Knoxville got mad. <br /> <br /> In the first Jackass did he rejoice in practical jokes more than physical things? its opening of the car rental herd and the later bit that had a lighthouse on a golf course, was more similar to a type of extreme camera? but in Jackass: number two is really his tumbler. <br /> <br /> Start with a sequence where he is driven by a bull through a lounge, or later when he drives a rocket (a bump that almost costs him his life due to an unexpected explosion from the side of the rocket), and especially when intentionally standing in front of a defense mechanism and spraying a pill in the stomach, Knoxville is a crazy man. In the first film Bam Margera and Steve-O? notorious party animals ?? was the daring, but you know it's pretty bad when you see Knoxville to relieve them of doing a stunt. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this is a series of stunts pulled down by testosterone-consumed guys. It will eventually end in death for one of the role players? in Jackass 2 Steve-O almost loses a leg after a shark, Knoxville (as mentioned above) is almost applied with a rocket explosion, and so on. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed due to the success of 2, and I really can't outdo a stunt that does the bullshit in the opening scene of this movie? It's amazing imagery. It's almost incredible, and I wondered if it was faked, but apparently it was 100% really. (What's really scary.) And in terms of extremes, Jackass 2 falls far short of his predecessor? It also feels more kinematic than the first movie, with fewer cheesy titles leading up to stunts announced on the original MTV television program. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, boys are given too much freedom here, and a good number of gags are simply lame exercises in crudity ?? I can enjoy the occasional poop gag, but look at a man who relieves him on a miniature toilet, or sees Steve-O take beer on the buttocks (yes honestly), after a while . Even the frat boys in the screening I attended? Who was enthusiastic when Wee Man took a playing card on the back and was pushed through a chair? was disgusting by some of the scenes in this movie. It's not as much as possible to get away? It is a matter of saying, "Is it even entertaining or funny?" Many times, unfortunately, it's really not. <br /> <br /> But for every lame stunt involving faecal issues and getting people's faces, there are a few brilliant hidden camera bits. Wacky director Spike Jonze ("Adaptation") dressed like an old woman and hit the streets naked, with soft breasts and no shame. And my personal favorite skit involved Knoxville as an irresponsible old man, with lunch with his grandson, letting him drink alcohol and smoking people and insulting and insulting people. It's taken classic comedy to new extremes with the freedoms of an R rating. It's a pity they had to destroy all the good things ?? including a final segment with an extensive terrorist prank ?? <br /> <br /> Yet, there is enough mere spirit and insanity in this movie to earn a viewing, and it really took the concept of extreme cinema to new heights.
