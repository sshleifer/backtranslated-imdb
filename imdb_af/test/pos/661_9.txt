Cheezy? Yep. Badly filmed? For sure. Zero budget? They claim it proud of their posters. Brilliant anyway (or as a result)? For sure. <br /> <br /> This movie celebrates (and makes fun of) everything classic about the nineties teen horror genre: characters with absolutely no depth that fit into a stereotype role, they never escape for a moment; teenagers try to kill by a mysterious force that disturbs them by doing something ugly adolescent; totally free nudity; impossible amounts of blood coming from victims; slow moving zombies; big one-liners ... and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket! <br /> <br /> It's not an all-out spoof like Scary Movie, but more a tribute movie to the lost innocence of the 80's horror movies ... when scared and taken out can also be a fun, stupid, sexy and goofy good time!
