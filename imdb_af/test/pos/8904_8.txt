... but I laughed. Very. <br /> <br /> I saw 'Astérix et les Vikings' at a public screen during the World Cup. The sound was mean, it was too bright to see the screen properly - but I enjoyed it quite a lot. The names of some characters have made me roll on the floor: Smsix, Abba, Vikea ... Everyone is not very funny, but in good Astérix tradition. Some very good jokes, but also some that don't all look like. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't like was the voice of Astérix and Obélix in the German version. The voice players are very well known here, and that was the only reason they were definitely thrown. They don't fit the characters at all. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great way to spend time (and if it's free, as in my case, better) and some laughs. 8 out of 10.
