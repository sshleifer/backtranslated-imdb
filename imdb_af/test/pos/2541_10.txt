Three of the things you can say about Spalding Gray are: he definitely went to the beat of his own "drummer". He was never at a loss for words; and he obviously felt that those who looked at him and listened to him were interested in every aspect of his life, experiences and thoughts, no matter how trivial. <br /> <br /> Most of us are not quite as far away from the wall as he was. Most of us are not as interested in sharing the smallest parts of ourselves with one another - even one-on-one. one or in small groups, let alone on the stage. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't make any less interesting to watch and listen to this erudite, unusual man, and after seeing one of his performances , we can, after reflection, find many of his articulation muscles that may be more relevant to our own lives and thoughts than we first thought. <br /> <br /> Allowed, he was a "New York / avant-garde "type of personality, and undoubtedly a bit" strange ". (There are those who would be described as' New York 'and strangely' unnecessarily redundant.) <br /> <br /> I give him a "10" for the talent he offers in this genre, which is his specialty.
