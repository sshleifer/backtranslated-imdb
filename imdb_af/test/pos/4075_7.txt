I can't understand why so many people don't like this movie. Robert De Niro was at the top of his game and gave his lines with such a grave. He must believe it is his daily attitude. Granted, the movie looks to take on many friendship convention concepts while trying to enjoy the concept. It goes without saying that this film was really funny. Of the police dogs, because Eddie Murphy didn't hurt me the worst, this movie is a real watchman. Rene Russo also expressed the rest of the role-play perfectly and established her role so as not to interfere with the emerging relationship between De Niro and Murphy.
