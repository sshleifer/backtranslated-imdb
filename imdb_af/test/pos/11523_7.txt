An interesting film featuring Jordana Brewster as a young woman traveling to Europe in an attempt to find out what her older sister (Cameron Diaz) had died earlier. Brewster is very good and keeps you engaged despite some unrealistic plots, like finding her amazinly and starting a romance with her late sister's older boyfriend (Christopher Eccleston). Still, usually good. GRADE: B
