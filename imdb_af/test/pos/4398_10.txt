I was immediately in the movie. I saw the other Coen movies, with the exception of Raising Arizona, and I noticed that each of their movies has a color. Fargo is gray / white, Lebowski is bright orange, and this movie is a pleasant yellow. <br /> <br /> The brightly fun features of this movie start right away. Soon the look is accompanied by the great, good music. It's the old folk sound, the kind of music written in a time when music was enjoyed as part of everyday life. Enjoy by everyone, chain gangs, church choirs and even prison flights. <br /> <br /> Now, escape the prison. I don't know what crime their characters might have done, because they are a very friendly group of guys. Clooney is fantastic and nails his role completely. <br /> <br /> See as soon as possible. I believe that anyone can enjoy it at any level. For some reason, the theater I was in was full of old ladies and old men, and they loved it. <br /> <br /> You'll love it too, I promise. I immediately had to get my hands on the soundtrack.
