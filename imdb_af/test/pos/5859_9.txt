I can get tired of murder mysteries, with the exception of some very good TV shows. Otherwise, there are just too many of these murder plot themes. I don't like the theme of the two overarching, selfish youths who are killed as an intellectual exercise. I have no interest in Hitchcock. It seems to be somehow associated with the fact that I'm not going to find out about. But don't get me wrong, the theme in itself is excellent, the whole movie is so well done, and of course Sandra Bullock is as always superlative. <br /> <br /> Sandra's character (as in Miss Congeniality) has not been assessed by the male team with whom she works, despite her obvious skills. The boss mostly ignores her ideas and eventually forces her aside and gives the case to her male partner. Of course, Sandra works out what is going on and is almost murdered in a very dramatic denial. It is interesting to see how the boy who worked out the murder plague does not allow her to be murdered by his colleague - he has some kind of conscience and may be saved, while the other is a true psychopath. <br /> <Sandra's hard-shell is caused by the misery of her past tied to the murder case. Her colleague, who realized that Sandra was solving the case, despite being bound by the thick superior, eventually discovered what Sandra herself had in her. teens, that she now has to look out and drive out and the last scene shows her start - we hope anyway - to do just that. <br /> <br /> I can see from the few other reviews I had time to read that this movie will attract a broad group - those who are interested in the two spoiled boys flushing their time with their Greek philosophical determination to deceive the police and get away with the perfect murder, the relationship between those so cleverly portrayed, the terrible links to the heroine's past, a police theme, and some smoke and mirrors - as well as to Hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> For those who asked why Bullock's character should have a problematic past, I really think it would be a much less interesting movie if she were just a detective trying to understand what going on, with a willing sidekick helping and a male chauvinist boss. The link between the murder victim and the detective is needed to show that the detective is getting involved or otherwise how will she lose her arrogant boss's confidence and thereby lose her life? It's hardly an original theme, and it's actually a very annoying theme, as this male chauvinist boss brutally tells us he's frustrated, but of course inspired to leave the case and give it to someone who clearly doesn't have the skills to solve it well. although the sidekick is. I was very worried about the end of what might have happened to Sandra's character if her emotional involvement in the case and special sympathy for the unfortunate victim of the crime were dangerous to her. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the relationship between Bullock's character and her sidekick. It is interesting and sometimes very sharp. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two boys is definitely interesting, if that's what you're interested in watching. I felt it was kept in some ways low key, either because the filmmakers didn't want too many friends, or because we didn't think that emotion would govern their relationship. The film makes you clever and wondering which boy is in control of the situation and there are a few turns and the boys show their underlying immaturity at different stages. <br /> <br /> There was one thing I wanted and that is what happens "after the movie ends" when Sandra's character arrives at court .... you have to watch movies to know why she is there. <br /> <br /> Well done by everyone. I definitely can't agree with those who complained about Bullock's scene. She was excellent. The part adapted her very well. The story is grabbing, even if murderous mysteries are not your thing and they are not so often mine.
