One of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is highly regarded as an "in-name only" successor. There is nothing wrong with it: the return of Chevy Chase and Ty Webb. It connects the viewer to this character (from the original Caddyshack in 1980) and makes fans think or want Caddyshack II similar to the first one. <br /> <br /> There are rumors that Rodney Dangerfield was supposed to return. He did a great deal of the first movie, so she would return would put Caddyshack 2 on top. Jackie Mason is the 'new' Rodney for this movie and does a decent job, although their comic deliveries are different. Then Aykroyd was big, but not enough in the film. He had to get involved in how much screen time Bill Murray got in the first one. Robert Stack (Plane!) Was good at the 'new' Ted Knight / Villian role. (We miss you, Ted!) Danny Noonan had to be back. So many others came back to show us what happened to their characters eight years later. Bushwood did not have to undergo the total makeover. Instead, the characters in question, rather than the club itself, had to be the main focus as they were in the first one. Looking at this movie, remember it's not a big successor and you might think it's a good or bad eighty comedy. Fans of the first must see it, but do not be shocked if the comparisons between the original and Part II are so far apart.
