When I read the synopsis, 3 people were lost in the game against a large crocodile. I didn't draw exactly. It sounded like the typical yawning movie horror formula of a lot of people being knocked by a monster - except in this case there are only three of them, so we won't even get the macabre 'joy' to see if they are one selected for one. <br /> <br /> I watched it (couldn't sleep, nothing else to do) and it was much better than expected. The acting is great, the atmosphere is tense and you really get the scant sense of a low budget winner. <br /> <br /> Horror as it should be done. First-class movie-up. It's not perfect, but it's worth seeing. I give it a 7.
