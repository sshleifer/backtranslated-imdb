I was looking forward to the release of this DVD (and it has been followed for some time (Female Prisoner Scorpion: # 701's Grudge Song).) I really enjoyed the first two movies of this series, after watching this movie, I should say that this is probably my favorite of the three. <br /> <br /> All three of these movies were directed by Shunya Ito, which, however, is good with them, although they all have the same main character (played great by Meiko Kaji), they are all very different from the others. <br /> <br /> The first movie (Female Prisoner # 701: Scorpio) is more or less a typical Women's Prison movie, but the character of Scorpion is a lot interesting - very reminiscent of the anti-heroes of many spaghetti westerns, and the director often used very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material. <br /> <br /> The second film (Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41) is a true tour-de-force, not so much a WIP movie, because most of the film has Scorpion and six other escaped prisoners on the lamb. <br /> <br /> This movie (Female Prisoner Scorpio: Beast Stable) is the third in the series and the last one directed by Shunya Ito. This one plays so much more of a crime drama. Again, our heroine is going. But this time she managed to maintain a certain degree of normality in her life (relatively speaking anyway). She gets a job, she finds a place to stay, she makes a friend on the outside. But of course everything has to be unraveled. FPS: Beast Stable has a more straightforward story that is told at a more peaceful pace than its predecessors. But I found it to be from start to finish. And don't worry: there is still much hardship to go around in this movie! But I think these movies exceed most exploitation sites because the more disturbing elements are played in a straight line, rather than just using the shock value in your face. Yes, there were definitely moments in this movie where I got power. But I didn't feel that they detracted from the value of the story (well, maybe a time or two). One thing I really enjoyed about these movies is the continued build-up of Scorpion's mythos. With this entry, character development is much more extensive than in the previous two. We see that she is much more than just a stingy badass! <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier in this review, a fourth film followed. It also contains Meiko Kaji as Scorpio, but had another director. Without giving away anything, I would like to mention that FPS: Beast Stable ends in such a way that a sequel is completely unnecessary. The fourth movie is still pretty good, but it seems to be an unnecessary footnote for a trilogy thinking. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in out-of-the-ordinary movies. FPS: Beast Stable can be enjoyed as a standalone piece (like the first two movies), but I also recommend watching the others first if you haven't.
