I just praise this movie. From the beginning to the end, Stephen Sondheim's brilliance captured. I'm not a big fan of music. Most of them are very exaggerated. However, this one has changed my mind. I am an actor myself and have played Actuel Sweeney and I know how difficult this role is. George Hearn has made a beautiful, masterful and well-rounded show worthy of the highest awards we can give him. (He won an Emmy and that is something.) Everything he does turns him into gold. He is so good, it will make your mind why he is not in oscars. Lansbury is also very good and very funny. Sara Woods is creepy and wonderful like the Beggar Woman. All in all a good video. Pick it up if you can.
