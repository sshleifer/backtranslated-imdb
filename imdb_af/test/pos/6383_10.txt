This movie has shaken !!!! saw it on a screen this week. Just a strange story, where James Franco plays this rogue who marries Sienna Miller, just to get out of the country and they go to the Niagara Falls for their honeymoon. Do not want to give it away, cuz the movie has not yet been released, but she is completely cool and you will never expect the things that happen. I thought I would hate it, but it is a romance, but it is also a twist and a lot of things I love. The play is really good and Sienna Miller is completely smokin 'and plays this really sweet girl. I think she should do more roles like this. James plays for a while, but you like to end up with him and the end of the movie is really good. David Carradine plays a cowboy and he is good. I gave this movie a 10 because I came out of the movie that really likes it and wants to see it again what I didn't expect and my girlfriend really liked it and cried. good date flick
