What a great role for this movie. The timing was excellent and there were so many smart lines - a few times I laughed for minutes after being delivered. I found Manna from Heaven to have some surprising moments and while there were things I thought would happen, the way they came together was nothing but predictable. This movie is about hope and law of justice. I was inspired by the scene to do the right thing. Bravo to the Five Sisters.
