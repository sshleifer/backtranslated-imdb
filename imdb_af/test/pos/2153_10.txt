See this movie at the Mod & Rockers festival in August. I was so inspired and touched. Harry has a wonderful life and one of the best and clear voices ever recorded. For those of you who don't know Harry Nilsson, do some research and you will see that Harry has somehow come to your life - maybe it was his 70's special "The Point" or "Everybody's Talk" by Midnight Cowboy. For me it started with "people let me tell you to my best friend" - the theme song of "The Courtship of Eddie's Father." Looking at this movie, you can really feel the love and admiration of Harry's true friends and peers. Don't throw a tear for Harry - he had a ball ... <br /> <br /> Brett
