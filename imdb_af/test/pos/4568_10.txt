I love this movie .... one of my all-time favorites !!! It was the first big screen movie my mom took when I was 9. I recommend it to every African American. This story is about love, trust, challenges and the everyday life of a black family. All the actors worked well together. I wish it was on video, but from now on it's not available what I know. I caught it on television a few years ago and recorded it, so when I got the urge to see it ... I got it! The soundtrack is also fantastic! A must-see!
