I only saw it when I was a teenager in my last year of Junior High. I was cut! I loved the special effects, the fantastic places and the trial aspect and the flashback method to tell the story. <br /> <br /> Several years later, I read the book and while it was interesting and I could definitely see what Swift was. I'm trying to say, though not as perfect as the social commentary book, as " a story is the movie better. It is more sensible to have a long adventure than to return Gulliver to every trip and make a profit by selling the little Lilliput sheep or whatever. <br /> <br /> It's much more arrest than everyone thinks he's crazy and the sheep anyway make a cameo. As a lace note, when I saw Laputa, I was amazed. It looks very much like the Kingdom of Zeal from the Chrono Trigger video game (1995) which made me even more like this mini-series. <br /> <br /> I saw it about 4 years ago and realized that I just enjoyed it so much. In fact, of high quality and starting with an excellent series of Sweeps mini series for NBC that followed it with the solid Merlin and interesting Alice in Wonderland.
