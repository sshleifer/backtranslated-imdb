It is a typical Sandra Bullock movie in which she plays a mouse (but profane) woman who is in trouble but is a way to survive and be the hero. Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> There are many holes in this story. Things just don't add up, and some of the tensions are a bit more fun. But - that tension is very good. There is a lot of tension in this story that goes through paranoia. The story starts slowly but soon kicks in and remains so, making it a movie for the viewer. That's why I give it a pretty good rating - the movie gets you involved. Bullock is more cute than annoying, which she usually is to me, so it's my highest rated movie with her in it.
