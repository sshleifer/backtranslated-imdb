This movie is good with some of the best songs that Bon Jovi and Kissie have preformed. The film is about a man named Chris (Mark Wahlberg). Who is the biggest fan of a band called Steel Dragon. And then he gets the gig for lead singer, his world changes upside down. With the big acting of Jennifer Aniston, this movie is a must for rock lovers! <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
