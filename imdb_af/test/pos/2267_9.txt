2005 was one of the best movies for movies. We had so many wonderful movies, such as Batman Begins, Sin City, Corpse Bride, a History of Violence ..... We also had Brokeback Mountain, King Kong. But if this year was the only big movie that came out, everything was relieved, then we wouldn't miss this year. The first film as a director of the talented Liev Schreiber is a beautiful, heart-warming, touch drama that also brings one of Elia Wood's best roles. He's perfect like Jonathan, a foreign man who is head of Ukraine to find the wife who saved his grandfather in World War II. Liev Schreiber, who also writes the film, performs a masterpiece, with unforgettable scenes and (many) funny quotes. This is a true mix of Comedy with Drama, which contains a movie that will be responded to from now on. A serious Oscar contender, Everything is Illuminated is a powerful, original, and, why not, enlightened movie. But there is one thing to remember while entering the movie: leaving behind normally. It's special .------ 9/10
