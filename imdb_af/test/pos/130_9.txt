The thing that makes "Fire" even more appealing to look beyond its magical artworks is the touch of feminism and rebellion. In my mind, the character of Shabana Azmi is a symbol of Indian female protest against Indian society. The name of the movie and the scene when Radha runs through flames in her kitchen, is symbiosis of Hindu Mythology's Lord Rama's wife, Sita, who runs through the fire to prove her flawlessness, as in the same story the film appears. The film can be a great inspiration to women, especially those in the subcontinent, seeking their freedoms and gaining control over their lives.
