I have never seen any of The League's work last year - although when I jumped on the channel one night, I caught the end of one of the series three episodes. But last winter I fell in love with the show and its dark, eccentric and sometimes straight sinister characters. When I learned that they made a movie in which the show's sweet creators met their own characters, I couldn't order the DVD fast enough and I tore it to my postman's hands when he delivered it. I was so excited to see what the Gents did and how they did it. <br /> <br /> And that was great! From the very beginning where Jeremy (Michael Sheen) is affected by Edward, Tubbs and Daddy terror (Dyson, why didn't you play yourself? He's perfectly capable of viewing the infamous Highgate House of Horrors!), Bernice berat one more from her herd, to Geoff, Herr Lipp and Hilary to discover that they are characters, which is a wonderful scene. The screens introduced in 1690 are very enjoyable, with the Gents turning their hands to even more characters and a new plan. David Warner's turn as Doctor Pea is fantastic, slightly camp and very funny. <br /> <br /> The League has always been brilliant to blend humor with sadness and emotion - and the highlight of this movie where Mr. Lipp struggles with The notion that he and the other vague residents are just fictional people who will never be able to change who they are or their purpose - and to see how it breaks down is really sad and beautiful to look at at the same time and It really shows the talent of the Gents - something they are terribly overlooked for. <br /> <br /> And then you have that smart slender end - where you're wondering - playing Joby Talbot's beautiful theme music. And you know you enjoyed a very clever and funny movie.
