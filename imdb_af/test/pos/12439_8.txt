The play is cleverly built - starting with the porter, Rainbow - and let the audience unfold the background through his eyes. The film follows the play with great faith, and certainly works on the simple assumption that it cannot be improved. Now throw in an army of great character characters and the result is a sounding triumph. A particular must-see.
