It's an excellent, exciting, murder mystery movie. Not only was the plot full of excitement and intrigue, but you get a few hours of beautiful Ryan Gosling who doesn't love it! Sandra Bullock is also good in this movie. I've always been a fan of her, (I just wish she didn't decide to be in the Lake House, it was terrible, but it's another story altogether). Of course, since there are thousands of other murder / horror movies out there, there are similarities between them, it doesn't have to bother this movie, as it has at least some similarities to all that has been made. Anyway, it's a good movie for those of you who actually enjoy scary movies, it's a bit dark and twisted, but overall a good movie !!!
