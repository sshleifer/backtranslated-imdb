I loved this movie and I never knew it was so old, it came the day a year I was born and now I'm 19 now, I still love this movie, especially the songs like "My Mother "and" Rock N Roll Boys and Girls "and I remember as a child I believe I was 5 my sister was 6 and my cousin (son) was 6 and we pretended to be the characters in the movie. I was Eloner and Janette and my sister was Britany and my cousin was Alvin Simon and Theodore it was good times and I miss it and with this movie reminds me of the good times since my cousin is old for these things and so am i and I say we will not forget the chipmunk and the chipmunk movie I still remember the songs and words from the heart, although I have not seen this movie for 12 years, but now start to love it again. ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS AND CHIPETTES <3 <3 <3 <3
