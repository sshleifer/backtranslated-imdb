A group of cats are looking for their home after being kidnapped by a greedy butler. <br /> <br /> The Aristocats are considered one of Walt Disney's best 2D animations with its beautiful writing and cool characters, but that doesn't mean 'I have quite the magic created by Snow White or the Jungle Book. <br /> <br /> The slow opening will have younger viewers increasing their eyebrows, but once the cats are established in the story, fun and entertainment begins. /> <br /> The young cats are most delighted with a beautiful young sad rivalry, the special kind of bond that any brother or sister of any age can associate. <br /> <br /> Not the funniest Disney picture there, but there are some great comic moments, especially with the Cats and the Dogs. The representation of the gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusing. <br /> <br /> The story, after the boring start, is consistently entertaining and exactly what a family movie should be. There are hardly any dilapidated and not dull moments. The journey to find the house is interesting and you get a sense of exploration, not to mention two very strange British swans. <br /> <br /> With Disney you always get a strong meaningful message. With the Jungle Book, this is where you belong, with Beauty and the Beast exploring the importance of inner beauty. However, with this 1970's picture it seems that something is missing. The film has the importance and relevance of the house, but is not enough cement; it seems very fetching and irrelevant. <br /> <br /> My sister and I got it very strange to see it, as some of the central characters were voiced by the Jungle Book cast. <br /> <br /> Despite the bad start and the confusion of his preaching message, this is a consistently fun family movie with good music score and some cool crazy characters that viewers of any age can relate to. love.
