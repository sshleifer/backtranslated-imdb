One of the things I love about PT Anderson is that he has the talent to take talent that pushes most people to the side or pushes them to the side and makes them stars. Case in point, an excited ... Burt Reynolds delivers a good performance in this movie. And if Adam Sander can be proved, it's not enough. Here comes Mark Whalburg. As you've never seen. <br /> <br /> I think many people succeed in "Boogie Nights" because they are anti-porn, or just hate the adult industry and can't think of the aspect of this movie. But underneath it is a wonderful story about characters who lose everything and struggle to regain themselves. There's a beautiful movie ... and it's too bad enough people see it.
