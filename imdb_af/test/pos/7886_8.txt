I remember so many things to see this movie back at its original theater release - the post Woodstock needle of peace and love, along with the pre-Watergate tension of fear and paranoia. It's hard to believe it's thirty-seven years later, and I can still remember the minds of my head while watching the movie with my best friend. As to marvel at Peter Boyle's characterization of the ultimate redhead, you have to make sure he remains the rest of his career (Oh, how wrong!), And how the counter-culture radiates the sensitivity of most of the country. To this day, my partner and I still use Joe Curran's line out of my summary above when faced with a dilemma; odd how a simple line can stay with you for decades. <br /> <br /> Commenting on the movie from others on this board, especially those who say the movie has a dated quality and how the top of the characters was, is curious. Nevertheless, if you were around during that time, the picture gives a pretty accurate portrayal of the polar opponents that existed at the time, pretty much side by side, as the events in the story reveal. If you really want dating, when was the last time you heard the words Macy's and Gimbel in the same sentence, or a line like Joe's? Come on, come with the Pepsi generation. For a historical perspective, you have the great Nixon poster immersing in one of the background screens: "Would you buy a used car from this man?" With less complexities like this, director John Avildsen takes many of the subtle but still hints of how life was four decades ago. <br /> <br /> Today's show was just the second time I saw the movie, and I have to admit that I don't remember Susan Sarandon in one of the lead roles, but again, it was her very first photo . The scenes of nudity and free love were something very new and brave at the time, shocking because filmmakers are beginning to experiment with their ability to print the envelope of propriety and convention. "Joe" took a big leap in this respect, especially as it was a "mainstream" picture. <br /> <br /> Over time, the thing that impressed me most about Peter Boyle was how he won Joe Curran's stereotype to appear or die in some of my favorite pieces of work. I mean, how do you go from "Joe" to the hilarious version of "Puttin" on the Ritz in "Young Frankenstein"? And my absolute favorite episode of 'X-Files' has Boyle as Clyde Bruckman, in both a soft and tragic, funny and serious performance that changes the tables on Scully and Mulder more than once. And as a career, Frank Barone must be one of the funniest characters in the history of television. Even repeated episodes in syndication are funny like him - when the older Baroness comes loose with one of his observations. He is one actor who already misses this viewer.
