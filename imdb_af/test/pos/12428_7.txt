Adam (Eric Jungmann), while driving on a highway to the wedding of his beloved Betty-Ann, is surprised by his former companion Harley (Justin Urich) on the back seat of his car. Adam broke with the inconvenient and moron of Harley because of Betty-Ann. Along their way, Harley makes fun of a few rednecks in a bar and later their car is driven by a giant monster truck. After a few incidents, they gave a lift to the Sarah Sarah (Aimee Brooks) and earlier the trio of terror was hit by a scary monster driving the monster truck. <br /> <br /> Despite having one of the most annoying characters, I've ever seen in a horror movie, the annoying Harley, "Monster Man" is a surprisingly good garbage horror comedy. The story is a collection of cliches that start like 'Joy Ride' or 'Duel'; then it becomes one of the countless rip-offs of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"; There is a surprising twist, ending with a hook for a successor. There are hilarious scenes, Aimee Brooks is very sexy and this movie really does. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Monster Man"
