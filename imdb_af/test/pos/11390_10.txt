A small town kid working in a big city becomes a big star and then spirals out of control. It shows you the rise of fame and then falls from fame and back to a little rise. Great role players and a great director = a great, good movie called Boogie Nights. <br /> <br /> P.T Anderson. A wonderful director who made Boogie Nights great. From the moment the movie starts to the moment it ends, you can feel how beautiful this movie is. Some scenes are breathtaking, literally. A great story, a good movie. Mark Whalberg was fantastic, Philip Seymour Hoffman was wonderful as he was in everything. Thomas Jane was also beautiful and although he only had a small part, he played it perfectly. There is one scene in this movie I can't find, "The Drug Deal Gone Bad Scene", it was wonderful, combined with music and cinematography combined to make it wonderful. I didn't see Boogie Nights and thank you, I did it, it's so well-rounded and I'm now a GREAT fan of PTA (Paul Thomas Anderson). Do everything you need to do and watch this movie. .
