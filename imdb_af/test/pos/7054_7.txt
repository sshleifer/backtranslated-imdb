I mostly liked this movie, but to say if there was someone other than Bill Murray in the lead, it wouldn't have been so good. He brings energy to the role that this film holds in the hands of what it would be different. I especially enjoy the pranks drawn on one advisor and there are other humorous things in this movie like the hot dog eating game. This movie will also be the stage for summer camp films with the end of the competition. Almost every camp movie has either this or the restless or restless child chart, or a combination of both. This series will also take a rather strange shift in tone, as these two and one are both family-friendly movies, while part three and four are more mature oriented, more like the old teen sex sex comedies of the time. It was similar to the opposite of the Police Academy movies that went to PG-movies from R to PG-13. This series goes from the opposite to R. However, this first and only good one is worth a few chuckles largely due to Bill Murray.
