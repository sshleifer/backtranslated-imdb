I found it charming! No one but Kiarostami can do so little, and yet, get so much. You might think I'm strange, but I was so charming that I couldn't talk to the movie. While I make lots of comment during other movies. The short movie he made for Lumiere et Companie, the one with the eggs, that one is unbeatable in my heart, but it is also wonderful. I liked it better than Ten. Kiarostami is perhaps the best director in my opinion because he can see things! He doesn't have to use many things brought from home to illustrate his images, he just takes a camera. Not many can do it. Maybe I don't know much about movies, but I don't mind complicating things, all that anyone has to do is touch my soul. Kiarostami do.
