I rented this jewel several times! It's a small but somehow vast masterpiece that takes the viewer of Manhattan glitz to the beauty of the Greek islands. John Cassavetes on the screen marriage with his real wife Gena Rowlands is on the rocks. He finds meaning in a fling with footloose Susan Sarandon, who he finds in Greece, while her daughter, in her earliest role-playing role by the adolescent Molly Ringwald, falls to the Greek ship's son who drives her mother on a yacht. neighboring waters. Meanwhile, the incredibly talented Raul Julia plays a goatherd in his cave with his Sony Trinitron. He has the "hots" for Molly Ringwald's character until he is confronted by John Cassavetes. Everyone gets together in the end in a classic closing scene where everything is reconciled. Raul Julia, the goatherd, is seen as dancing with his goat. This movie is full of mysticism, beauty, young and old love, humor, sex and more. See it!
