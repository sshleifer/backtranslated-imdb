A delight from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> If you don't like the Muppets, be sorry for you. This wonderful movie doesn't just fit the Muppets popularity - it's a well-developed and well-written film in its own right. It has good songs, and it has that thread of capricious melancholy that was always present in Jim Henson's creations and which is most personal in the character of Kermit the Frog. I have always responded to it as a child and this makes the Muppets enjoyable to me as an adult when other material aimed at children makes me crazy. <br /> <br /> A large number of big names appearing in cameos make this movie feel like a kiddie-sized version of "Around the World in 80 Days," except it's about 80 times better. <br /> <br /> Degree: A
