I can't say that I embrace it as a Romantic Comedy, because I got little funny about it. I found that it was engaging, entertaining, heart-warming and terminally sweet, and while there were exciting moments, I found them more bittersweet than mere comic. <br /> <br /> I liked this one. Barrymore has grown so much as an actress, and it's always great to catch her on the big screen, but it also translates well to the small screen. In fact, over the following views, I like this one more and more. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the Romantic Comedy, you may be a bit shattered by a lack of comic effect with this one, but if you're in the romance, it's definitely here to find. <br /> <br /> It's a 7.8 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
