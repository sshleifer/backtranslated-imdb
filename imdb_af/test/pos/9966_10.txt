Seriously, where is Al Pacino's Oscar nomination for this one? Is it that we take it for granted at this stage in his career? Pacino here is extraordinary. He gives a complex, heartbreaking performance as Shylock, the Jewish money lender. The movie as a whole was pretty big, with beautiful shots from Venice to watch and a pitch-perfect score to listen to. Other actors also do a good job, but the right reason to see it is Pacino. I've seen all the nominated Oscar appearances of 2004, and I have to say that Pacino has been killed. Blame it on anti-Semitism related to the play, the lack of campaigns at the studio, the late release with no major Don't press, or probably all of the above. In my mind, the best performances of the year include Jamie Foxx in Ray, Don Cheadle in Hotel Rwanda, and Al Pacino in the Venice dealer.
