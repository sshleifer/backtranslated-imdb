The reason I think this movie is fantastic is that it has so much emotion. From the writing and the fantastic play you can tell that there is a history behind all the feelings there is. You understand why the characters take certain actions and why they don't make others. You can all feel at once with sympathy and joy and love and sadness. You see mankind at its best AND at its worst. You can relate to the characters because, although you may never have been in their exact situations, before you see qualities and apostasy in them you see in yourself. To a certain extent, this movie is kind of like you, but in the end it explains itself and you feel a certain peace and understanding, not only in you, but also for the characters. I will say that I have never cried so much in my life, nor received much from anything. I recommend watching this movie and it makes sense to the heart. That there is only one real thing and that is ... love.
