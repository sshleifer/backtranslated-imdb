The word Ghilli actually means a small sharp wood game instrument used in a game called ghilli-danda (a precursor to Cricket) in India. The use of the word as a nickname for the main character is stylish, as it is a sharp, fast-paced person who can hurt badly when rubbed the wrong way. <br /> <br /> Ghilli is one of the best movies for Vijay and in it is unmatched in its pace and action. The movie never flashes for a moment and always keeps you in action. The film is in Madurai and Chennai and its story core is simple. A wealthy landlord tries to covet a beautiful girl in his village, and prevents his indisputable power and authority from seeking a justice. The hero tries to save her, and the majority of this movie shows the week in which all this action takes place. <br /> <br /> A very exciting movie and although the story is nothing new, the director and the actors receive praise for the full action.
