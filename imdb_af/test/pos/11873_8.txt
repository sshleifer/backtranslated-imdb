I must admit, I like this movie, and don't find it all misogynist. It can be subtitled, three ways to look at LiV Tyler. Three men are obsessed with the same woman and tell their stories to many different characters. One man (John Goodman) tells his story to a priest (the very funny Richard Jenkins). For Goodmans charcter, the Liv Tyler character is an idealized saint, the second coming of his beloved wife, Theresa. For the character of Paul Riesers (who tells the story of a shrink (a fine, understated performance by the great Reba Mcintire), the Liv Tyler character is simply the object of (kinky) sexual fantasy. rather dull charcter, tells his side of the story to a messy hit, played by Micheal Douglas, all three of this obsession tells at once, and everyone is amusing.The film ends in a bitterly funny climax I won't throw away.
