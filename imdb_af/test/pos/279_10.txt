In moments of despair, it was willing to do what it took to win. I loved how the Maple Leaves were useless as a metaphorical basis for Bobby and Tessa. The acting was accurate, far superior to the movie industry's intake. <br /> <br /> Great editing! At the end of the short I felt it was a bit incomplete, but so is life and it is life and art in a movie masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Excuse me while rinsing the cheese wash, but I think it is acceptable at certain times. <br /> <br /> Two scenes I have to point out are: The bath and the couch. <br /> <br /> The couch for Tessa was a decisive moment and 360 of the human condition. By short I saw her as a brute, but now we see her true reality. Her thoughts spoke to her heart. Should I say more about the bathing place.
