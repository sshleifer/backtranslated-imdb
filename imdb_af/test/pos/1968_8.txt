Allegra Geller's (Jennifer Jason Leigh's) latest game - "eXistenZ" draws not only the volunteers to try the game, but one who almost kills her (and her game as well). Ever since she was forced to stay out of sight, Allegra is stuck with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a marketing expert ("PR nerd") to be her bodyguard, though he has only a rifle made of meat and bone bullets were made. is teeth. Director David Cronenberg does use a few pieces of his previous films ("Videodrome", "Scanners", "The Fly", etc.) and put it in good parts of the story with good timing. Right and Leigh is good here and so there is also a supporting role (Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccelston, and so on). Dafoe is anything but devilish like Gas, a fraudulent car mechanic. One of the best scenes of the movie is to eat Ted (fish and frogs) and build a gun and acknowledge Allegra: "I can't help myself." "eXistenZ" manages to show that he (Cronenberg) is busy with his old tricks and it still works like a charm.
