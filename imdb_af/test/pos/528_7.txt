As a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London, I was very excited to see this movie on the Vancouver International Film Festival list. This movie has great shots, an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a 'not so well-known' London. <br /> <br /> The movie is kept entirely in 'dark' colors, which I don't personally like. much. Furthermore, the narrative was a bit too British and the commentary was a bit flat. Other than that, there are some good comments by London and excellent shots. FINISTERRE does not glorify London by showing all the great attractions of the city, but rather giving a deep insight into what London really is. From the east to the vibrant center with its music scene as well as the 'special little retreats' for Londoners. <br /> <br /> All in all: <br /> <br /> + Great Soundtrack + Beautiful shots + good insights <br /> <br /> -Narration -Tirling to watch at times -The dark picture <br /> <br /> Worth watching! I give it a 7/10
