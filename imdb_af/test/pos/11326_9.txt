I feel the Niiiiiight Heat! I HAVE YOUR HEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAARTAFF! Something is not right! "Theme song written by BJ Cook of Skylark-David Foster's old band and wife. She also wrote the memorable theme of CBC's" Airwaves. OH Night Heat! What a program! Well written, well-acted and completely classic Crime solvers and a good team and a bit of humor at the end, I think it's really what detectives do / have. Giambone was a real favorite! At a Canadian point, I taught EVERY Canadian actor name and style from gas stains done at Night Heat, all passed through the Night Heat set and like Law & Order, it was story-driven so you could just see and enjoy without much character melodrama.
