Get the tagline on the box, "100 TRAPPED PASSENGERS ... 3,000 VENOMOUS VIPERS!" You should almost admire that degree of "no chance in hell that we ever put on this promise". I can admire the Asylum's hucksterism more, if they have made movies that are good, or at least worthwhile. Haha, and that's what I like about theses movies. They are rubbish. You put them in a toilet and then you rinse. It's worth the price if you're a fan of cheese films. It can be a cult classic among many fans. The gore screens are effective, there's not much I can say, it's a Z-movie parody of the new movie with Samuel L. Jackson. Hell, it could be better, so who knows!
