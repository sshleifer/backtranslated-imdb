Being Belgian, I take an interest in the history of the Congo. It has been our only colony for many years (Rwanda was a Belgian protectorate, but not a colony) and it is part of our country's history. Currently, it seems very popular to say that everything the Belgians did in Congo was wrong, especially in the 19th century. I'm not saying bad things didn't happen. Of course they did, but then it wasn't abnormal. Do you really think the French or the British were so much better in their colonies? No, they weren't. It was "normal" then for our King Leopold II to use the Congo as a means of obtaining personal wealth. It was his private property (it didn't belong to the state then) and he tried to make the most of it. Of course, horrible things like hands that are cut off are happening and yes to today's standards that are inadmissible, but in those days it was common practice. And it must be said, it has not all happened in the last decades. I know several people who have worked for many years in Congo before declaring Congolese independence. It is true that they had several black servants, but they are very nice people and I really can't think they treated them badly. As far as I know, they always treated them with great respect (I do not say, however, that all Belgians did). In fact, if they weren't so old (almost all about 80 years old), they would like to return to Congo. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this movie is that it has a historically accurate vision of what happened during the last years of the Belgian government and the first years of Congolese independence. The story is not as black and white (maybe not the best words in this context, but how different to explain what I mean) as I feared it. It doesn't say all the Belgians did, and all Congolese did well. It shows perfectly how Congolese, in their haste to become independent from the Belgians, did not hope to accept aid from the Russians as well as the Americans. They both had more attention to the raw materials such as copper, diamonds, bauxite, rubber, ... and get the Congolese in their political 'camp' and were not all interested in their independence. It not only gives a good idea how Lumumba has become more powerful, but also how Mobutu played a dual role. It shows the Belgian response to some of our compatriots who have been violated, threatened and even murdered. (My dad was one of the paratroopers sent to Congo to save the Belgians). It gives a good idea of ​​the political problems that Lumumba experienced when the province of Katanga did not want to be part of the Congolese Republic, the role of the Belgians in the murder of Lumumba. It's all in the movie. <br /> <br /> The story looks very accurate and the characters really look like real. This movie could give a very good idea of ​​what life in the Congo was in the late fifties and early sixties and should be seen by anyone interested in the country's history. But it must also be in the history classes, especially in Belgium, because it is part of our history that must never be forgotten. I give it a 7.5 / 10, maybe even an 8/10.
