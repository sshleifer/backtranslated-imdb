The above summary is not really meant to be a leak to this movie, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar ("The Saint") meets a distressed lady and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who is estimated to accept a bribe. Along the way he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as "Pearly" Gates) and, during his unraveling of this not very compelling mystery (neither of them is really), Templar is extremely erudite and just totally cool! George Sanders is once again the completely sophisticated British yolk and again he is making an excellent B-detective series film. Nothing special, but a familiar and bitter product that will surely please fans of the genre.
