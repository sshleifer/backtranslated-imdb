Damien O'Donnell has a good record and in this film he deals with a very delicate subject with sensitivity, but he doesn't manage the film in schmalz. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie, it's funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to see it now- FANTASTIC! <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent, and Dublin plays a leading role. This movie will change the way you look at people with disabilities, and also give you a very entertaining night out in the theater. I can't wait until it comes to DVD.
