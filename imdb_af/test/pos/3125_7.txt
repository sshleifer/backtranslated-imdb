This film deals with two horse dealers who agree to guide a small group of Mormons across the desert. Along the way, they meet a murderous family of thugs who threaten the peaceful people and endanger their pilgrimage. <br /> <br /> WAGON MASTER is what I would call a "small" John Ford movie, as it did of course not have the budget or scope of some of its other Westerners. In particular, this movie lacks the big name stars like John Wayne, but leaves some of the usual supporting characters in the middle stage. Along Ford Characters, Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr. and Ward Bond, have been promoted to major roles. Perhaps the one who came as the "lead" is probably Johnson - although the other two have almost as much screen. time and focus. It's not a bad thing, because the movie works well without the big star - and it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Not to say I loved the movie. It was very good, but definitely not perfect. In particular, as far as the music goes, you will probably either love it or hate it. I sometimes found the Sun of the Pioneer music a little schmaltzy. It had a nice mood, but sometimes dominated the screens. I think a little would have worked much better. Plus, with their incessant singing in the background, I expected Roy Rogers to come out at any moment. Another small problem is that the plot was incredibly simple, and the end was quite a preliminary conclusion. <br /> <br /> But I'm happy to say there's a "though," although it's rather formal and sentimental, the movie still worked well. This was mainly due to John Ford's good, as usual, direction as well as Ben Johnson's exceptional performance. He could provide an excellent anchor for the film. Another plus for me is that I saw BRIGHAM YOUNG, another film about Mormon migration, the same week. While BRIGHAM YOUNG was a little stupid and exaggerated in his depictions, the Mormons were less "perfect" and more like real people - with foibles and personalities. Oh, and speaking of BRIGHAM YOUNG, Jane Darwell seems to have been the 'go to' girl for Mormon-themed movies in this period, as she was an important supporting character in both films. Since she died in BRIGHAM YOUNG and it was about 20 years before WAGON MASTER, it's a bit stunt! <br /> <br /> Also, if you want to get a look at the famous Jim Thorpe, he is in a small role as he plays the invading Indian dance next to Jane Darwell around the campfire.
