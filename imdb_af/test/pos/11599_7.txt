I watched this movie at the Locarno Film Festival in Italian-speaking part of Switzerland. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 7/10 because of its nice moments. <br /> <br /> * spoilers forward. <br /> <br /> It has some very nice cinematic moments in it, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> Although my general feeling is too long (over 2 hours and 40 minutes), it contains too many dialogues. And hardly any dance at all. <br /> <br /> Obviously, a Bollywood movie like Lagaan or Devdas is a very different film compared to Chokher Bali.
