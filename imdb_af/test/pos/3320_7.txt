Claire Booth Luce's "The Women" shows relationships with men through a woman's point of view in a play (and 1939's Joan Crawford movie: a character Amanda Farrow could have been 20 years earlier), which are no male characters. Here we see the male characters and what a lot of them are. They use women like toys and throw them away, leaving the women to suffer. Ironically, the women in "The Women", perhaps because they are all we see, are shown in a less favorable light, alternately silly and twilight, with the only "beautiful" (Norma Shearer) growing "claws" through the end. In "The Best of All" we see the men for the pillows they are while the women are largely innocent and vulnerable. <br /> <br /> It's a movie about women jumping out of things. Diane Baker jumps out of a car (perhaps the most absurd scene in cinema history, which is not in the book). Suzy Parker falls from a fire brigade. The women in the movie jump into the workplace and seek success and love at the same time. Women will jump in the future and leave this type of soap behind in the next decade. But they will come back in the 80s and 90s through the novels of people like Sidney Sheldon and Judith Krantz (though their trashier works are not as good as they are). <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is what it looks like. I love the shiny cinemascope movies of the 50's and 60's. They look so much better than the pixel-challenged home movies we've made since, especially in the letterbox version we see on TV, and the DVD, with the picture so clear that you can enter it. The look of the look of young beauty in it is also memorable. This movie probably has more beautiful women in it than any other. It has a supermodel (Suzy Parker), a beauty queen, (Myrna Hansen, who wasn't American in 1954, like Rona Jaffe in the DVD commentary, but rather Miss USA 1953, by IMDb: but so) and " a Playboy playmate, (June Blair, from January 1957). My voice goes to Suzy, one of the astonishing beauty of all time. Her actions here are not as terrible as people pretend: they respond just like people at the time to the appearance of a supermodel (the first really), trying to act. No one cares how well she did. Her role, that of a seemingly worldly woman who seems to be the most vulnerable, is the most complex in the bunch and she does well. <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable thing about the movie is now the age of the female lead then. Hope Lange was 27 when they filmed it in the spring of 1959. Diane Baker was 20. Suzy Parker was 26. Hope, which looked like Grace Kelly's heir, never really made it big and closed on Mrs Muir on television and, by IMDb, got into a house with a crate for coffee tables ran because she spent her money on causes she believed before dying at the age of 72 in 2003. This film had to be a very distant and irrelevant reminder to her. . Baker, always a welcome sight in the 60's TV (especially for Richard Kimble), and still active as an actress and acting coach, has just become 67. Parker has found the best of everything "with Bradford Dillman for 40 years before he was 70. The same year, Lange did. But here they are, young, beautiful and ambitious for success and love, just like their characters.
