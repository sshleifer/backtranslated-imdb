My husband and I were watching last night ... It was wonderful .... For once he was wrong to guess the exciting end of time. It was moving very fast and the acting was wonderful. In any case, I worshiped Tom Wilkinson. He never made such a bad movie. The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head ... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque landscape is wonderful. We've just watched all the Prime Suspect series and I'm convinced that the British have a way to capture the audience. There is no doubt that I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to receive a couple of hours of thorough entertainment.
