Not to repeat what everyone else noticed, I'll just say: <br /> <br /> Almost everyone says they loved Curly best ... but I'll put BRIDELESS GROOM on any of the other Stooges shorts. <br /> <br /> I think it's the most hilarious from start to finish, as well as the most re-viewable. <br /> <br /> The off-key singing student ... Christine McIntire's "Nephew Basil" routine, and of course Emil Sitka's JP are highlights, but only for the Stooges' impeccable timing and also the great writing! <br /> <br /> Nuff said.
