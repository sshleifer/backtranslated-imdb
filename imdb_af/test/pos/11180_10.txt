The curse of Monkey Island is a brilliant video game and it is a stroke of genius of video game designers at lucasarts to create this sequel. All the characters are brilliant, the voting surplus for the characters was realistic and funny. Have a lot of trouble in this game and it deserves the 10 I gave in the vote, keep up the good work lucasarts!
