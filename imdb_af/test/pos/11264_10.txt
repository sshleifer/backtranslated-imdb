Wow, don't see this idea, it's going to be a relaxing circus evening! It keeps you completely at the edge of your seat. Circus has never been more colorful, more exciting and more breathtaking! The whole concept is really great. You are admitted to the world of Cirque Du Soleil and left with a thousand thoughts when you leave. There is only one thing to do: get the CD and / or DVD and live it again and again. Become addicted! It is worth the effort! Must be the most beautiful thing on earth and one of Cirque Du Soleil's best programs.
