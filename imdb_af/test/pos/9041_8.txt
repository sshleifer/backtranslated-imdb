No movie can ever do Faulkner's English language command. but they did a good job here. Lucas Beauchamp is exactly as I suggested to him in the book, just like Chick. What the movie couldn't really do was how Beauchamp was not from the Negro people either, because he was as stubborn. Not that it is a bad thing, but from me take the book that was his attitude to the world (yet I felt it was the white society's racism that started it and poured it into the Negro society until it became his attitude towards everyone. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is that you will see Yoknapatawpha County (actually Oxford, Mississippi) exactly as Faulkner wrote about it (the film was made when Faulkner was alive and writing.). It doesn't look very different today. Because of this alone, the movie is worth watching as it is filmed in Faulkner's backyard. A real must see for Faulkner fans.
