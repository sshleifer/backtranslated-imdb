This is the best direct-to-DVD effort I have ever seen from Van Damme. Van Damme plays a border patrol broker who pours out to stop heroin traffickers from going to the United States. The action in this movie is wonderful and the fighting scenes are at Van Damme's best. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For further evidence, see "Undisputed 2". Adkins is so good that I had previously watched the "The Shepherd", thought that Van Damme couldn't seem to be credible enough to beat him on the screen. Van Damme keeps his own though and although he is not quite as athletic as Adkins, he can still kick with the best of them. All the fighting scenes in this movie are very well done and the gunfights are above average for this type of movie. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped. I think Van Damme's character's motives had to be presented earlier in the movie, especially with regard to why he was carrying a rabbit. The reason he does this is very cool, but you don't even get to the end. There are a few other things that are never really explained, but it is a Van Damme movie, so you know where the priority is to make this kind of movie and it's not character development. Overall, it's a solid action movie I recommend. So run for the Dams border!
