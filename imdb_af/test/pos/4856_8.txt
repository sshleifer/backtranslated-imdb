Others' main criticism of this film - namely that Macy suddenly looks Jewish when he comes to his glasses - is misplaced. The glasses are just the bit of change needed to convince others that he is a Jew. The scene in which he told his boss (paraphrase) "but you know what my background is," with another conversation with his mother, suggests that he had to fight the same assumption in the past. The glasses just make him seem just enough to confirm his neighbors and co-workers' existing suspicions. Then there is his new wife's big nose and taste for hard clothes, meaning COURSE she is Jewish. The whole point of the movie is how the little stereotypical nothings become the whole basis for judging others. <br /> <br /> If he has a lisp he must be gay. If he has long hair, he smokes dope. If he is Hispanic, he has a knife ... and if he has black glasses and he is slightly built, he must be Jewish. These statements all sound similar to me. If the conclusion was that people were in Focus, the whole point of the story would be lost.
