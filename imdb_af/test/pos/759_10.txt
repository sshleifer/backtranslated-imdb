I had to get this movie because it didn't come where I live. I waited patiently and it was worth the wait. I fell in love with this movie. You could see the chemistry between Walters and Grint, as they also worked together on the Harry Potter movies. The woman who plays his transferable, fair mother has really convinced me and how much of a hypocrisy she is, I think she has a good job of playing the role. I just wish we could see the actual sex scene or more of it. LOL, but of course we just have to use our imagination about how it went down. (snickers) I totally thought the movie was worth the wait and if you wanted a good movie to watch. Rent this movie. I have to say that Rupert really did a good job and it's nice to see that he does movies outside of Harry Potter, although I love him much like Ron Weasley. The whole team did a good job and I hope Rupert will still be outside Harry Potter to broaden his skill!
