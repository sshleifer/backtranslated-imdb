I didn't see much movies with Holly Hunter, but seeing her in Broadcast News was a pleasant surprise. She is a stubborn journalist, Jane Craig, who has devoted all her time to TV news show. Her colleague Aaron Altman wore her torch for a long time without saying anything. The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnick. He is the somewhat remote former sportsman who is the new reporter. For Jane, he symbolizes everything she doesn't like about news reporting - to change it, not serious matters. To her surprise, Jane finds herself attracted to Tom. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter does a great performance as the beautiful journalist. But I don't really see what she's so charming about her new colleague, Tom. It is something that prevents us from getting up close and personal with him. Almost impressive is Albert Brooks, who gives her everything in the role of a professional who gives more than 100 percent to his work, but he doesn't get much back. Actually, I thought he was Steve Guttenberg of the Police Academy (1984). He has some funny lines. If it was a Meg Ryan picture, they would call it a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Running in two hours, some scenes could be edited or left out, e.g. Jane and Aaron's journey to Central America. Also, I'm a sucker for happy ends and chose another end than just a reunion between the three of them seven years later.
