Between the ages of 30 and 51, when he died of a brain tumor, Zachary Scott made 70 films. He was introduced to Jean Negulesco's "The Mask of Dimitrios" in 1944, where he played Dimitrios. The following year, in 1945, he made three films, one of them. He is best remembered by cinema actors as the star of Jean Renoir's "The Southerner", one of the 1945 films, where he had a sympathetic role. However, he often played creative characters and in this film he is a socio-pathetic murderer for money. So what's happening here? He lives in a house with three women, so look out! Faye Emerson, who also appeared in Dimitrios, plays the parent of two daughters in the house. She falls in love with Scott and they are secretly engaged. Then her "cute child" younger sister (played effectively by Mona Freeman, who looks at Bonita Granville, both in appearance and behavior) returned from boarding school and revealed in speech with Scott that she inherited a neat sum, so Scott changed his images. on her instead, with all the dry jealousies in the household awakening it. Things get tense, and then they get teeth. Meanwhile, murder plans are in the mind of Scott's calculation. But it seems he is not the only one with such intentions. He is also being sought because of his last death, which opened the film so we know his story. James Wong Howe gives effective noirish cinematography to this story, directed by Frenchman Robert Florey, who earlier moved to Hollywood. The movie is an effective psychopath-in-home puzzle that can cause a bit of the sides of some seats, for those of such a tendency.
