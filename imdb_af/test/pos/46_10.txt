I watched this movie almost every night on HBO. It is my opinion that this could have been successful in the theater, as the advertisement has been so far. I was thoroughly impressed with Nanny's actress. She is an excellent actress. Of course, my favorite actor is Terrance Howard. He is a very distinguished actor and earns much more credit than he received. Ebony magazine did a good article about him, and gave him some of his excuses. Lakawanna Blue, understood me from the stories my parents used to tell us. They were from a similar town "Philadelphia, PA" where they had to have fun in the butt joints and such. I also want to say that Mos Def is an incredible actor. He found his calling. I saw him in several movies where he played a variety of roles, from doctor to doctor and he has the good! Overall, please put Lakawanna Blues on video for rent.
