eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, in which characters from the empire go to the world, trying to land a landscape to win a game they do not know, the purpose or exactly where it leads them. Within the virtual reality game, more low virtual reality games, which question what reality they come from, are the "real" one. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not spectacular to hide the fact that it's not going to reasonably answer a real reality, rather than the idea of ​​whether it's actually or a video game in question even to the end. I'm not even sure Cronenberg pretends that the twist won't be there, it's so incredibly obvious in a sense that it's a bit disturbing. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie, however, is its basic nature, in a sense. Cronenberg questioned reality and criticized play. Yet, the same things he uses to criticize game play the game: the violence, discontinuity, lack of focus and in some sense the pixelation, even though there is no such pixelation in the movie . I once heard that someone stated that Cronenberg's violence was actually a criticism of hyperviolence in the media, but he hid it well with the fact that he had such incredible pleasure in opening new openings in humans, animals and amorphous piles of biological sludge while. /> <br /> What is brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of video game views (not exactly what you want to say during cutting scenes, relative lack of environment or environment that doesn't make sense, just " Some people around where it feels should be alot and vice versa, all those things along with the motive of penetration. It definitely deconstructs the video game reality in a way that is misleading and absurd, but it makes it even better by replacing video game electronics with literal "pods" of biological matter that are shaky and shifted and honest, disgusting for one of the most abominable degrees. For what it's worth, this movie causes a reaction in you. <br /> <br /> But what for? It criticizes the virtual reality, but it is a movie: it is its own virtual reality. The banality of video game plot lines and character design seems to be criticized, but it claims that banality. It certainly seems to worry whether killing a video game character is better than killing a real person and how video games can be confused with reality and people don't think about the consequences of their action in real life and yet again I enjoy enjoying the greatest pleasure of ripping people, objects, animals, things and organisms into bloody khaki. <br /> <br /> So, while it has a major focus of anxiety, it doesn't really matter. , not really. Just what it does is present the anxiety in such an original way, it cannot really be denied its own moment of beauty. <br /> <br /> In a sense it would be much easier to just hate this movie because it is stingy and violent, because there is no good reason why I can see it, and yet I can't ignore either mediocre or bad. It will be easier to simply not take it, but because I can, there is nothing I can really do with it. I believe it is a bit excessive, it really doesn't have to go that far, but Cronenberg's intentions are so mixed and confused. I don't know if it was Cronenberg's mistake or Cronenberg's point, and I didn't "I think there's really a way to figure it out, except maybe ask him directly. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
