This movie is George C. Scott at his best, Bernard Hughes at his very best, and Princess Rigg at her most spicy, and of course, Paddy Chaevsky writes at "masterpiece" warp! There are also very short instructions from future biggies such as Susan Sarandon, Stockard Channing, etc., which contain one line of play that you don't necessarily see until you see fifth or sixth times. Nancy Marchand as a young to middle-aged nurse supervisor is also fantastic, as well as virtually every "face" in Hollywood of 1970. <br /> <br /> It's one of the few movies that get better, the more times you see It. Look for the "surprise" scene ala "Wait till dark"! It's one of the few movies I've ever bought on DVD. It's great.
