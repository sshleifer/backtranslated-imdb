This short was the first short issued by Paramount Famous Studios and was one of the others done by the studio. Popeye became directly involved with the enemy, mostly the Japanese. While Warner Brothers, Disney and, to a lesser extent, other studios, shorts that Germans often portray as foil, the majority of Famous Studios have focused on Japanese. Given Pearl Harbor and Popeye's fleet tires, it's pretty understandable. This is an average short. Seein 'Red, White an' Blue and Spinach For Britain is better aged. But it's still worth watching. Recommended.
