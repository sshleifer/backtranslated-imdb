I saw it at Sundance, one of the first years I attended at the festival - it broke me away ... <br /> <br /> It went way too fast and I never could do not find. I thought it would appear somewhere on a compound, but still no joy. My memory is foggy on the details. I just remember being over and over again and again on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Anyone reading this has any leads? Online, DVD, VHS Cooling Report - I'll try to make it worth it ... Over the years I've probably seen over 200 short films (live near Aspen where they have an incredible Shorts Fest in April). It's definitely among my favorites, and I hope to see it again! <br /> <br /> Thank you to anyone with guidance on how to see it :)
