I look forward to seeing this movie since I first caught the trailer, and I am so happy now that I have it. It's really a wonderful movie. The actors are great, the writing is fresh and actually, the whole thing is just in the right place. I love James McAvoy in it, and I can't wait to see him in The Lion, the Hitch, and the Wardrobe movie this December. Romola Garai is also wonderful. Be sure to check her out in "I Capture the Castle" or "Nicholas Nickleby," two of my favorite movies. Overall, I think I like this movie because it didn't make up chicken. It's a difficult topic to tell a story about making a lot of people offended or making a little sentimental candy-loving love party. But they totally avoided it and instead made a film that is real, honest and touching, but never over the top. Well done. Surprisingly well done. Go out and see it, and you'll know exactly what I mean.
