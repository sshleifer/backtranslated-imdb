During World War II, there was a bazillion movie created by Hollywood and, after seeing a lot, they began to look one day. OVER 21, however, is so unique in so many ways, as it shows a side of the war that you won't see in other movies - it's worth seeing even if you've seen the bazillion other movies! <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays the male lead, but the real lead of the movie is Irene Dunne. It looks great for a 47-year-old lady (yes, I checked - she was really old when she made the movie). In 21 years, the couple play husband and wife. He desires in the army, much to the dismay of his father (Charles Coburn) and owner of the newspaper where Knox works, and most of the film takes place when he is in the official candidate school. The movie shows little of Knox in school, but rather puts on Dunne as she lives in nearby Spartan housing for spouses. During this time she (as the British say) has a "stiff upper lip" and makes the best of it - though she is not really a housewife, but a well-known professional writer. Sometimes she gets very short visits from her husband, but most of the time is spent housewife duties and keeping the interfering Coburn at bay. Eventually she decided to stop the turbulent Coburn to call constantly. (He always complains that his paper will not survive without his son) by pretending that he is Knox - writes wonderful editorials who just accept everyone. <br /> <br /> While there is nothing in this movie, it is a very interesting piece of life movement. In addition, the play is really good everywhere. Interestingly, this film is a fictional reworking of the experienced Ruth Gordon (well-known author) and her husband, Garson Kanin (also a well-known scriptwriter and director). When Rabbit joined the army during World War II, Gordon soon wrote and died in the play this movie became. <br /> <br /> By the way, I noticed that some of the judges really liked the speech at the end of the movie. and was inspired by it. While it was very good, it was also very sad, because all this hope for a better world after the war was brief.
