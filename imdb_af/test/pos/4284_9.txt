There are so many more complexities on the basis of this wonderful thought-producing movie than just unfaithfulness and responsibility for the accident. I was struck by the initial apparent goodness of man Wilkinson who wanted the driver when he thought it was Everett, reported to the police, and changing the heart (and morality) when he learned it was his wife . He was indeed good and / or he tried to save himself by allowing her to go with Rupert. When deciding to turn things over and SHE was the right thing to do, she hit him. Most important is the theme of salvation (for the accident - for the infidelity - in her own strange, flawed way) strongest in Watson's ill-care for Everett. I believe that's why she made the effort. <br /> <br /> It seems to be a common theme in modern British novels: Brideshead Revisited, The End of the Affair occurs. Crazy about it.
