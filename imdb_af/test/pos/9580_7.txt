... the opportunity I gave to Ireland's past was invaluable. <br /> <br /> I had the benefit of seeing it at my Cork Mother, and in the look we talked and I learned a lot from her how things were back. <br /> <br /> Stuff likes how Deasy and Co. A Cork cooldrink company was; how rain can really destroy a crop; how farmers had to collect the crop; how did the women and men in the dance halls really stand against the opposite walls before the men walked forward and asked the woman to dance; about the bladder that set the fire on fire; how priests really called the list of church donors and their donations and a little bit about the currency that was at the time (which helped my dad show me what the pennies, shillings and crowns used earlier were also England) ). <br /> <br /> I didn't pay much attention to how good the movie was, but I was very grateful to have had the opportunity to look back over some time for some Irish history, but for others , including some of our parents and grandparents, are just their childhood.
