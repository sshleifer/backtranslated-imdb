Rickman is sexy and good, but the "stranger" is less convincing. Reedus is kind of sexy, but he is not a consistent actor. This can be the director's fault in this case. We are supposed to find him righteous in the extreme. because he is "beautiful" - but that is not enough. The weakened woman is almost convincing - 7 years of marriage and she and Rickman's character have to be settled with each other, whether their roles are incompatible or not - they must now have patterns. I get it, though I think the woman is a little tight in her role - and not convincingly attracted to the "stranger" - it's a failed - the unspoken bond between the Rickman character and the "stranger" is better done, even though we are not sure what it is. I miss Rickman's sexy English accent (luckily he strikes it and out of the American pattern). disappointing, but with some great plays.
