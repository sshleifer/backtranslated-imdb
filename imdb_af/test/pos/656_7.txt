It's an interesting, difficult movie from the early 70's with Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who doesn't hurt the cut. Dressed in 'baby blue' outfits to humiliate them when they are sent home, the failed recruits are packed. Vincent stops at a bar and walks into a very young Richard Gere, who has just returned from a tour of the Pacific as a hard core Marine Raider. Gere's character is already astonished and considering desertion, and he uses Vincent's innocence, steals his 'baby blue' uniform after making him drunk and beating him. Vincent's character, whose name is Marion, takes Gere's outfit and is suddenly transformed into a Marine Raider. Marion walks in Wyoming and stops at a small Norman Rockwell-like village. In the local cafe he meets Rose Hudkins, who immediately gets his eye on it. To stay with Hudkins's parents, Marion draws all sorts of attention from the town's people. Mr. Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a Marine Raider can still be so innocent. The story also brings up the Japanese International Camps, as the townspeople escaped hunting. Marion is accidentally shot. But there is still a happy ending, which aroused me a little. I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway, it captures JMV at the height of its 70s performances. BUSTER AND BILLY, BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid 70's were incredibly good JMV performances. He was both an action star and a heartbeat at the same time !!! He made many quality films during his career, and did so in the mid-80s with the big TV show Airwolf. He does a very good job in this as 'Hedge', and quietly looks at how people treat him (in his uniform) as he travels across the country. He also had to do some stunt work. There is a shocking river scene at the end of the movie - and he seems to have thrown the man down the river! But really, knowing his popularity, this movie could have done so much more with JMV's talent and appearance. Innocence can be just as interesting. Angry, as explored in Buster and Billie, is far more dramatic! Anyway, Glynnis O'Connor is lovely like Rose. The whole look of the movie is like a Norman Rockwell painting. The outdoor scenes are beautiful - must be filmed in Canada.
