This is a very touching movie. It's a story about a special bond between a child and his grandfather. A village man (Arun Nalawade) brings his grandson, Parashuram, to the city to treat his eyes. But find out that Parashuram (Aswin Chitale) has some rare cancer of the eyes and needs surgery and loses both eyes. The movie is about the emotions and the unrest they both go and how they accept the whole thing. The movie avoids any melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. Although the movie is in Marathi, language is not an obstacle at all. It proves that good movie is made, you don't have to have items songs, superstars and ordinary masala. Excellent achievements. This is India's entry for Oscars 2004. Hope it gets at least the nomination. Would rate 10/10.
