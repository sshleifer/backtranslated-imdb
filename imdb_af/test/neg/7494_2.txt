Perhaps it is unfair not to keep a movie for a movie, rather than what it is, but I have approached this hope to finally make a movie maker a film about rural gay men and women. Instead, the focus is mainly on the outrageous story (big news!) Of the locals (and those in remote areas) and the truly horrific torture / murder of a young gay man. <br /> <br /> So much time dedicated to stupid people talking about Aids, sin, hellfire and perverts. So much time devoted to the gospel preacher who is about to bible about the Bible and gay people they deserve. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see more people coming to the "gay bar", not those who opposed it. In addition, the young man who was murdered is not even from this town. <br /> <br /> The whole movie works as a warning rather than a celebration, and it's very suspicious.
