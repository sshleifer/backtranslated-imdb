I come from Romania ... and therefore I apologize if my English is not that good. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching this movie and I have to say I'm very disappointed. I always liked Wesley Snipes's movies, but this one is terrible. I regret having spent more than 3 hours uploading this movie. There are many mistakes in the movie. For example, the stadium in the movie is not Lia Manoliu. The name of the stadium is Ghencea. The name of the soccer team is known as Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli. The stadium scoreboard is unable to display graphics: video replays, live images, etc. It is a simple scoreboard that can only display letters and numbers. The Uli (Seaua) team's opponents are shown on the scoreboard as Din (probably from Dinamo Bucuresti - who is Steaua's main competitor in the Romanian soccer championship). The images from the soccer match are a match between Steaua Bucuresti and Poli Timisoara (my favorite team and my only love - watch it on the internet and you'll see why). The police cars in the film were not properly made. There is not a single dark blue police car in Romania! They're all white! The "bug list" can go on and on, but I will stop here! In short terms, this movie is terrible. It's not worth renting it, it's not worth buying a ticket, it's not worth it! I honestly feel sorry for Wesley Snipes playing in this movie. A previous film from his ... 7 seconds ... also filmed in Romania ... was OK, but it's awful!
