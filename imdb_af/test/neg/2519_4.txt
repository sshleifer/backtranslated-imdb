OK, this is a strange movie! Fans of Ed Wood Jr. will appreciate the "inventive" techniques used by George Barry, such as stock image and cute voice books. He can make a crack in the wall in a plot device! There is more humor than horror here, but I found it an uneven blend. You will laugh and cry, and probably wonder why you got your hands on it. Barry explained in the introduction that the filming started on this movie in 1972 and was completed in 1977 at a cost of $ 10,000. It's 59 months and $ 9,900 too much! If you want your cheese on campus, with vintage 70's, you can find it an irresistible and freaky snack.
