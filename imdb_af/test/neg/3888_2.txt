I was shocked to read all these wonderful comments about this movie because I hated it. I held it to the end, but it was painful - especially to listen to that child's voice. As Socact-1 noted, although the girl claimed she was from Chicago, she didn't have a Chicago accent. It sounded more like she was trying to mimic a NY accent - but also failed. I was so confused that I was waiting for the punchline. Of all the wonderful actors who played that child, why did they choose this one? And why force her to talk like that? It wasn't even the accent, it was the writing the monologue created for her. The reason I even chose this movie was that the plot thought addressed me - this era of history, the kind of characters who are poor and uneducated, the institution - and the love triangle. As far as I am concerned, it could and should have been much better. I was just as relieved to read that at least one other person felt the same way I did about this movie.
