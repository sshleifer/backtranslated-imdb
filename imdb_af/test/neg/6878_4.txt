I never meant to see poison, but I caught it on the cable. It has good elements. The Louisiana swamp atmosphere for one, unfortunately we won't see so much in movies due to Hurricane Katrina. It is based on an interesting concept, a regular man filled with the spirits of evil. His confrontation with his son could have been interesting, just like much of the movie. But as it happens in Hollywood, an interesting idea is in a familiar direction: <br /> <br /> Kill all the characters, save the good girl, start with the black guys. I'm a fan of Agnes Bruckner, but the other characters, the villain's former son, CeCe who has to become a voodoo priest, are more interesting. And for the love of God, just once I see the virgin murdered. We all like the easy girl, why can't she live? In this case, it was Byou Phillips, and we love her. <br /> <br /> The end didn't make sense, considering what was determined by the villain's immobility. All the carnage and the atmosphere, and it does not lead to anything.
