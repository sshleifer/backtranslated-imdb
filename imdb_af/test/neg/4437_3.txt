The best thing I can say about Quintet is that it's not quite as bad as I remember being on my first viewing. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't mean it's good. <br /> <br /> This strange, sci-fi thriller isn't quite like any other movie I've ever seen. It gives me at least the marking of novelty. But it is a disaster of a movie, and one of the worst Robert Altman ever made. On the DVD special feature about making Quintet, it is clear that even Altman did not know what the hell would be the movie. <br /> <br /> It's set in a distant future when the world is in the grip of another ice age. The film was shot at the abandoned place of the Montreal Expo '67, and I have to admit it gives the movie some interesting production design features, even though it seems to be filmed in a fridge-shopping mall. Paul Newman, looking out and absolutely interested in anything happening around him, and Brigitte Fossey, play drifters wandering in this futuristic city in search of Newman's brother. Soon, Newman gets caught up in a deadly game of Quintet, playing all the bored residents for lack of anything better to do, and its rules are never made clear to the audience. All we know is that the purpose of the game is to kill everyone you play and remain the only person. This gives these nihilistic residents their only excitement, because as one of them says at one stage in a psychobabic soliloquy, it can only be alive. <br /> <br /> The movie is slow, ugly and actually uncomfortable to watch because of its relentless gloom. It's almost as if Altman deliberately set out to make a movie nobody wants to go through. There are no characters. Oh, sure, actors are walking around to talk lines, but none of the lines really matter, and the impressive list of international actors Altman didn't meet for this registry. Only Bibi Andersson gives the closest thing to an unforgettable performance, as can be found in a movie like this. Yet, it manages to create an atmosphere, even if that atmosphere is one of sheer horror, and it is strangely fascinating, as one will slowly be hungry for himself, fascinating. <br /> <br /> After nearly a decade of excellent movies, Altman hit a dry game. "Quintet" closely follows the heels of the horrible "Wedding" and is followed shortly by the not bad but mostly forgetful, a perfect couple, "the terrible" health (which I have never seen because it is not available to not see) and the disastrous "Popeye." Thanks, he came back. <br /> <br /> Degree: D-
