The most positive points in this movie were the credits (textual style) and a few moments in Ice-T's play. The story line; Two competing gangs who have to fight it out, with the narrative of betrayal, power and change, are well behaved, but in this case it is painful (many) to blow through. The horrific scenery, which has light credibility in places, and dubious lighting, is constantly derived from any interest / identification with the characters (the shine of the actress's forehead / nose was blind, not to mention other scenes with the same problem Not even halfway through the movie, I wanted to know more about how and why it originated, as opposed to what happened on the screen. A disappointment if you've seen Ice-T in other roles. Kudos to other actors / actresses who watched their roles despite the poor direction; Corrupt's sidebar and the other restaurant worker.
