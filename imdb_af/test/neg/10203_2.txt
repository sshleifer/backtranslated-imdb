Hulk Hogan and Zeus are terrible wrestlers and horrible actors. Hogan was for some reason wanted enough to get a movie deal. I will never know why. If not for Mr. Mcmahon's money is not, this silly movie would never be made. Maybe someone will ever make a good movie about pro-wrestling. No Holds Barred is not that movie.
