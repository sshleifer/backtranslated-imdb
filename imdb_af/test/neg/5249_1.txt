This movie is painful. This is probably the best way to describe it. It is 93 minutes of your life that you can never return. Well, it's actually more than 86 minutes, because there's no way to put someone off the credit in this stinky stack of dogs. Immediately you can say the movie is from the "Mortal Kombat" manufacturer because of the thin and annoying techno soundtrack. It drains the few nice moments that this movie can give you. The rest is drained by the completely uninteresting and annoying characters, the "Freddie Prinze, Jr. School of Acting" acting abilities of everyone involved (including the mistress Christopher Lambert) and the non-existent director. Did I leave something out? Of course I did. Let's not forget about the suicide-invading writing, with the unified faith. Oh yes, and let's also talk about how they had punched the original poem with this sad and useless futuristic / medieval translation. The costumes and weapons (were those giant pizza cutters I've seen yet?!?!) Are just stupid, that's the best way to describe them. And the last culprit of the night is the always terrible CGI. When will filmmakers learn that CGI is sucking? When will we see the wonderful effects used in the 80's? Probably never, but movies like this and "Star Wars, Episode 1: The Phantom Menace" let us wish they will bring them back. Eventually avoid this movie like the latest Freddie Prinze, Jr. movie. Then again if you like Freddie Prinze, Jr. movies, you deserve this terrible excuse for movie entertainment.
