This is the result of the village of Milpitas California, which makes a home movie and submits to the rest of the world. Legendary in some circles as the biggest movie turkey, this movie is rightly regarded as a bad movie. Share comedy, share giant monster horror movie this movie is full of non-actors not acting. the plot has something to do with a huge monster created from the rubbish and pollution in the area and going on a rampage. The monster, which we do not see until the last 20 minutes, is quite cool, but is not cool enough to justify the previous hour of boredom. First, even hardened bad movie lovers will have a difficult time to finish. It's a stinker.
