PEP SQUAD is at a very low point with its confusing plot line and horrible acting. <br /> <br /> First, let's tackle the characters. Cherry (Brooke Balderson) continues to have an outrageous, booming rage throughout the film, due to her overwhelming passion for becoming prom queen. However, it is completely unknown to the audience why Cherry wants to become prom queen in the first place. Before the nominations are even read, she rushes around at the school with a constant disinterest to be there, and shows no interest in the place or his students to start with. Why does she give so much to be their prom queen? Brooke Balderson apparently produces an "award-winning" performance, but in reality he spends a lot of time with an angry face, bumping over and killing people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you gave a young actor / actress a script that only requires him or her to act crazy, you don't ask much. You also don't let the character develop very well. <br /> <br /> Beth's character, played by Jennifer Dreiling, is even worse. Trailing shows absolutely no emotion and no relation to her character whatsoever. When she is harassed by her principal, she knocks him (after a few seconds) without feelings of aversion or shock or something as traumatic. Her lines are read as if she is reading the trivia of the back of a cereal. <br /> <br /> In the rest of the film, students in charge of his kidnapping sound play more like they plan to do a braai than to decide what to do with their principal while tied up in their basement. be. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Cherry has died with several female prom queen candidates, and no one notices or cares. (Yes, I get it, I get it, the whole town is worried about prom. Very realistic. At least you can throw some funny scenes with the police, but it may be too much.) For example, just after Cherry Ry through the school and shoot a handful of students, and Beth is found by the local media. The reporter calls the "shooter" in a way that seems like no one knows who killed these innocent students, but then one second later asks, "What do you think of guns in the hands of minors?" or something about it. Where did the reporter jump into such conclusions? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, after Cherry has killed the award-winning prom queen and the fiance is persuaded. With the media reappearing, Beth adds that "she understands (Cherry's) should be heard" and walks away with her friends, smoking cigarettes in a quiet, unchanged mood. No one is even ignored by the fact that they only witnessed a murder. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that students are constantly parking in a yellow zone, and no one seems to make a sudden increase in violence in the village, July, living in a large house with no parents present, and the bizarre feast at her home. Maybe I'm a little bit away from the scene, but the last time I knew high school parties didn't involve naked women, artistic dancing in a pool of water while men for marshmallow bumps and everyone fights in their "I'm so indie and mod "Attitudes", Beth's parent's horrible behavior with her mother acting on top and her father, nods to everything the mother has. to say (and not in an entertaining way), along with stupid scenes like the new black principal walking after Christmas while trying to shoot her with a gun. Yes. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> The only compliment I can give this movie is that photography is great. The corners are flattering and the screen is very clear and sharp with each shot. <br /> <br /> Too bad is the acting and the script.
