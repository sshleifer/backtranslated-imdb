This movie is about a group of women (perhaps not of the highest reputation) who are going to a small fort to take over a recently remodeled odd property where they plan to build a store. Upon arriving in a nearby city, they find no one will go there (even though it is only 15 miles away), so they walk. When they get there, they find that there are no soldiers, but a good number of people who used the fort and built a small town. They soon find that something is not here and Fort McMillan (Ft. Doom as the locals call it) is in a serious problem. <br /> <br /> Rather than go into the plot line, I'll comment on things I've noticed about the movie. First of all, the play is very flat, just a few of the people really seem to believe enough. However, my first was poorly acting, but at the end I looked at some of the outtakes and the same people became alive. So my only thought left is how the director wanted it. Over and above the bad play I have a big problem where people do not respond properly to a given situation. Take, for example, nobody will take them to Ft McMillan for any price, even if it's only 15 miles away. Yet, when we arrive at the Fort, it is well maintained by a decent population of people. Everyone needs to get supplies from someone, and it's e-mail, etc. It should take place in 1867, but we can have the electric car electric lights (they are not at least) and a locomotive that is at least 30 years later, not one of the popular style of locomotives so popular. There are also places where you can see a paved black top (and maybe a car at one point, didn't want to look again) and other anachronistic items. If they followed the rules of the "world" and made the actors actors, it could have gotten a 4 of me instead of the 2 I gave, and they rewrote it 4 times. It could have done even better.
