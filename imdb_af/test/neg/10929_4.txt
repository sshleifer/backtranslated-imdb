It's a pretty simple romance. Girl finds boy, girl loves son, girl loses son, girl finds son. Colleen Moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe, delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic / romantic show, and earning an Oscar nom. Just as well, the air conditioning is special effects. <br /> <br /> Moore plays a French girl whose mother turned to a British airplane during WWI. She is the "daughter of the regiment", loves a little sister. In this mix comes a fill-in for a down-flyer, Gary Cooper. First, they hate each other, then they love each other, then the whole squadron is sent out on a suicide mission. Cooper returns but falls into the village and a red cross unit removes him. Moore looks for him, is told at a hospital he is dead, then walks the streets until he calls out of a hospital window and they are reunited. <br /> <br /> It's a nice little romance, but little more than that. Recommended for fans of me. Moore and Mr. Cooper
