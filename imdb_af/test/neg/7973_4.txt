When Kristy Swanson gets an assault on the guilty feelings about what she does, she wants to go out. Unfortunately, Madsen is her immediate superior in a company where a two-week notice is not an option. "<br /> <br /> As a teenage-deadly vampire, Kristy has done a very good job, the valley girl's image looks fit, but as an assassin ... running continues to run Kristy. Run, run away! This movie is not a concept that hasn't been done before, but it's better done! <br /> <br /> I didn't want to watch the rest of this movie, but I felt like if I wanted to give an overview of this movie, I always liked Madsen, and his character was a little predictable, but this movie was definitely a waste of time to watch and make. it never was released theater!
