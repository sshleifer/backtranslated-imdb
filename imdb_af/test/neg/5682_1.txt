First of all, I must say that I don't like fiction movies so much! But there are some movies I really liked. This is one of the other;) I have the same opinion as some (most) others here. The movie is still going on in my back, but the few effects aren't really enough to look all the time. I think what they did well is the animated scenery with 3 suns and 4 moon, but that's the only thing I like. There are no intelligent dialogues (is there ???). But it's a great movie for anyone who loves Lara Croft or other girls in HOT PANTS ...;) <br /> <br /> For the directors: "Stop trying again, PLEASE !!!"
