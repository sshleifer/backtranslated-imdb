See the names of the lead actors (Statham, Snipes and Phillippe). I thought the movie should at least definitely be funny or interesting. Instead, I only got 92 minutes boring, but the frustration of knowing everything that was going to happen, and hearing tons of lame and loose "bad cop" phrases. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that the movie doesn't have a good story to start. And if you do, no one can help you, not Statham, not Wesley Snipes. Not even John McClane can save this movie :-) It can be cool for kids if they are no more than 12 years old. age, because they don't care much about the story, and there are some big explosions in the movie.
