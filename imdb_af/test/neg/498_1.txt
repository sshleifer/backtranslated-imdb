Critics like this movie. I personally found it senseless and tasteless. It was the millionth time I fell in the critics love it and came out that someone would pour hot boiling water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching the movie. There are many scenes that are completely unnecessary. A warning to animal lovers: Don't see this movie if you don't want to murder and molest sheep. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Asian movie, see Africa. If you want to see a movie about escaped prisoners, watch the classic Stir Crazy by Gene Wilder / Richard Pryor. Avoid 9 souls like the plague.
