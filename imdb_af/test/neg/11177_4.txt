A wonderful beautiful Charlotte Lewis star as a ghost woman tormenting her on the phone. Throughout the fright, Charlotte is forced to confront this cold secret to save her common sense and her life. I can't believe Ruggero Deodato, the director of "Ultimo Mondo Cannibale", "Cannibal Holocaust" and "House on the Edge of the Park", has rectified this absurd piece of rubbish. The music of the foreman of the Goblin Claudio Simonetti is quite good, but the story is painfully stupid. The writing by Franco Ferrini is ridiculous and it doesn't make sense, the acting is bad and there is absolutely no tension. The scene in which a prospective Charlotte Lewis rapist is murdered by coins emitted from a subway phone is more than ridiculous. Don't waste your time with this piece of crap. There are much better Italian horror movies out there!
