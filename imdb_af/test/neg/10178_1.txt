First, I have nothing against Christianity. I believe every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses. But I can't imagine how stupid one should be to believe it! What a waste of believers' money. They will use it better to feed hungry families in third world countries. I don't want to talk about talking or plot this "movie" because I couldn't find any of those in it. Story's simple - two reporters, one (A) is atheist, the other (B) for some reason left religion. B regains his confidence in religion and teaches A a lesson - believes in Christ or goes to hell. This message appears after about ten minutes and stays at the end of the movie. People don't believe the rating of this "movie" read reviews first. I didn't waste an hour of my life: (PS: Why is it classified as sci-fi? Because of those few strange sounds and some bright light from the air? PPS: UFO = Satan's evil do? new one :)
