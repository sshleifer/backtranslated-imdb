This is a piece of celluloid CRAP. You can see when you watch a "want to" mafia movie .... and that's it. It didn't make SENSE, didn't start his life, charactors were everywhere ... and the TERM "GODFATHER" didn't even exist until PUZO wrote the book! ..... THEN, the real mafia, borrowed the PHRASE and made it themselves AFTER the movie ..... THIS piece of some would think that the phrase (representing the mafia-don) was used in the 20's ... when these people are just called "DON" .... out of the original Godfather movie, if you want to see another decent mobflick, watch Puzo's The Last Don (part 1) part 2 sucked.
