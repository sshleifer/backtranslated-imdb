This movie is bad. Not so bad, it's good. Not bad. However, it is hilariously bathed. I watched it from a morbid curiosity and will never see it again, or any other Chuck Norris movie. If you have to choose between this movie and death, you must choose this movie happily, because it is a master class in a terrible movie (hence the hilarity). <br /> <br /> It's a constant depression to shut down, as I work at my desk, some people become involved in movies and decide to produce things like this. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10. Still better than Starship Troopers.
