The first season was wonderful - good mix of work and brother and friends at home. It was actually a funny show. <br /> <br /> Now it shows again and the brother and the two hot chicks are gone - and the whole thing turns around the airline. Even the old man running the company went downhill - even over the top, where it was perfect. <br /> <br /> It and not anymore Sarah Mason - one of the most beautiful girls in Hollywood. <Br /> <br /> That's what happens when you get some exporters to get their hands on a show. You can almost see the meeting. "The old man is funny, focuses on him, makes it over and makes everything about the airline. It will be a dirty version of the office!" Anyway, no hot chicks, no watch.
