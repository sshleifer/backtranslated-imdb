Steven Segal has done horrible movies, but this has probably been one of the best since his career about ten years ago. The role play is better than usual, and while the story and plot are a joke, most of the action looks good. The plot is probably one of the worst in film history. Someone is being executed because he stole money? Some mercenary types kidnap a Supreme Court Justice? Their aim is to exchange the Judge for the prisoner so they can find out where he has the money? Meanwhile, the Performance Room is full of fall doors and false floors and looks like a set of one of the Cirque Du Soleil circus shows. <br /> <br /> Then there's the issue of jail. Here is the Warden a Homie, played by Tony Plana. The prisoners all have their gang colors and signs, and the guards are there to serve the meals and keep the prison clean. Nothing like a bunch of prisoners who beat and beat fighters while watching the Warden. What happens? The Warden gives them a strict talk. He can punish them next time. <br /> <br /> There are many moments in this movie that are good for the laugh. However, Nia Peeples looks pretty good, and Ja Rule is trying to be an action hero. Have fun getting the prisoners to "do the right thing" and get armed so they can release the High Court Justice from her prisoners. Regardless of how bad Half Death may be, if you see it, remember that it is easily the best movie Steven Segal has experienced since 1992 in 1992.
