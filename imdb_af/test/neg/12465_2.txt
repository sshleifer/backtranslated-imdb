The box for this movie is wrong. The cover shows a view of legs and underpants in a short dress. The title is `Tart. "The summary on the back of the box made it look as if Kat, the main character, was an outcast who became one of the popular students, but that popularity led to a bizarre lifestyle she couldn't escape. Everything the box made for this movie was a terrible lie. I expected a kind of crappy, direct-to-video version of "Heathers" against the teenagers of today. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you what "Tart" really was about. Yes, it's really the plot; so if you don't want to know what happens, stop reading. We have one infinite, boring rich girl. This unlikely girl's best friend is a sham. The bastard is expelled from the school, so the unlikely girl is befriended by a British girl. This leads to the unlikely girl pointing out this boring man, who refers to the box as the "most popular boy in the school. "If that guy was the most popular man in their school, I wish I was going to that high school because I could have kicked the shit out of it. Anyway, as any movie will tell you, the most popular man at school is always a killer or drug addict or thief, or in this case all of the above. Anyway, everyone ends up failing the unlikely main character because she is Jewish. Then the most popular man in school beats her best friend, the shank, dead with a rock because the shank has caught the most popular boy in a homosexual act. The unlikely girl's stoic mother and hypochondrial younger brother are there for her. Oh, and the whole movie is about sneaky kids and their terrible parents. Give, what's wrong with that? It sounds like a fantastic movie! Well, that's what I thought. But you see, there are NO durable characters in this movie. The main character is boring. The filmmakers made her mean while spitting on the freak during the film. The shank is not shiny enough and has little screen time. The popular man is nothing to write about the house. The popular girls are just your running girls. There are no moral lessons. Kat, the boring main character, is not a freak, never become one of the really popular girls and worst of all, after all the crap she goes through. She thinks she's still too good to befriend the only pretty girl, the brave girl. To be honest, I have no idea why the movie is called Tart. I asked, who is the tart? Is she the tart? Are they all tart? At 94 minutes, it is theoretically not a long movie. But after watching this terrible waste of a VHS band and not knowing who the tart was, I was surprised that the movie was only one and a half. The movie felt it was two hours and a little change. After a while I hoped the movie would be about pop tarts. At least when you look at a box of pop tarts, you know what to expect.
