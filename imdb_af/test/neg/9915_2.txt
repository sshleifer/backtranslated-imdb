A wasted effort. On the surface it is a typical disaster movie: we are involved in the lives of a few people caught in the Big Event. However, the writing is so terrible and there is so much explanation of the characters' background in the dialogue we feel we are treated like morons. Even Sesame Street does not have the origin of Mr. Snuffleupagus does not explain whether Mr Hooper died: we can work it out. Someone thought the introduction of 'Enron' in the script would give it money when the power companies were discussed. The acting is largely soft, with the exception of the older performers (Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy), and after the first hour I couldn't care less about who took out the storms. <br /> <br /> But maybe there are the special effects to look at. Unfortunately no. Even on a 20-year-old TV I could see that one tractor and trailer's computer was generated. Maybe there are budget constraints, so I can forgive that one. Moving a plane trying to land seems pretty real, but I told myself I had seen it before. This site confirms this: it was from a previous movie, nowhere to land. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, the only good bits of another movie are, and if you see the best action series in a 30-second network promo, it makes Category 6 look pretty good. My advice: rely on your network to make good 30 seconds, look at them and save yourself two nights.
