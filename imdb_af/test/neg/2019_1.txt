One of the hardest things to consider the lack of abundance of good movies in the genre, and that I have seen hundreds of them in my lifetime, I must say that Dracula 3000 is by far the most uninspired, crippled and poorly done piece of garbage I have had an accident to see. Stay away from this movie! It's so bad, it's not even laughable. The special effects (I said, "special"?) Were probably made to spend a few big, the acting was terrible and the writing had to be in the trash after the first reading by the studio who decided this miserable to tackle project. The whole movie was literally filmed in a warehouse. Also, for your parents who hold nudity in your movies, don't be deceived by the R rating. If you think you get a chance to see Erika Eleniak even half naked, you're wrong. She is fully dressed throughout the movie. And the cover art is totally misleading! There is no scene in any part of the movie that is even equivalent to the amazing cover art they put on the box to attract unsuspecting horror fans. <br /> <br /> Too bad the score is only 1 to 10. I'll give this movie a -10. Be warned. Don't waste your money or your time on this one.
