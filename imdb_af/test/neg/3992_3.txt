Likewise, Lamberto Bava was a substandard fasimily of his father, Mario (who was a very overstated director anyway), Michele Soavi is a substandard director in the Dario Argento form. "The Church" has at least one thing to recommend it - the amazingly detailed artistic direction - but absolutely nothing else. The movie is long-lasting, filled with one-dimensional characters, and slept almost several times. There is a fine line between 'art' and 'pretentious crap', and while 'the church' is not completely worthless, you would be better off looking at something else. <br /> <br /> 3/10
