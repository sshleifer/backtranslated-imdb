I chose this one each time in the rental shop and wondered if I should shoot it. Today I broke down and gave it a whirl, and I probably don't need it. <br /> <br /> While the author / director gave the film a respectful effort, it became far from busy. The characters, while you wanted them, just didn't have enough development or depth to really get involved with them. Sara's sexual outbursts were rapidly changing. I don't care for sex in movies, and I don't care about meager characters, but being a "bad" girl doesn't mean you tend to ask excited people at will if they want sexual favors. By the time the characters happened, I was bored, and I was ready to climb to the climax, the end, anything exciting ... and deliver nothing. The things that people in the story finally let them know that they were forced and unrealistic, were just not played right. If they threw a little more anxiety there, I might be interested. It had to be a more of a thrill / drama movie, and had to be held on the title "Jon Good's Wife" rather than the whole "red right hand" and horror movie-like cover. Hell ... it had to have tension, period. <br /> <br /> Anyway ... watch it on a rainy day or a late night when there's nothing on TV. Although not as big as I had hoped, I would be talking about certain infomercials.
