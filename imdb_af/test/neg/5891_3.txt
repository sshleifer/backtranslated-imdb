I honestly expected this movie more. It may have been the problem. There was not a time when the camera had always been. At close-ups, the camera shakes, the subjects move, and I get headaches. The cuts are so frequent and so fast that the viewer often finds that he / she is wondering what happened. (LOOK OUT, SPOILER ALERT) And at the end of the movie, if you expect to have a happy ending after thinking so much useless to understand what's going on, they'll lose it. For me, this was a really horrible movie devastated by a camera man with ADHD, and a lack of meaningful meaningful plot.
