I watched the 1st scarecrow movie and didn't take one out of the bag, although I knew it was b-grade. It really had a decent gore, and the scarecrow man was a great acrobat and had good skills. The effects were better and the costume looks better than this movie. <br /> <br /> I borrowed this one with an open mind, I'm also a fan of ken shamrock (former ufc superfight champion) and hoped it was a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Boy was wrong, the movie sucked, the monster was pathetic in both appearance and in fact scary, the storyline was so predictable, it was like watching the movie in preview, as I would already guess what will happen, the music was so bad, with a terrible lip sync song that made me punch the screen. <br /> <br /> In general, avoid this crappy movie. <br /> <br /> Save money.
