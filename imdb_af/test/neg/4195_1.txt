Apart from commenting on the technical merits of production, or lack of it, the play is absolutely terrible. What is really scary about this movie is that I actually have a copy of it, it was, of course, in a bargain and was renamed Dark Harvest 2 and after I saw it, I can understand why it is in Die bargain - they had to pay me to get it out of their stock. <br /> <br /> The majority of the movie, if you want to call it, is spent by a madman running around a maize field. maze is looking for his daughters because he has a foreman that something will happen to them. I suspect the camera with which the girls were playing at the beginning of the movie was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco. In the maze he walks in the ghost of a few children, who are weak, and the movie goes terribly south from there. <br /> <br /> I can see why they are renaming this movie, otherwise they would never have got rid of them. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever had to go through, and it wasn't worth the $ 2 I spent on it.
