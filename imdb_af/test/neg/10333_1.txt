This movie is from the 80's, but it seems to have been made in the stone age. The effects are much too cheesy. My copy has Sandra Bullock on the cover, so I bought the movie. She was in the movie for about 5 minutes from the total screen. She will probably deny all involvement. <br /> <br /> In short, there is no part of this movie to see, except to laugh at how bad it sucks. Rent this to see the worst movie ever made.
