Well, let's be fair. Following a cult classic like Road House is no easy task. Now create Swayze from the equation and get a monumental task. So, with Patrick, not on board, whose idea was to go anyway and make this piece of garbage? I'm going to blame the director who didn't give proper footage throughout the movie for 5 minutes. I was actually shocked when they were going to jump Will Patton (Armageddon). Johnathon Schaech did a good job with the lead, but the writing was horrible. In the first 5 minutes of his film, he dropped his dark-skinned Crystal Mantecon in the first five minutes. But I stuck with the movie and hope to get a glimpse of the great cheesy humor that worked so well with the Double Duece. No such luck. The cover of the DVD is hilarious, they show these two staples that make one 10 second in the film. Costar Ellen Hollman actually offers a decent performance. But again, the effort is useless in a piece of garbage and shame like this. Has Jake Busey ever been thrown into a decent movie? Can't they draw at least some actors in the first movie for some kind of nostalgia treatment? Even one of the old bouncers or two, or Jeff Healey for a performance, would have been nice. Take this movie out of your queue immediately. -LostFlix
