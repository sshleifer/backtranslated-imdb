What can you expect from a direct DVD movie? You know what you get when you rent it. The quality of cinematography reminds me of reality TV shows. <br /> <br /> Why are shots always so close to the actors! And why are they always characterized? There is nothing to look at. (And the actors are so beautiful, so it blows.) <br /> <br /> Writing and dialogue is just awful. That intro scene, with British Guy, is hilarious. Just try to listen to these words, they don't make sense, just go around in circles. The lines in the rest of the movie looked as if they were out of romance and sci-fi novels, as if the authors had no idea what they were doing. The characters definitely sound like they have no idea what they are saying. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible movie. I feel bad for the actors attached to this project. Embarrassing!
