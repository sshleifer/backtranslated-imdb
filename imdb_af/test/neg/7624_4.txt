After his success with a nightmare on Elm Street in 1984, director Wes Craven decided for some reason that his next project would be this TV movie. I'm not a big fan of this director in general; early exploitation slip The last house on the left as well as its modern scraping scream, Scream, is fine with me, but the rest of his work is hit and miss and I would hesitate to call him the master who marked him. The main theme here is cryogenic freezing, but it's more of a plot for the plot rather than an important part of the movie. The main influence here is of course the excellent 1974 zombie movie Deathdream and our focus on Miles Creighton; A businessman cryogenically frozen for ten years before an accident which means he must be thawed immediately. Miles is part of a project for people who are ill; they pay to be frozen in the hope that they will be revived in the future when their diseases can be cured. Miles has been revived successfully and it is seen as a miracle ... but the person waking up is not the person who has been frozen, as Miles returns without a soul. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been pretty decent. judge by the idea for that, but instead we get a plot that doesn't really care about it and it should be said that Craven does not make the best of the potential of the film. The soul is the main focus, but it does not seem to have soul and has only a murderous intention. No compassion is the same thing that felt a little imaginative. The film is made for television, and it's not very nasty and it is clear that not much money has been spent on it, as the whole production feels very cheap. Michael Beck never became a very popular actor and it is not surprising to judge by his performance here; while mental, he has largely missing charisma and is not formidable in the central role. The plot does not flow too badly, but there is a real lack of tension and / or tension and things are going too slow too, which sometimes causes the movie to be boring. It also comes to a predictable end. Overall I have to admit that I was not impressed by this film and as far as Craven's filmography goes, Chiller would have to go with Shocker, the Scream sequels and The Hills Have Eyes II as a miss.
