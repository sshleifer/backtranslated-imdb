Peter Crawford discovers a comet on a collision course with the moon. But when the government doesn't believe it (stupid fact # 1). He builds a shelter in the deep underground area and draws lots to see who is going. Plus is willing to kill to save humanity (stupid fact # 2). With millions of dollars of technology, how can a citizen see what NASA couldn't do? Plus, the ends justify the means moral of this story is just plain WRONG !!! This movie is unlikely and totally unbelievable. What worn by these people, why does hell shake like this green light? Sometimes I wonder who anyone should **** to make a movie in this city.
