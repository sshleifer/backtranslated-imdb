It makes me painful to say this about an Australian film, but Mr. Accident stands alongside the worst of the worst movies I've ever seen. What is even tragic is that it does not fit in the "it's so bad it's good". What irritates me most about this movie is the rather large amount of money that was put away on an inexorable, undeveloped, incessant script. Dumb performances (What is Garry McDonald and Elisabeth Gore aka Elle McFeast doing in this trash?), Insufficient direction, no plot and a general sense of meanness are completely away from the interesting production design and leave you with a really horrible taste in your mouth. Comedy! Ha! Do yourself a favor and stay away!
