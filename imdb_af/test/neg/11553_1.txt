It is unthinkable for me to enjoy or laugh at this movie. I'll say it's the worst movie I've seen for years and I see a lot of them. Maybe I forgot junior high? It's also very hard to believe it's the same Jeff Daniels to do such a brilliant performance of George Washington in The Crossing. Looks like ever since he did Dumber, he's been in the tank. Can you believe he even wrote and directed this junk?
