In the 3rd installment of "Left Behind", the makers did not mind placing ANY CHILD OF CONTINUITY in the plot. Although all the weapons on the planet were seized by the United Nations, World War II suddenly began with a finger. Within a few split seconds, the ex-lover of one of the main characters moves passionately to lead him to complete hatred for a melancholy confession of love without any trace of direction. <br /> <br /> But especially this movie is really an ironic free zone. After the president of the United States accepted Jesus as his savior, he immediately became a suicide bomber and blew up a skyscraper in the center of the city. Osama Bin Laden will be very jealous if he sees this movie!
