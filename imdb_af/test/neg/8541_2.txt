A group of adventurers travel to the 'dark continent' to find a lost heir, named Diana, who disappeared into a plane crash many years ago and who is now believed to live with a wild tribe who believes that they are their goddess. <br /> <br /> Again, my search for messy, European cannibal movies took me deep into the Jess Franco area? a seemingly endless movie wilderness that suffers with sub-par scriptwriting, crawling jaws and lots of work with terrible acting (Franco-regular Lina Romay takes this prize for her spicy performance as a sick, elderly woman). It is here, in this hellish place, that I finally stumbled upon the Kilimanjaro Diamonds, a turbulent jungle-based exploitation so bad that it took me three consecutive evenings to observe it. <br /> <br /> Tawdry and relentless dew, even by Franco's standards, fail this tedious piece of garbage at virtually every level: the story is a terribly boring derivative of Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan, even if it's with a female strife; the film appears to be filmed in the local botanical gardens, although grainy stock footage is poorly integrated into the film in a meaningful attempt to convince viewers that action really takes place in Africa; and the dead scenes are virtually bloodless (Franco can usually be argued for some plover, but despite initial appearances, it's not a cannibal movie and it's not that nice). <br /> <br /> However, where the director succeeds in throwing his sexy young Katja Bienert as a jungle-jail bait Diana. Running and jumping through the undergrowth in nothing but a slim cloth, her crooked copy, shouting the fact that she was just sixteen at that time, makes this nubile beauty quite an impression. Franco also throws some nudity courtesy of Mari Carmen Nieto as treacherous traveler Lita (who gives us a glimpse of her untamed regions) and Aline Mess as topless warrior Noba, who so carefully avoids another score of 1 / 10 of me to get (although I'm sure he'll receive much more in the future? I still have a lot of movies to watch).
