Young couple on the road, thinking about their own business and having comfortable sex in their car during the broad daylight. Yet they are suddenly threatened and terror by a bad psychopath in an old and rusty truck. Hmm, where have I seen this premise before? Oh yes, now I remember, we've seen it a thousand times before, and about nine hundred and ninety-nine of the other cases were much better than 'Rest Stop'! This weak and spicy new movie even insults the minds of the most indifferent horror fans, as it does not contain a single original twist or memorable gimmie. It's very sadistic and nasty, but every teenkill slasher movie is sadistic and filthy nowadays, so it's no longer a real surprise. The absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large number of dumb plot holes and meaningless subtotals. Author / director John Shiban damn realized that the ultra-thin basic storyline was almost not enough to fill an entire movie, making his film like a Thanksgiving turkey with immobile and unfriendly material. Nicole's boyfriend disappears at a deserted and dirty resting place in California. Immediately killing her character will not immediately result in a very long movie and, as a result, she becomes a family of freaks, suffering from visions (?) In which she talks to previous victims of the terrible killer and his deep emotional has (and sows) conversations with a police officer who just won't die, even though a lorry is overrun twice ... The stupid subplots never lead nowhere and they are definitely the most pathetic and desperate effort to stretch a movie length I've ever seen. Instead of all the relentless stuffing, Shiban had to pay more attention to the build up of tension and make his main characters a little more enjoyable. Jaimie Alexander's character Nicole is an annoying and mindless girl and you will not really care if she will survive the ordeal or not. Her boyfriend, Jesse, as well as the policeman, are both junkies and their brutal deaths have not been painful enough, if you ask me. I counted exactly three series, all including torture and free mutilation, which was stingy and exciting enough to bring a sadistic smile to my face. It's still too much for a contemporary horror movie. Basically, "Rest Stop" is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such movies as "Wolf Creek" and "Hostel", but you are better off looking at the original. It was the first film from the new production company Raw Feed. They are promoting themselves as the new name in great terror, but they will have to come up with something better than "Rest Stop" if they want us to believe it.
