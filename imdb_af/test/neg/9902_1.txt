I can't believe I've actually spent nearly three hours of my life seeing it. It has to be one of the most incredible, predictable and cheese television movies I've seen in the past. I was hoping for some good special effects and action, but I rolled through my eyes all the time and shouted "OH COME ON !!!" on the screen. The dialogue is level and obvious, the stage is sometimes the story moving, it is not just funny, how everything happens at the same time ... not to mention the obvious and misleading end. Now I have seen more than my part of disaster films, I am actually a big fan, and think they can often pull out quite unrealistic things as long as they are done in a fun way, but it certainly is not. It's just an insult to intelligent viewers everywhere. What did they think when they made this movie ?????
