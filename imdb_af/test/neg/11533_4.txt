The only reason why any of the hundred or so users watched this movie was because they belonged to the crew, were friends for the crew, or were obsessed with Lance Henriksen or Lorenzo Lamas. I personally follow the "cult of Lance", so I was disappointed to see that it was in spite of the leader, but only in the name. Launching rich criminal Newcastle, Lance is a joy to watch, but all of his screenplay is released at the beginning of the movie. Newcastle picks up a 747 lift that includes Ketchum (Lamas) and a lot of forgetful characters. The biggest shock to this viewer was that the pre-hoist scenes were not so bad. With the exception of somewhat unpleasant and rather confused Aviva Gale, who plays each and every line with the subtleties of a primary school playboy, acting around the world and none of the lines really made me. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the hoist takes place, the movie falls asleep. Not only is their plan the most ridiculous thing ever captured on film, but it has been dragged too long. It's not a very deep movie, and you have to fill in 90 minutes, but these scenes are so boring. I cut almost two o'clock in the afternoon. One particular order in which we look at each of the characters, do the same task over and over, is especially difficult to go through. The film's name is "Rapid Exchange", but the exchange is far from fast - it's over and long inflated. Perhaps it would have worked if any of the characters had real personalities, but come on, there's just as much you can find out of a straight-to-video movie that is explicitly displayed from Showtime Filter. <br /> <br /> Luckily, Lorenzo Lamas is apparently a tired master, making some amazing bizarre scenarios, and Lance returns to the movie's end, though for a short while. It's a bad movie, and I probably didn't need it, but it's far from the worst thing I've ever seen. I will not put it too high on the list of Henriksen movies, as he is in some real gems with greater screen time and somehow the movie loses a lot of steam as soon as the heist starts, but the best I do Can say Rapid Exchange are the last two movies I watched before it was the mainstream hostage and the over-estimated, pretentious Crash - and it was better than both.
