"Fate" leads Walter Sparrow in possession of a mysterious novel that has ominous similarities and connections to his life. It's all about the number 23. As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Spar must find out his connection with the book. and how the story will eventually end. <br /> <br /> The number 23 provides an intriguing point of departure that is undone by a poor performance. The movie just failed at many different levels, which is pretty disappointing because it had so much potential. The script was probably the worst part of it. It was full of dull rows and ridiculous dialogue that only killed the movie's mood. The scriptwriter seems to have had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to run over a ninety minute run. The second half of the movie was aware of ideas, the turn was pretty obvious and the end was terrible. <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he has saved himself a bit with Phone Booth and some other movies, but the number 23 reminds me that he is still a stinker can make. He drenched the movie, but he just can't get a good focus. He moves the film in a few and slow pace. He switches from reality to what actually happens in the book that has quickly become annoying. The real book in the movie, "The Number 23", is a horrible detective story and the audience gets stuck and listens to Carrey. It tells me what just makes me bored. When Carrey finally made the book, we got stuck and watched him run around to solve the puzzle. At this stage, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We are waiting impatiently for the movie to reach it, it's a terrible end and unconvincing explanation before we celebrate the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was mostly average and beautifully forgotten. Jim Carrey was clearly just asleep by his performance and he didn't even try to try it. He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just lots of wood. His narrative was a complete urge to listen and he had no life in his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role, but she should choose better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty sweet like Danny Huston. Overall, the number 23 was a terrible excitement that laughed more than excitement or excitement. Rating 3/10
