They call this movie "euro garbage horror". <br /> <br /> Well, it's not horror. The film takes place in Europe, if so, it is 'euro'. Trash can? Oh yes, it's dirt. <br /> <br /> You know you're in a good movie when the DVD really starts with the text on the screen apologizing for the quality of print you're about to watch. Expect cartilage, strange abrasive cuts, and film not to fit the screen. Plus there is the sound - I initially thought I was watching a baptized movie. When I looked carefully at the lips, I realized that, no, it is that the sound quality is shamefully bad and old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is pretty goofy - an old, mutilated woman named Dr Bannister kills a scientific death for his youth formula. I do not give away much, because if you see the "old woman", it is pretty clear that she is under a layer of thick, poorly applied makeup. Anyone with a nice sense, see the fake age, know what comes next. <br /> <br /> Yes, the "old crone" is wonderfully transformed into a beautiful young woman - complete with facial makeup and a long wig of hair! Sin! <br /> <br /> If I say the old woman is misleading, I mean that she has glued cornflakes to her face. The film does not attempt to explain how the maize flowers came to it. For the case there is no attempt to explain anything related to any of the characters. They never developed beyond the level of finger puppets. <br /> <br /> The two policemen who persecute our anti-heroine just wander around, apparently stunned by the simplest clues. The murdered scientist has worked on a youth serum, the old woman has disappeared and we are in a young woman. How do these pieces fit together? What does it all mean? One of the police swears a lot and bangs his face with a cloth. The other smokes a pipe. That's pretty much everything we get, characteristically. <br /> <br /> Dr Bannister (the crown, now a beauty) is going to wear strange costumes and then take off so we can see her flesh. She has business with men. She comes in a cat fire with a young woman in a nightdress. She goes to Geneva so we can see the lake there. She took a little water and took out her wet suit to reveal a strange bun curry bikini. She put her clothes back in a strange ninja costume striptease. <br /> <br /> The end? Well, without giving away anything, it's just a bizarre one, pointed to the conclusion that makes as little sense as the rest of the picture. This is the kind of thing a writer comes up with when the director wakes him up at 4am and says, "Quick! We've put an end to our movie! What's next?" <br /> <br /> The writer mumbles something half awake, and the director walks with it. <br /> <br /> What's good about this movie? The music is champion and fun. The classic 60s organ music that is so thin is enough to make you laugh out loud. There are some weird temptations, bizarre dialogue, goofy moments. <br /> <br /> It's so close to being so bad that it's good. I managed to look from start to finish without swallowing or sneaking my eyes. I think it is praise of all kinds. '
