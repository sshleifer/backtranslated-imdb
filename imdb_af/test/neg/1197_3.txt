According to the blurb on the back of the DVD cover; Jonotan Ross laughed until a little wound came out. "I suspect it has more to do with its fullness. <br /> <br /> I never looked at the series for some reason, so maybe I miss some essential directions. With regard to this movie; I watched the first 45 minutes or so. I laughed once, smiled once and then arrived at the newspaper while waiting for something else to happen. Nothing did that. <br /> <br /> It's apparently meant to be a surrealistic spoof on life in the post-Python gross humor style. It falls absolutely flat. There has been a series of comedy series on television over the past few years, the least of which was 'Bottom', 'The Fast Show' 'The Vicar Of Dibley' and 'Father Ted'. Each one has a group of bizarre hilarious characters and sketches. Any one of these can knock this shit in a chopped hat. <br /> <br /> If the series was anything like this movie; I'm surprised they got the funding. Fortunately, it was one of those Â£ 2 Tesco fire tube purchases and is now in the local charity shop. <br /> <br /> The morale of the story is; Don't believe the pundits, never pay top dollar.
