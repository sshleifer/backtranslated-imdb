They did it again: detached from an old show's title, then the nostalgia destroys with boring "re-imagined" things. The '60s cartoon was one of the funniest of his time, a great singer of superhero comics. The character is drawn as a half way between animal and human, as is Mickey Mouse. Here they use a real brawl; It's about the same as making a Mickey Mouse watch with a real gear. <br /> <br /> Most of the clever schtick who made the original show funny is missing from this movie. Instead, we get a clumsy ex-police dog that is even thicker than Cad. And a few pet owners who add nothing to the story. Cheesy effects (the dog-talking animation is embarrassing). Poor dissertation. A stereotype dwarf plays Simon Bar Sinister. The gravel man who hired them to vote is Underdog painful. You'd think they'd at least have got a voice impressionist to approach Wally Cox's humorous distinctive voice to Underdog. But no. There are at least some loving references to the source material (such as the rhymes), which makes it a 4th light. <br /> <br /> Only small kids who love dogs can enjoy it. Everyone else should get a DVD of the original cartoon. Just look it in despair.
