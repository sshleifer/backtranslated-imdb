Seagal was far from the point with this movie. I am a fan of his and expect to expect cool combat scenes and sharp one liners, but this film had none of this, but it had injections and cheese music. Even if you are a fan of her, I strongly advise you to stay away from this movie and watch the siege or even deadly ground.
