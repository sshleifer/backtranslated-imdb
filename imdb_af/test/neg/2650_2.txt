To quote a critic's review of the movie, "it started slowly and stopped." The plot was credible enough (although some of the characters' actions were very, very RANDOM), the writing was pretty well written (because the dialogue wasn't forced), but everything went too slowly. There were too many breaks between lines, and the way the lines were delivered was not so good. This movie had potential, but it sounded like a teenager who changed drugs. My advice? Wait for it to come on TV before you see it.
