Producers of this movie should be sued for the misrepresentation of copyright material, namely the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Players Handbook. Fear and ignorance break the kind of mindless propaganda that inspires garbage like this movie. If any of you have any doubts about the innocence of Dungeons & Dragons, why not go to your local hobby shop and see if you are in a gambling group so you can see that D & D is nothing to fear be for.
