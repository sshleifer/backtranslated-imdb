The first half of this movie was pretty good. It was interesting and exciting. The second half was pretty bad. The story of the story of the cartoon came full circle and we see many comic Nazi characters and some bad behavior "good guys" blow them away. There is a lot of violence in this movie. I'm not worried about violence, but I think it should have at least some purpose in a movie. There was little purpose for the violence here, except to create a genre film where we see many people being cut with guns. We are somehow supposed to be amused by this. <br /> <br /> I recently watched Reservoir Dogs. There was a movie where violence was effectively employed. It was realistic in the world that created the movie. There was never an over-the-top sound effect. It was a crime movie that played it straight. Inglorious Basterds had to play it straight, but didn't. I threw my eyes on how the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra dots on the head and face. <br /> <br /> None of the backgrounds of any of the Basterds are really explained, it's just Nazi hunters. We do not really touch any of them, because they are too busy cutting scales and shooting people in the face. It's all about "revenge" and very little. <br /> <br /> There were 2 1/2 hours to work here, but little of the Basterds are really in depth investigation. It seemed to be just a vengeance, pure and simple. We saw it in Tarantino's last movie, "Death Proof", to which I also did not go. It suffered the same problems. The characters were almost changeable. <br /> <br /> The first half was pretty good. I wanted to see the benefits of the Inglorious Basterds in Europe. I was presented with a much louder film about the resistance movement that makes revenge against some comic Nazis when they all go to a movie movie in France.
