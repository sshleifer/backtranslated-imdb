Aksar is a horrible movie. The writing, the story, the acting are all just laughing. Dino Morea plays a man who pays Emraan Hashmi to deceive his wife. Yes, it is as ridiculous as it sounds. Both Morea and Hashmi offer incredible and indifferent bad acting. Udita Goswami plays the aggressive, capricious and fierce woman. She is beautiful but has zero-acting talent. The film has one hit song called "Jhalak Diklaja" composed and sung by Himesh Reshammiya. I could never understand the hype around this song, because I never found it very good, even though it was catchy. The movie is supposed to be a thrill, but it looks rather like a cartoon, due to the terrible direction and writing. Avoid this cheap at any cost.
