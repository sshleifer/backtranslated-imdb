Although Humphrey Bogart received star bill in King Of The Underworld, I'm prepared to bet he didn't thank Jack Warner for it. In fact, this film was a hollow crown. <br /> <br /> The underworld king was probably a remake of the Paul Muni film, Dr. Socrates, but since Humphrey Bogart was in the role, the character was written more. Duke Mantee In The Petrified Forest. He even has an English writer in the person of James Stephenson. <br /> <br /> Kay Francis and John Eldredge are some married doctors and Eldredge is doing some surgery on one of Bogart's henchmen. Bogey is a man who appreciates good work on his behalf and gives Eldredge $ 500.00 and there's more to come from when he plays his cards right. Eldredge who has a gambling problem is a great way to get unprecedented revenue. <br /> <br /> But when he is killed in an attack on the gang's hideout, Francis is also involved in the law and the American Medical Association, irrespective of whether she disputes her innocence. It's not good, and she and her aunt, Jessie Busley, move to a small town to get away from the infamous. <br /> <br /> Of course, the celebrity and Bogart and a traveling Leslie Howard as writer in Stephenson are all doing her again. But Kay is brave and resourceful to say the least. Bogart's character was ridiculous, no wonder the poor guy shouted for better parts. He is a gunman who pushes both people down without mercy and only gives his lips his followers. He is worried about his image and thus denies the author Stephenson to haunt him, writes his autobiography and, of course, he admits enough to burn him in all 48 states. And then, let Kay Francis completely dismantle him, hard to believe he was something of the king. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the lesser works for one of the stars.
