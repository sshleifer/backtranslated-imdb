1st watched 1/1/2003 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Henri Verneuil): Sober drama about a good doctor who is in trouble with a relationship with a younger woman, bringing in his family to live with they, as well as being married to another in the same household. His search for happiness is not clear, but they bring the reason for his unhappiness pretty well by showing the remaining trait of the women in his wife's line. Well played, but predictable drama.
