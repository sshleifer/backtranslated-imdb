For native Mongolian speakers, the film lacks emotion and emphasis. Use too many non-native speakers, especially Jamukha. Too many deviations from actual history. Terrible terrible caption !!! I wonder where and who did that caption. It was both in English and Thai. I wonder how bad the subtitles were in Thai if the English caption was so bad! Describes one of the greatest leader's life, very uninteresting. Better films were made by Mongolian directors with a very low budget from 1980s. Honestly, I wonder if the film critics of the Academy Award are so nice or what? Only good thing was some good CGI in some fighting scenes just moderate ... not about the top CGI
