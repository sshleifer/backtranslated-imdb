Frankie Muniz plays Jason who is a high school student. His biggest problem is that his life is built on small or big lies that puts him in trouble most times. However, he cannot escape from his teacher and complete his creative writing homework just before his deadline. As he quickly cycles to give his homework to the teacher, he smashes a car. As he explains the situation in the car to the grumpy man (Giamatti), he gives him a lift to his school. But the problem is that Jason leaves his homework, otherwise Marty Wolf (Giamatti) says it steals. <br /> <br /> After a few months Jason goes to a movie and sees a trailer needed to surprise him. Because the story of the movie is based on his homework. He told his parents, but they didn't believe him. Especially his father used words that insulted him. Jason decides to go to LA and find Wolf to tell his father that Jason is not a liar. When Wolf refuses, Jason takes action and ruins his life. <br /> <br /> This is the short story of the Big Fat Liar. Well, as a children's movie it might be a light heart, but there are mistakes that can even ask if it's possible. As having such a small amount of money and going to LA with a friend to sort out the problem, have access to the highly protected home and office of this cinema producer, a telecommunication system sets overnight. Is it credible? It doesn't. Well, it's a children's movie, but children aren't so believing. <br /> <br /> Big Fat Liar offers some fun to his target audience. Unfortunately I'm not a big fat liar to say it's a good movie. ** from *****
