I enjoyed a lot of Bruce Almighty, but the moment I found out there would be a prosecution WITHOUT Jim Carey, I knew it was bad. Although Steve Carell was hysterical in the first movie (the babbling scene is one of my favorites), I think an Emmy deserves his role in The Office, he's pretty poor in this dull comedy. I'm curious how much work the writing writers have, because we can do just as well without the story. But even if we throw the big plot holes (why did elephants and lions come to Evan when flooding just that particular area of ​​Washington), the movie is simply ... not funny. I didn't even laugh and as far as I remember, a comedy is supposed to make you laugh. Or at least giggle. Not this one. <br /> <br /> There is little hope, however. Evan Almighty has a family written about it, and maybe a family show can be enjoyable (kids can be entertained by the variety of animals and the crazy jokes), but for me, Evan Almighty, it simply doesn't cut. br /> <br /> I give it a 4/10 and hope Carell will be careful when choosing his roles in the feature.
