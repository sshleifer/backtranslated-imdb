I read the newspaper reviews of this movie and I have to say that my expectations were very low before I watched Ocean's 12. I really enjoyed the first movie, but this successor is one of the worst movies ever. I would rate this top 5 of the worst movie I've ever seen. Why do I say this? First, there is such a story that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. The fragments that can be assigned the term "story" are sometimes held together, but most of the time, the movie does not move for any purpose or drive. The whole story seems to be forced and the writing around the story is even more forced to go on occasion. <br /> <br /> The actors appear but do nothing to earn any credit or appreciation. Most embarrassing are the top ladies (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) who are over-performing or extremely simple. Damon, Clooney and Pitt aren't brilliant either. To be honest I really don't understand how they are associated with something as bad as this movie. <br /> <br /> May contain spoilers ==== Camera and editing, sigh where to start. There are many unnecessary camera movements that just make the experience painful. Combine it with very inactive editing and start looking for a wooden spoon to carve your heart out. Especially the scene where the whole gang is moved out of jail to be transported by car. The camera's zoom to each one just gets boring and when you get to number 3 of 12, you get the message: wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects - NOT. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) playing Julia Roberts is supposed to be funny, but it just gets very embarrassing and turns away to prevent you from experiencing the mess. Bruce Willis. Why? Please explain it to me! WHY ??? <br /> <br /> Taking ... if you have to choose between root canal work and Ocean's 12, I recommend the former. Make sure they do all the teeth while you are there.
