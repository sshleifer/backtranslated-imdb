I know that Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and spoof them in every single episode of South Park (if they are not shown and then they call them) and they like to mock and joke and also of themselves to enjoy, but I have gone this mockumentary feeling too far. <br /> <br /> For one thing, the most common running theme in the "documentary" is that their episodes are crap-significant and just bring them out for the money. Obviously this is completely untrue if you even save an episode, and the constant "You know, I learned something today ..." was said by the main characters at the end of almost every episode. The creators are also portrayed as pompous, arrogant asses who just care about money, including a supposed but funny-but-is-the-scene in which Isaac Hayes lines for Chef (over the phone) and Trey Parker shouts at him to suck and hang up. I think it's supposed to be funny, but the pretense in it really made it ... The way they interviewed employees working for Trey and Matt shows the duo as tyrants who stamp their employees to the limit , just for money, in the end. Quite untrue, of course, and already a joke, but it's not funny. It's alarming, even if it's just a joke.
