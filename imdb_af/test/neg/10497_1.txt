Amazingly, "Vampire Assassin" is considerably worse than such atrocities as "Tequila Body Shots" and "Zombie Nation" - and those movies are terrible. Author / director / star Ron Hall is unaware of both charisma and acting ability, and is also clearly unable to understand the most basic guidelines. Possibly the worst camera work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and battle choreography I've ever seen in a movie. Rarely shoot two shots and you can't see much in the illuminated lighting. The terrible dialogue is uttered extremely slowly by a very undoubted role, stretching the film to an almost deadly 87 minutes. It's a very nice embarrassment for everyone involved. Obviously, aficionados of horrible movie production want to see it, but it's very hard to go through, no matter how bad a movie viewer you have experienced. The fact that Ron Hall thought it was actually detachable is amazing. If you are a movie director and you actually think it's good for the opening credits of your movie to include some frames of the words SLUG before the title appears, leave your rough editing - and you can't seem to gather energy. Of course, to point out those frames - then your standards are so low that they are offensive. I'm surprised the Lions Gate / Maple agreed to release this movie on DVD. Despite Rudy Ray Moore's very short comedy, this movie is a work of selflessness on Ron Hall's part. He thinks he is a formidable actor and must also believe that he has superior writing and government skills, but the movie is so incredibly unclear that it is difficult to believe that he really wants people to see it for fear that they pronounced brutally as I do now. A jaw-dropping, crazy movie. I'm not joking.
