Critics fall within the Weinstein sphere of influence to praise this ugly, misleading and repulsive adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it is based. Minghella's ham-fisted direction of the distinctive gory and shrill exaggerated episodic odyssey is one of the many misconceptions of this "civil war love story". Are they joking? After Mrs. Kidman and Mr. Law in a small North Carolina town met with zero-screen chemistry and steals a coast before being left for Jude and his girlfriend's photo memorial, it's a two-hour test for the kidneys. whether he will survive a myriad of near-death experiences to reunite with his soul mate. Who cares? Philip S. Hoffman's amateurist scene chilling in a disgusting and unpredictable role strikes Renee Zelweger's appearance as a wheat-fed dinamo that miraculously erupted at Kidman's lonely farm to save the day. Rarely did a show shout of "look at me, I'm doing" smugness. Her bare evasive nerve awakens the lung diapers for a few minutes until the blower is painfully thin. The Weinsteins are apparently along with Dick Clark, the critical community, and released 8 Globe nominations for their remaining failure by Miramax Strategies for Oscar and Golden Globe (which is a farce). The resulting crime is that awards have become meaningless and small, less powerful PR-driven films become obscure. Cold Mountain is a concept film and an empty, bitter waste of time. Cold indeed !!!
