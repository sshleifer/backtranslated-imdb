I was a classic horror of my whole life. Numerous nights stretch to the early hours and watch the Universal movies on "Horror Incorporated" and "Creature Feature Night". Unfortunately, I watched this movie in the early evening and yet I was still sleeping. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever seen a "horror" picture where everything has mattered. . Dr Edelmann does not seem to believe in the supernatural, but before long he had Dracula medically treated and Larry Talbot turned into the Wolfman while he barely blinked. He and Talbot discover the Frankenstein monster as it is an everyday appearance. Edelmann was all fired to bring the monster back, but after Talbot, Miliza and Nina he protested like 'Aww, you're right. After the realization of Dracula's betrayal, he opens the spade's coffin for sunlight and POOF! He's not like that. <br /> <br /> The only person who didn't seem to call just in her lines was Jane Adams as Nina. Her reward is put at the end of the film by the Frankenstein monster at the end of the film from the back of her back. And nobody even tries to save her! She, dr. Edelmann and the Monster are all about, while Talbot and Miliza release the castle. <br /> <br /> Definitely the lower point for Universal during the classic horror years.
