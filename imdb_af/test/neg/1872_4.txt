Just caught "The Rain People" at Turner Classic Movies late one night. The film was released in 1969. Shirley Knight star as Natalie, a Long Island housewife, who - exactly reasons unknown - leaves her husband and starts on a road trip, without knowing exactly where she is going. Natalie is also new pregnant, which complicates things. Along the way, she picks up a brain-damaged ex-soccer player, "Jimmy" (James Caan), who was kicked out of his school and hitchhiking. There are many turns and turns along the road between these two, as Natalie struggles to look after Jimmy and she begins to realize he is spiritually limited and cannot take care of himself. She goes through her own struggle, unnecessary to say, and in no position to care for him. Natalie seems to be a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown at times; She made some strange calls to her husband, who ordered her to come home. Natalie tries to shuffle Jimmy several times, just to return him through her circumstances. A young Robert Duvall plays a strange and troubled policeman who befriends Natalie. You get the whole feeling that this movie is going to end badly and do it. This film is definitely uneven, and the writing is somewhat lacking. Francis Ford Coppola managed it and of course he will soon be renowned for The Godfather in the next few years. The actors are good, needless to say, as they will all have future in the future. Shirley Knight is the least known of the three, although she is also underestimated as an actor. James Caan is especially effective here and he seems to live only this character. This movie is little more than a curiosity, as it is an early film by Coppola's, and I admit I never heard it. So God bless Turner Classic Movies to bring it to a new audience.
