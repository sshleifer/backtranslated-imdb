-So the poor excuse for a story in the generic loss of time involves a man who wants to be an animator, but can't get his career off the ground. His super-hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to make him a loser, but the man is not happy with it and wants to make more of his life. One day their dog brings them a magical mask that changes his life. Unfortunately for him the god Loki is looking for his magical mask and as soon as he gets the man with the mask, he tries to get it back and that's the whole story. If it was exciting for you, then someone throwing water on you should wake you up. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. There really is no other way to say it and I just can't stretch it enough. The only good thing about the whole thing was the lady Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot, but apart from her, there's nothing about this movie worth watching. I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic, but what about the adults who have to take their kids to see this trash. Why should we suffer from this dirty vomit bag of terrible shit. The original mask was a very good movie that told a great mix of comedy and a good story. This one is a lame effort by hack filmmakers to set cash on the franchise and judge by the ridiculous BO gross. I guess the franchise will stop going. <br /> <br /> The cinematographer must be badly beaten because the sweet colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up. If there was music, I didn't pay attention because I already broke my eardrums to prevent me from hearing the horde dialogue. Then there's the acting or at least acting for today. you can watch an infomercial and see it much better than the one in this movie, but I can't really blame the actors as it is the director who deserves the debt, apparently he did not realize that the actors king had to do not take. If a new line wants to start a franchise, they have to upload their game by signing up writers who can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will see a shit coming out. <br /> <br /> - Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love yourself to torture. Please do it because it is painful to watch, but if you are not and you really want to watch movies that are good, avoid it at all costs.
