After a long, hard night at the Walkabout in Islington, I needed a pickup. My throat hurt, my wallet was empty and I finally talked to a drug addict at a bus stop to sell me some petrol. Today I watched "Red Sonja" and I can honestly say that I feel much better last night than I do now. Brigitte Nielsen leads a lot of ass-kicking fighters in various shapes and sizes to restore a green rock to an evil queen whose motives are never fully explained. Yes, it's so good. <br /> <br /> "Red Sonja" is not in a genre known for good movies, until Peter Jackson came with a certain Oscar-winning trilogy. In fact, the best sword-and-wizard movie I can think of before "Lord Of The Rings" was George Lucas's kiddie-friendly Willow. Perhaps, in the light of this, you should go a little on this movie. But I can't - it is poorly written, acted poorly (with the exception of Paul Smith, who is just average) and terribly composed. The film is as convincing as an episode of the Flintstones, with costumes and scenery apparently being lifted straight out of Bedrock. Taking into account the cartoon source material, it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies. Why Sonja insists on saving the most annoying child in this world or one is confusing. His personality seems to spoil from spoiled brat to polite man on the cut of a switch. Schwarzenegger shows less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the movements, a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in "The Terminator". <br /> <br /> It is easy to kick a movie when you are off, but the fact remains that it is not a good movie, by any imagination. When Nielsen grieves her sister's death and Schwarzenegger puts his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then protrudes into that characteristic Germanic accent, "she is dead", then you know you're a rough ride. A few smiles were raised at inappropriate points, such as the priestesses of a temple who, when pressed into a hole in the ground after their death, found the experience - at least, judging by the orgasmic moons that the place is coming. If you have to see an 80-year-old fantasy film that's not porn, look 'Willow' (but it should never be a lazy endorsement). For the right thing, take yourself to your local plywood and show Peter Jackson what he did with 'Lord Of The Rings'. Trust me, 11 Oscars really means it's a good movie - unlike bloody "Titanic".
