"TNT Jackson" is not completely incompatible. But either the version I watched on DVD has been edited with a weed-whacker, or the script itself is the lowest level of grind-house / blaxploitation wors. Or maybe both. <br /> <br /> At one stage in her career, Jeanne Bell should be a Playmate, and the film makes the most of the connection by showing her breasts at least twice as much as she really needed. (including a hilarious topless battle scene I'm pretty sure about, was meant to be funny). I will admit that they are very beautiful. Still, she's kind of average looking and doesn't have the charisma of a Foxy Brown, or even a Cleopatra Jones. She did have her moments as an actress in the film, but it would have been nice if the director squeezed her a little harder or the script gave her a chance to do more than kick people and people. br /> <br /> Speaking, the battle scenes (the other supposed reason to watch such a movie) are very poorly done. There is no real choreography to speak of here, only people who hold on and fist bump the general direction of their opponents. One small exception is a nice moment with an opponent equipped with butterfly folding knives; another is a drive near the end where a clear stunt doubles for Bell (and maybe for Stan Shaw) and does a few minutes or two proper sweeps and groundwork before Bell / Jackson emits her finger's deliver, Shaw falls together. and the script doesn't stop. (Again, I will admit that it is much in the Shaw brother's tradition, since the ages of centuries). <br /> <br /> There are some supporting actors who are actually better than the movie deserves (I'm thinking of "Joe" and the fellow who plays the drug's right hand). There is a halfway decent funk-loaded soundtrack that complements the on-screen action and adds a star to the rating itself. There is a semi-dodgy sex scene that manages to be effective, in spite of itself. <br /> <br /> This one is strict for blaxploitation hardcore fans. I saw it out of curiosity, and I'm not sorry I took the time. But I can't imagine taking the time to see it again, unless I decide to write a dissertation on the pop culture crossings of Kung Fu Theater and Foxy Brown.
