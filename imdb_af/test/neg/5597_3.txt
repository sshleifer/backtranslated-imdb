Having seen the movie in my class and chatting with the filmmaker, I got exactly why the movie bombed the way it did. The creators of the movie were not going to call the movie "8MM 2". Originally called the movie The Velvet Side of Hell, it was last modified by Sony Pictures at 8MM 2 without talking to the filmmakers. In doing so, they have been screwed out of theatrical releases and doomed to a straightforward video release with minimal advertising. <br /> <br /> Again, it's from the filmmaker's mouth, not mine, so I really can't say what's the truth, and what's hype. <br /> <br /> Looking at the movie "Velvet Side of Hell," it's not that bad. It's not good, but it's not godly. It would basically just be a B movie that would like to show boobs. But as a sequel to "8MM," the movie failed terribly.
