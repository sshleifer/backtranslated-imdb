* Some Possible Spoilers * <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie can't be expected to be as good as the original. Remakes are rare. But this remake of one of Hitchcock's greatest films, Psycho, could have been much better. <br /> <br /> First of all, everyone who has played the movie must be psycho. I mean, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What they think ?! Unlike the "harmless", almost childlike assets that Anthony Perkins was able to portray, Vaughn seems to be a killer. In an effort to make his assets appear, it seems innocent that Vaughn is gay playing. Many of the other actors also did not choose their parts, including Julianne Moore, who not only appears in the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the horrifying casting film, filmmaking is particularly inaccurate, despite the fact that they made the play for the scene. The one thing they added is random shots of objects such as clouds or a naked woman, among the shots of characters being killed. These shots were in any case irrelevant to the plot and, in turn, had no sense. <br /> <br /> Overall, this psycho-remake, which could be a decent picture, apparently became a total waste of time.
