Total rubbish !!! No reflection on Washington heights so ever. If I had four arms, I gave it four stupid paths. Acting performance worst as storyline. Actually over graded. Hour and a half of visual torture. Rather look at Ben Aflec movies for the rest of my life. Feel bad for the movies that have lost this crap. What were the judges watching at the film festival?
