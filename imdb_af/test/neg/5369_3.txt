"Paranormal state" is an interesting display for most paranormal believers. I enjoy watching what the "team" has to say and what they "find," but I know that the whole show along with its build up and story lines is completely set up. They go to real ghostly places and I suspect they are talking to real witnesses. I usually feel when I see it, that I don't watch fiction, but a real movie that is contrary to reality. Personally, I would not recommend or recommend this show unless you are a basic scammer. <br /> <br /> Interesting display. Stick to "Ghost Hunters"
