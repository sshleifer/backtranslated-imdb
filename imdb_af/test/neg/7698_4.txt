Ridley Scott is one of the best directors and producers these days and can command huge amounts of helmets, especially as he has films like Alien, Gladiator and Blame Runner. So from this partial list of credits, it goes without saying that he is a wonderful talent. However, if you look at this very early attempt that he made in film school, you'll probably find it hard to tell that he was destined for greatness. This is because, although it has a beautiful camera work and style, the movie is hopelessly boring and unimportant. However, since it was not meant for general release and it was just a training ground, I am convinced to look it charitably - so the score of 4. <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie is part of the CINEMA 16: European Shorts DVD. On this DVD are 16 shorts. Most are not good, but because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT HEAD, COPY, RABBIT and WASP, it is a great DVD for short film lovers and worth buying.
