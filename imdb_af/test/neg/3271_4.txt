Perhaps, like most others who have seen this movie long after being put on television, I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and dark form, which is exactly what Slow Burn is. Except for the nostalgic value, the movie itself is not very good. <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts plays former reporter Jacob Ash, who was appointed by a Gerald McMurty (Raymond J. Barry), a wealthy artist, to investigate. the whereabouts of his estranged son, Brian, who lived with his mother, Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) for the past few years. In a Phillip Marlowe esquire fashion, Jacob Ash tells us more than just an investigation into Brian's abode. But as soon as Jacob unloads Laine, his discoveries break open wide, much trouble. Perhaps because events in the movie are moving too slowly, there is never so much tension for this little thriller, even at the end with the final routine of revealing the culprits and their motives. <br /> <br /> But, as said before, this movie is probably one that highlighted the then relatively unknown role players, both very young Eric Roberts as well as the adorable Johnny Depp, who Laine's stepson, Donnie, play, include. It might be enough to try it ... if you can find it.
