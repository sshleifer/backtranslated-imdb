I didn't think this movie was very good. In fact, they took a bunch of one-liners from several Shirley Temple movies, threw them together, and Orr acted like Shirley Temple on the screen. "Oh my good!" was said quite a few times. If you are familiar with Shirley Temple movies, you will recognize several rules from her movies. The problem is they are saying it in Shirley's everyday life. In the end, what we get is a hodgepodge of Shirley Temple movies created again, rather than any kind of real-life look at Shirley Temple's life. Save yourself the trouble and hire Shirley Temple movies, it's better to see if Orr is trying to recreate Shirley's acting style.
