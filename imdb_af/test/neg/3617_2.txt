Don't waste your time. One of the cool boxes you pick up at Blockbuster, but not even worth it. You won't say, "It's so bad, it's good." Just, "It's bad." The Biggest American Hero is a writer who hires an African Island cabin called Snake Island. Some other tourists are on the boat who drop him, but they are not on the island. They just stop there to leave the writer out. Then the boat was stranded there, and - in true Hollywood originality - the only radio on the island was banned. So they start to walk around and see a bunch of snakes. Like hundreds of them, who really got annoying and you knew the plot would go nowhere. It's not as if there was ever one main snake. Like a giant mutated snake or an extra poisonous king of all snakes. Instead, there are just a bunch of ham and egg snakes of all kinds. Their only purpose was to escape the island ... as opposed to the victory of the enemy. Because there were so many snakes, you knew they couldn't possibly try to kill them all, and they didn't try. I saw a similar movie where a village was played by snakes and they lead all the snakes into a cave and blow it up. At least you get the feeling that the good guys killed the bad guys and that was a normal ending. In the Snake Island (by the way, every character was shocked to see snakes on the island ... duhhhhh, it's NAMED Snake Island for a reason), there was no other plan than to get gas for the stupid boat no. Oh, they never get gas on their way. They just happened to find another boat on the island that had already thrown up.
