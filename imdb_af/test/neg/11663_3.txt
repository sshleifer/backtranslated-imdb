"Delusion" is what you experience when you watch this movie and then believe you have seen something worthwhile. This movie, which tells of a trio of semi-psychic travelers who aren't good anywhere in the CA desert, is amateurish and just stupid. The movie suffers from a horrible story, a common script, and a few terrible directions to name just a few of the shortcomings. If the movie does something about it, it is the same performance of B-movie diva Rubin. Don't waste your time on this turkey. (D)
