The movie starts well enough. It is a frightening scene as some refugees tear off the law, an innocent family living in a secluded mansion, killing the mother and father. The young girl only succeeds in escaping using a mysterious ghost that kills the two aggressors as she covers a lower case. Then we arrive 15 years later as a drug addict who lives the supernatural investigation, with her ravenous aunt and cared for by a mysterious redhead. She has no real friends, is almost raped at a party and holds bizarre visions that no one else can see. So yes, life is great. Things get much nicer when she falls out with her mother's sister, who is later found dead in a bath under suspicious circumstances, with 11 in her forehead. Hmm, I wonder who the police's main suspect will be? It is quickly followed by more deaths, everything related to their relationship with our heroines was poor with them before they passed. Could she be the culprit or maybe the statement could be something of a more ethereal nature? Clue: When you think of the former, you picked up the wrong blockbuster movie. Go back and get the right one, short-sighted gimp. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was ready to move quickly to the good parts, safe in the knowledge that I didn't miss Nothing but a mediocre suspension pot boiler. But the first ten minutes grabbed me and I decided to give it a chance. I was quite pleasantly surprised: it was definitely not a masterpiece, but the play was good enough and the writing sparked intriguing situations I was looking to find the solution. Unfortunately, 45 minutes in, I realized that my attention began to wander during a long drive where the main character walked into a library, doing nothing. We then get a cheap scare, followed by a quarter of wickedness over the paranormal between her and her new boyfriend's hunger. Things just got worse, because the promise is starting to throw out the window, as we are turning an infinite plot to another, ending with such an anti-climate, it's like promising the moon and instead of ending up with a teenage meteorite. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> If it was poor all the way through, it would have been much easier to swallow. The fact that it starts at a canter and hardly ends with a throat is not only disappointing, it is heartbreaking. How can something so promising be so formative? I don't know, and I don't care. I'll give the writer and director a little advice next time: Don't spend 5 weeks writing the first part of your script, then 5 minutes to complete the rest. You tend to notice these things in the final product when you treat your project as sloppy as here ... 3/10
