This film, by its main player, states that the world is essentially sad and painful and those who ignore it have blinders. One can argue whether this is true or not. But even if you accept it as true, the film's A) disputes it by saying that it can be a bit good in tragic situations or B) forget about it and use a flattened mount to make the audience feel excited. <br /> <br /> The film metaphorically releases its main character by presenting it as a sympathetic character, despite any evidence for that sympathy, showing contempt for the supporting characters who were the most compelling in the film. <br /> <br /> So what you got in this movie is a script that is not consistent in its theme and direction that does not bring the end to the rest of the movie. There are excellent performances given by each cast member, especially Spacey, Olin, Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson. It is a pity that they were not supported by a better writer / director.
