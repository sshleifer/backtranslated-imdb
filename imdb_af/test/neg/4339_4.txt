A clever overall story / place for a story. Action is respectful. The children are annoying and their motivation is unclear. The foremost villain was a good change, but could have been better. "I love you" was more over-told than "you finish me" but at least Van Damme had the chance to show some tenderness. One of Van Damme's better movies.
