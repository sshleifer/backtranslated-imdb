Lina McLaidlaw is a bright, lonely young woman who falls in love with Johnnie Aysgarth, a highly qualified bachelor with a love of losing money. They marry, but almost immediately, Lina is subjected to Johnnie's addiction to lie, gambling and debt. In spite of her defects, she can't resist his charming way until she starts to suspect he can have murderous thoughts about her ... <br /> <br /> It's a good movie, well done, with " a stylish throw, a good writing and possibly some of the finest ending in film history. Well, it may be too far, but not much. Many of the films change the end of a book (Great Expectations, The Shining, etc.), but the last two scenes of this one are not only annoyed, but also make the entire preceding plot completely meaningless. The story is about a woman whose husband is missing out on his greed and moral missing - and what she knows about him - to kill her. It must end (as in Francis Iles / Anthony Berkeley's book Before the Fact) with him trying to kill her. The reason for this is not that the studio Hitch had to resume the end, one of the first examples of the divine process of preview hearing testing. Hitch was canny and did what he said (it was his only movie in Hollywood). He knew he would be able to control the game sooner or later, which was invented by his fifties masterpieces. But it still leaves us with a turkey from an end. It's a great shame because it's really a very good movie with an intriguing theme. Does anyone really know their husband or wife? The script is excellent, with very anticipating moments (such as when Lina's father dies and Johnnie accepts that she is crying about it), a finely-rated performance by Grant (who never played again) and fine photography throughout the well-known glass of -melk shot. Fontaine won an Oscar for this show, though I personally chose her confusion and vulnerability in her earlier gender roles in Rebecca. I want to review this movie higher, but I can't really forgive it; That's what happens when movies are made for money, not love, which I guess, is strangely the theme of the movie itself. Quickly look for Hitchcock's cameo as a man posting a letter.
