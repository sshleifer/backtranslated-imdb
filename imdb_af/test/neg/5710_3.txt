The only reason I bought the DVD was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when Liz (Kim Basinger) responded to Joe Cocker's music: You can leave your hat! It was the best part of the whole movie. Not because the scene was good; just the song. I'm not saying it was a very bad movie, just as well. Disappointingly so! <br /> <br /> Especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality could be expanded. Instead of expanding on the dangerous side of lust, obsession and imagination and where it can lead, his heels are unclear from one idea to another. For example, when John (played by Rourke) can leave her on the top of the Big Wheel, Liz (Kim Basinger) is relentlessly aggrieved by the bizarre experience based on John's sense of humor, but less curled about his sexual exploitation that the eternal ever willingly entails Liz; and as one reader has said, it is unconvincing for a woman to enjoy sex, to experience the dangerous side. This "dangerous" side is not exploited enough in the film and one gets a sense of anti-climax from the point of view that it can all be terribly wrong. The theme of slavery often makes an appearance, but only takes one to the edge of the danger and then everything goes well. Is the movie sent the message that this kind of "predict" is FINE! If the film made a point about the pitfalls of slavery and the ugly branches of sad-masochism, then it might be a good moral point. Instead, the movie jumps uncomfortably from a "hissing" scene of Rourke's nutrition Basinger and ties her to the other. In a movie that might have been good, it falls flat on its face, as it doesn't expand and expands the themes that the film may be trying to relate to. so for me it doesn't have a plot or theme, but just a mix of ideas.
