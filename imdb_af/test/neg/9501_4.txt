Underwoods goofy story about a young man (Arquette) convincing his friends that they are Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas) must be kidnapped. The film is ridiculously written, the direction is strange, the dialogue is off-side and the rudder, the actors have not done much justice, Arquette is annoying throughout, Ian Nicholas was non-existent, Macy was decent but just because she " A pretty good actor and probably just doing his best not to come out of this project with a total embarrassment, he was at least acceptable. It's a stupid movie in my eyes, sometimes boring, not entertaining, just a movie I wouldn't recommend to anyone. IMDb Rating: 5.5, my rating: 4/10
