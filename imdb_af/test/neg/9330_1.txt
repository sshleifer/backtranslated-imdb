How does a movie become a biblical epic? By simply quoting a few Scriptures and using some names from the Bible for your characters? The only thing that Bibles was about this epic was the names of the characters. Oh, I almost forgot the 3 kingdoms, Israel, Egypt and Saba were also used. Where did King Vidor get the rest of his story? It certainly wasn't from the Bible. It was complete and utter nonsense. If you want to read about Solomon's government as king in Israel, then read 1 Kings 1-11 and 2 Chronicles 1-9. You will even come to Adonijah in 1 Kings 1 and 2. The Queen of Saba, who does not come to King Solomon, has been king for twenty years, and it has long since been Adonijah and Joab. dead) can be found in 1 Kings 10 and 2 Chronicles 9. One of the first things Solomon does is make an affinity with Pharoah by taking his daughter. <br /> <br /> Yes, King Solomon became involved in the worship of false gods and therefore the kingdom was divided after his death, and not the temple is destroyed by lightning. Also, I think Solomon was too busy marrying and giving temples to the false gods of his 700 wives and fighting his 300 concubines to fight Egypt, let alone a dead brother. <br /> <br /> As I said this movie was totally nonsense. If you don't use the story in the Bible, call it something else. It could just as easily be called Romeo & Juliet or Sid & Nancy. <br /> <br />
