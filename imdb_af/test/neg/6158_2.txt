This movie fails at many different levels. The writing is the first to fail, and as I understand it, if the script stinks, there is nothing that can solve it. The plot is boring, after the first 45 minutes I look at the counter on the DVD and tell myself, "how much longer?" The cinematography is pretty terrible. I'm not sure how bad the transfer to DVD was, but it looks like a VHS copy. The sound was also bad. I realize it's not going to be fixed for 5.1, but it didn't even swear as it was in Dolby Stereo, which has been almost a decade since they cut this movie. <br /> <br /> Slipstream was far too similar to both Mad Max and Blade Runner for comfort. Due to the lack of proper special effects and high quality dialogue, it is extremely disappointing. If I remember, the wiser scene took place during the last 20 minutes, usually it should take place in the first 20 minutes. Most people will be completely confused about what the arrow goes on until the last 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The movie's music was excellent in parts, and then completely inappropriate in others. Elmer Bernstien scored the score, but it looks like someone else is holding a hand in "other" stuff elsewhere, because it doesn't match the overall good orchestra party (with some synthesizing music.) <br /> <br / > There were big actors, Bob Peck, Mark Hamill, Ben Kingsley, Bill Paxton. And they did a good job of breathing the small available life into their characters. (Well, Paxton's character was pretty stupid and the whole movie was centered on him. I'm not sure a heroic sting is a good choice for the main character wearing the movie.) Another big mistake with the script . br /> <br /> Thanks, I watched it from a mail order DVD service, not the theater. Overall a big disappointment for Sci-fi fans, or fans of Paxton, or Hamill. 90 minutes of your life, you will never come back.
