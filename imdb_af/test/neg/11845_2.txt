The biggest and most disturbing thing about the Raptor movie ended up being that the Tyransaurus is identical to Carnosaur, except that the child in the loader performed a little better and then was the adult. The similarities with the Carnosaur films were rather poor in plot line selection. The only thing that approached well was the start of the kids in the jeep. Then the plot pulled off from there. Would have been nice if another plot was designed, rather than cloning the previous movies. The raptor movie had to take lessons from Jurasic parks in several plots. The only movie that has recently come close to a good dinosaur movie is Aztec Rex. The repeated scenes of the Carnosaur movies remind you of those movies.
