Oh, I'm usually not the kind of person to give a movie less than 5 points. Mostly, just because of the efforts of actors and directors. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for Keyman from me. If someone thinks that the main character (or anyone) deserves an Oscar, I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. <br /> <br /> Serious. I can't believe this movie made it to Europe. The acting was terrible, the plot was terrible and what about the 70's horror music. Give me a break. <br /> <br /> "Popeye" e.g. What about him? Why is he there, he has nothing to do with the movie. <br /> <br /> And what about the Keyman's talk. Once he can't say a decent word, next time he gets all the talk. He also almost dies when he wakes up and shines sunlight through his bunker. But if he walks in the street, the sunlight doesn't seem to do anything. <br /> <br /> Just look at this movie because you are about to die of boredom. I regret not watching my roses grow, which is more entertaining than this piece anyway ...
