Mainly a biography of a funny doctor, Robert Merivel, (Robert Downey) who goes into the king's palace for the first half of the film and then helps the oppressed in the second half, especially "Katharine" (Meg Ryan) . <br /> <br /> The GOOD - Fantastic set of decoration (ie the lush king's palace) and costume make it a visual surprise. The language is also very tame. Ian McKellen and Hugh Grant offer interesting support. <br /> <br /> The BAD - After 50-60 minutes, this movie just sows. It should desperately get a little spark after an hour, but it does the opposite: it pulls on and off. The script definitely needs a bad need for "recovery", would we say? The movie may look good, but it takes a long time to sit for two hours.
