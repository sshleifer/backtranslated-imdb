I love a good Western movie, but it was more like a play on stage or an act at the local street carnival program. I could only stand 38 minutes of it hoping it would improve, but it just got worse and I had to end it. Each actor (s) indicated the lines as if they were reading directly from the screenplay or map cards. There was too much predictability for the lines and actions, not as if it were a natural look or conversation. The wig on Rachel Kimsey was obvious. The actresses playing Native American sisters could have played and should have non-native parts. Wardrobe for Native Americans could have been better and a little more authentic looking. If I decide to see it with any friends in the future, I will do so, not with the expectation of a good Western look, but with the expectations of watching an amateur comedy film production.
