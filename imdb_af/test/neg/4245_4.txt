This movie was a painful attempt to recreate a critical time in English history. The movie version of Cromwell's increasing involvement in the War is marginally accurate, but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was far away. This film implies that the war on religious differences has begun, but the Civil War was by no means Catholic to Protestants: both sides were Protestants. Cromwell was never present at the Battle of Edgehill and never saved the day. The royalty did not win, the battle ended in a draw. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer noted, Cromwell was definitely not one of the "Five Members" to be removed from the House and arrested. <br /> Overall, this movie was decent. The producers tried WAY hard and it didn't turn out so well. <br /> <br /> could have been better.
