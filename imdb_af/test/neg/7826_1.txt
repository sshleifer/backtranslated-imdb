The story is unsuitable and poorly written. We get threads and a possible hook in action one, just to see it disappear. If the author made an effort to read his work carefully, it became clear that Madsden's character's initial problem and encounter with the 'bad' girl indicates that there will be a difficult alliance between them if they try to solve his problem to solve. <br /> <br /> The problem is nowhere. The relationship does not go anywhere. And there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships. Nobody is digging anyone and nobody is tempting. Writing and directing is laughing. You can feel that someone is struggling with the mess and moving the story to focus on the excitement of excitement. There is nobody. The author / director is simply a beginner whose swollen efforts somehow became a movie. From simple mistakes like "... they took poloids ..." - in Japan in 2007? To insulting errors like nudity for eroticism, this film is an insult. You can't make them much worse. <br /> <br /> And plotting the 'Madsden' on the talent list, the producers thought they would succeed. He is barely acting. Asia is definitely ... and the result is some heroin-chic panto. <br /> <br /> Give it a big mistake.
