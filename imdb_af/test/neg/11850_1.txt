The worst movie ever, with characters from Carnosaur 1-3, just fell to fall to the same downfall as they had in the first movie, so that footage and special effects could be reused. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this debacle. <br /> <br /> Corman destroys his legacy. He made and produced fantastic films - but that era ended with Carnosaur being his latest "creative in his bad" movie.
