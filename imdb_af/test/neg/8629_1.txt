I watched this movie after seeing the original "Spoorloos" a few times, in anticipation of the cold end. <br /> <br /> I can't even explain the anger and disappointment I experienced. The end came and went, and the movie continued to get a happy ending. What a waste of time it was to watch this American remake ... <br /> <br /> If you have a choice, please skip "The Vanishing" and look at the Dutch original "Spoorloos". The tension is very well built up. You feel the frustration of Rex, looking for any trace of what happened to his friend Saskia, after entering a petrol station and never returning to his car. The search took him three years and when he finally got in touch with the person who knew the truth about what happened to Saskia, he had to agree to undergo the same thing that Saskia had undergone. The end leaves you speechless in your chair.
