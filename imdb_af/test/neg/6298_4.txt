Terence Stamp can carry anything, but it's still a level one-dimensional movie. It's nice to watch - so are the actors - and if you're in drag queens, you think you can do it a lot, but the plot and characters are as thin as cardboard. It's one of those politically correct movies that endures everything to make a 'minority lifestyle' look warm and hug. It gets many miles out of the bitchy dialogue, which is amusing in this irrigated form, I think. <br /> <br /> Ninety percent of the action is splitting in turbulent costumes into awkward situations. The dramatic content is a sign attachment - they hardly try to take it seriously.
