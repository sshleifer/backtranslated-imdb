The time I wasted to see this movie I demand! I then felt sick, but not because it touched me in any way. It's pretentious to make the audience feel bad for the people involved, but I can't care less. The characters are silent and stupid. You do not get an explanation for some of the screens and do not later notice thoughts to set up your own explanation. All the students in the movie have problems, but since you don't feel like them, you don't believe their problems. <br /> <br /> If I could write better in English, I would never stop. But I can't, so, I'll stop now. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it.
