I would think it was one of those movies that the director didn't read the book on which he was based, because they were just the same. It is certainly possible that a good movie on a book will be very easy to base. It was definitely the latter but not the former. There were a number of errors. One was that it was too much like the railroad children, probably because adults expect it from the same writer. Another is that it was also trying to be like Harry Potter, to the music and to overstate the environment. I have nothing against J K Rowling or the movies, but the book is nothing like the Harry Potter. I thought the Psammead, though very well spoken by Eddie Izzard and also in character, was almost free in a totally inappropriate environment. I may have missed something here, as the comments made on one of the characters' own books may have been a reference to the inaccuracy of the adaptation. No extra characters were needed, and today's special effects could easily be used to tell the story as it was written, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two kids, one of whom knows the book and the other of whom. The one who knew it thought it was right, but was not as enthusiastic as the one who didn't. I don't know what that means.
