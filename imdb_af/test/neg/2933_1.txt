Maybe I expected too much from this movie, but at least a comedy should be funny, and this one has very few amusing moments. It controls it to homosexuals, heterosexuals, women, obese and possibly other groups. <br /> <br /> Tom Selleck and Matt Dillon are ridiculously overlooked and Kevin Kline looks mostly confused. <Br /> <br /> Other reviewers compare the movie to Will and Grace, but at least "Will and Grace" _is_ funny.
