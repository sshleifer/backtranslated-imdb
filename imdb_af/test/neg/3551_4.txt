Not even originally in the plot. Ho hum. There were some interesting angles, but the movie follows 90% of Hollywood movies. Samuel Jackson doesn't play most of his time in his other films, but he was pretty good at this movie. He screams scarcely and goes much further in his character rather than returning to a "in your face rage." I like Eva Mendes - as usual - and even though she is a nice eye candy, she proves that she is much more than an actress. Luis Guzman was also really good, except that I didn't have the change of character to Samuel Jackson at the end of the film. How can one's character center have an aversion to a former police officer and then change to lollipopland within a second second? Isn't there an original idea about Hollywood?
