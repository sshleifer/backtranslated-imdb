At first I thought this little fantasy outing would be a bit entertaining. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> A good throw (Roy Scheider as the president) didn't help it. The story has every conceivable possible worst-case scenario that occurred in a terrorist nuclear disaster. And nothing can happen! <br /> <br /> True - the kidnapping of the President can only be accomplished with the inside of a traitor in the Secret Service (Ala Air Force One), but all they've portrayed in terms of football and the helplessness of our country when it falls into the enemy's hands is ludicrous for the Nde degree. Seriously, even the President cannot completely overrun our missile control. The case is only used to reload orders. In this situation, our system would have completely removed the codes and the whole thing would go nowhere. The destruction of Beijing could not happen - no missile would have been launched because the silo teams would be commanded not to communicate (communication includes a hardwired system). There are just too many security guards to prevent such a thing from happening. <br /> <br /> True, films like FAIL-SAFE and STRANGELOVE have given credibility to the concept of losing control of the system. But this film goes too far and fails to suspend my concept of the incredible. And that makes the experience a waste of the viewer's time. This movie is a failure.
