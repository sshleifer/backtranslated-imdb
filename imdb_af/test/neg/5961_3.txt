The back of my DVD describes the plot of "El Chucabra": after his capture in the desert, the legendary bloodthirsty creatures escape Chupacabra to the city that creates chaos and panic. Realizing the deadly animal, animal control officer and scientist Dr Starlina Davide that a vigilante with his own suspicious plan also watches the elusive killer for a mysterious research facility led by the deadly Dr. Goodspeed. This turbulent horror movie is somewhat amusing if you watch it under the influence of alcohol. The writing is completely silly, the acting is wood beyond belief and the direction is amateurish.Two rubber Chupacabra suits are easily the best thing about this movie.3 out of 10 and it is very good.
