For weeks I was looking forward to seeing this movie just to find myself very disappointed at wards. In my opinion, the only good thing was 'river queen' because it was the wonderful scenery used as a backdrop. The story line was everywhere, Samantha's character Sarah was very hard to understand and what on earth was all very close to her face? It didn't bring anything to the story - if there was one! A better actor of the part of Boy could also be chosen, for me it sounded like he was reading his lines straight while shooting his scene. Generally, a real shame because it would have been such a good movie.
