Veteran TV director Ted Post treats us to a plowing, confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from Column B of the Harold Robbins Big Book Of Plots. After the Charliehoek corners, Jaclyn Smith, take a star turn as "the woman whose eyes are secretly shadowed at all times," while JFK imitator James Francis sits around the edges. <br /> <br /> Mannix goes west, monkeys are abused, models are leaning against classic cars, and Smith is constantly staged by Sybil Danning until a great style wrap-up brings the whole pity to a bitter end. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and Bob Mitchum is also there. Somewhere.
