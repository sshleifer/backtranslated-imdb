The opening scene really got me watching the movie. But no more than 5 minutes later, I had thrown my eyes out of my mouth. Not only could I understand a word that was said, the acting could have been better by a group of mentally handicapped people. The one highlight of this movie was that there was a punk white lunch. However, I didn't get the connection on how a white midget was the child of two African Americans. But I think everything is possible. Also, why was hell Robin in the movie? I'm not sure it added anything artistic. Overall, I strongly advise you to jump off a cliff before renting this movie.
