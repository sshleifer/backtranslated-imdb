No, not no. This is all that has to be said. <br /> <br /> Summary: A random man is in a maize field. For some reason I'm not sure, but it's his duty to run inside. The next big thriller? <br /> <br /> A five-year-old can make a better movie, just to film an ant pot, or even just to grow. Seriously ..... <br /> <br /> You can't say it has bad acting, because there is NO play. You can't say it has bad writing because it has NO writing. You can't say it has bad cinematography, because there is NO cinematography. You can't say it's a bad movie because there is no movie! If you don't believe me, check it out. Don't just say I never warned you .....
