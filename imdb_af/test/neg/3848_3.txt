Just to save the $ 3, or whatever it takes to rent movies from your local video store, and the anxiety and how-to-long movie is a simple plan here. Go to a friend's home, talk to them to rent the plague for you, first look at the first 30 seconds or so and then make a few excuses to leave. The opening sequence is very funny, definitely worth watching. Unfortunately, the other 99% of the movie is terrible. Without the shower scene at the beginning, it is one of the worst movies of all time.
