After sitting through the train wreck that was the first Dark Harvest movie, I couldn't leave enough alone. When I saw that there was a prosecution (or rather I believed it was a prosecution) I had to increase my pain level. Since it has nothing to do with Dark Harvest, it had to be a good thing. In this one we did not get a killer scarecrow, but instead we got a fox to go for a maize field that cries out little things like "Girls!" and can you hear me? every now and then. In addition, we had two (four if you included the two girls that the director had the same effect as the twins in The Shining) wanting tiny little girls who couldn't act. And the cherry on top of this mess will have to be the Corn Cop. I had to know that this movie would be terrible when the dog got an opening credit. How I watched this movie, I will never know.
