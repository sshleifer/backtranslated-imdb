Contains spoilers! These guys are total scams, they did the lost roles of Judas and said Judas was a great friend of Jesus ... And now this? Clearly, trying to destroy a religion must be illegal. They have no evidence, it can clearly be a setup. How can we know and trust these people? What if they cut the grave and "said so"? And at the end, SEAL they forever tomb so no one can go there? How silly do they think we're really? Do we have to trust that they are trustworthy people? Who really found a grave of Jesus? And how can you bump all Christians like this? I think this documentary should never be made by a non-religious man. It can only be made by a Christian and I mean the DIRECTION and WRITING. It must be illegal for Jews to film a Christian related documentary, especially if the documentary alleges that Jesus is not a "Son of God who has been resurrected" (nothing against this, they can be Buddhists or atheists, except Catholics ). /> <br /> For me, it's a total hoax, a pure documentary scam. They sealed the grave so people couldn't "think" about things being done. This documentary is a total failure, how stupid do they think Christian people are? And what about the lost pages of Judas ... it was also a total scam, they finally said seriously: "We know a few people who can do such a false scroll and no one will know It was a fake "... Oh my God, they just said." Dude, we might have done this ... This kind of documentary must be illegal, it's a bump on all Christians and the Catholic who they must be burst !!! I am not a fanatic, I am a former Jew, now atheist, but I have valore and will always respect other people's religion.The part when Israel ordered the grave to be sealed forever should be ADD!
