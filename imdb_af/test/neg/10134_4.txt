Imagine being trapped inside a dark middle-aged museum and a risen vampire and its manic sidekick looking for you. Where is the absolute last place you want to hide? I want to say in the amazing Virgin or Nuremberg torture device because there is a good risk of being bleed to death. And yet the elderly lady in this movie runs foolishly into her speckled coffin. "The Vampire's Kis" is a disappointing successor, as director Fernando Mendez does not recreate the Gothic atmosphere of the 1957 original, but emphasizes comic situations and dialogues. No more ominous castles with ominous cobwebs and dark safes, but confused doctors and clumsy assistants who explain instead of fear. The story opens in Count de Lavud's last resting place, where a leading doctor and a hired assistant steal the coffin to investigate the corpse at a private clinic. Of course, the wooden pin is removed from his heart, and the vampire count comes to life again, and immediately leaves the little one to do his dirty work. The vampire looks at a beautiful female patient at the clinic, and it is up to Dr. Enrique Sald√≠var to save her soul and destroy the blood sugar. "The Vampire's Kis" uses a limited number of places and there is very little action. The whole movie would just be boring if it wasn't for a handful of memorable rows and decent performances. Photography is incredible, with the sublime use of shadows and darkness. It is especially at the scene in which Count de Lavud stole a young woman through the deserted streets of the village at night. This is the only worthy scene of the whole movie, the rest is fairly mediocre and dear-vu.
