These tatty am drama-adapting scrambles soulessly through the plot of Dickens' wonderful book, replacing the emotional impact with hasty transitions and any outside places with drawings. It is not the fault of the actors and the production team that the budget is so low, but of course you have to ask the point to make it first when there is no time or money to do it. Michael Hordern's Scrooge is far too soft at first, which lacks his transformation, and is not helped by a lack of response from him when he looks at the visions. The other actors range from acceptable (Clive Merrison, Paul Copley), to non-committal (Bernard Lee) to shine as if they will forget their lines (John Le Mesurier). It doesn't even matter for trouble, to be honest.
