Meh, Sums it all to me really. Drilling story, mere dialogue, dull action scenes (HOW do you make something like a battle or a shooting boring? Do you actually try to do it?), No real characters, etc. Not dull. Snipes is a talented actor and physical artist, but none of this has appeared in any of his DTV work, when there is the opportunity to give the audience a much better product than they are used to. Imagine a decent script with some solid characters you care about and some explosive action, battles, shooting, etc. How can it be difficult to handle? My personal opinion is that the primary players in the productions just don't mind. There is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they do. Look at Snipes in the first 2 Blades, Passenger 57, Rising Sun, New Jack City, Demolition Man, etc.? Awesome, intense performances complemented by decent (if not always outstanding) scripts, good supporting works and bad action. <br /> <br /> None of these are evident in any of these releases so far which is a great shame. The distributors hit Wesley's face on the cover, knowing that the audience would shoot them because they hadn't yet realized they'd seen him in the theaters for almost two years. <br /> <br /> I want to see Snipes work with someone like Isaac Florentine who really knows how to make the best of a DTV production, and works with Alpha Stunts that are just some of the best action is old. Together they will all make an incredible team and a Snipes action vehicle that we will all be proud to see. <br /> <br /> Detonator sucks. It's not as bad as The Marksman, who is chewing, but it still sucks.
