OK, if you're a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and love to mock movies, then you'll have a lot of fun with it. Otherwise, it may be too painful to see. Plot: Obsessed crypto-zoologist sneaks a large crate with a Chupacabra on a ship (apparently it doesn't have to be declared at the customs, or even call him aboard a living animal - "no, it's research equipment, the air holes are just an accident "). Some dipsticks he hired to open the crate to find that he had paid bunches of money, maybe there is something to steal. Once the WOOD CRATES are open, the Chupacabra breaks through STEELBARS and goes on a deadly rampage. <br /> <br /> Whatever. <br /> <br /> With a coincidence, Marshall (I'm taking on an American Marshall, as he was in the Gulf War, not just a man named Marshall), aboard, and investigating money disappeared from the ship's safe. He appointed as an insurance seller ("Lady, I'm the best insurance you have ..."). Other scintillating characters include the captain (John Rhys-Davies, and unfortunately his dignity is the first victim of the movie), his Tae-Bo instructor daughter (Snicker - Tae-Bo), an annoying old stuffed lady with a a puppy fed a cat (guess what it eats ...?) and an incredibly unpleasant gigolo who might have promised a movie in 1964, not something more recently. Many of the plays were really bad, and the characters were just there so you could laugh hysterically when they were dead. <br /> <br /> Overall - SCREAMINGLY bath. Bad on many levels. BATHING BATH BATH. What ??? Bullets don't even make Chupacabra flinch, but the Tae top bimbo can push him and scare him? ?? Hey Sci-Fi Channel, you are desperate for scripts or what?
