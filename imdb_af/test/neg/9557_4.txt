The movie had to be released in 2002 and was much awaited by the promotions, but it was eventually released in 2003 after the producer died. <br /> <br /> The movie is good in parts, but overall is not good <br /> <br /> The scenes between Rani and Ajay are good, but the other scenes are not handled well. <br /> <br /> The movie is too similar to BOLLYWOOD Hollywood and even though it was planned before it was released, originality was lost. <br /> <br /> Millions of Luthria disappear altogether after KACHCHE DAAGE <br /> <br /> Music is good, but too many songs. Ajay Devgan looks naked and his appearance gives away that the movie was delayed and his acting also seems boring Rani is good Sonali is good to rest is good
