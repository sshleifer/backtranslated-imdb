The worst thing I ever watched. <br /> <br /> The movie is pure trash. All the stuff is bad on this movie. The direction, script, art, cinematography, throw or anything else. <br /> <br /> Can I say more? <br /> <br /> The main character is a boy. It should be about 20 years old, but the actor playing the role looks like 30 years old. In addition, he is a very bad actor. <br /> <br /> Editing is trying to save it, but with very bad material in hand, they can't do miracles. <br /> <br /> As I said, the scroll is poor, the text is poor, it doesn't help the actors. <br /> <br /> I learned how to make a movie.
