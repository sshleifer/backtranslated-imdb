My mom and I rented this gem a few years ago while she was here for Thanksgiving. I laughed so hard. It's a typical low-budget horror movie with stupid special effects, a worse plot, and even worse acting. But do you really expect a classic when Linnea Quigley receives top billing? I didn't think. <br /> <br /> Since this movie does have some entertainment value, I give it a 3 out of 10.
