Master of Italian horror Dario Argento is called a very bad thing by non-supporters. And do not deserve anything from the decline. In fact, every time I hear something about Argento, I really think they're talking about Michele Soavi. He just didn't get the same attention because his films were never so successful in theaters. In fact, his best movie - 1994's Cemetery Man - was probably his least successful. Or just didn't get the attention he thought, because after that he left the movie and chose television. He never came back. So people do not really know how inferior his other films are, because by the time they saw it, they are already fans of the Italian horror aesthetic. This means you have to accept the fact that they make almost zero sense and are usually very unattractive. This is where the church stands out. Because it is visual, it is so cheap and antique, you can smell the fabric. But it also has its charm, though they are few. The camera work is really arrested and the music score is extremely extended and large. <br /> <br /> Since Argento are the reasons people saw Soavi's work all, I don't know anyone who caught the Church before Argento's Suspiria. and deep red. Soavi is a bit of a hack. Similar to an Italian Mick Garris - the best example of a director who prefers the fabric. The shortcomings of the church are constant and many. The movie starts with a somewhat interesting prologue that shows knights on white horses and loads through a farming village similar to what you see in a Robin Hood adaptation. These scenes are intense enough, energetic, and get to the point quickly. Then we cut to the present, where the film's style takes over. Yes, the movie is right to watch. And for about 35 or so minutes in the present, 1980s all over Italy, the movie is just interesting enough to get us to the slowly revealing horror elements. So now we know the purpose of the movie is to build up his horror. And that's a decent build up, for the most part. But as the film reaches the center, we realize the movie's drive through, and ... nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple. I think. Two people working in a church, one as a catalog of books and the other as a repairer of the wall art of the building, discover a book / script that the man thinks they will lead to a kind of buried treasure or valuable artefact he can sell. and being rich of He follows only his 'card' to reveal a power under the church that hallucinates him, while slowly becoming a demon that will make everyone hallucinate. So while doing his demonic work, someone who has transferred the power to him has killed him in a way that everyone falls into the church while the devil spreads "contagon" on everyone and a black preacher and the little girl out of the church every night to go clubbing as the only 2 people who can stop spreading the plague outside the church walls. It probably sounds like action packs and Soavi's style is far more deadly than Argento. But I have never seen an attempt at surrealistic film that is annoyingly boring. I don't kid you. Absolutely nothing happens in the whole movie! I have previously seen expressionist (or impressionist, I'm no film school supergrade) movies, but most of them actually show things happen (John Carpenter's Halloween for one). It follows quite closely in the footsteps of Lamberto Bava's Demons movies (since Argento produced together). We are shown in a place where a lot of people get together, change one into a devil, all the others are isolated, that person infects all but a few survivors, then the devils either become infected or the survivors get out of it when the demons die. This film puts all the elements in place. Except for Argento's work, nothing happens. All right, a few things happen. But just one bizarre sequence has the panache of Lamberto's much more fun Demons movies. A random woman's neck is wrapped in a devil by using a portion of the fence he rips out of the floor. What is weird about, you wonder? It happens for about two dozen people. What are they doing? Nothing. She died, her head sneaking in the head. But all the people do not even see, although it is in clear view and not less than 8 feet away. Perhaps 4 people see the demon running to stab someone he can while he walks to her so they get out of the way. She is dead and in the lap after she dies, all just sit still while a boy plays a saxophone. I don't kid you. That's what happens. This is more than logically incoherent. This is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> The scene suggests that the woman just disappears and no one saw her death. They all just got up and forget about it. And this 15-second thing is absolutely the only event taking place in the movie. I'm not saying it's the only violence, gore or murder we see. It's not. It's just the only thing we can tell, happens. For example, in a scene, a beautiful woman sees herself in a mirror that looks old and ugly. She started climbing the skin on her face, but when she appeared later, no scratch. People are devoured by fish and their faces are mumbled by metro cars. But later on, they become completely undivided members of a possession cult, in a scene that makes the ultimate horror crime. A famous scene of Roman Polanski's masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby, is the biggest horror movie ever made. Even if Argento did that, I would be furious!
