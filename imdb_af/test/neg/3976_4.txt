The movie wasn't really that bad, especially plot-wise, but the thorough (and hairy) actor they chose for the lead role was a bit chintzy in the acting department. I would have chosen someone else. The idea of ​​"to America" ​​was a lot of ingenuity, and the main character who ever knew what he was, made him a little fun, but not so, so when there is a look for a leading actor. <br /> <br /> The storyline was interesting. This raises the question of how the subject of cloning will be dealt with in the future. Certainly cloning will not be allowed for the purposes of the movie, but it is still a valid argument for today. Clones are still people ... right? <br /> <br /> The movie wasn't very special, but it's still much better than some of the cheese released during the 70's. Let's not forget the "Giant Spider Invasion". I give it a 4 because it didn't quite stink, but the MST3K version makes this movie a 10. (I still like Dr Super Mario!) You will keep this movie but it won't be your favorite no.
