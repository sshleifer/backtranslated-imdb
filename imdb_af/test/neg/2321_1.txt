Absolutely unknown movie with Abbott and Costello. Even our young children are becoming increasingly annoyed with this complete mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> Abbott as Dinklepuss. What a look he had on his face. Certainly, he had to be part of this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Did anyone realize that Costello's mother sounded in the movie and looked like Fay Bainter? Fortunately, for Mrs. Bainter, she wasn't in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is really no excitement to hear for children. The jokes, if any, are pretty stale. The song is well done, but the lyrics are ridiculous.
