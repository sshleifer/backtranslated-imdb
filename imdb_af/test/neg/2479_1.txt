Really, Actually ... What pleases you (American one!) In this so-called show is completely outside me. What can we learn from this series: <br /> <br /> 1. Each casino spends about 2-3 billion dollars annually to hire a satellite and a large amount of high-tech high-resolution cameras for their security team . Let FBI bite their dust. <br /> <br /> 2. Every security employee must have adult breasts, of course, natural people. The tits must always be shown, otherwise they will lose their jobs. <br /> <br /> 3. If the employee is a man, he must be implanted breasts and then go to step 2. <br /> <br /> 4. Only in Hollywood can one think of the other ideas round off other tunes and implement them as their own and call all these crap "original" and "art". <br /> <br /> 5. Every security with tits greater than 39D is considered immortal and cannot die. <br /> <br /> I would like the opportunity to vote with minus values. -10/10 for this one!
