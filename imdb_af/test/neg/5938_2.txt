Perhaps a state citizen is not the most glamorous way to make a living, but it is still a way to make a living. However, after watching this movie, one can get away and believe that every government office is a lazy, puffed, excited, storyteller starring its next lunch. Not exactly a pretty picture, but it is the picture that the audience must endure when it comes to what is nothing more than another boring, noisy, overworking action movie. Just what the doctor ordered ... right? How much more of these movies did Hollywood make? One thousand? Two thousand? The formula for making these movies is so beaten up in the fabric that it must now be completely unrecognizable. The sites are changing, but the images remain the same, and with the same level of character development and equally-level acting as trained artists are being asked to divide into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. This movie was unmistakable. "When will this movie end?" I thought to myself repeatedly. Leonardo DiCaprio was totally unbelievable as a CIA surgical but what should be one of the great gaffs of miscasting, an overweight Russell Crowe playing a CIA bureaucrat. Please note that site operation in this movie is "leaning and mean" while his desk is jok supervisor fat. This is called stereotyping. What did the casting director think? Why didn't Jack Nicholson choose an overweight office? Whether Nicole Kidman is playing a frumpy store retailer? And the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it. A clear non-Arab American (Mr. DiCaprio) is trying to speak to himself as an Arab ... Liquid Arabic speaks ... all kinds of hairbrush schemes that are doomed to failure ... try to imagine Arabs being completely unfolded by its laughable Arabian masquerade ... trying to romance a Palestinian woman while in the middle of a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission is ... etc. By this time you get the point. Next time try to throw a real Arab into the role. Not even the most naive filmmaker can believe it all. There must be a rough balance between the protagonist and antagonist. In this movie, the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in society. Next stop for this movie - DVD land and oblivion. And another thing. Don't let this movie discourage you from working for the government. The payment may not be good, but the fringe benefits are excellent, a critical fact that this movie is conveniently omitted.
