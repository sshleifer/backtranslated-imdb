What happens on Earth with RGV? There are so many things wrong about this movie you have to stop and decide where to start - first and foremost - the music. Each scene was accompanied by this pretentious background music that told you the mood, very pathetic, I can add. Secondly, the lighting - do we really need such dark scenes where we wonder if the projector is still working? And finally - if you are going to Indianise the Godfather and Godfather 2, you realize that many of us have seen. Nayakan was a ripoff of GF1, but better done and more entertaining. I saw an agreement in both the company and the sarco, and while RGV's Ab Branch was brilliant, these two movies leave something to be desired. People will no longer be impressed by only corrupt politicians and destiny. Maybe RGV should see Maqbool, which is good enough to be RGV!
