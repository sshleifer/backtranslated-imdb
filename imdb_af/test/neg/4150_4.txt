An epic story of hope limited by budget and limited artistic ambition. Since Terrence Malick produced it, I expected it to be something spooky and lyrical. Instead, we get a typical Norwegian co-production ("Revolution" with Al Pacino, anyone?), Where good intentions are likely to be hit by a terrible script and many characters are reduced to stereotypes. The "me-Tarzan-u-Jane" English dialogue between non-English-speaking protagonists is especially cringeworthy ?? One can speculate whether Nick Nolte and Tim Roth have their own ad-libbed, as they almost sound like real people. The story is unsatisfactory. We are expected to believe that Binh can speak a smattering of English after living his entire life as a farmer's slave (his vocabulary, but unfortunately not grammatical command, impressive in the Malay refugee camp without the benefit of nagklasse). Coincidence is great; I wonder if an hour or two of the first third was edited: he almost immediately goes to his mother in Ho Chi Minh City after being half-brother in his thirty years, who suddenly recognizes him! Mom gives him a golden locket (or something similar to great value) as they share, but it is never referred to again. His relationship with "Me Dead Inside" Ling is supposed to provide the mandatory "love interest" but feels as artificial as Leonardo and Cameron in "Gangs Of New York". <br /> <br /> The voyage of a boat bucket carries a sense of the terrible conditions of human trafficking. In fact, the only time the movie is remotely exciting and unpredictable is the sharp, handwritten footage of the bridge during harsh weather conditions. (Incidentally, a boat trip from Malaysia to New York via the Cape of Good Hope and the African coast without stopping for fuel or supplies is definitely an epic journey). The beautiful shot of the New York skyline echoes Malick's use of magical hours, but I want to know why the Coast Guard didn't show up. Maybe they watched the Super Bowl, or something. Of course, Binh can find his blind old dad on a remote Texas farm, with the same navigation feature in Ho Chi Minh City. I was impressed by how Nick Nolte could wander around gravel fields without the help of a guide dog or a white stick and feed horses on a large farm. To demonstrate how a story about refugee obstruction is structured and shot on a small budget, watch Michael Winterbottom's far superior "In This World".
