As an old film lover, I have heard a lot about the controversial movie CALIGULA, which has been unambiguously assessed as one of the most realistic epics of some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies of others. I decided to see it all over the unnoticed version, to evaluate it myself, hoping to find something positive that would justify the many accusations of the film. I put one autumn sand in my chair and started looking. The first quotation from the New Testament suddenly shocked me and raised the first controversy in me ... why a sentence from the Gospel brought by Mark into the film about pagan Rome? But the prelude pastoral scene with a young half-naked couple (Caligula and Drusilla) running hopelessly through meadows was pretty sentimental. The music that sounds memorably, while the credits also aroused me positively. Yet, the negative feelings soon came to me, especially at the death of Tiberius. The cruelty was very intense and sexuality was exaggerated. However, it was not so terrible for the drug. During the second half of the film, I felt as if I were not watching a historical epic, but a very disgusting pornography. In the end, I told myself, "This is one of the movies that you really hate". I am aware that a movie may be controversial, but I never expected CALIGULA to go far enough to remove all limits of taste. . I hate this movie because of many reasons, but especially one. <br /> <br /> CALIGULA does not serve the purpose of an ancient epic (which he claims), but Bob Guccione, the director and founder of the Penthouse pornographic magazine, seeks to combine cinematography with pornography. This is, I think, the most serious matter the film can be accused of. Movie is an art that must be controlled by taste, by message, by a sense of epic grandeur, while this movie kills all limits of good taste. CALIGULA shows the most enduring side of man in the worst, decadent way. Some scenes are so disgusting that I don't think there are any people whose psyche won't be affected by them. Some say that Rome was so cruel under Caligula's government. Yes this is true. Corruption at the time blew, several sexual disorders were better than Roman citizens. However, I do not think it is right to focus on these deviations so much as to emphasize an ancient epic. I believe it's rather the bizarre psyche of the producers and their strange tendencies ... <br /> <br /> GREAT HISTORICAL CRIME: The script by Gore Vidal is notorious for inaccuracies. For example, this is evident from the figure of Proculus (Donato Placido), a historic Roman senator. Yet the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom Caligula forces his most decadent ways of torture and rape. In addition, Livia was not Proculus's wife who was raped by the emperor at her wedding. What lies behind the stories of historical characters in the stories filled with incredible vulgarity and violence? Another example of historical travesty is the figure of Caesonia depicted by Helen Mirren. She is presented with Drusilla, his sister, as Caligula's wife. In fact, Caligula is married to Caesonia long after his sister's death. The sexual abuse of his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene without historical bases. I also hated the murder machine right now - a pure imagination of the director who has nothing to do with historical facts. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL ASPECTS AND CAST: From a technical point of view, the film is nothing special. The cinematography cannot boast, it is exceptionally fine and the sets with costumes are also not outstanding. Yet, the only strong point of the movie is the performances, especially those of Malcolm McDowall as Caligula. He does a perfect job starring what emperor and cruelty of the emperor. McDowall raises the value of the movie. If everything bother you in CALIGULA, you can at least admire his performance. I also celebrated Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla (yet the movie is based on a gossip by Suetonius that Caligula loves his sister). Sir John Gielgud as Nerva and Peter O'Toole as old Tiberius are also memorable. O'Toole does his best play in the Capri Grotto series depicting the decadence and exhaust of the old emperor. Yes, I admit that the only thing I like about CALIGULA is the representations. Therefore, I do not rate the movie 1/10. <br /> <br /> LAME CONTINUITY: The historical inaccuracy of the movie is also in pairs with poor continuity. Let's just analyze the beginning: Caligula comes to Capri Grotto where he sees the terrible pleasure of the old Tiberius. Then, after about 15 minutes, the action moves to Rome where a black bird near Drusilla and Caligula's bed is a bad sign. And immediately are the characters in Capri where Nerva (John Gielgud) dies ...? <br /> <br /> All in all, I don't recommend seeing CALIGULA to anyone. If you want to get to know the story, read Robert Graves's beautiful novel I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD, or watch Herbert Wise's mini-series with the stunning performance by Derek Jacobi. CALIGULA is a sick film whose most serious crime is the destruction of art. It's mostly a porn movie that is never called an epic. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are really artistic and sharpen people's taste of beauty, <br /> <br /> there are average entertainment movies; Yet they have something to offer <br /> <br /> There are movies showing extreme violence; Yet, they still have morals, <br /> <br /> There are, however, movies that affect diseases and decadence for their sake and consequently people's minds. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, CALIGULA belongs to the latest group
