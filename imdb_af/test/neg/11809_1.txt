A Pre-Nerd Robert Carradine, a Pre-Automan Desi Arnaz Jr., and an almost pre-pubic Melanie Griffith takes to the road and goes to Alaska with romantic dreams of becoming rich salmon fishermen. Well, their dream is about as exciting as this dull youth road. They are not very interesting, and the film doesn't have much of a point except "We brought together the fuss of some famous people and made a low budget film about their misadventures. "From the canon of 60's and 70's movies and rebel youth films, this one is mediocre, under-developed, non-involved characters, not very white, not much freshness to the story. It's just as fatter than the muddy landscape of the movies. <Br /> <br /> But for those who care. They go to Alaska, and apparently Alaska was like the Wild West in the 70's because everyone was carrying a rifle and was rough and tumble. Robert Carradine says beautiful things like "I hope we can get a shower, my nuts are sure". (And he's the one with Melanie Griffith!) They are quickly robbed and forced to take jobs, and the local bigwig, their employer, places the moves on Melanie and eventually shoots Desi because they are not corrupt. It's when they aren't smart and don't leave the town, rather eat or eat dog food, are beaten by the guys, and then in the bigwigs car. The last half of the film leaves the wicked big wig when the trio commits a robbery, goes on, and hatches a kidnapping scheme, and so on. The film is just like an end, annoying and ambiguous, but seeing how they didn't have much character development and story in the first place, it is rather appropriate. A look is if you really are in the low budget 70's, but ultimately nice to forget.
