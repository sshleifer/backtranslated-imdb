Lastly, this movie had to be seen. What a disappointment ... it barely reaches "made for TV" level. Given the list of actors, I would have expected something far more sophisticated. The movie doesn't have a good story, well, actually any story for that matter. It has no credibility but much predictability. Save yourself the money and the time.
