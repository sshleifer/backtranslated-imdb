I tried. I really tried to think of something that would earn more than two. It's not that I don't "get it" - I'm a big fan of the Asian theater. The truth is, the movie is childless in construction, long lasting and painfully unfounded. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you think of Alfred Hitchcock's mindset "Don't tell them, show them" then you can try to appreciate this movie, but you'll still be hard pressed. <br /> <br /> First, the Terrorizers try Jean-Luc Godard's style awareness and fail in it. Edward Yang seems to understand the basics of the technique, but he is very unskilled about it. (Perhaps he gets better with age, I don't know as I haven't tried other Yang movies yet.) The point is that he uses a lack of "show, not tell" that really just interrupts the procession. Sure, in some visual arrest, he gets images, but they don't bring the story together, and they don't help it make it better. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main concept behind stream-of-consciousness and "show, do not tell" is that with the right images, the right drama, repetition and close correlation the viewer can make his or her own deductions make; Not to say that it will be the correct deduction, but it can be changed as the story progresses, and each director must strive for some of this type of audience interaction. Hereby Edward Yang disappears a lot. The viewer is constantly on the edge. There is no reason to be drawn in, no reason to consider the characters or their motives, no reason to become emotionally involved, and really no reason to stay awake. <br /> <br /> Finally, Yang is lost in the story he wants to tell, not the story that tells the movie itself. His art moves in one direction, but like a big dog he can't control, he is constantly going and trying to get it back on the course he wants, not the one that follows it naturally. The most genuine example of this is the end. The end really had to take place at the moment of the man's revelation. The end of the book focusing on the movie has already been told to us (and a possible end to the movie). If Yang had chosen to end at that stage, he would have had a much more powerful piece, and leave the keeper in tension - does the story play like the book says, or does Yang's "real world" play differently? Asking the viewer to think about it is the kind of interaction the viewer needs. Instead, does he continue to tell the story what he wants to tell, the natural conclusion for what? For the sake of a main character, we no longer needed to know more of her superficially, and Yang didn't need to tell us if he didn't make her in a veneer. Make her a more engaging and deep character to start with. <br /> <br /> Why does Yang extend his movie and torture? To get "visual arrest images" in some of these. "The movie is really up to it. It wants to end, it has a conclusion that feels natural and leaves the viewer, but instead pushes Yang. Instead, Yang constructs a complex ending leading the viewer and causing him or her constantly asking, "so what?" The first end, the one who ignored Yang, it was good. The second end, well, my mind was "so what, who cares?" For it is not as if it introduces something which is not yet in the story ... but the last end? It was really a waste of time, not only did the "right" end disconnect me, but I also felt it was a deterrent to what the story could have been, Yang has offered a potentially good story for the bubblegum-melancholy-noir-tinged conclusion he has long demanded. <br /> <br /> My last problem with the movie has nothing to do with the movie itself, but rather its after production, the subbing (if you see it subbed) is terrible, long sentences remain for a second or two e, while shorts stay too long. Also, as Yang quickly changes images, the captions are removed from the screen. It's one of the rare cases that captions can stay on the screen as the picture changes, because there's not much dialogue at all.
