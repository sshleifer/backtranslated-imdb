Well, how to make a movie as challenging as possible? This cartoon-straight shocker is trying to extend two low-life Paris women (one prostitute, one recently raped, non-porn actress) and in particular a national sex-and-deadly spree man to run. <br /> <br /> Very short time gives you an indication of the experimental nature of this violent hardcore "Thelma & Louise" - but it is completely ironic or contemplated for any possible feminist message ... And since we Don't touch very close to the protagonists, the violence actually feels muted and numb - and maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> As a liberal lawyer of freedom of expression, I am always welcome when the "serious" movie industry ventures out of sexual scenes. But the question is: Does it work for the movie as a whole? Is this good? Here, not much, though we get a new meaning to the phrase "a shot in the ass"! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 of Ozjeppe
