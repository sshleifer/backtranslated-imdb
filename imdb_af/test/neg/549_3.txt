I was delighted to find that TCM showed it, because I love the 1992 version with Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Joan Plowright ... This movie has a light Ann Harding, a great show by Frank Morgan, But others' acting the movie more of a farce then the wonderful unfolds that later movie. Reginald Owen's Arbuthnot is painful to watch and you can't understand why his wife loves him. I found out after watching the movie that it was based on the play, where the 1992 movie is based on the book. The original film also felt it was a piece of a bigger piece and felt unfinished. It was a pity that it was such a deviation.
