I won't say much about this movie, because there is not much to say because there is not much to talk about. The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters of "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" are back. Several of the bad things about this movie are that they have terrible characters, it has terrible comedy, horrible animation, and James Arnold Taylor tries to copy the wonderful, and only Michael J. Fox like Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticism are that all the characters are turned into something they have never been, and should never be, an animation that has been downgraded to the lowest possible level. And finally, why would anyone who did wonderful voice work for Obi -What Kenobi in "Clone Wars" want to copy Michael J. Fox? I have an answer to this. Because they are the same person who thought he needed to copy Eddie Murphy from Mulan to Mulan II. Yes, unfortunately it is true. <br /> <br />.
