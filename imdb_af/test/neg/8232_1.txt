This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The plot revolves around a man named Luther wearing metal dentures, biting people on the neck and walking around like a chicken, without the flame of the arms. He also thinks he's a chicken. <br /> <br /> Sounds weird right? Well, for me, the bizarre and strange the person is, the better. The more gore, the better and so on. <br /> <br /> The film starts with the board that decides whether they want to release this mania from their institution. They mention that he has created some dentures in prison that he bites people on the neck. He also sounds like a chicken and thinks he is a chicken. <br /> <br /> If I had such a patient, there was no way I would release him. <br /> <br /> First, Luther heads to the supermarket and drops an old woman on a couch and walks away. Then he sneaked into the back seat of a woman's car and she drove completely to her home. <br /> <br /> As he joins home, Luther connects the woman to the bed. When the woman's daughter and her daughter's boyfriend come home, Luther hides. <br /> <br /> Later through the film a policeman comes to the front door and asks about the mother. You can clearly see the daughter is scared of her and crying, but the officer keeps asking if everything is right. She replied that everything was fine. The officer eventually gets into his car and leaves. If I see a woman constantly crying and looking, at least I would like to find out in the house to investigate a little. <br /> <br /> The end is also stupid. As the woman started in the barn, she started clucking and getting Luther excited, so he started walking to beat his arms and knock like a maniac. She finally shoots him and just sits there for a while before finally knocking more. <br /> <br /> The credits roll. <br /> <br /> It's one of the STUPIDEST movies I've ever seen! Nothing happens at the woman's house! Nothing! <br /> <br /> Sometimes I enjoy champion movies, but this one really bored me. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star 10. Good idea, bad direction!
