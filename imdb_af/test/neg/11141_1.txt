It's an absolute drive, designed to shock and tap the 60's mindset. The play is entirely wood, consisting mainly of ad-libbing, which causes the substandard actors to repeatedly dribble the first thing they can think of. <br /> <br /> The end result is of a poorly written play that is read by people who have no idea and don't care. One exception to this is the main character "Joe" (played by Joe Dallesandro) who spends a lot of the movie in a mere stupor (or stoned or the only one in the piece that can act!) Don't think I don't get Warhol - It's simply and simply a stinker that should never make it out of a movie class.
