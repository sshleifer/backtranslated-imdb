NBC must be ashamed. I won't let my kids see it. I will definitely tell my church to stay away. This movie is proof of why NBC was always a 3rd-class network. The producers, actors and writers have to get on their knees and ask God's forgiveness to make this work of fiction. There were no pirates. Noah's wife did not go around on the deck of the ark. The ark had NO deck. Lot was not even born when this event took place. Has anyone trying to read this project read the Bible? There are more than two animals of each type taken. Read the story in Genesis. How can anyone bring it to any screen, small or large!
