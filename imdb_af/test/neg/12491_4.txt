It is disappointing to see such a talented actor such as Amitabh Bachchan in such a poor role, especially if he was over in BLACK (which I strongly recommend). One line in the film reads: "Sakar is not a mere man, he is a thought and a philosophy." Director Ram Gopal Varma credits THE GODFATHER as inspiration for this movie, and maybe it's the problem. It looks like a bad mangled American movie set in India. The left elbow index considers seven elements of filmmaking - acting, continuity, plot, character development, dialogue, artwork and production sets - on a scale of high of 10 to a low of 1, given 5 as an average score. The movie continuity looks high, an 8, by keeping a violent tone placed on drama in places, and using justice outside the legal system as motivation. However, there seems to be a lack of emotion related to evil organized crime. The acting rate is 4, it looks too weak, even when someone is beaten or murdered, it seems hoohum. For example, if one character was shot in the forehead, I found myself wondering if he was going to fall. He did not, and ala Ronald Reagan he was put in a car, with his blooming face attached to John F. Kennedy. The plot is a 5 as an example of American gangsterism, with a family-oriented Robinhood on its head. Character development looks static, and the characters look like chess pieces on an abandoned chess board, giving it a rank of 3. The dialogue seems silent, and seems to be forced to fit a Bowery speech pattern - a 4 for dialogue. Production sets seem to be below average - a 4. And artworks are mysterious, with too many close-ups, too fast panning, and too many group screens where the actors seem to be reproduced - a 3. For me too much camera movement is disruptive. The average of the left elbow index is 4.4, and with a slight derivation based on poor derivatism, it moves to a four. Two questions continually arise in the film: one, why do so many people eat so often: and two Not India has its own brand of organized crime? Should films like this be so dependent on Western cultural examples? As much as I like Amitabh Bachchan, I can't recommend this movie.
