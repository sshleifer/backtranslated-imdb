This movie might have been the first Puppet Master, but it certainly bored me to death when I saw this dumb movie, I wanted a refund. It was a bad series for the Puppet Master and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks it's terrible. For some it was wonderful, but for others it was a ticket for strings and boys were right. The dolls didn't do anything and didn't kill people either. It should not be seen by people, so I warn you not to see it. You will be disappointed even to the fans who love the Puppet Master, it was a waste of time and it didn't make that much money. No one even killed, but one or two, very useless. <br /> <br /> 10/01
