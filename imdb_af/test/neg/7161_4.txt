After the book I became very sad when I watched the movie. I agree that sometimes a movie of the original novel differs, but in this case it was more than acceptable. Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) why the ranks differ (eg Lt. Diestl instead of Sergeant etc.) <br /> <br /> 2) The final screen is very poor and makes Diestl as a soldier who humbles himself and wants to die. But that's not true in 100%. Just read the book. He was also a bull dog in the last few seconds. He did not want to die by destroying his gun and just walk to Michael and Noah. <br /> <br /> So it's a kind of happy ending that doesn't suit this movie at all.
