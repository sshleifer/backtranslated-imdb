I will avert any temptation to see this movie, it's simply not. The characters are predictable and thoughtless. The killer is fairly unmistakable. There is no tension, fun, no style or even a glamor of originality that can be found in this train wreck. And the majority of Hollywood clich√©s are choked. Oh, and you have a movie that makes a hero of an IRA terrorist. Cute. And now I have to talk more to fill the ten lines. And a little more Is this enough? Not quite, how are you? No, now you have to do even better confabulation, but the Jackal is really not worth it. However, the original was great.
