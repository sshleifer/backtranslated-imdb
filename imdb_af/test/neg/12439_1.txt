I've been in a movie that's so embarrassingly bad, I wonder why movies exist. This is one of them. It's a terrible attempt to parody the Godfather with annoying cartoon sounds and bad dialogue. Eddie Deezen is just annoying as Tony, an annoying twist who, at the request of Don (William Hickey), takes over the family business. Tony, as I said, is an annoying little twit. This makes the whole movie a complete mess. The movie is terribly daffy. This is too cartoon. The main point I'm trying to make is that you can't make as much cartoon art as a well-known drama like The Godfather. It does not work like that. Believe it or not, you must take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously. If you don't take it seriously, it will feel too much like a parody. The thing to do a parody is that you can't seem to be doing a parody too much. You have to make it look as if you are taking the movie a little seriously. It also feels that they just mock Woody Allen, and this makes this movie absolutely horrible.
