Solo is a poor film - it can't be ignored. The actor for the most part is a lot of wood (the only exception is Adrien Brody's performance as Solo's creation bill) and the story is small enough that you will probably forget, WHEN you watch the movie. It is said that such films are more about action than plot / acting, and as such live or die by action sets - this is the point of such films - giving 14-year-olds something to smile while adults watch movies of the actual substance. And even on this solo failure to deliver - which little action is there, is poorly done, dull and uninspired. After watching this trailer on television, I was hoping for something like Predator with a robot that replaced the Predaot. Instead, I got a pretty lifeless action movie, with a poor effort to reach depth by recording the message that robots can also feel. See Terminator II or Predator instead. Both classic articles that want this movie to be desperate, except that it does not have the inspiration, or to justify the budget.
