I recorded this movie because it sounded like a pretty fiction, and I have always been a fan of foreign films. But for someone who likes movies, I was amazed at how much I hate, hate, hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Although it is aimed at the lives of young, lower class men in Lima and A To the extent that it succeeds, the characters are hopelessly level and the audience has no sense of feeling for them. have not. <br /> <br /> Although the story revolves around M, he rarely ever speaks, and his dialogue is at best, incredibly dry and boring. <br /> <br /> *** Warning: a little small spoilers *** <br /> <br /> Basically, the story turns to a young man named M looking for work, but Without success (He gets to work twice, but stops because they're "not for him", if you're poor, is the last option to choose) Spending some time with his friends, whose idea of ​​'fun' is to rape a little 14 years old, cover a little wreckage from a piece of gun for a thin bag and a some other slightly delayed activities. /> <br /> M's friend comes up with a plan to make $ 25,000 and move to the US by driving Cocaine to Miami. When the drug master gives them a job, we are treated to an extremely lame scene of the three friends who buy clothes at the mall with music playing in the background. We see them trying to buy different clothes, like little girls who buy $ 200 to buy, cut hair, and then iron out like a shiny gangster (one character, Carlos, will always wear sunglasses this morning). Even at night. The day before they leave, the leader of the group leaves to talk to the drug master, leaving M and his friend stupid. They party, take a few examples of the drugs they are supposed to run, and break into their old school, play like animals and waste everything in sight. <br /> <br /> The movie ends when M tries to call his girlfriend, who hangs on him. The friends then continue to fire the payphone, which brings out a lot of children and an old man with a gun. M and Carlos' friend in charge of the drug show point out his motorcycle and want them to leave with him now. Then he takes himself off and is shot by that old man. The police show up and arrest M and his friends (but not the man who shot the man) and cover their dead friend with newspapers as music and it disappears into credits. <br /> <br /> **** End Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> I even watched this movie a second time, hoping to see a subtle, redeeming factor , but I didn't. A complete waste of 102 minutes. Although I have to admit that I am fair and not move away from disturbing elements, the decisive, acting and overall direction leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> IMHO, if you are interested in a movie exploring the issues that this one would assume, would rather rent the City of God (Cidade de Deus). Avoid this trash at all costs! You have been warned !!
