Royal Rumble 1988 bored my pretty damn well. The rubbish itself is pretty unpredictable, filled with middle hoods and a winner who really had no point in winning and why did the Young Stallion Vs The Islanders do the main event on earth? half of the crowd remained. Jessie Ventura sounds bored by half the thing, and you can say when he calls, he finds the development of Hogan Vs Andre more interesting. McMahon and Ventura don't have the chemistry of Gorilla and Jessie. <br /> <br /> Ricky Steamboat vs Ravishing Rick Rude. This very disappointing game, with too much rest, and too much of a low tempo. If it gets so crazy in the last 5 minutes, it's too little, too late. Steamboat wins by DQ. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> Next, Dino Bravo is trying to set up a new bank press record, with Ventura mocking him. Horrendous segment, with no entertainment value ever. Ventura isn't nearly enough to carry this segment, and even McMahon admits it's boring. Controversy or not, I wasted enough time on this shit. <br /> <br /> WWF Wife's Tag Team Championship. <br /> <br /> 2 of 3 traps. <br /> <br /> The Glamor Girls | C | / W Jimmy Hart. Vs The Spring Bomb Angels. It's the best game of the night, no I don't joke! Many exciting things for Woman's struggle, and you will be hard pressed to find things right now, one day. The spring bomb angels were over, and the crowd won the monkey for their title. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> Contract signed between Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant. Hogan gets a decent doll, but there are some noticeable boos for him, probably because it's in Canada. A little to explain to my taste, but it was necessary for the storyline. This has made the point and has some effective moments, but many of the times I continued and said, "Continue with that." Both draw, and André hits Hogan's head on the table and pushes the table on him. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble Match. Very poor Royal Rumble, probably due to uncomfortable pacing, and the true lack of strength. I think Vince tested the water with this one, and it showed. Ventura seems unreliable, and I don't blame him. Crowds clearly wanted Roberts to win, and he shouted DDT almost every 5 minutes. He was in there, and while Duggan got a good doll, I don't believe he was the winner they wanted and where did his career go? Nowhere. Bret's 1st ever Royal Rumble, and he made an impressive show. It wasn't terrible, but it was rather slim, and it didn't have enough to make the show, as it was based on the show. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Hogan interviewed Craig DeGeorge. Standard Hulkster maintenance, but not with the same madness, and unpleasant comments he usually draws. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Ted and André get an interview. André claims he will give the championship to Mr. Dibi liver. Short but effective. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> 2 out of 3 waterfalls. <br /> <br /> The Islanders Vs The Young Stallions. Crowd is completely dead, and half of them are tied to the exit bolt. It was pretty boring and had no business in the main event. Jessie and Vince seem bored and argue about other things while the match is taking place. Islanders win because of Roma's injury. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Historically important, I think, but there is really nothing to see here. It was just a starting point for great things to come for the Royal Rumble, and while you can see a spectacle of potential, there's nothing here, go out of your way to see it. I usually recommend Die Hard Wrestling fans at once, and if it's the 1st Royal Rumble event, I think so too, but make sure I get bored much of the time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
