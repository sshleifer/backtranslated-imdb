I bought it out of curiosity. How did John Carradine (who died in 1988) and Cameron Mitchell (who died in 1994) made a film in 1995? Thanks to the miracle of unused film, imagery that probably sits on a shelf for about 10 years can be so! You can see because the movie inventory that shot their screens does not match the movie used to shoot Jack-O. Ed Wood's curse remains. The good thing for both Carradine and Mitchell is that it is exactly the kind of movie you will find on both of their movie cartoons. The same goes for Scream Queens Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith. <br /> <br /> The neighborhood is Oakmoor Crossing on Halloween, and a kind of curse is released when stupid, bitter-eyed teens disrupt a grave. The result: an assassin with a crook and a big plastic pumpkin on his head! He (that?) Goes to the healthy Kelly family for revenge (and kills others coming in his way). The father opens a Haunted Garage for the neighborhood kiddies. The boy (director Ryan Latshaw) has one continuous, confused facial expression for all his scenes and one hilarious grave scene. At least he is a child. The mother's eyes hold her head as she reads her dialogue. There is also an annoying woman who seems to explain things that attempt to pronounce all her dialogue phonetically. <br /> <br /> So, what about actors? You see Stevens, Wildsmith and Mitchell briefly on a TV screen (they use the time to push out). Linnea plays a bigger role than a babysitter, and she does exactly what she can. Her enthusiastic performance helps a little. There is also one of the nowhere laughs when an ultra-conservative couple watching a Rush Limbaugh clone on TV bites. The woman slides on a mat and puts a toaster with a knife. She exploded and the end result looks like a flame-brown Muppet. <br /> <br /> All in all, beautiful, entertaining things! I wasn't bored!
