"Snowball Express" from Disney Studios is not quite as dated as some of their output from this era. There are no hippies or hot-rodders, just dull-and-water Dean Jones inherits a ramshackle hotel / ski resort from a deceased relative. When Jones and family arrive in a sleepy Colorado town, the people who give them directions - like extras from "Deliverance" - are strangely vague about the hotel (we expect it to look like a one-room chef), but actually the hotel is a lot beautiful. Jones's teenage daughter has a sore look at her face (which doesn't prevent one of the local yahoos from learning), and of course, clumsy doll Dean Jones is a regular stumbling block, which results in many pratfalls. in the slush. Perhaps this square scenario may have benefited from some magic because this script is a frozen stiff. * of ****
