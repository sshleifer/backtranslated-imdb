What do you do with all the material that doesn't make the final editing of a movie? You can set this aside if a director's cut or extended version is released one day. You can sell it as stock stock to be used in a part of another movie. You may not be able to do this. Or you can collect it, accumulate more and more from every movie you make and use it to make another movie, which doesn't coincide or sense. Throw a very primitive skeleton of a narrative into it and set a number of opportunities (no, excuses) to hit your celluloid retrenchments. Excuse the amazingly stupid nature of the plot by putting it all in the mind of a horror movie director and you have a horrible movie. It can be done with just a few days of shooting. And idiots like me will waste two hours of their lives to see it. And then come here and try to warn others. The whole chain of events is one big waste of time.
