It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen over 300 movies in my lifetime. The frightening, the only light spot resembles the anatomical skill of the female role players. After watching this movie, it is suggested that the viewer not use heavy machinery or drive for at least 24 hours. Also a bottle of Valium will be recommended so you don't feel that bad for the 100-minute minutes of your life. The plot is nothing original, the dialogue is disturbing, and even the weapons seem sub-par. Do yourself a favor and go to your local Blockbuster and burn any copies they have of this terrible movie.
