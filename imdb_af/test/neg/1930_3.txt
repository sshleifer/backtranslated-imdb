**** Possible Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> If you make a serious movie with a powerful but aging father with three seemingly ungrateful girls, with performances of the highest caliber, with great cinematography and a beautiful Midwestern area, now where are you going with it? Why, of course, you want to create a modern tragedy after "King Lear". <br /> <br /> That's what I expected. It certainly wasn't what I got. What I got was 105 minutes of female tripe - one long unrest over man's inhumanity to the woman. Why wasn't there a decent man in the whole story. <br /> <br /> You see early where this movie might be headed, but you can't believe anyone will waste all those good actors and artisans about it trite scenario - you just want them to continue with the King Lear theme. But this never happens; and there is the real tragedy if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Apart from the panorama of the glorious rural heartland, the only thing worth watching in this movie was the wonderful chameleon, British actor Colin Firth, who practices his Midwestern accent has. . Now there was a spoil. <br /> <br /> 3/10
