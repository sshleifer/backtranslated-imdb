Flashdance is one of those horrible, silly movies that you really enjoy just because they are so crazy. I just watched it on TV and my friend and I were amazed at how dull it was. It's true that Don Simpson and the other producers got the idea of ​​a fairly inexpensive lowbrow movie with lots of sweet bodies to help sell a soundtrack of (dedicated, catchy) doll, so Flashdance is a strange kind of pioneer : the first MTV movie. Adrian Lyne has started advertising and shows it because Flashdance is almost commercial. You've already decided to see it, but the movie has this strange, panic-like undercurrent, as if it's scared that you can change your mind at any moment. It keeps selling you completely over and over, all the time, using smooth commercial style editing and shiny needles from hunting breasts. The story is wafer thin (I honestly can't think of another movie I've seen with less plot) and it never makes much sense, but it's a very compensated, calculating film, so it feels consistent. People say it's dated, but Flashdance was always rubbish. Viewers in the early 80's knew it's just Cheesy T & A, but it works in its own stupid way. There is sweet romance for the chick-flick crowd and piles of oily, writhing female bodies for their dates, all on a pump disco beat. How can this fail? It helps that the dialogue is useless, so you can grab a popcorn without missing something big and if this kind of thing is not your cup of tea, you can always laugh at the 'interpretive dance'. The scene where Jennifer Beals's institution was "dancing" on stage in front of a fan with a fan in it and a face full of white clown makeup had us in stitches. A real guilty pleasure.
