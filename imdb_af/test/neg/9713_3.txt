Pete's Meteor. I saw it as "authentic" and a jewel. I caught this movie on a Saturday afternoon. I wish I didn't. <br /> <br /> Apparently, it was known as Mike Myers' first dramatic role. Unfortunately, it had to be this movie. The first thing you'll see that Pete's Meteor suffers is a complete lack of plot. Or rather, a lot of small subplots that aren't really connected and don't go anywhere. Young orphan Mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with their grandmother. A meteorite land in their garden and is eventually collected by a scientist named Hugh. Despite the title of the movie, Mickey is the one who claims the meteor, and the "storyline" actually has little to do with the meteor in any form or form. From here, several other characters and subplots are introduced. But as I said earlier, it is not going completely. <br /> <br /> Things go from cute family movie to dark thriller pretty fast when Pete (Mike Myers) is launched and starts playing a role. Micky blamed him for killing his parents, even though we were never really told what had happened or why. Hugh has romance problems because his girlfriend can't get past his cosmic fascination. And Pete's drug-related past starts catching up with him and temporarily pulls his own friend and the rest into the mix when shadow characters try to kill him. It looks like the main plot is, until you realize it doesn't even have a half-way roll through the movie, so everything feels different than useless stuffing. Hugh's girl problems, Mickey's bad behavior, the meteor ... what did they do on EARTH? Not much. <br /> <br /> So the plot is incompatible and half of it is useless. But good throwing characters can save it, right? Keyword: good. The majority of characters are incredibly unlikely people, most of whom are sorry. At least, I know I would. Despite the title, Mickey seems to be the main character, which is a very bad move if you see him in action. He is one of the WORST little children I have seen in a movie, with a very bad attitude problem. He borrows a car, struggles and speaks Hugh (an adult) to take the meteor, trying to burn the man's house when he doesn't get his way, and even tries to stab Pete with a knife. You think a child like this is heading for the prison house. Unfortunately, one of the worst things about this movie is that Mickey never gets to see him. I'm not sure at what point you're supposed to be sympathetic to his character because he's always a nasty little brat. He is the lead role for his brother and sister, so they predictably end up taking and lagging behind and just following what he does. Unbelievably, they are being pushed back so far that I can't even remember their names. They can't even be there. <br /> <br /> Their grandmother is pretty much a borderline alcoholic. She tends to be so nasty to Hugh and Mickey, and likes to squeeze people out of her home and give them anger when she doesn't drink liquor bottles and drink her drunk. Very ridiculous when you consider that she is supposed to care for three children. Her issues with alcohol are never really addressed, though she falls into the movie from time to time. <br /> <br /> Hugh is one of the few nice characters in the movie, but it's just because he puts the bags for the majority of characters and takes their mess without giving it back. The children treat him properly, but he always comes back and tries to teach them and do good things with them. He has a taxi girl who sees every aspect of his life as a scientist as a personal offense, trying to leave him several times when he goes into his cosmic lingo or does something to prove he is not exactly on the same wavelength as the rest of the characters (thank you). <br /> <br /> Then there's Mike Myers as Pete. Pete, despite the only fixed purpose and plot in the movie, is extremely untapped and does not play any role until the second half. It is a pity that Myers was stuck in such a position for a dramatic role. Even when Pete gets screen-time, half are just Myers walking through dark streets and hiding in small corners. And even though he was the only real point for this movie, if his plot line ended the movie, it was a strange and unsatisfactory conclusion that made all the characters laugh at a good note, with a quick and strange explanation. behind the title of The movie makes you wonder if they are just playing the movie you just watch. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth seeing in Pete's meteorite is Mike Myers's role as Pete, and that is if you can venture through this unpleasant mess long enough without joining a other man because of the extremely unlikely characters and non-existent plot line to attack. No sir, I didn't like this one at all.
