I'll just start with a few quotes from other reviewers who describe it best. <br /> <br /> "It's easily one of the most over-rated movies of the year and probably the worst movie Tarantino has ever done." "The only good thing in this movie was the performance of Mr. Waltz." <br /> <br /> "So I was very disappointed and watched this movie in place. # 40 of the best movies of all time is the only thing about this, which lets me open with my mouth opened." read more details and read "Hate it" reviews. <br /> <br /> One thing I hate about a movie is when it's heard as a bunch of silly people. (Spoiler ahead). Now I know Tarantino's style is based on fantasy and fictional plots, but come on, Adolf Hitler and 200 top Nazi officials will be present in a movie premier in occupied France and you only have two guards in the whole theater and environment. Where also an American-African walks freely with steel pipes that close doors and light fire. These 2 guards are then executed in seconds opening the door for our 2 "heroes" to kill Hitler with an empty spot with about 100 laps ... very stupid. At least, our intelligence challenge and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (look, Valkyrie). Besides, Mike Myers's personalization of a British general is more realistic and authentic than the man Hitler does, just the picture. <br /> <br /> What further ruined it is that the only clever and powerful character who all cut at night The movie, with its psychological and mental bending interrogations, becomes effortlessly through the most indifferent character in the movie hunted. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I was sympathetic to Nazis, who were portrayed to have more courage and humanity than our Basterds !!! Imagine. <br /> <br /> My recommendations, if you have insomnia, 2 hours 33 minutes to waste or you want to give a break, check out this movie.
