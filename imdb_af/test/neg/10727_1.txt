Jim Carrey is a special mood and I personally think he's a good actor (for example Eternal Sunshine). <br /> <br /> However, this movie is thought to be nothing more than a Jim Carrey vehicle. be aware that if you do not think his comedy style is funny, you will be seated throughout this film, as it does not recommend anything else. <br /> <br /> Even if you like Carrey's comedy, I'm not sure you will find this movie amusing. I watched it on a Saturday night at 10:30 and the audience was definitely right to laugh. They giggled throughout the trailers, which were not very funny, but when it came to the movie, stubborn silence. I think it has about five parents laughing. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. It cannot keep in mind whether it is slapstick or serious. If it was stupid, it could be forgiven, but I also recommend making a point about the relationship between the two central characters. <br /> <br /> The strong point of the movie is the hold-ups, and there was a lot of potential here. But it only started halfway and remains largely undeveloped. Meanwhile, you should sit through the first turbulent 40 minutes as the couple's life deteriorates. <br /> <br /> Four separate groups walked out of this movie while I was there, and if my roommate didn't ask me to stay away from home (his girlfriend just returned from a month-long vacation! ), I would have done the same. And in my 25 year movie I have done it once before.
