This absurd movie was about a "Goodie-two-shoe" teenage girl who really wanted to be Valedictorian, but found her in a teacher's name, Mrs. Tingle. Katie Holmes, who plays this "goodie-two-shoe", is confronted with "the biggest dilemma of her teenage life" when this classmate meets her with the final exam exams that will help her get married. Tingle's test to nail. Mrs Tingle comes along, takes Holmes, the classmate and her best friend with the sample of her final exam. Convinced that the three of them are planning to cheat on this, Mrs. Tingle, enthusiastic about her opportunity to destroy Holmes once and for all with allegations that can take away any chance of Holmes passing her class. And the classmate, who believes Holmes, always wondered why she never gave him the time (he's an idiot)? Feeling desperate, Holmes and her friends visit Mrs. Tingle in the middle of the night trying to refuse her if they believe Holmes was planning to cheat. It all somehow burns when the classmate is bow and arrow at Mrs. Tingle points, and threatens her to make things good for Holmes. Mrs. Tingle returns, but eventually ends up as Holmes and her friend's prisoner. <br /> <br /> Ms. Tingle captivity under Holmes does everything they can to tie her in and grab her in her own bed to kill her fake pictures taken from the unconscious coach in bed with Mrs. Tingle. I curled myself when the kids joined Ms. Make Tingle's home home, eat her food and go all her private work. At one stage, Holmes Mrs. Tingle's degree book found and changed the degree in her favor and reduced the degree of her challenge for valedictorian. The end played like a childish attempt to bring back the comedy that was sparingly in the beginning of the movie. It solved purely irony, slapstick and absurdity. <br /> <br /> It must be the most unlikely and wicked evil. character Holmes will ever play throughout her life. I wanted Mrs. Tingle really helps dig a grave for Holmes. She was manipulative, selfish and kingdom. She even slept with the classmate, despite her best friend's overwhelming interest in him ... and she didn't like him. From the attempt to destroy her graduates' degrees through Mrs. Tingle's grade book to take her best friend's husband, would you think Holmes would get what she eventually earned, right? Unfortunately, she gets everything her heart desires, showing that it is evil, manipulative, selfish and gay, can get you whatever you want. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Tingle was supposed to be the character you didn't like. They didn't bring me up to that point to believe she was this woman who had to "learn this lesson." She was like every other strict teacher who even gave valid reasons for her resentment of the next generation. Personally, I felt that her opinions on young people were validated every time with Holmes and her friend's actions. I was hoping she could get free to call the police and nail Holmes. They tied her in the bed, picked up her food like a lot of pigs, drank the woman's wine, messed up her personal belongings, and we had to believe she didn't deserve to take a bat. heads? And the classmate must be one of the most neglected characters in the history of the film. Forget idiot, we need a new word for him who is not in the Webster's dictionary. He brought the big problems in Holme's life, then he made things worse when he was in Mrs. Tingle's house comes, unpleasant behind Holmes, and corners Mrs. Tingle with a bow and arrow. I was excited every time Mrs. Tingle had the chance to blow him out, or choke the wannabe actress's best friend. <br /> <br /> If you are a teenager and want to see when a teenager's manipulation and doing wrong can get him or her the world, see this indecent, caricature-filled, unintended movie noir.
