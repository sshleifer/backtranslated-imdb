It's one of four 1970s movies by TV writer Lane Slate about sensational murders in small towns. They have similar TV personalities as police chiefs and peculiar characters as villagers, including loving interests. The other is: They just kill their masters (James Garner, 1972); and the girl in the empty tomb and deadly game (both Andy Griffith, 1977). <br /> <br /> Alda's is near Vermont ("Mount Angel" along "Horse Creek"); others in California, Garner's by the sea (Eden Landing) and Griffith's in the mountains ("Jasper Lake"). Everybody tries to capture the feel of a small town, moving casual characters into a relaxed pace and telling a mystery with at least a complicated twist or turn. At that level, they are somewhat entertaining (that they are regularly recreated, suggesting they have a profession). But they suffer from overall thin stories and dialogue, bad pacing, blind settings, flat or exaggerated characters, and shutdown, forced efforts (often young or rough) on color or humor. <br /> <br /> Alda's and Garner's are the most serious of story, characters, pacing and tone. They have the best supporting roles, although Alda is better used. the Griffith is lightly compared. Alda's has the best director. <br /> <br /> "Shocking" has a surprise and drama. The killer's method is inventive. The tone is more even, and the dialogue is more natural than Griffith's. Alda's movie does not suffer from the other of the metropolitan transplants to the town or of hokey, exaggerated local characters, who are not figures of a Hollywood screenwriter (the worst offender is the Griffith movie's pipsqueak, mummy demon "whit", who told us, was trying to make and finish a jeep with a trailer that serves as a temporary banking department, dragged the harbor for the police boat, tomatoes from a farmer The truck was stolen only after getting nothing for them, and filling out $ 11 on the withdrawal slip of "Spiro T. Babylis" to be discovered by the counter). Graciously absent is the sounding, heavy-handed, repetitive style dialogue from the Griffith movies ("Are you going to lunch?" "I'm going to take out the boat." "Are you going to take the boat for lunch?" I'm not going to eat lunch. "You are not going to take the boat for lunch?" "There is no fish in this lake. Why are you fishing here?" "It is illegal in Horse Mountain." "Some law. There's no fish in this lake." "So why are you fishing here?" "I told you, it's illegal in Horse Mountain." "Please call Lloyd. My name is Lloyd. "Okay, Lloyd ..." "Call me Lloyd. That's my name. My name is Lloyd.") <br /> <br /> But Alda is too low key and petty to be taken seriously as even a small police chief, certainly not a reddish judge being asked by a competitive town. Slate acknowledged the character so much when he arrived at the scene of an obvious idea, because of a coincidental name recognition. Rather than detecting or investigating, Barnes blindly appears in emotional denial. His secretary Lasser feeds him an important idea ("Why didn't I think about it," he says!). An embarrassing funeral scene, plus a plot contrivance, leads to another gift idea. <br /> <br /> Worse, Barnes is more interested in the military style helmets of the country police sent to help him (Deadly Game also suggests Slate has something against the army) than to effectively them or his own men lead. He allowed a late murder by guarding an unknown target. Barnes repeatedly attaches his car to the killer fleeing a crime scene, without pulling his gun or taking control. Again, he was ineffective, and almost killed, in the climatic scene, arising from various errors on his part that are only partially rectified by accident. The volatile northeastern accent affecting Alda does not help credibility. <br /> <br /> There are plot holes. Why would the murderer strike after all these years? And to commit the first two murders without a trace seems unreasonable. But they are nothing compared to the latter - a few together, a shopkeeper in his shop during business hours, a full-fledged deputy in his office and amazingly his dog! <br /> <br /> Alda's film also suffers from some offensive elements that inject Slate into all the movies. Barnes first appeared in a motel clerk's bed. He then treats her on every turn and insult and tries to avoid her children. That, and talking about the female doctor, hitting a rugged, temperate pattern (Garner's film was described as "messy", including a scene where he and a deputy laughed at how a girl in the back seat of a car crashing in the road bit a part of her anatomy with her in a car in the car Griffith's function is a ersatz Ropers routine, in which the woman tries to embarrass the man in a car. a free locker-space exchange with a deputy in discussing a young woman's car accident ("Did you take her out?" "I took her right away."); "Bernice" as "excited in places" and to make and hate a peg in her and dismiss the secretary "Maude" because she was "too hairy", a description of the female doctor's practice as "two timetable tables and a flashlight ", a humiliating scene in which Fran Ryan statements Griffith, who has grown a little home, and an abusive subplot in which a woman, by a play-like Like a dripping buffoon, seems to sleep "). <br /> <br /> Finally, Alda's film has a dark, bleached, colorless, lifeless look. Only Louise Lasser adds spark. At least the other movies had spirit, scenery and pleasant music; Griffith came out on the mountains, on the lake, and even in the big city. You feel more like looking back at Masters of Empty Grave than shocking.
