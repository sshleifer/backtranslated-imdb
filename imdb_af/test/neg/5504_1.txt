this movie is the worst ever !!! sorry, but it was a total waste of good hours. quasi-psychology and b-actors make a baaaad horror movie. You can say that if you are in bad movies, you will worship this one. and the "hot chick" was not so hot. There is absolutely no climax for the movie, and the worst part is the finite song. a homemade thing with these words: "It is in a terrible state, the world is a mess. If the head of the fall of bodies and girls remain, they will not be clothed." Jesus! sorry guys, but milk is bad with this one.
