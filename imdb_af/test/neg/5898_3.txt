I rented the DVD in a video store, as an alternative to reading the report. But it's actually just more terror. <br /> <br /> While the movie may provide information from the report in the play, you take the word from the producers - there is no reference to the commission report anywhere. in the movie. Not one. <br /> <br /> The play is really bad - almost all the stereotypes of hot shot bitchy dirty-known government agents. Everyone thinks they know more than everyone. There may be a truth about it, but it really has a bad Hollywood stereotype. <br /> <br /> IMDb's user community ratings and comments tend to be more right than wrong, and I started looking at the ratings before renting. <br /> <br /> I wish I had this one.
