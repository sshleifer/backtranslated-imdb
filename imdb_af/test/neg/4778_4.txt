When I see 6.0 on IMDb, I was quite impressed and excited to see this movie, as a 6 for a horror movie should rather be entertaining. Initially I thought it was going to be a little disturbing, invisible evil power (the book didn't read) to fear the audience - but it turned out to be a bit more commonplace - killer plants. Regardless, I'm a sincere person with regards to movies, so I thought the movie would bring a little breakthrough to carnivorous vineyards. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this did not meet my expectations due to the excessive amount of clichés and lack of any originality. To curb this, the female main character remains annoyed with her stupidity. Unless the movie is deliberately a bad B-rated movie that is entertaining in the hilarity of bad, no movie should ever ever have a main character to annoy you if one expects the audience to care for the character. Such roles should be reserved for secondary characters. Characters were undeveloped, the specimens (plants in this case) left unexplained and clichés drank everywhere. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is slightly effective is the bloody / gory scenes, though the gore pales are compared to films like High Tension or Ichi The Killer. Consistently failed logic (such as why would a character not be at the top of a rope during a second attempt to hide in the ruins when it just broke and almost killed someone), even if it is a minor, just angry the audience. The movie could have saved itself by using characters or some story device to reprimand or "leave" the idiot characters who just did something stupid (or at least let the character recognize or regret her own mistakes). But to continue to allow idiocy to give chairman, the audience will surely abandon the care of the character, thus removing the horror of the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a poor movie. An example of a well-portrayed movie with a beautiful twenty-something murdered is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake (and the prequel too) that has certainly instilled fear and had far less characteristical errors. In summary, if you have a lot of time to kill, see if there is nothing else. Otherwise, don't waste your time with this sub-par flick and go see something really scary and very satisfying like The Hills Have Eyes remake.
