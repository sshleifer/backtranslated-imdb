See the film at Lawrence, Kansas premiere. This shaky story about a group of disgruntled high school kills killing prom queen was just terrible. It fails for many reasons - bad acting, bad writing, no clear point. But especially it feels like the filmmakers said themselves: "Hey, I have money, so let's make a movie!" - without really thinking about it. Most indie movies that don't make it, just suffer from that mentality. They just don't realize it's costing money to make a good movie ... or even a viewable one in this case. With this movie I do not feel ashamed to say that if I were not from the crew, I would have walked. As simple as that.
