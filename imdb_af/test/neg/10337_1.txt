I've watched watches like this all along to see if there are any redeemable features to justify this in my clients' video libraries. Don't look at it, not even for a moment, unless someone has a gun on your head. You will, as I have done, complain and groan at least 500 times and pray that one of the one-dimensional characters, all played by many bad actors, will kill and shoot you. <br /> <br /> Even if you are the biggest Sandra Bullock fan in the world, it's not worth even the two or three short scenes in which she appears. <br /> <br /> I want to kick the asses of the bad marketing people that Sandra's big picture on the face of this DVD box and get them thrown into jail to fight me or something. I really wish I had the opportunity to read a review of this movie before buying it. <br /> <br /> Please call me and I will pay you $ 10 to immediately remove this movie from my inventory before it stinks the whole place! (just joking - don't call)
