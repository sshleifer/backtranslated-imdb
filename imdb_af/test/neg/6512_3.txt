A not so good action thriller because it unsuccessfully develops the same water as early Steven Seagal movies, because there is not a very good piece of it. Steven Seagal plays the same kind of character he has played since the law. In my opinion, the performance of Keenen Ivory Wayans is wasted in such an average film and belongs to a much better movie. Bob Gunton is good as most important heavy. The best play in the whole movie belongs to Brian Cox, who is very scary in the role of the killer. My favorite scenes are the battle scenes with the Russian mafia. One of the movie reasons to watch The Glimmer Man (1996) is for the short look of the beautiful and voluptupus Nikki Cox. It's too bad that there were no more scenes with her in them.
