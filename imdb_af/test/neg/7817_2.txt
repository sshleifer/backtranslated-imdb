This is the first time I have commented on a movie I didn't watch for the credits. Reason for this is simple ... people have to be warned: this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium. I usually stay away from a whole bunch of bad comedies, but I saw it as follows. An unfortunate decision based on other Ashton Kutcher (semi-) comedies, such as A Lot Like Love and Guess Who. <br /> <br /> Where those two movies had their charm and laughter, it had nothing and I mean nothing!). The acting is terrible, especially the 'boss'. Tara Reid was no surprise, how dare she call herself an actress?! The premise is thin and the plot does not thicken at all. Not a problem if you manage to keep it funny and / or sweet ... but as you probably already guessed, it didn't matter! The writing felt that it wasn't quite finished and I wouldn't even be surprised if the director did some rewriting while shooting. My dog ​​could have written a more coherent script, seriously. And he's not exactly Lassie either :-). Stay away from these trips, even if you like foolish goofball comedies (like me). This low quality movie will not be enjoyed by many people. <br /> <br /> I never give (almost) one, so ... a 2.
