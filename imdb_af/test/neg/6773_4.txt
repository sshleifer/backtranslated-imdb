I saw this one, mostly Charlie Ruggles and Una Merkel, two of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The plot has turned and turned - it's not bad as a straight mystery on board a train. <Br /> <br /> But why throw a circus train wreck and an escaped gorilla? I can call it without being a "spoiler" because the circus train wreck and the gorilla have nothing to do with the intricate puzzle. <br /> <br /> The bad person trying to kill the good people has many tricks on his sleeve, but the circus train wreck was purely coincidental. It allows for a single scene with a threatening gorilla, but then it's back to the murder mystery!
