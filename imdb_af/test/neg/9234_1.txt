Altioklar: Master of the thieves. <br /> <br /> Watch some movies, steal some of them, write a script ... It should be very easy to be a director in Turkey. I think Altioklar looked at "Identity (2003)", "Saw (2004)", a few series dealing with crime, murder, etc. Then he said, "Eureka, eureka" (I found it!) Then he wrote the script of the movie. <br /> <br /> You can guess the killer at the beginning of the movie. It only took me 10 minutes. He shouted, "I'm the killer, I'm the killer." There is no mystery. <br /> <br /> Tamer Karadagli is the same (sux). Excessive imitation, funny macho man. <br /> <br /> There's only one good thing in the movie. The performance of Demet Evgar is very good. You can only see the movie for that.
