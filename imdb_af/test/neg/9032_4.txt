Have you ever wondered why these guys - Seagal, Stallone, Willis, et al - succeed in surviving all the rifles in which they are out of reach? I think I figured it out. The enemies always miss, and the hero does not. <br /> <br /> Here, Seagal has a pistol and a half dozen hardships. One of the swords has a shotgun. Or maybe two of them. It does not matter. There can be a thousand shotguns bleeding on him and Seagal will still explode with his ponytail. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to mano battles, forget about it. The males may or may not be armed with swords or knives or blunt objects, but Seagal, with his skill in aikido or tempura or sushido or playing or whatever, is brushing them aside with a few slacks. Not only is he a master of these outre skills, but his physical strength is Herculean. More than once he understands someone's long legs as easily as we would break a toothpick. He broke a man's SPINE over his knee. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you something. (I come here in the spirit of the movie because Seagal uses the line, "I'll tell you something", several times with, "What is supposed to mean?") These guys fully deserve extinction in any good Xenophobe's handbook. They are all black, speak with incomprehensible Jah-MAY-can accent, wear bells, who immediately need a shampoo, torture and murder with aplomb, and here is the worst part. They are unchristian. That's right. They practice voodoo. <br /> <br /> Actually, the voodoo element comes close to the most interesting feature of the movie. They had the ingredients of the ritual reasonably well - cigar cigar, rum spit, the sacrificial chicken. They only left the possession dance in which the spirit drove the dancer. They had to read Metraux on voodoo. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the plot adheres to common conventions. What was done to Jaqueline Bissett by voodoo practitioners in "The Deep" is done here to a friend of Seagal's. What John Wayne did when he held the trucks in "McQ" is done here at Seagal himself. At the opening of the movie, when Seagal made a brief speech on seeing too much senseless violence in his DEA career, he was now happily retired. And when we got to know his friends and family, I tried to keep his affiliates looking to see if I could choose which one would be terribly murdered or mutilated to generate his vengeance. <br /> <br /> Acting doesn't really require much comment. But Charles, the Jamaican policeman, played by Tom Wright, is really pretty good. Wright has considerable scope. Here he is a co-worker of dubious marriage, rather sinister. But in "The Pentagon Wars" he has a comic part that he perfectly endorses. <br /> <br /> The Jamaican never flew as movie corks. I don't know why exactly. It's a small movie market. And if you go to Jamaica, stay at Montego Bay. However, if you want to see Jamaican voodoo drug dealers as heavy and if you are in the mood for another typical standard action, it should be a satisfying view.
