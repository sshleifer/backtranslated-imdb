I am currently watching this movie and I have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now. The acting is ridiculous. Half of the role players should be retired with porn actors, and to kick off porn, you can imagine the quality of acting. <br /> <br /> The graphics are different from anything I've ever seen. I think there are puppet shows with more credibility. They can't even afford spaces for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters. Perhaps I should also notice how incredibly impressed I am with the number of dots their pistols can hold. <br /> <br /> If you are asked to summarize the movie, I would say that someone rolled up a group of full-hundred hopers at the local excavation show, slapped them on an island, added unnecessarily intense music and a 6 year old does the editing. <br /> <br /> I honestly can't formulate any possible explanation why this movie was released, recorded on DVD and cost $ 6 for one day from my local video store. As something, I got the benefit of knowing that I'm much smarter than all parties involved in this movie. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie with great intensity. Why? I wish I knew Captain, I wish I knew ....
