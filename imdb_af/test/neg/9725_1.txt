From the beginning of this movie, with the "Lost Boys", the opening sequence turns off, the bad wirework and even worse dialogue end, this movie snapped up. "The covenant" has highly recommended some of my co-workers, and I am convinced that I play a practical joke. At least I hope it was the intention and their taste is not so bad! This movie wasn't much longer than half an hour, but felt much longer. The story was so basic that it could be summed up in about 15 minutes, maximum. They could have filled at least the rest of the movie with some entertaining magic or fighting scenes, but someone decided (maybe the director, but I don't know if anyone really directed this movie) that it would be filled with " some poorly executed "artsy" camera shots, and careless scenes of "boys" swimming and fighting. About half through this movie I thought my head might cling to a wall, be more entertaining, and partly to get rid of this awful dirty feeling I had to keep it. . So I threw my head against a wall, and I enjoyed it more than the movie! I watched it to the bitter end, hoping it would give me more enjoyment. No, my efforts were rewarded with "How do I make you Whee-aytch!" I raised, and then I just felt embarrassed by the writer author and sorry for the poor actor who had to deliver this drift. The play was really not as bad as other reviewers did, but even the most talented aunt couldn't save this work, and it did it on my nerves! I give movies a chance, even bad because they usually offer some kind of pleasure, and it wasn't really the worst movie I've ever seen. After it was over, I felt like watching the movie "Stealth" again and WOW it was so much better this time! Oh yes, matter in point, don't save with this movie, really, don't. Watch some episodes of "Charmed" and look at "The Lost Boys" after having a good amount of alcohol and you'll be a much better person. If you fall into the same trap I've done and see the "Covenant", make sure you keep all the sharp objects far away from you, and you'll thank me for it.
