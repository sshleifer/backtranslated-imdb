Well, to start with, I'm getting as black as black straight, and I can tell you it's very sad when black people suck a "black movie". I can't say I've ever seen a movie or a worse story line. <br /> <br /> Snoop is my thing and everything, but he didn't feel this movie at all, I don't know how much they paid him to be in this bucket, called a movie, but I hope it's enough to wash out the scent. <br /> <br /> I'm all about supporting an obstacle movie, but this one was bad, really very bad. It cut leaves in every way, no real plot, story sucked, couldn't act and the best one was the white man! <br /> <br /> I almost asked for a refund on my way out of the theater door, half the crowd up and left before it was over, I still wish I had. Save yourself pain and go see something else, anything else ...
