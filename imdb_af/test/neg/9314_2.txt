What can be said of this independent effort, besides being shot with television cameras, and whether it is by mind or budget constraints, does not make it easier to look at this theme on Romero. I always reminded that I looked at someone's school project, at best, at worst, cheap. <br /> <br /> Author / director Georg Koszulinski (also featured in the film) does interesting stuff with stock material, but it says more about his editing style than his direct style, consisting of in-your-face closest to TV cameras that made me think I had access to public television instead of a real, honest-to-good movie. br /> <br /> The story copies and pasts pieces from various sources, including the aforementioned Romero's DEAD trilogy, THE ROAD WARRIOR (digging the stock image of a future that looks like the past) and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. <br /> <br /> What results are an hour-and-nothing worth finding for zombies and eating people. (Okay, the "people" in this case are clones, but it doesn't change anything. It's the same menu.) <br /> <br /> The year is 2031 and the first group of people who cloned nineteen are years before the start malfunction, especially in the diet area. Of course, when clones go bad, the first thing they taste is human flesh (or, in this case, cloned human flesh). It's not safe to be inside, it's not safe to be outside. It's just a matter of time before the carnivorous ghouls devour our heroes. Have you seen it before? <br /> <br /> I don't mind, people who rummage Romero, if it's done well, but there's no new area covered in this movie. This is the night of the living death meets the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, shot with television cameras. What is particularly disappointing is that the DVD cover looks like it has been shot at least 8 mm. It would not have been a problem for me if the story were not as cheap. The film provides a dark image of the future in which technology has evolved to the point where human cloning is possible. Should we still clone our favorite movies?
