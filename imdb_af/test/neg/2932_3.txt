I suppose Hollywood was not quite ready to celebrate homosexuality in 1997, so you might want to give credit to those who have put this movie for some courage. One simply wants the credit to be given to them because they have a very good movie, and I believe "In & Out" is not qualified for that score. This is the story of Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) - a small town high school English teacher who is challenged on the eve of his wedding by a former student who has won an Oscar and who then has to go through what can only be described as a period of self-discovery as he becomes homosexual. For me this was the first problem with this movie. Howard didn't have to be really gay. The movie would have been harder (and perhaps even more thought-provoking). Brackett was defiantly straight despite the stereotypical gay aspects of his life and the town's belief after the Oscar speech that he was gay. (In fact, I thought that identifying him as gay who gave the presence of those stereotypes might actually be offensive to the gay community, as well as to straight men who hold poetry and believe in attractiveness! <br /> <br /> <br /> Kline was well-behaved, and largely behaved in the film, apart from him, most of the other members (although good actors) were not really aware of their big screen success, such as Tom Selleck and Wilford Brimley and Bob Newhart are good actors, but not big movie stars, I actually thought the funniest (as very small) role in the movie was that of supermodel Sonya, played by an actress, Shalom Harlow. With stereotypes, I talk about her o-so stereotypical model line. "I promised to do this photo shoot this afternoon. I have to shower and vomit!" In the end, which really scared me off this movie, was the ridiculous ending , start the graduation (and to be honest, though someone decided that the graduation ceremony was really needed, the movie had to end there, rather than end up with the completely unnecessary marriage work.) <br /> <br /> Basically I got some chuckles out of it, but nothing more. 10/03
