After spending 2 hours of my life watching this movie, I came back and re-read some of the IMDb material to remind me why I first looked at it. In retrospect, the only thing I can think of is that the genre is about the general profession. But this movie was a total waste of effort. It fails at every level, and to see that it is described on IMDb as a comedy, really leaves me a loss. I don't remember more than a few. There is more laughter in any episode of law and order than in the last man. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Too many of the characters' interaction just didn't find me so well-founded and so very unlikely / incredible. <br /> <br /> If not, For the almost-free bikini shots, now, what can I say? Avoid this movie like the plague. Or paste it and just forward to the bikini shots. Don't even spend $ 1 to rent it.
