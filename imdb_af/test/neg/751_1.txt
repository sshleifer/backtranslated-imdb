Is it possible to give a 0 out of 10 rating? Because this one deserves it. While I'm not a big fan of Jane Austen's books, I put this one with two women. Well, at least we had a big laugh about how bad this movie is. Robert Hardy was the only actor with any charisma in the whole thing, though he exaggerated it as he usually does (almost as bad as William Shatner). But it was not enough to save this stinker from total weakness. It's often difficult to separate the girl's dream series from what really happens, and so many holes are left in the story that you can hardly figure out what's going on. Too much loose ends and the end feels like a "tune in again next week" climax. The main actress is too dizzy and strange looking for a heroine, the leading man is too goofy-look and effeminate as a convincing hero and the music sounds like a kind of cheap new-age pet project from the director's hippie. daughter I mean saxophone ??? mixed in with some kind of spatial operational female crying?). So, finally, I suggest you blow the budget and order a DVD from this one as soon as possible. Especially if you are disappointed.
