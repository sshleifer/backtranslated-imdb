SPOILER ALERT !! <br /> <br /> I'm not into a high tech movie that expects them to be 100% accurate on all computer related issues. But somehow, even the average "I have a computer" user, it's supposed to believe it: <br /> <br /> 1) A professional computer with top secret, special data <br /> <br /> 2) keep the primary copy of the given data on a 1.44 diskette <br /> <br /> 3) and make absolutely NO RESET of these special secret data. Even high school students do their homework again on goodness. <br /> <br /> This is also the worst representation of a computer nerd ever. Although she is super cute, we have to believe she has no friends, neighbors, extended family or colleagues who can identify her. Even the unabomber had a family that could change him. <br /> <br /> END SPOILER <br /> <br /> It's not just small bugs that didn't affect the movie - it's the big plot points that fueled the storyline. The characterization was terrible, the plot was completely unbearable, and if you didn't see it, don't bother it.
