I was so devastated by this movie. The tagline was something like 'The story of a girls sexual awakening'. You can only imagine how disappointed I was. I was then seventeen and I took my girlfriend to see it. I thought we were going to see a sexy movie that would make my girl walk away. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I think we were just not ready for a deep and meaningful movie that required an element of sophistication that we did not possess at the time. I'm not so sure I own it now, and I've long been divorced with that particular friend (sorry, really my first love). We left the theater halfway through the movie, my friend, who knew better, stayed for the whole thing. I still have the required result with my girlfriend, the movie just didn't help much. It will be interesting to see it again, so I can make a more informed criticism, even though I feel the experience has terrified me.
