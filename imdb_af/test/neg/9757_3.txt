Teen Exorcist is one of those God-horrible movies to make video that gives the viewer any expectations of proper entertainment for low forehead sexual antics, adolescent humor and empty writing. This film delivers exactly what she's trying to deliver. It's about a girl moving in a house where a Baron de Sade (hmmm) once lived and eventually drawn to him by her own inner devil. Her sister and brother-in-law, with an Irish priest, her boyfriend, and a pizza-living son, try to save her and drive her devil. Well, not much in the way of horror or tension. In fact, one line from the movie, make a few summaries of what to expect. Mike (the girl's brother-in-law) tied her up (the name is Diane by the way and she is played by Brinke Stevens) after trying her sister. He removed a gag from her mouth and said something like, "It won't be the last bunch we see tonight." Indeed, it was not. The special effects are cheesy and poorly made, and the film uses this by playing on its comic appeal. Some of the lines and situations are funny. Robert Quarry, old Earl Yorga himself, really steals his scene as an Irish priest. He is hammering it up with biblical verses and smearing Irish songs. You know you're in trouble when Eddie Deezen gets top bill. They do their schtick and also have some nice moments, but the material is just too thin to be something more than teen sophomoric time filler. Michael Berryman, of The Hills Have Eyes, also has a short but interesting comedy in the movie. As for the other thespians, well, they are all pretty good at being fairly mediocre. Stevens is beautiful in fishnet stockings and French panties, but she does not expect much from her. Her sister is played by Elena Sahagun, and she shows a little more than Brinke (a very lovely young woman passing by) and acting out of Brinke. Her husband, played by Jay Richardson, shows his ability to act and is amusing amidst mediocrity. Again, not a bad movie to waste a little time, which involves nothing. If you're a Robert Quarry fan, look at it for at least his performances.
