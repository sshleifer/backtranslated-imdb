Could they possibly be worse than this? Probably. But Steven Seagal gets everything he does. Well, nice; This time, instead of killing the bad guys, he just wounded them. Through the reputation of a bad donkey agent, Seagal is hired to deliver a special package from France to America. But it's not an easy task, with so many people trying to intercept and pollute the mission. The battles just didn't bite enough and the big bangs are just big and that's all. Anna-Louis Plowman seems to be the only cast member not to appear wood. Also in the cast are: Jeffery Pierce, Max Ryan and Harry Van Gorkum. Don't put all the blame on Seagal for this clunker.
