Crash is overwhelmed, over-thought and over-baked. A great example of how to make a pumpkin and self-important movie with a message. Haggis tries too hard to make his point and ear reactions in every category of film. It feels very much in love with its own sense of social relevance and has all the subtleties of a jackhammer to the skull. Sure, race relations are all and there is much ambiguity in the matter, but the universe of 'Crash' works to suggest that we are all victims of our own perceptions about race. This is a tiring thread that is repeated repeatedly in the first 30 minutes. I found the outcomes of the characters inconspicuous and forced, and the film came out forever and died. The fact that this movie is in the top 50 movies on IMDb is proof of the public's willingness to struggle through Hollywood malarkey. <br /> <br /> Indeed, if you want the right "Crash", look at one by David Cronenberg: dark, twisted and original. This film plays as a minister, tiring and masochistic.
