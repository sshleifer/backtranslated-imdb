Most of the other posts have hit this movie and do deserve it. I just looked at the technical incompetence of the filmmakers. It would be nice if the director had at least lunch with someone who knew what a gun was, because he had no idea. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! YOU ARE WARNING !!! <br /> <br /> Folly: <br /> <br /> Specs Ops team is made up of several military units whose members have never met before. <br /> <br /> Maybe two people were in the unit. weapons that used the same magazines, parts, ammunition, etc. <br /> <br /> The sniper school instructor uses a sub-machine gun (gun caliber) as opposed to a gun we assume she would be more skilled. <br /> <br /> One poor team member's night vision optics weighs more than the gun. You can know when he handles it, it's VERY heavy. <br /> <br /> The team leader sends out a team member to "challenge" the Skeletonman when they confront him first. Challenge A 200-year-old revived Native American long-spelled skeleton and an attitude that drives a walking war horse with a serious nose blood? I don't think, Bubba. <br /> <br /> Bullets don't spark when they hit trees, Director. (Some people have already mentioned it.) <br /> <br /> Teams "air support" consist of a ubiquitous "black helicopter", but this one has a few sidewinder missiles that are thrown from below. . Someone forgot to tell the helo crew that the Skeleton is not flying, and they are over the American heartland where there will be no enemy planes. Rather, they had to carry air-to-ground missiles. <br /> <br /> The helo air-to-ground arrangement consists of a semi-automatic AK-47 (or 74?) turret. Needless to say he was just getting dirty. A belt vehicle was carrying a belt. <br /> <br /> Later on, a grenade launcher finds out that it is also quite useless. <br /> <br /> A freaking-repeating bow woodpile does not make helicopters, Director. <br /> <br /> After that point (about 30 minutes) I couldn't take it very well and gave up. You need a morphine drop seriously to make it through this movie, it's just painful.
