"SHUT THE FRONT THROUGH" This is what I said when I was told that Blockbuster got a new movie called Snakes on a Train. Well, maybe that's not exactly what I said, but you get the point. I didn't need to know who was in the movie or anything else. All I knew was renting this movie. <br /> <br /> I probably had to ask what it was about. In retrospect, I don't know if I would really like to see a movie about a Mayan curse that causes a woman to give birth to snakes and spit out her mouth. And I also don't want to see a movie that sees a man who strangely looks like a pedophile version of Leif Garrett. <br /> <br /> Anyway, while the curse might be interesting at certain levels (well, maybe not), there was still promise that these annoying characters were being eaten or at least killed by snakes. So I was prepared to sit by the first hour of very few events other than a Texas Ranger forcing a girl into a nice little titty groove so she can keep her cocaine, or the Spanish shaman who occasionally stab people . But then hell broke loose and the girl began to spit more and more snakes. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * So everything is going well, and I'm prepared to ignore the fact that some of these snakes seem to be 25 feet tall. After all, people are eaten, so it's all good. But then suddenly, and I'm not going to tell you, because it will spoil the best part, one of the snakes is about 300 feet long. Then it continues to push and devour the train, with all the graphic works of Serpentaur from the old GI Joe cartoons. Unfortunately, I couldn't make a Nemesis Enforcer connection to this movie. Anyway, so you would think a snake that was so big that a train had eaten would be pretty unstoppable. Well, not if you know your Mayan voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from heaven. Yes, that's all I will say about it. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is bad. Really bad at the point where you might be deadly after watching it or hurting your brain. I didn't give it one because it didn't matter how stupid it was, it wasn't as bad as Date Movie. So if you like camp or poorly built B horror movies, this is the one for you. If you think it'll be cool as its bigger, more notorious brothers, just walk away from the box if you see it. And I'll give you a quote from the movie that basically summarizes it all. <br /> <br /> "Snakes can't get on a train!" Because it's not stupid. Not as they stop or make anything.
