Well, I didn't know what to expect from 555. Flawlessly, I've never even heard it. But being a collector of almost all kinds of horror, I thought I would grab this dark 80-year-old shooter. <br /> <br /> Basically, the storyline has to do with a killer killing every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. Which means the third 5 in the title ... no one knows. Anyway, the murders start as the killer searches for young teens wandering in obscure places. He decapitates the men and kills the woman. Then he continues to rape the dead body. The police think they have a head start on the murder, but really have no idea what's going on. How will they get the killer? Does anyone care? <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with some of the worst actors I've ever seen. No wonder, none of these actors literally did anything else. The three main actors consist of two detectives and a "sexy" female reporter. I'm sarcastic when I say sexy, she's about as sexy as it gets. The two detectives are like a two-piece and two-piece stupid. One of them undermined his part and the other one went to the acting Shatner school. The play is so bad that it forces you to lose interest in the movie, so you almost fall asleep. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps this horrible movie together is some decent gore scenes. For a movie on this budget, the makers must all have money in the special effects, which is not as good yet. <br /> <br /> Unless you are like me and have every eternal horror movie there, I would suggest making this movie clear. 10/04
