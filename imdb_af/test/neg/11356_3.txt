This review contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> I was looking for horror movie DVDs on Amazon when I came to the Flight of the Living Dead. I already knew of the name that it would be abysmally naff and probably a rip-off of Snakes on a plane, but it was brand new for 69p so I thought I didn't have much to lose. /> <br /> The music that played on the opening credits didn't fit at all. Although I liked the song, a pop rock song is not really suitable to appear on the soundtrack of a zombie horror movie. It started off surprisingly well, the opening scenes weren't too bad, some of the acting was a bit worthy, but not as bad as I initially thought it would be. <br /> <br /> It's all right to Laura Cayouette (Rocket from Kill Bill: Vol. 2). She is supposed to play a scientist. If she is, she is not very bright. Luckily she was rolled off very quickly. <br /> <br /> I actually laughed physically when the camera was placed on the plane during a turbulence. There was a nun. Have you ever been on a plane with a nun! I was surprised she didn't cut a crucifix. <br /> <br /> Eventually, after 35 minutes, we get some zombie action and use the word "action" loosely. The special effects are fairly below the standard, but it is expected from a movie with this budget. To cover in blood and have yellow contact lenses doesn't make you look like a zombie, but it makes you look pretty amusing. The use of slow motion doesn't work well either. I think this movie is probably guilty of trying to add too much story. Trying to overcome the problem as a "malaria virus" variant was not a particularly good move, as malaria is not a virus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is almost like any other zombie movie. Most characters are killed and eventually end up with a handful of people fighting to stay alive. Perhaps the worst part of Flight Of The Living Dead is the absolutely unthinkable end. I know it's a movie about people coming back to life and feast on life, but the end was just ridiculous. Rating: â˜…
