About your terrible movie copying Beethoven. As a professional musician, it is my duty to watch every film about any composer and Beethoven is one of my favorites. When Hungarians and Americans meet, it's a terrible combination of empty over the top emotions combined with the worst taste possible. You've proven it in your terrible b-movie. The only thing the movie carries is the music. Of course, you didn't bother to look beyond the good, but in my taste confronted performances by the Tackacs quartet, but OK, I have to admit that the performances at least have quality as opposed to the movie you made . It starts with the dying DEAF Beethoven, which Anna perfectly understands what just whispers. Beethoven's trial during the movie is getting better right now, but it has to be a vague divine thing. Then there is the impossible semi-pornographic "eyes wide-locked" double-headed scene that is completely over the top with the nice Anna and the crying cousin in the end (who also cry in the scanned scenes with constant red eyes, my GOD performing ). And because of the rounding of Amadeus, with Beethoven dictating music to Anna, not in notes but in total nonsense, which she understands perfectly, but no one else in your audience will even understand trained professional musicians. Of course, your reaction will be that negative reaction is at least a reaction, but I can assure you that Beethoven himself is turning into his grave because of your worthless creation and reason. This so-called tribute is blasphemy and I'm sorry to have rented one of the worst movies ever made, even though it's my favorite subject. Ed Harris and others, you can't understand the greatness of Beethoven in your wildest dreams and certainly not after a few lessons in execution and violin play. It's the trouble with your Americans: you think you can understand everything even when it takes a lifetime of hard work. Yes, we can do that anyway! Remember that a good product comes with hard work, talent, dedication and professionalism. All of these creators of Beethoven Copying are missing. See you in the kindergarten.
