This movie's basic premise is that everyone in the world can know that a person is gay except that person. And it's a man who likes songs, has good taste, and is neat in appearance. Must be gay. Yes, the movie is funny in parts, but the basic premise is to be homophobic and insulting that crumbles the whole movie into something that is quite painful to go through. The performances, especially Joan Cusak and Kevin Kline, are very good.
