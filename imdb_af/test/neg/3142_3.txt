I hired this movie from a local library without having prior knowledge of the book on which it is based or the movie itself, purely based on the chance that it is one of those rare, exaggerated gems that one can from time to time Discover and really enjoy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's not one of those movies. I'm not sure if it's a movie driven by sentimentality or worse, deliberate agenda, but some elements of it made it impossible to deepen. It is supposed to portray a struggling immigrant worker community trying to cope with the difficult realities of their lives. This is a good point of departure and it could have made a poignant story, but the execution just made me alternate to be annoyed and amused. <br /> <br /> Here we have a community of simple farm workers. who migrate to the US in search of employment and repeatedly used and abused by evil white men. And if I say badly, I mean evil. All white people in this movie are sinful, racist, sadistic, abusive demons whose only purpose in life is sexual depravity intertwined with the exploitation of poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it wasn't so unintentionally grotesque and hilarious. <br /> <br /> The portrayal of the immigrants is also a worthy example of exaggeration, except that it goes in the opposite direction. The immigrants are holy, clean and can serve as an ointment for boo-evil and oldies all over the world. I couldn't help but I saw these "field workers" digging in the ditches all day with their infamous clean clothes and chopped hair cuts from a top hair salon. A little restraint and a more unbiased hand at heart could have made it a much better movie, which caused some intended emotions, rather than sarcastic snickers.
