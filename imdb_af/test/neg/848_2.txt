1st watched 3/17/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Mario Pinzauti): Silly, sex-filled master and slave with too much intimate relationship movie. This movie looks more caring about sex than the story and kind of story around the generation. Laughable dubbing of the original Italian language in the version I watched with ridiculous end where the attempt is made to give an anti-slave statement (or should I say one line). What a waste of time for everyone who sees this trash.
