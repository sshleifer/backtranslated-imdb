... or better still, see Fandango if you want to see a very intelligent and funny male college age track. Rolling Kansas sounds promising (in fact, the program guide has given it 2.5 out of 4 stars, which usually means it's fairly viewable), but I passed it very quickly. Travel routes usually have great music, but I can't even remember music. The only high point was a small role with Rip Torn as a wise old hitchhiker / guru. Otherwise the jokes and timing have been missing along the way. The four main characters are unfamiliar actors and I don't remember seeing one of them in another movie. (Oh yes, I see that Thos. Hayden Church was in it, but he's in everything, good, bad or careless). This movie is about as funny as seeing someone else stoned if you're not.
