I expected this movie to be absolutely god horrible. Like "What Dreams May Come" or "The Truman Show" or something. Well, they sold it for Â£ 3.99 in my local HMV and it had Giovanni Ribisi on the cover, you know you can't help but love him, and so my friends dared to buy it. and I was sure it would be trash. Perhaps this is the only reason I could sit through this movie because my standards were never so high.
