I saw it on TV and wanted to watch, because I remember the article from the Spin magazine on which the movie is based. I was very disappointed. First, if James Belushi is the lead in a movie, it should be a sign that it is not exactly an A list production. Gregory Hines was a world-class dancer, but unfortunately not a great actor. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the actors in this movie are either flat or hammy, which can only be blamed on the director, who is this movie's worst link. Charles Carner tried to try Oliver Stone's "JFK" to portray the alleged conspiracy to cover the "real" child murderer (s), but without the benefit of good writing, an A list should be thrown or it should be say the talent. It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that such a worthy subject for a movie is not treated better.
