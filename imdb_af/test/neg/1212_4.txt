I loved this movie ten years ago when I was about 16 years old. My biggest mistake was to see it again, 10 years later. It is not the worst I-want-a-pilot movie ever, but it has so many mistakes that you can hardly think of. <br /> <br /> Queen's "One Vision" (along with the rest of the soundtrack) makes this movie better than the average patriotic nonsense you will usually see;) <br /> <br /> [* *** ------]
