Perhaps the worst film in the Kharis series, despite the presence of John Carradine (misappropriated as an Egyptian high priest) and George Zucco (as his predecessor, is hilariously harassed by a bad case of Parkinson's Disease) that Lon Chaney Jr. . support as the titular being - if indeed it was in the context of it, as its contribution at best is insignificant! It's a waiting 60 minutes by itself, but the standards have dropped significantly when compared to the two previous entries, and the end result is strict routine and not at all memorable. Just about the only interesting feature here is the fact that the female lead is the reincarnation of Princess Ananka, called in many earlier films, but never actually seen.
