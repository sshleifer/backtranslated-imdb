Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) picks up Danny Ocean and his team and demands that they repay the money they had stolen from him (in Ocean 11) plus interest. However, he retreats from violent action, but he is under the command of the world's greatest thief, the night fox. The team then has to break down a series of hooves to repay Benedict while testing their abilities against the Night Fox, who want to keep his position as the biggest thief ever. Simply, this movie is a complete mess. The masses may argue that it is "cool" and that Clooney and Pitt have performed well, but these are the same people who have a "Hello" magazine and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a good actor. The story is complicated, it is not complicated or clever and it does not have intelligent turns, it is just a complete mess that flushes in various directions hoping the audience will think it is cool and intelligent (Hello magazine readers) . However, any respectable movie guard will see the movie for the farce it is. While Oceans 11 was not a good movie, it had a decent fit, stylish and had some decent twists and turns. This movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up. It's as if the director and threw himself said, it's not really working out, can just have a laugh! Indeed, the cast looks as if they enjoy themselves, but I wasn't. I will not plunge into the plot as his confused evolution does not guarantee an investigation. The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying. The screens where Julia Roberts personifies herself (with Bruce Willis doing a cameo role) while it seems almost amusing is a desperate step to interest the audience. The movie is so full of plot holes that it seems like Arnie emptied a Uzi 9mm in the movie studio. Credit can only be given to some scenes where Night Fox uses Caopeira to take a lift against the backdrop of some funky music, but it's hardly justified to watch the movie. The final scene had the team in a drunken stupor; this makes the movie correct. Paste the original.
