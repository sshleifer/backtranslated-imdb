I love ghost stories and I will be watching a movie until it's finished, even if I don't really enjoy it. I rarely feel I have wasted my time ... BUT, this adjustment of the Bell Hitch story was terrible! <br /> <br /> It wasn't scary at least. What's with the comic relief moments? The dialogue was boring. Acting Inconsistent The film was too long, and some scenes were unnecessarily pulled out in me. <br /> <br /> The only good idea I can think of is the costumes and props. This is well done. <br /> <br /> I'm curious about other adjustments, but so far, I'll keep reading about the story.
