If someone at the National Lampoon reads this, please stop the curl you turn out of your bow, really now! Why are you watching movies like this? They are not funny and looking at the sexual content is really a waste of time. It's such a horrible movie you might want to shoot while you watch it. I'm serious here, guys, it makes Harol and Kumar blah blah blah, look like a real good movie (and we all know that H & K is one of the worst movies ever made). It really sucks, it really does. How bad is this? Well, even losers who actually like National Lampoon will hate this movie ... they will want to kill the director, I swear to God. I hate you, National Lampoon, already dying. Dying.
