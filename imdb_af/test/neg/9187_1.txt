Jeff Fahey has such watchful eyes and a dirty, treacherous smile that every character he plays looks shameful; therefore it doesn't really work to throw him as the good man of the piece, but the audience just waits for his character to crack and start blowing people away. Drew Barrymore, fresh from her popular role as "Poison Ivy", had to do this movie as a favor for director Phedon Papamichael (he was the movie maker on "Ivy"); played a character called Daisy Drew (!), she was immediately pushed. It leaves us with no one to look at, but Jeff Fahey and Sean Young (who haven't had a subtle moment since 'Blade Runner'). This whiteless manuscript, by Michael Angeli, relates to a police sketch artist who draws his own wife's face from a murder witness's testimony. Although it is not a bad idea for a plot, it will be much better suited for an hour-long TV series. This cable-made movie is short on inspiration (starting with the casting) and shorter on surprises. * of ****
