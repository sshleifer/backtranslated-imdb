Topical? Definitely. Entertainment? Probably - but just about removing a pinch of viewer's healthy sense. Reality? Only to such an extent that it was made on this planet. How many thousands of people had died due to a 5 meter wall of water in a city full of buildings that had been overrun. 25 meters high is quite outside me. Carlyle's line with the effect of "How can anyone survive?" When the lap shows bushes of buildings with several floors above the water, it is completely laughable. Furthermore, if someone joins him to an area (underwater) where a cylinder of air is not enough (that is, they are going to die), why not use the simple advice to take more than one cylinder? It is clear that the author believes that people in stressful situations cannot count more than one (one cylinder, one floor). <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this test, you'll be more informed and entertained by discarding and reading the DVD. The price information on the cellophane outer wrap. <br /> <br /> Spicy, truly miserable and terrible waste of screen talent. <br /> <br /> As for the sexist propaganda that suggests that only women can see through the problems to alleviate the solutions to be solved by the best men: even more PC tosh. Little wonder that First Blood, Delta Force, Navy Seals and other such films of little or no merit will always have a next, while these blatantly politically motivated bilge are created.
