I saw this movie last night, a satire of the reality-style programs that are currently making the rounds. <br /> <br /> What can I say. I absolutely hated it. Just as interesting as to look like paint and maybe one or two just a little amusing moments. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it has something to do with me, definitely not a fan of Survivor and Big Brother-type shows, but if it was a video / DVD, or if I myself watching the cinema, I would certainly not have tolerated more than the first 5 minutes. <br /> <br />
