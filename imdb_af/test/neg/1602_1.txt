I thought bedbugs were interesting and exciting to watch until the last episode, when nothing happened, his F ****** BS, your Americans portraying Muslims as terrorists, and the Americans as a hero, that's the other way around, I hate it if every American TV show is finally predictable. I was hoping the bombs would go into that stadium, but I knew it wouldn't be, it takes pleasure to watch it when you know the good guys are going To save the day, again Americans are the biggest terrorist , I'm the leader of them all. He has to blame for 9/11, and I'm P ***** because you're throwing these shows to us, what's all the f ****** the same! I have a good performance on terrorism, the so-called "The Whitehorse", and he himself is the cell leader, it's the same with 24, how ever 24 was good, basement is a mockery and should never make a season 2 , she's F * **** joke! And so you are American producers.
