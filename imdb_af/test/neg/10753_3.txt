I found this film completely and completely incomprehensible. I knew about his facts about Caravagggio, but here they were twisted and mysterious. The images were amazingly interesting, but I was more looking for a biographical and / or critical accounting of Caravaggio's life and work, not a LSD-type drug journey. The dialogue was very confusing and through the use of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes back and forth was extremely distracting. If it was called a "artsy movie", I would not have bought the DVD; Now I have a DVD that I will never see again and who will buy it? I do not prefer mainstream movies to those that require translation or explanation. Thumb on this one for me!
