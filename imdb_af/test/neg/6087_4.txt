How much do I like this movie? Now I'm not a fan of bad movies, but I like a movie that's so bad, it's good. This is one of those. Juan Pablo Di Pace has a good ass, looks fantastic on the screen, and definitely doesn't make a bad turn on his acting debut (I believe). Billy Zane is pretty mean and moody, though I still feel there is something more in him. I felt it in the Titanic, the look on his face when La Winslet, for example, had spit on him, completely broken, shocked and thrown ... violently! Kelly Brook is a pretty face ... not serious, I think that's it! It is worth seeing to see a very hot guy, some great bro fillers from Brook, nasty by Billy, laughing at the dialogue, enjoying the scenery and madness of the whole thing. I'm gona, look again - Yeah, I bought it !!!
