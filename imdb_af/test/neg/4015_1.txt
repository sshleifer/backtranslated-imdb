I saw the episode about life at minimum wage. It went as far as an Oprah Winfrey's appearance for that episode. It's bad enough that people struggle to meet weekly. Then this hypocrite exploited the problem. I did not appreciate the constant complaint of him or his significant other. Queston is how anybody has the power to pay their medical bills from the ER? sure he shows the bill is high, but he paid the remaining balance (from his own pocket) after his return from his bad experience. How many poor have that kind of privilege after 30 days to pay off their accounts. Instead, they hunger and "Peter robs Paul to pay". Complaining the episode is not a humiliating thing for him. The movie and restaurant scene is terrible. Another privilege is that poor people.
