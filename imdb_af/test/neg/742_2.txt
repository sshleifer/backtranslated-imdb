I'm afraid I didn't keep this adjustment. When I started to watch it, I had a strange feeling of watching a TV series of about 70, because of the filter and the musical score. I didn't have the final scene. Mr Tilney just looks dressed in his waistcoat. Jane Austen will never leave a gentleman without a coat. The producers seem to have made a modern misinterpretation of a romantic girl's dream. I appreciate the more modern JA adjustments much more, which shows an eye for these details, which make the BBC series so worthwhile. Sorry, looking forward to the 2007 adjustment. I hope it will be better and will show the benefits of 20 years Jane Austen adjustments.
