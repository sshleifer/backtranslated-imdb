My first warning should have been that this DVD was for sale for $ 5.00. But since it knew Sandra Bullock, which I usually like, I bought it. My disappointment with the movie started almost immediately. The dialogues are slow and stiff. The color is distorted. I adjusted the volume to hear the conversations. The acting is amateurish. Even the murder scenes are a failure. Twice dead people moved their legs. When my money shortage daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie, I immediately met with joy. It's an incredibly bad movie. Tomorrow I will give this DVD away at the white elephant Christmas.
