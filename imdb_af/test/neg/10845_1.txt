I rented this movie for about $ 1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) I've ever spent. It's LAME! I couldn't believe how they could come up with such a thing. <br /> <br /> The plot ... there is no plot. Everything you expect to happen means it only in a worse way. The acting was terrible. My dog ​​could have done better. The special effects have no effect - except to cause unbelief. And the cute lines .... I mean, why even save it? <br /> <br /> The only credit I can give for this piece is the opening styles. They were pretty pretty. And one of the reasons I decided to rent it. The graphics shown there are probably the best and most realistic CG of the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Total reality gets 1 out of 10 because it can't mark lower.
