Even worse than the incredibly boring "Exorcism of Emily Rose". It started straight ahead and until the mother told the father, "See, I knew she was in possession", in an I told you such a voice. It was a terrible line, which was badly spoken and it predicted the rapid demise of this incredibly bad movie. Each family member has a past edition with the priest. The father all accused him of holding his wife or even having a relationship with her. He eventually started killing his husband, and then himself in the obvious immediate lucidity after realizing that his friend had not slept with his wife. People die, others come in possession, and at this point most viewers no longer care. Except for their employee Miguel, none of the characters in this movie were really nice, and it makes it difficult to care about any of them. The acting was terrible and the writing was even worse. Glad I saw it for free; Although I feel that for a movie this bad someone owes me money for the time I lost.
