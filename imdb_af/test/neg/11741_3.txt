What an embarrassment ... It's not right on the original with terrible acting of everyone in this movie. Hitchcock must turn into his grave. The spectacle where Marion is murdered in the shower is just as ineffective and original. The only good thing is that they used the same music and it is so obvious that killing her in the shower. I rate this movie 3/10
