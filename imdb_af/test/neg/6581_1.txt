I am scared: there is a scene in this movie where a hobo hits his head on a tunnel keystone and explodes (without fireball) into a million pieces! It scared a kid in front of me in horror! ... In a G-rated movie! <br /> <br /> This movie can serve to convince children that Santa Clause is EVIL! His helpers are ugly, misanthropic, over-the-top and mean! When Santa Claus (here an anagram of satan!) Appeared, all 200,000 elves began singing "Santa Clause is Coming to Town" as if it were a Druid War Chant. Then, in the reflection of the movie's "Rosebud" object (a jingle bell that shows tips why you can't hear it, read: "doubt .... doubt ...)), appear old Saint Nick what looks like a stoic Donald Sutherland, his face glowing like Moses' from "K10C." When we hear him speak, his thundering voice sounds less like an old elf, and more like James Earl Jones's voice slows about 20% <br /> <br /> The poppy music is out of place, boring and repetitive, it doesn't follow any emotional threads (as in "Titanic's" very effective score). It just seems to be thrown at certain points. Generates heat and magic, which fails to stir, partly because it does not match the images of the movie, there are a few musical train wrecks (no pun intended) where the ominous symphonic score suddenly disappears into happy, childlike POLKA This makes the whole movie sound like it is in production! <br /> <br /> Finally, I consider Ree with other reviewers about how, well ... "dead" everyone looks. It sometimes looks a bit macabre. The movement-catching technique is good to let the Kings Island-like roller coaster train sequences seem convincing from afar, but close, "right" actors had to be used. Overall, nice eye-candy for the death of time in front of the TV, but not much else.
