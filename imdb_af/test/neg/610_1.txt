This show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat-idiot-blue collar butter with the beautiful (and sometimes sharp-appearing) woman and the gentle clean family (s). With this performance it is the fat-unfunny comedian Kevin James as Doug Hefferman who works as a delivery manager for a parcel service. He has a beautiful wife, Carrie (Leah Remini), who works as a legal assistant, and senile father-in-law Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in his daughter and son-in-law's cellar. Kevin James' Doug is your typical beer drinker, sports lover, watching television messy from a sitcom man who wants to see the tube rather than deal with his marital problems. He also has some idiot friends who give extra stupidity to the problems experienced by this show's couple. In addition to the few faiths provided by Jerry Stiller's crazy old man character, this display was generally unsuitable. Kevin James's unrelenting behavior usually caused the show's problems, which are usually solved by his wife. This show continued with a run sitcoms with the dumb father / man and their beautiful women who for some reason seem to be on ABC.
