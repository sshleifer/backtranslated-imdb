That's what this movie really does. A large piece of cheese. This movie is about a sister and brother Bonnie and Clyde-type duo who create their own party to attract and catch their victims and kill them. But for what reason? Just for the pleasure of getting away with it? Richard Hatch comes in as a wishy washy ladies man. A true BAD version of a ladies man. And he gets involved in finding who is behind all the murders over LA. He eventually meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest for you fun and entertainment. But there are parts in this movie that really attract me like the scene with Lief Garret, dressed in his mother's wedding dress, like a sissy in front of his sister, telling her he needs her and can't live without her . beat him over the face that dominates him. I can't believe it was LOVE !!! Well, I think I can. But it's worth watching, but just to see one of Garrets's worst movies he ever did.
