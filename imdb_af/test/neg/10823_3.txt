I rented this movie through Blockbust because of the Cover and Title! Sounds intriguing !! This movie suffered from the writing, it needed more stress. The "monsters" need more face. We needed them to have some special power and definitely more "O Sh -" moments. Photography didn't bother me, except for the scene where re-breathing blows. There were too many close ups. But otherwise it seems as if the movie is moving and the heroes have not really worked for their freedom. Overall, I would say everyone has a lot of time, even the authors. But this movie is definitely a below average rental. <br /> <br /> There is definitely better pick up. I would recommend Anacondas 1 or 2 for this choice.
