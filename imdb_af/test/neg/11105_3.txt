Seriously, Sci-Fi should stop making movies. They are all terrible. And this one had John Rhys-Davies in it, and he couldn't help the movie. Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito) captures the legendary Mexican chupacabra buck, and aboard a captain's captain Rudolf (John Rhys-Davies). The creature then escapes and begins to kill crew and passengers. Captain Rudolf and the crew then go to the essence, guns ablazin '. But they can't stop it. So they call in the fleet. They can't stop it either. Then the thing kills 5 (or how many of them are there). Then the captain and his daughter will find out with another man how to kill it. Stay away from this movie. The chupacabra looks incredibly vigorous, the naval men are shooting at the slightest movement, throwing grenades on the ship, and the play is terrible. 10/03.
