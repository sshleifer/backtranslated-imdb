If Daphne Du Maurier REBECCA sat in San Francisco in the 1950s, it looks very good like this excited, highly unusual noir by Robert Wise. Valentina Cortese plays a concentration camp survivor who steals the identity of a dead woman and steals herself in the life of Richard Basehart (who is also the guardian of the dead woman's son) ... it is absurd and over, but also topflight entertainment. Cortese is great, slow apart, for she realizes the mistake she made. Basic heart is fine if a little mix ... although the lighting at the end makes him very threatened. Fay Baker makes a very good Mrs. Danish-like caretaker. Show is a fine director and he likes things at a nice quick clip. He also steers a now-classic car accident with Cortese (or at least a stunt Cortese) at the helm.
