I'll give this movie a 1/10. This film is without ordinary film material and focuses too much on the current "skin trend" in Bollywood movies. I would definitely not recommend teenagers to watch this movie. What really makes me feel is how such an impressive banner like Yash Chopra Movies could ever be for such a terrible production? They may have forgotten to keep in mind that there is also a larger audience than an "adult" audience, who, if exposed to such brutal films, can destroy and grow their minds for things without sense and recognition. <Br /> <br /> Overall, movies should not only be entertaining, but must also be of some sense. Certainly, this movie is a huge disappointment for Yash Chopra fans, especially myself. I'm really disappointed with the plot, acting and everything else. Why can't people put in a fabric that can be nurtured after being confronted in the movies, at least once in the movie? The point is clear. I would like to briefly say: "Terrible - Disappointment - Very mature material - Lack of meaningful" substance "- Lack of normal psyche - Worthless - Can grab a Cornetto or a Temptations chocolate instead"
