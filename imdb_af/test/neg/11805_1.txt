No one can say that I have not been warned, as I read the reviews (both user and external), but as most of us were attracted to horror movies ... curiosity got this cat. (Let's all shout to the people in the movie not to go into the dark room, but you know it's horror aficionados are always dead to know what's in there, even though we know it will be bad.) < br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this movie left me angry. Not because it pretends to be real (who cares, is uncomfortable), or because the actors and dialogue are so lame (is it an unusual event in horror movies?) Or even because the movie is so bad (and I'm be polite here). What made me really angry is that the movie is not just a bit of BWP, but also a half-hearted lazy ripe. <br /> <br /> I don't believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could send BWP then kudos to them, but they didn't even try. The film was made with little effort or care and it is the most unforgivable sin in the horror (or any) movie!
