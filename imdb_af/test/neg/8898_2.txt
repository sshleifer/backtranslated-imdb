Although I rarely agree with the film chronicle, I must say that this movie, while not horrible, didn't care for me at all. And it all seemed like it was out of place ... it had its moments ... three or four kids that let me sneeze ... but most of the time I just sat and wondered why? why did the characters do this? Even Hot Shots characters thought and fell more ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a nice Norrlands movie, watch Pistvakt. There were more than random ethnicities just walking around to shoot each other on the Swedish tundra. <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed ...
