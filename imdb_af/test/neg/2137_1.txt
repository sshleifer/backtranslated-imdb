boring, horrible piece of italian euro garbage about a scientist who seems to spend most of his time spending the beer (that's what makes him american, right? Our scientists spend most of their academic life out of their minds, all the very great theories come from), who is studying something (dolphin calls, fish migration patterns, who knows). He hears a strange sound through his headphones, proving that his radio picks up a drive in Jamaica. At the same time, a Jack Skellington girl with one of the worst, bleached 80's bad guys I've ever been trying to testify is trying to calm down the dolphins in the seafood she's working, as they believe upset about the amount of fish which she has exhausted lately. The beginning of the film was a very badly colored story about two annoying, many Italian people whose boat was attacked by something that invisible underwater. The shining woman is never seen again (the best part of the story), and the body of the guys is found without legs. The thin, alcoholic scientist (who has an inexplicable English-American-Italian accent) and the stick-girl with the hay-hair begin to theorize that there is some giant monster under the sea of ​​Italy's coast. .Florida. <br /> <br /> They use the help of an electrician to erect an underwater dike so the monster can sing karaoke. This man has a beautiful girl, the only downside is that she pronounces Petrus Pey tah, but for some reason he is sexually drawn to the anatomical skeleton with the curly hair, a situation that is shining. <br /> <br /> The dubbing is terrible, the editor a spaz, and the storyline generally a yawn. There is a bit about how this strange scientific corporation genetically manipulated this monster giant shark squid-barracuda thing for some reason that doesn't make sense, and a very unpleasant, greasy, haired man is about women kill, again for no obvious reason. A dumb sheriff and his chief are with a female scientist (who we know is smart because she wears big glasses). At once, the female scientist takes the huge, terrible monster (yes, Ed Wood's giant octopus is more credible) with just a small hand wash, and she wins the game. Hooray for skinny little women, who of course make the best monster hunters! <br /> <br /> The solution to the giant thing's problem is to blow up half of the Everglades, leaving a dead zone for a few miles in every direction. . To hell with ecology and the environment, right? We must kill this giant monster! At the end, the electrician and his brook drive love in the sunset on her Vespa. since she was given over to her colleagues' death and he is not very upset that his girlfriend has been crushed by the crazy man with the greasy hair. Hooray for true love! Wait a minute, isn't there anything dirty about it all?
