I just watched it yesterday and wanted to read other people but got some high points. <br /> <br /> WHAT ??? It was probably the worst Asian horror movie I saw. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * There were just as many fundamental issues with the story. Much of the Asian horror has turned spirits, trying to help but only scary (with notable exceptions: Ringu and Ju-on). This is the case here, except that they are not scary. A pretty Asian woman who looks a little pale is not scary at all. The "monk" character explains everything as a complete natural cycle of life; nothing either. But the woman doesn't get it, she'd rather kill her and then let her baby reincarnate this poor ghost. My friend and I just laughed when she jumped out of the building twice and the ghost waited until the second time to tell her why she was following her. That information would have been nice to know before she started jumping, but whatever. <br /> <br /> * It said I was right in the middle like some parts. First, she haunts a ghost taxi (haunted by taxis) containing many extra hairs that are inexplicably horrible. Just after the bus stop, you should see it, because it's pretty messy. <br /> <br /> Even though this movie is a total bomb, I have given it an extra point just for the two scenes above. . It is a poor quality Asian horror that manages to make ghosts that fly almost beautifully into women's womb while trying to scare you with the same images.
