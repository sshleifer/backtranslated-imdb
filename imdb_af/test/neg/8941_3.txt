As much as I like from trains, I couldn't stomach this movie. The assumption that one can steal a locomotive and "drive" from Arkansas to Chicago without hitting another train should be there immediately on the Impossible Plot line board. Imagine two disgruntled NASA employees stealing the "crawler" doing the shuttles back and forth and driving it to New York and getting the idea. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, it's a good try. Wilford Brimely is the best at his Quaker Oats, and Levon Helm makes a good performance as his forced but significant sidekick. Bob Balaban is quite worrisome as the Corporate Guy, and the "little old take Goliath" story gets another air.
