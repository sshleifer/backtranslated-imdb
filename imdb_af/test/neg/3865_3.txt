It was such a horrible movie, almost a comedy sketch of a noir movie. The budget was low compared to a blocker, but still higher than most. But this is where they decided to cut costs that are totally weird. Some actors are least competent, while others seem to be dragged just off the road. One of them is the main actor, hes so much bad that I have clipped when he ever said something (he speaks through the whole movie). Then there are the strange costume choices. At the start of the movie, all the characters wear the clothes of 1930. They drive a classic car, but the background is a modern wind farm that is blatant. The costumes and some institutions remain this 30-year film noir theme. Then BAM drives into a brand new escalator with 24 inch fields .... WTF. Once again when a man has a night series on his gun, you get a shot of his face. She targets a man with an MP5 and tactical gear. In an equally strange contrast, the venues are brilliant and seem to cost more than the rest of the movie. The camera shots / corners are very good and show these places brilliantly in the screens. The director has a keen eye for a good shot, but not an idea how to do much else. . <br /> <br /> People who have to be shot for this movie. â–¼ <br /> <br /> The author The director The deciding agent The costume designer <br /> <br /> People to be tortured to death for their monotonous, monotonous nails on chalkboard speech. <br /> <br /> Anton Pardoe's lead actor, author, producer If you've ever seen the movie Hostel, I wish it would happen to this guy, but he escaped.
