I find it incredible that so many people (probably Poland) voted for this movie, and it gave such grades (mostly ten). OK, the movie was good, funny, but it was nothing special on the other hand. The only good thing about Kiler is the dialogue, rather not comprehensive for non-Poland. The script is primitive, the acting (except Jerzy Stuhr and Ryba) - terrible. It's too much ado about nothing - fortunately it's not included in the top 250. P.S. The sequel "Kilerow 2-och" ("2 Kilers") is on its way and it's just the same story.
