The new celebrity deathmatch is terrible. They kill the popular people and win the low budget celebs. I mean ... Andy Milonakis? Lil 'flip? Lil flip and Lil Wayne must be both dead. Lil 'flip sucks. The battle between Lil 'Jon and Lil's bow wow and Lil flip was MAD corny and short. They just have to kill them. Why did Tobey lose to Jake and lose Christians to Adam? they are better actors and superheroes. They also spend too much time talking rather than fighting what the viewers can wear. Everything seems to be rushing for some reason, they can't just make a long struggle? the old deathmatch is better.
