I write this while watching the DVD. I grabbed the laptop and went to IMDb during the first song. I didn't know anything about the movie, except a friend said the show should be good. It also has a decent Netflix rating, so here I am. <br /> <br /> Perhaps on stage it worked. But I have to say that the face of fever boys dancing and singing completely naked, just looks silly. And syncing the lip to a prescribed score adds the strangeness. <br /> <br /> Most of the songs and routines deal with aspects of male nudity. That's my idea of ​​nothing, sorry. The score, so far, is generic display of music. Nothing memorable, or especially melodic. Everything is to serve the lyrics. What I have to say sounds like they were written by a committee. Each song is essentially an elaborate joke. If the jokes were ten seconds, they could work. Do these few minutes of jokes. <br /> <br /> I now look at the movie through chapters - a few minutes until I get the core. Kind of hoping one of them would be different, or remembering enough to keep me off the next scene. No. <br /> <br /> Good. I am finished. So here's what I think. If you have any experience or long appreciation of music theater, avoid it - it's just not quality. However, if you are a gay one and one and never saw or heard a musical comedy, you can be entertained. Or maybe it will interest you if you have never seen many handsome naked men. <br /> <br /> I have.
