After I started watching the repetition of old Columbo movies, I thought they'd all get the same voice from me (6). But I'm starting to see differences in the movies. This has happened in some of the only past episodes, which have shown some beautiful genius directors, and show them in one, but in a negative way. <br /> <br /> The movie was so boring, I sometimes kept myself in the newspaper instead of watching (never before happened in a Columbo movie!), and sometimes it was so ashamed that I had to look away. The direction seems too pretentious. The screens with the "oh-so-mature" neighbor are a misplaced. And generally the lines and plot are weaker than the average episode. Then the scene where they debated to dismiss the trumpet (who was falsely accused of murder), is pure terror, really stupid. <br /> <br /> However, some applause should be given to the "predict". In this episode, the focus is on how the killer tries to protect his alibi and hide the evidence. I really liked it. But unfortunately, no focus on how Columbo reveals it all. And the "proof" that ultimately conquers Columbo is the silliest ever. <br /> <br /> Rating: Set between 4 and 5
