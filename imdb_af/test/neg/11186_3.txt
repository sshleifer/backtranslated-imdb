OK, this is a piece of historical film making that caused and banned a riotous, shocked people. I'll give it, so I gave it a 3 rather than a 1. It might have been before the times, but it's definitely the way behind the times. I'm a big fan of Salvador Dali and I loved Un Chien Andalou. This brief was fascinating with one creative scene after another. L'age d'Or was too long and boring - just an indifferent piece of pompous movie simply created as a poor attempt to try Un Chien Andalou by creating a full movie (and shameful Dali's name and fame, although he had little to do with it). Total rubbish except for a (few) few shots of "shocking scenes" separated by long pieces of boring non-action. A waste of time and money. Both my thumbs are down, down. It will be on my shelf to never be looked at again.
