I was eagerly waiting to see this movie, but when I finally got the chance, I was very disappointed. I had to stop halfway (or was it quarterly?) Due to poor writing and directing. Not to mention the poor throw! Josh Hartnett is the only one who can act, and he is much more suited to be the hero of the story. <br /> <br /> Well, basically, the story is just about a loose girl from the country who has been cheating on her for a long time. - Time decent guy just to have meaningless sex with a spoiled rich brat. This movie couldn't draw my sympathy, even when the author planned to do so. I wonder where the moral values ​​go? <br /> <br /> The actors are so stiff that I still failed to pay attention to the movie (a few weeks after it was interrupted by its boring nature). The spoiled couple can just upset me! What a movie! <br /> <br /> I think all the people involved in this production should sit down and review it together so they won't make the same mistakes next time. And next time they can consider Josh Hartnett as the lead ...
