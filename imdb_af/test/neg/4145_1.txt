Unspeakable starts in Los Angeles with Jim (Roger Cline) and his wife, Alice Fhelleps (Tamera Noll), driving in the pouring rain. Unfortunately Jim defeats the car and his daughter Heather (Leigh Silver) ends dead while Alice is being turned. in a wheelchair-bound vegetable. Destroyed by the death of his daughter, Jim begins prostitutes, and then kills them because of voices in his head. Erm, it's really. <br /> <br /> Written, manufactured and directed by Chad Ferrin I hate inexpressible as a movie. There are a few movies that you sometimes see that the "goal posts" move, as far as everything you look at, some movies are so brilliant that everyone's judgment is being judged, while others are unspeakable, so bad it sets " a new movie. It's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was seriously surprised by the huge positive comment on the IMDb, although I did not surprise the low overall rating on the main page, I do not know if I missed something for a start Inexpressible has no plot, it has no story not and many seem almost random. There was nothing in Unspeakable to keep or entertain my interest and as a result, I became a test of endurance to come to the end. The film is trying to be shocking with some blatant sexual abuse of a renter by a priest, there is a scene in which a disabled person scratches herself, it slams on the floor and her dodgy male nurse starts her healthy sexual bone feel & underwear. If anyone can find such a bit of entertainment, then I cut my wrists now, the character is the worst I had the accident to know. The dialogue is hilariously bad with some it sounds like it comes straight from a dirty torch porn of the worst kind. It does not work as an abomination because it is not scary, it is absolutely hilarious and honestly insulting to claim that it is a serious drama about someone who is suffering a great loss and is trying to cope with it. It's a senseless, jerky, bad piece of crap from Troma. <br /> <br /> Directing Ferrin movies like a bad documentary, the special effects are terrible and are of the 'Let's throw tomato ketchup on our actor's face & the audience will be convinced they are a gory death variety died. There is no graphic violence at all except a suicide where someone puts a knife in their own mouth. Considering the amount of prostitutes in Unspeakable, the nudity levels are kept to an absolute minimum ... <br /> <br /> Apparently unspeakable has a budget of about $ 20,000 and all I can say is where did all the money went? Oh, a quick note for the filmmakers, if you're going to play upright, make sure you don't have your actor's lines along a main road, as half of Los Angeles seems to be riding up. The play sucks, period. <br /> <br /> I think the total crap is unspeakable. It's probably not the worst I've ever seen, but it's right there and I can't remember seeing such a horrible movie recently. One to avoid unless you're a masochis or insomniac.
