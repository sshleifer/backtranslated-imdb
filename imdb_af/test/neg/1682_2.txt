I give the show a six because the show was actually a platform for Damon Wayans, as the Cosby Show was for Bill Cosby. It dealt with many issues with humor and I felt it was actually adapted to a laugh rather than having the jokes out of the character. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle An interesting patriarch and a wisecracking person. He's PHENOMENAL in movies, but in the show he was there for the wisekrack and even though I loved it, I felt the laugh was more important than credibility. <br /> <br /> Jay Kyle I loved her since Home Party and enjoyed her at School Daze and Martin, it was a big part for her and she made a good choice to choose this sitcom to join die. I also feel that Jay and Michael were more like the show, but Jay was more the woman who ran her crazy men and went along with his way of unorthodox discipline, as she might have felt it worked. Jr Just plain stupid, his character must have been well developed and although he has his moments of greatness, we are returned to the stupidity as if he hadn't learned anything, doing my nuts !!!!!!!! Not to mention that most situations (in episodes I've seen) seem to center him <br /> <br /> Clair The attractive sister who dated a Christian found her boyfriend's character to be more interesting be as she was (she'd be better at keeping movies, the authors had to do more to show her intelligence, but it's not stereotypical enough) <br /> <br /> Kady Lovable and the youngest daughter . I think the authors have made the most of her character except the parents and Franklin. <br /> <br /> Franklin I love this character and I think they derived it from Smart Guy (T.J. Mowry) who only lasted one season. They did a good job of throwing this little genius (the effort would have been if Jr were the smart, but also the deviant sides.) <br /> <br /> All in all, this sitcom is a wonderful thing and it is tribute to the Cosby Show, is well done, I love the show and wanted it to last longer than that. I can't wait to see the series final
