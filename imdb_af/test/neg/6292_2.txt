Insatiable British film from a Japanese novel about a very difficult young man who comes under the influence of a Hitler-like classmate and harms his widow's lover. A few good scenes (Sarah Miles, who discovered her son, looked her in the eye and confronted him in anger, the reconciling boy trying to sharpen Kris Kristofferson to his demise by being extra friendly), but what is the point above the shock? Ugly and uncomfortable, it doesn't show anyone who's taking any advantage (especially Kristofferson, whose hollow and usually horrible talk is out of place in a psychic mishmash like this). Cold without any sense of his own absurdity, it seems that director Lewis John Carlino believes a situation like this can actually happen. If he's right, it's much more shocking than anything in "Sailor". * of ****
