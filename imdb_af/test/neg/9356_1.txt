I can't believe the comments here in the reviews. The film is of course dated and from our comfortable point of view in the age of CGG, many special effects are now very unconvincing. But even for that, Helen of Troy is so bad that it's almost laughing. <br /> <br /> The essay is terrible, just awful, without any characterization. The performances suffer as a result, you can see as Hardwicke and Andrews look in anxiety of embarrassment, as they deliver the most ridiculous plain trite codswallop lines. The authors seem to want to explain almost everything in a terrible didactic script that enables the viewer to decide nothing for him / herself. The beginning of the film portrays the historical background as if no one ever heard of ancient Greece; I know they had American audiences to take into consideration, but the condescending way we've told everything twice to make sure we understand the action is really terrible. <br /> <br /> I honestly can't describe the commentary above film as a great epic movie. Even for the relatively primitive cinematography and the relative sophistication of today's audience, this movie really stinks.
