This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain top congregation as free men in the 17th century Brazil. The story is interesting and constructive. However, this movie, like a movie, is terrible. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. This is Afro-Brazilian pop music from the early 1980s. Battle scenes are fought against the sounds of cheesy pop rhythms that are best left at the disco or bad cops dramas. Admittedly, the lyrics are folk-ish stories of slaves' heroism. The special effects are absurd. Rather than insisting on the mystique of African religion and atavistic beliefs, they only make the movie cheap. They are absolutely incredible, and I do not mean in a sense of probability. <br /> <br /> Life within the Palmares congregation couldn't be the way it was portrayed in the movie. For this society, as shown in the film, is a once-off kibbutz, unanimous Afro-pop festival. In addition, it is almost embarrassing to watch the director look at the blacks of the talents as talented singers and dancers who just want to be happy. He portrays daily life as a series of dance parties in which the liberated slaves paint bright colors and turn to the tribes of the 80's pop music. On the other hand, they have an abundance of beautiful food, but the viewer hardly sees any work being done. The king doubts private property in a clipped and clicked way. When a man complains that people take the vegetables that he has grown over many months, the king says: "What comes from the earth belongs to everyone, as the earth belongs to no one. If they need food, they have right to take yours. "<br /> <br /> I'm glad I learned about this episode in history, but I'm relieved that a movie with such low production values ​​and that such worn stereotypes are probably not will be made.
