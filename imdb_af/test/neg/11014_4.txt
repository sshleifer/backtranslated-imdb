This is one of the movies I can remember when I was a kid and I recently managed to get it from ebay - 20 years later, it is nowhere as good as I remember it. <br /> <br /> The story is 'bleak' kicking, through a 'cosmic event' (there is another extra film staff in the credits for 'poor story development') that makes collective ants super intelligent. Ant species that made war with each other stopped contradictions and worked closely together. The thing I always wanted to know was to do exactly what? You never get what they want. Nigel Davenport and his sidekick travel to the desert where bizarre ant activity is noticed and begin to study the ants of an impenetrable igloo-shaped lab. Probably, the most different scene was, in my opinion, when the two scientists visited the giant square in the crop (like a square version of a crop circle) a result of ants hiding. <br /> <br /> This movie wasn't very scary because you didn't know if you had to fear the ants or like them. All you know is that the ants want people to leave the area so they can continue with their cables - but you don't know if they're really bad. This is not a sci-fi, because the 'cosmic event' explanation is too vague to be properly considered. This is more of a cooler. TBH the torches, brave hairstyles, stiff shirts with big collars and Nigel Davenports, unnatural big hair, provoked me more than the ants! Did you find that there are only six actors in the credits? Yup, right - SES, and you won't see any other people in this movie at all. Not even in the distance! It's a clearly clear low budget movie that is a bit vigilant because you probably haven't seen one of them. I can't think of anyway. Filming the ants is pretty good, they have to do months and months of filming before they had the shots they had to keep in the film. You might say to yourself, "How the hell do they get the ants to do it?" over and over, but it's all pretty simple. You will also notice that filmmakers sacrificed millions of innocent lickle ants to make the movie, so animal real peeps Stay away! Good for novelty, but you can't watch it more than once.
