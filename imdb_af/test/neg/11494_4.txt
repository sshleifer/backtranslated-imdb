I just read Forsyth's novel 'Icon'. I thought it was one of the most in-depth, detailed and page-turning books I ever read, definitely in my top 10. I have a DVD version of the book with Mr. Swayze got it. OK, let me first point out that a decent adaptation of the novel in 2.5 hours of movie time would be impossible, so I understand the teams' reason to sway and disagree with the book version. However, if I say, "I really need to say" difference, "take the characters out of the book, add a few, leave a few, leave the book's plot, add a modern new plot, insert Frederick Forsyth's name there somewhere ". I didn't say it was a bad picture, far from it, some of the effects were on top and the acting wasn't half bad. The story sucked and didn't rely on logic or reality. Forsyth's novel was so good and real and changed the facts of reality instead of exaggerating them. It could be so much more if it took its time and was made in a 10-part series. If you haven't read the book, expect a decent movie with a good play. If you have read the book, try it and forget it when you see it.
