Dark Harvest is about a group of friends going to a farm (it belongs to one of the friends' family or something) for a getaway. But there are killer scarecrows lying there (there was also something about a curse, but I forgot.) <br /> <br /> The play in this movie is terrible, I don't know what the director is. Think when he was actors and actresses. The script is the same story as the acting "terrible" (this statement emerges is very obvious, though.) If there was better acting and better writing, it could have turned "okay". <br /> <br /> Directing stunk too, I see no potential in this man's future. After all these negatives, this movie still holds a "fun" factor that bumps it into a two. The last plus is that they don't use CGI! My overall thoughts on this movie are it's bad, really bad, but so bad it's fun, so it's getting a 2/10
