This series continues to frustrate and irritate. How are they going to drag it for another year? Each episode presents more and more questions, while the answers are provided for very little. To quote another very popular site, I believe this show has jumped the shark. <br /> <br /> Will I see it now? <br /> <br /> Probably, <br /> <br /> Will they keep the show on the air until it ends? <br /> <br /> Probably not ... <br /> <br /> How did two qualified doctors not notice that Naomi was still alive? How did 30 plus people realize that a body is waking up and running with a knife in her back? How did someone have enough power to create two trails and climb a tree to ambush Kate? <br /> <br /> We've now set up a ghostbuster ... <br /> <br /> Same time next week? yep!
