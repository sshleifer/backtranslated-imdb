Well, finally, a view of this underrated movie. But you can't find a good copy, horrible copy full of green drops, editing is not synchronized, the sound sometimes has the terrible lift and sometimes you can even hear the camera recording. Overall it's too dark, a time to say, but it's not. It's a little slow, the first half of the movie, it all talks and loves each other. It is even odd that the girls in the 60s never wear a bra. When they enter the sleeping place, it is full of glory. Anyway, banned in the UK since 84 and still list the video nasties. The reason is simple, it's a pity for their time. It really has some boring dismemberement and it is somehow creepy because it's a handycam. So every shot moves the image, things they do with the sturdy camera today. The Terrible Ones could have been better if the quality of the movie was better, but still better than other films of the time such as Schoolgirls In Chains.
