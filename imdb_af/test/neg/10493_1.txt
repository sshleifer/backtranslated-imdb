People from small towns, high school students, fake rock music and a few weirdo kills, and especially not a reason, this movie is mainly a re-make of the Giant Gila Monster - except without the Gila monster, of course. <br /> <br /> Now, anyone who actually saw "Giant Gila Monster" knows it's one of the worst movies of all time, often so slow, it's not even funny. And I can't believe it in 1967, "Giant Gila Monster" earned such a reputation that young directors just die to pursue a sequel, let alone a remake. So would someone please explain why this movie was made? The dance series, incidentally, is historically interesting, but about three years old; but even that is spoiled, as it goes on ... and on ... and ... on ....
