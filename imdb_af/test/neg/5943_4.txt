"Midnight Clear" has a good starting point. A group of overpowering, excessive CIs are sent out by incompetent leaders on a vague mission to patrol an isolated farmhouse on the eve of the Battle of the Bulge. The GI has a group of non-German Germans, and it becomes clear that they no longer want to fight. <br /> <br /> There lies the problem. It's really pretty simple. If the Germans want to surrender, they do it and that is the end of the movie. If the Germans want to fight, they do it and that is also the end of the movie. So, instead of doing, the GIs and Germans also play games with each other, and even kick snowballs at one point. Interesting for one or two scenes, but soon becomes very irritating. This is GERMANS. The enemy. Nothing in this movie makes me think that they should not be taken prisoner or shot. The film points to making them more human. In fact, much of what the German characters have done, wants to shoot ME, including one scene where the German official refuses to handle a Jew or give a mere man! Why should I care about such characters? Just shoot them and let's move to the Battle of the Bulge. This is much more interesting, anyway. <br /> <br /> One good scene: The GIs come back from a record of the German position, where they had the Germans in their attractions, but didn't fire. As they walk over a clearing, they realize that a group of Germans left their Mausers on them. The Germans are about 100 meters away. The GIs then do something I've never seen GIs in any Sillywood movie. They throw down their guns and throw their hands up! Unusual, as it is in movies, it is a completely sensible response to a gun aimed at that distance. Although it looks far away, it's actually a pointy space for those guns. I'll have the chance that someone working on this movie is a rider!
