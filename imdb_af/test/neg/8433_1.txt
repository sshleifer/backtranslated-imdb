I've seen a lot of movies in my time and this one really looks like the absolute worst movie ever made in the history of film made all over the world. It made me 3 attempts to watch this movie. The first time I fell asleep after 15 minutes of boredom, possibly because I was tired when it was late at night. The second attempt I managed to get through 35 minutes, but I fell asleep myself again. I can go on like this, but I think you get the point ...... nothing ever happens in this movie. A complete waste of time and money. This movie really sucks. See it and you will know what I'm talking about. If you can get 40 minutes in this movie without shaking your head and wondering what the hell is its point, you are indeed a masochist. The only reason I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 is because 0 was not offered as an option. I just thought the world should be warned before either rent or worse ... buy this trash. LATER!
