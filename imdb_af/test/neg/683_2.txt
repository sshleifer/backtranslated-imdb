Excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors selected for physical appeal. It is rare that I am aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie, because I am just trying to go with the story and save the analysis for the second show. In the case of "Full Ride", the play was so poor that the film was impossible to appreciate as a story; I was too busy (during the first and only show) that ranged from laughter and nausea. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for most individual role-playing members, everyone in the ensemble is fairly poor, the individual talent constraints do not contrast with any real-world acting observer. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least well matched to the fact that they are too old for the credible age of their characters. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the writing especially requires intense and convincing performances to portray their characters merely Smith and Monroe's staggering lack of talent. On the positive side, they know enough not to look directly at the camera and they don't bump. <br /> <br /> Better to use a less attractive pair that could pass physically for the right age. The basic story is not very original, just another variation on an officer and a gentleman, but it would be a nice showcase for a talented couple of teenage actors. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know about it? I'm just a kid.
