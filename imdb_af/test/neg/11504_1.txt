When I first saw, I thought to myself, "What is it !!!!!" One of them shows where there is a perfect fake high school world with stupid problems that are considered "big". Then there's Sadie. This complete misfit for her friends and her family. She is totally obsessive with nature, it's not bad, but she compares high school students with animals! Like what is it? They also made her another Lizzie Miguire clone (yes, because the world definitely needs one of them!) Shes is also very perfect like most TV girls who make me sick! So please, it's a stupid show, it doesn't make sense, just skip it unless you like Lizzie McGuire or any other apps.
