It's a turn of Pulp Fiction. I thought it would be good for some decent laughs. Well, it seems this movie was really awful. The entire plot does not follow the Pulp Fiction plot. It turns to other movies like Forrest Gump and more. Some laughter came from this movie, but everything took it away from me 90 minutes from my life. Thinking about renting this movie won't waste 90 minutes of your life. Reconsider renting it and continuing and finding a movie that actually makes sense. Please, if there is a Plump Fiction 2, I will definitely not continue to rent the successor. Just a head for those out there.
