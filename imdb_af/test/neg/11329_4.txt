I first saw this movie when I was about 14, but I was excited to have made a movie about the 45th section. From Oklahoma and especially now that both my boys are 45th members, I would like to see it on a DVD. I might sound a little bias, but the 45th Division sometimes doesn't get the recognition it deserves. The History channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when talking about WW2 and Korea, but you rarely speak the 45th. One of the scenes that really stood out for me was when the Indian Code had talkers at work and the astonished look at the German soldiers faces when they couldn't understand this language. I'm glad that all the native American Code Talkers get the recognition they deserve.
