Joe was only released in the US in the 1970s. Despite respected notices, a reasonable checkout and an Oscar nom, it soon disappeared and was forgotten during the 1980s, before being reconsidered in the US. late 90's. Thanks to this long unavailability, his reputation went further to see it (inexplicably) alongside Michael Winner's original Death Wish. Although revenge is a theme, it is certainly not a movie about vigilance. <br /> <br /> The plot isn't meaningful. It's a flabby, hammy, and bizarre stages about a casual murder and the unlikely relationship that comes from it. This relationship and the largely class-based characteristics of his two are exaggerated in ridiculous caricature; These two, and their situation, have absolutely no connection with reality. <br /> <br /> Almost everything about the film is cantanker and greeting-aged, making the whole thing quite fascinating. Hippies are portrayed as clever and exclusive misanthropes. Hard drugs also let you sleep or dance maniacally with lipstick on your face. Most young women are willing to have sex with strangers in exchange for dagga at the drop of a fly. This is quite a movie of the 60's rather than the 70's, so why some industry luminaires started it in retrospective talks about the start of the Hollywood New Wave is a complete riddle. Martin Scorcese of all people even got involved, though probably just nodding the hug, toilet equipment of the grim urban cinematography, which almost four years later influenced the taxi driver. But Joe looks much like a raging tirade against the likes of Easy Rider and Bonnie And Clyde, rather than a continuation of the same rebellious cinematic ethos. <br /> <br /> It's not a film of any real artistic meaning - Despite Joe's indispensable rage on everything in his world, it remains a story of absolutely nothing - but its value as a cultural museum piece is unprecedented. Shoot on and off the streets of New York City during the darkest hours of the Vietnam War, and at a time when America (and significantly its cinema) was resurrected to the horror of the old guard, the film ends in its own entirety unaware and coincidental and say more about that period of history than several infinitely superior films that have tried directly to capture it. <br /> <br /> But as a movie? In spite of a truly surprising and effective end to shock, it's basically a Michael Winner movie, but not so good. How does it tickle your fancy? ** By the way, if you, like me, are a fan of random background looks, then Harold Steptoe looks at 1:22:11 in the hippie art gallery.
