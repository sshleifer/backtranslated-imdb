I'm a big fan of H. P. Lovecraft's books, and the Mythos wallpaper has pretty good stories and things like these. And in recent years, a few boys have come together who did films about H. P.'s work. ?? for the most part, low-filled flicks ?? and showed them to the public in places like the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival. Now, as I said, most of them didn't cut a lot, but at least they know the heart and the "soul" of Lovecraft's work and movies like "Cool Air" or "The Call of Cthulhu" - is what I would like to think - gifts for fan base and other wages such as HP's creation. <br /> <br /> And then there are people like Ivan Zuccon, who just rip the name and make a movie that would have been to see if I directed it myself and filmed with friends on the beach. This is what Mr. Zuccon did as it looks ... but while blocks like Aaron Vanek or Bryan Moore's earlier movies may not have been bothered, they somehow have more to offer, such as a story, real characters and a a bit related to Love Craft! Just blabbering names like "Nyarlathotep" or "Necronomicon" does not make a movie a Lovecraft adjustment. <br /> <br /> In any case, this movie will not only shake and hide supporters of the Mythos, but also for people who like good movies. 2. Licking over bad movies. 3. Keep good C-grade splash movies or 4. watch everything Gruwel wrote on the DVD cover. I will not go into the "plot" of this waste, as has been discussed by others on this page, but as I said, Unknown Beyond is like a movie I would make with some geeky friends. In addition, it lacks ideas for any story telling and goes into ridiculous "moronic-nonsense-but-it-art" things. Homemade movie of this "quality" is fun to see if you know all the blocks in it and ha-ha, see how XY coughs the fake blood we made from old tomato sauce and stuff? But hey, you don't put it in a DVD case, does it explain a real movie and want money for it? <br /> <br /> I give it 2/10 due to the I Dunno ?? trouble or something like that
