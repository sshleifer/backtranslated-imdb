Finally. Here is a movie that has done so much for the reputation of the men of Greece and Russia as "Gigli" for that of Mr. Affleck and me. Lo. From the city's details, the sadness and sordid life of some young Russian emigrants living in and around Athens and spending their time intruding, spending, pimping women's migraines and producing themselves ("But we're not gay because we're not not, you know .... And if we do, it's only once or twice with the same man. ") There's almost nothing here that you haven't seen before and better; just the Athens landing adds some novelty - even then there is only one scene or two that is picturesque. Author / Director Constantine Giannaris ('3 Steps to Heaven') offers a relative generic 95 minutes, in which the outstanding moments involve how stupid, sexist and (from the appearance of things) most of these guys are almost irreparable. (Interestingly, the gayer the old, the more redeemable he looks.) What really rangles is treating the women. Greek and Russian men want to give the Italians a run for their money for the well-known Madonna / whore complex. Has life in Greece improved much for women since the time of Plato and Socrates? One has to wonder. <br /> <br /> If I find Russians and Greeks in this review, I apologize, but even the non-emigrants pictured here (the driver, for example) crawl. According to another review on this site, the film (a hit on his home ground) was actually submitted by Greece for an Oscar for Best Foreign Film. What it says about the state of the Greek movies, I hesitate to think.
