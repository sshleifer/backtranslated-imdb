After seeing this show several times; I am thoroughly offended as a female that is so stupid, women out there who fall for this bullshit. I'm a little more mature than some of the "players" in this show, but I'm still alarmed that the entire dating game has been boiled on a game show. Where goofy dudes can spot their lame is trying to pick up chicks. If young guys watch it and use it as a guide: Don't !!! Save yourself the trouble and hire a prostitute if all you're after is a piece of ass. Maybe there are girls out there with the same mindset, but some I don't think so.
