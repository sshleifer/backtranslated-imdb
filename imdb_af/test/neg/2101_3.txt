When I rented it, I didn't expect to be blown away. In fact, I knew it was going to be terrible. It was just to see how terrible it really was. That's what with low budget horror. <br /> <br /> "Snakes on a train", not confused with the serpentine summer blockbreaker "Snakes on a plane" with Samuel L. Jackson, are about a woman sitting under a Mayan curse causes snakes to hatch in her and devour her from the inside. Her only hope of surviving lies in a shaman staying across the border, so she and her companion are pushing on a train tied to Los Angelas. Throw in a few passengers and hilarity. <br /> <br /> Think about it, but the story isn't half bad. Is not half good either. <br /> <br /> The play in this movie rivals that of a Sci-Fi original, if not worse. Trust me, it's terrible. The snakes were another problem. They are supposed to be rattlers, but most of what you get is mostly harmless garden hoses that don't attack anything and there's this rattling sound effect that really gets annoying. <br /> <br /> The gore effects On the other hand, while not on the Tom Savini level, it was pretty good. <br /> <br /> And another thing, the end alone makes for the rest of the movie. I'm not going to talk about this, so you have to rent it and see for yourself.
