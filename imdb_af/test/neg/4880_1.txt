I hoped this movie in a bargain box for an amusing bad movie. Son, I was disappointed. (except for avon.) You see, the movie is indeed awful, but so terrible, it's not even laughable. The plot, oh wait, there is no plot. I suppose you can say it's about the main character rising in the ranks of street fighting. At the end of the movie, the directors decided not to make any sense, or more likely, to die and had a monkey finish that directed the movie. PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ENDED! although the end didn't really spoil. The main character somehow ends up in a room with mirrors, a la Enter The Dragon, and then gets really angry, has a dumb flashback and saves a mirror. The end. Wheeee. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor of this movie was Avon's scene. He speaks to the competitive street fighter and says something about this, completely deadpan: "Don't worry about him anymore, sir. I've killed him in a sophisticated way. we went to the disco. We were very sweet. And then I killed him. "At what point the boss says," good work avon. you're number one. " And avon says "Number 1! Everything!" Alriiight! "The scene continues to say" alllrriigiight! "Over and over. The next scene is of a dead Avon floating in a swimming pool. Intelligent? I don't think. <br /> <br /> Finally I own the "Homeboy" version of this movie, which means the title on the box I own is "Homeboy." It shows a big man with a huge gun and screams. It never happens in the movie. man is never in the movie High quality. <br /> <br /> Note: I'm new to this review, but hell yes, I'm going to stop it.
