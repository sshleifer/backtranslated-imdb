If you see this movie in the TV list, you ignore it. If you're looking for something scary, you'll be better off looking at the rest of the X-Files. Previous comments referring to the incredible arm performed by the female head are dead. She is almost incompatible. The sum total of her series includes 'whiny and scared' and 'whiny and not scared'. <br /> <br /> I'm the kind of movie that enjoys a good 'bad' movie. But it's ridiculous. There is no direction. The plot is as simplistic as the set of numbers they keep throwing at you and much like that set of numbers. It eventually ends without meaning. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better spent turning off the TV and bathing your dog.
