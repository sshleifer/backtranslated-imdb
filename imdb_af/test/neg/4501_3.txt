"Destroy all planets", winder to establish for 'destroy all Tokyo' through the end of the movie, as a space monster resembling a giant squid falls to the reptile furnace known as Gamera. Actually, Gamera saves the Earth, from the beginning, and beats Varian Space Ship # 1 even before the first series of movies. The scene switches to a Japanese scout camp where we meet a few ungrateful young heroes, Jim and Masao, who take part in Gamera's exploitation after being kidnapped by strangers and radiated on board their ship in an electrified bubble shield. . <br /> <It is quite surprising to convince the boys to convince a scientist to work with a newly invented submarine that may be defective. Former boy genius Masao touched the unit to run in the reverse direction of the controls, but dr. Dobie did not think he would check it. At least what the boys have prepared to interfere with the control of the alien spaceship by playing switcheroo with a bunch of triangular blocks. <br /> <br /> When boss-alien Viras says "Activate the Videotron", hang your seats for rehashed footage from earlier Gamera movies where he battles Barugon and Gyaos. It takes quite a bit of screen time, but is not a fast forward button game to continue with. For the longest time Viras addressed an invisible crew, and when they finally appeared, they were Orientals who could fly. Suggest this! <br /> <br /> As these films are made for a youthful audience, it is amazing to see how gruesome some of the screens are. Gamera drawing blood comes into consideration, and how about escaping team staff. When squid tentacles started from the headless bodies, I was associated with the 'Alien' films; To merge the individual units to form the giant Viras was a neat device. <br /> <br /> I think the appeal for young children can remain in the identification with the two young heroes who make friends with a giant monster, moving freely on an alien space ship, and getting everything they wants with the help of alien telepathy technology. As the movie was probably made by adults, it could be a simple case of wish fulfillment.
