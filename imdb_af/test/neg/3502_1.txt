What a disappointment. The story line is so simple: "The good guys sometimes do bad things, and the bad guys sometimes do good things" - adapted them to a racist environment to make it smart, sophisticated and meaningful. It's not. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens is telegraphed and then switched over if you missed the explanation. <br /> <br /> For a movie like this to convince and move the audience, the ambiguity of the characters must represent and their motivation and action; Don't just put it as a series of 180 degree changes in the character of each character. <br /> <br /> Halfway I didn't want to waste any more time, but I thought I'd keep it up if it improved; big mistake, I had to stop then - it just got worse.
