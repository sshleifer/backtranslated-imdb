What can be said about such a pathetic movie? <br /> <br /> - Very bad acting! The main actress only looks like one facial expression: fear mixed with weakness. Like a poorly beaten dog ... The other actress (the one playing the evil one) looks like Ozzy Osbourne's female double, with a terrible red wig. The other actors are so miserable that they are not even worth describing. <br /> <br /> - There is absolutely no plot. The story begins with possibilities, but does not go anywhere: we know nothing about the meaning of 11:11, nor who Rayden really is, except the simple "she is angry" or "she is an apocalypse" is not an explanation. We don't know why parents were murdered, what kind of danger grew and why Sara was chosen. As the film is underway, we just watch pseudo-scary scenes, with bad music. In addition, the end says nothing: we see only two possibilities as if one of them was a bonus scene or the director cut. There is no plot, so no possible interpretation. <br /> <br /> - "11:11" is just full of clich√©s! It's so obvious that I can't help laughing. For example: the abandoned library or the bathroom counters, ghost silhouettes that go with a lot of wind, ... even the fashionable "scary girl" like in "Dark Water" or "The Ring". Of course, the main character at school is stuffed and looks like a stereotypical Gothic girl (dark hair, red lips, slim black clothes). Is it a duty to make her credible? I do not think so. Sara's psychology is so little developed and so typical that it doesn't make her credible or engaging. <br /> <br /> - Terrible direction: As I said, nothing original, everything has been seen a thousand times. and is used here without any real purpose. <br /> <br /> - There are some funny incoherences. For example, I do not know whether "ghost science", "paranormal course" or whatever is taught in American universities. In Europe, this is really not the case: teachers talk about negative energy or the use of "unmaterial" essence sensors. .. ridiculous. Also: how to watch a movie shot with a Super 8 camera on a computer screen in the sixties without spending hours of digitization (in the movie they immediately see it on the computer screen) AND how can you, on This old movie, isolate a small detail and zoom in and see a perfectly identifiable face? I wonder if the director ever tried to digitize an old analogue movie ... <br /> <br /> Finally, "11:11" just worth watching if you want to laugh a nice movie, or maybe if you want to fall asleep on your couch ... But it's an expensive way to fall asleep!
