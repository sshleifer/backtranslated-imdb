The movie starts with lots of voice over, a bad sign. Then it just slips down with silly and intelligence-abusive scenes involving trappers and Indians. But it reaches new and impressive lows when all the cheerful mountain men's squares dance in high alpine meadows. Meanwhile, the happy Indians are watching them. It's a better scene than the dancing cowboys in "Blazing Saddles". There is a slight error in this equation; "About the Wide Missouri" is not a comedy. <br /> <br />
