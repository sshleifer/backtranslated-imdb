An early 50's Cheesy "B" crime thriller, the story is droll, the characters wood, Allison Hayes and Abbe Lane are the only two sex pots that make it a catch, but one short shot, just a few frames For a long time, an 'el' train crossing the river crosses the State Street Bridge, showing the 6,000 series of Pullman-built cars painted in their original 1950s painting, as delivered in 1950. For traction fans like me, the one short take makes the picture worthwhile. I think movies like this one, Ulmer's DETOUR, D.O.A. with Edmund O'Brien, THE FUGITIVE with Harrison Ford, and others of the film noir genre, (metropolitan crime drama) make it interesting than anything other than knowing Chicago and San Francisco well and recognizing most of the street places. Otherwise it is a very tricky movie!
