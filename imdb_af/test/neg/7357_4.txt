If you come in front of a movie, you know you're wasting your time watching the movie. That's exactly how I felt while watching "Darkness". I can see every turn and turn easily. It is a combination of "The Amityville Horror" and a multitude of films that the occult handles. It's so stupid that I found almost satisfactory. I can't say I was completely bored, but I also derived the movie for my taste. Director Balaguer√≥ tries to repeat his early Spanish hit "The Nameless", but he can't break it down. I admit that a few rows were enough, but I just despise when I can find out what will happen next. I also hated to see good actors like Lena Olin and Giancarlo Giannini so much about this piece of liquor. Finally, Anna Paquin as the star of a horror movie? It must be a joke. She is cute, but she is one of those good kid actors who has become a very monotonous adult actor. You can live without looking at this one.
