Terrible. I hope I can save two hours of your life warning you. I just finished the movie, VAT. <br /> <br /> I love good cross genre movies. This is not one of them. Show me a sci-fi musical, a dramatic farce, or a religious action movie, I'll see them all. But you can't just throw epigrammatic quips at a rambling, camp, schlock horror party and draw my applause. <br /> <br /> I love philosophical movies. This is not one of them. Anyone who is surprised at the depth of intellect placed in this movie has not read a good book lately. Or ever. The "mindset" dialogue is at its best. Maybe it lost something in the translation. <br /> <br /> I love a good horror comedy. This is not one of them. Shoot! I thought I'd never start! Squirm? Only when I try to devise a polite way to give me feedback from the movie to the friend who recommended it. <br /> <br /> Rupert is uncomfortably good at setting up this movie, but even he can't generate it. I just wish he'd shot the director instead of the zombies. <br /> <br /> For the shame that the Inferno-led country should also lead this. Dante will turn into his grave.
