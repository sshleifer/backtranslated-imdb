I won't be too hard on this show, because I enjoyed the first season, but then things got worse. The concept is nothing special, just about a girl named Casey trying to handle a new step-brother, Derek, and his hard, rough family while gradually forcing her princess standards to each one. <br /> In season 1, the story was really interesting. I liked Casey because she was smart, strong, independent and conservative. She was well mannered and deep. I felt bad when she was harassed by her new step-brother at her new school. She was a perfectionist, but not as annoying as the later episodes. Oh, and she's dated a nice guy, currently portrayed as one of Derek's idiot friends. The season understands the true tension that tries to tie the title of the show. <br /> <br /> Now I can't say the show has really gone downhill, because the story is sometimes interesting, but I have now rooted Derek instead of Casey. Now there is little, if any, interaction between the two brothers and sisters. If they communicate with each other, it is only brief. Oh, and I don't want Dasey fans in my face. People, it's called INCEST, even if they are step brothers and sisters. My tolerance can go that far, but that's not the point. <br /> <br /> It's strange. Derek, as the antagonist, has become more sensitive over time, while Casey, the alleged protagonist, is more neurotic and unlikely than before. I like the younger kids getting more airtime, but the parents are even more clueless than before. But this is not the biggest problem. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we are forced to see everything from Casey's point of view, with lame, hazy background music. She got past and became more level. In one episode she was shining and wanted her boyfriend to be more chivalric, so that she deliberately killed food on herself and blamed Derek. Now, what happened as a strong, independent feminist? I didn't watch much of the fourth season, but I hear she is a man named Truman, who is a jackass, and is arrogant. Oh, I remember that fence episode. She constantly reminded him that she didn't like him, slapped him as a "sword", and eventually hanged with him because she could handle him? What the hell? Why go so first with such a guy. The first season Casey would have just knocked him in his ... Or maybe it would have been my reaction. Oh, and she's a cheerleader. Not that it's a bad thing, but I think she's been on one of her practices on her head. And in a prom episode, she cried because she couldn't find the "dress in her dreams," and wasn't quite happy until she became prom queen. One thing I noticed is that no matter how bad Casey is trying to tell her life, it's almost always on the way (she gets the guy she wants, Derek gets some kind of revenge, people keep all of her, etc.) Derek is rather immature, but I see that he really got ripe. I don't see why many people hate Sally. She looks good, and it's good to see Derek in a serious relationship with someone he cares about, rather than playing the field. He also treated Edwin slightly better, and is a good brother of Marti. <br /> <br /> Really, the show is so-so, and I rated it low because, despite a character development, the character I once admired became like any "fashionable teenage queen" you can be seen anywhere on TV. But it was good while it lasted.
