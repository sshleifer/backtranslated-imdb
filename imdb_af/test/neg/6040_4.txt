WEBS is a pretty strange movie, even though it is slightly visible. Richard Grieco plays an electrician who is flooded in a parallel Earth by mutant spiders or something. The film itself is made with a modest budget, which explains the limited spaces, and the somewhat boring script that does very little with a very interesting presentation. Basically a 90 minute episode of the TV show "Sliders", and nothing more. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review and reviews of other movies in the genre)
