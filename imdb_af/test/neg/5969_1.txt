I think the movie was one-sided that I watched recently and found the documentary typical of western filmmakers who were biased without substance. The fact is that prostitution exists all over the world, not just in Tanzania and not because of this fish business, there were prostitutes there before Russian and other business people arrived in Mwanza. Poverty is indeed endemic in Africa, let alone Tanzania and it is not because of fish fillet business. Indeed, the fishing industry has helped millions to support their families in their daily lives. This movie only conceals the good image of this peace country. As far as the arms trade is concerned, the film cannot confirm whether there is truth, as it does indeed look critically at the movies, but the authenticity of the filmmaker is doubted. It seems they are trying to prove their point by using a few characters for everything really done. Yes, Tanzania is a poor country, yes, there are prostitutes and street children, but they are not the product. It's just a common scenario in most poor countries, indeed the whole world, even in the western world. What a rubbish refuse. <br /> <br /> The pilot himself speaks of sending weapons to Angola, which is more than 2,000 miles south of Tanzania and the war in the DRC was also miles away from Mwanza. The director could not prove how these weapons were transported. Mwanza to the NGK! <br /> <br /> In short, the movies don't have focus and respect, it's pretty easy to find the character anywhere in Africa and have nothing to do about Darwin's nightmare or fish fillet. What a rubbish! <br /> <br /> The truth is that the Nile did not reject all the other species in the lake, as opposed to what the movie portrays and less than 25% of all Lake Victoria catches are being exported, the rest being consumed locally makes one get right.
