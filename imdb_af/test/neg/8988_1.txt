I watched this movie for the hot guy - and even he sucked! He was the worst - well, okay, I have to give props to that poor police rapist, he was even worse. The guy was not that cute in the end, he had the terrible accent, and he was the definite definition of Hicksville idiot who could not stand for his mother because he always loved it. Overall, if it makes sense to you, if I fetch movies at the video store, I think of myself as I read the back of a movie that looks like this: "Well, at least it can't be worse than Carolina Moon "The most horrible movie, and the most horrible writer, play - everything that made it, wanted to do my gag reflexes. It was the most horrible movie I will ever see, with Gabriela there too. I hate it and trust me, if any number under 1 had IMDb for rating, I would choose it in a heartbeat.
