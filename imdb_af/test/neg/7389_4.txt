A bad movie, but with one reel that is worth enjoying. For most of the movie, the jokes are bad, the songs are bad, even W.C. Fields are bad. Then there is one order with Bob Hope and his film ex; The dialogue is witty and the song (a version of "Thank you for the memories") light, cynical and delicious. Who parked this one bit? Yet, this makes the whole thing the original 25 cents admission.
