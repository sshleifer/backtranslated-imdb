The whole exercise is useless. Why doesn't the movie make it? The lighting is terrible, but the sound is just a joke. Like a high school production. Those who compile the budget for this film must be signed and quarted so that it can be made without the necessary budget for sound recording equipment. <br /> <br /> So much dialogue is incomprehensible due to losses in echo or lack of proximity to the microphone. Economy had to be made in any other area. The whole production is lifeless and just LAME with such amateurish half-arsed production. It lacks warmth, brightness and no design.
