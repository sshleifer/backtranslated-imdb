When I was young, I was a big fan of Chuck Norris. I just started getting all his old movies on video so I could see them through adult eyes. I remember especially having this one, and thought it was one of his best. Now that I'm a little older, I can say that while it is well-average, I still see it as one of its better movies. In a play for him, Norris plays a policeman who, through his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer, is being played. Serial Killers are all the rage nowadays, and people would like to think of them as a whole 90-year-old invention. In contrast, it is good to see where the current curse originated, of course, action flags (as well as stalkn 'slashers) of the 70's and 80's. While Norris is trying with both humor and any kind of human compassion, he is fiber and laughing, no one can kick anyone in the head like Chuck. As a big fan of Steve James, I can highly recommend this movie, also for genre-like Billy Drago, and to see Mitch of The Blue Brothers in a supporting role. Not great, but it's better than anything Norris did in the 90s.
