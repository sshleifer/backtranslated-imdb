This movie is poorly written, difficult to follow, and features bad performances and dialogue by leaders Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The premise, credible but poor (shelter drug agent, suggests the drug underworld) earns better than this Lili Fini Zanuck flop. The capable supporting film (Sam Elliott, William Sadler, others) was not enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie also features the absolute worst "love" scene in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the soundtrack is much overstated; specifically the rebellious, juicy without dust "Tears in Heaven" by the otherwise legendary Eric Clapton. <br /> <br /> "Rush" is completely unpleasant from start to finish. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
