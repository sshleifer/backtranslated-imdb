What I hoped (or even expected) was the well-known "stop motion" imagery and extreme slow motion, extreme zooming and all the embracing fish eye. Briefly, the art of a) finding interesting visual events and b) recording them in a way that the human eye cannot play so that the human eye can see. The things the other Qatsi hits made. <br /> <br /> I just wondered how the creation of the whole title would fit. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I felt the focus in this third part was on the message and not on the cover. That's good, especially since the message is so valid. But I already knew the message, and it appeared that nothing else remained for me. More than half of the film is sonicated or colored or pasted or altered by another filter. It looks very much like the effects your video camera does, but you never use it. Many of the images would have been better without the filters, like the giraffe and zebra hunt. You can say that 'technology or any human malicious source has disfigured our beautiful nature', but why do these seventies effects symbolize it? When there was more than 10 minutes in a row of this inexpensive look-out effect, I was ready to leave. The hope that the rest just couldn't be that bad left me. But then there was the slow motion: slow motion is good because it gives you time to analyze the moving picture. But if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frames per second, then there's just not enough movement to slow down. Please, record the motion-to-delay faster, such as the beautiful shots of the foaming and splashing water (some of) the laughing people and the drill masters. I admit that archive photos can't be rediscovered, but I've already seen a lot of those footage, but it could have done without it. It had to be a lot of work to search through the archives, and the effects couldn't be so easy to apply and arrange. In addition, much of the work was mixed together. It shows that the creator didn't want to lengthen or save the movie. But I didn't have a bit of the mixed stuff. The idea for that was sometimes nice or even clever, but the implementation was inadequate. The computer-generated images didn't bother me so much, but outdated. The 'bits' that flow along circuits (in the first part of the film) look more recently and were nice. Mandelbrot is always nice, the fractal mountain was less. I was happy to hear a cello playing an important role in music. A little less vibrato at certain moments would have been appropriate with Glass's music, but it's a matter of taste. Like all of the above, of course. I hope there will be another Qatsi story soon to tell where computer computing plays a less important role and it will inspire someone to get back into the field. <br /> <br />
