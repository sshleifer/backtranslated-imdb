This is the story of a news investigator who hates his work - which proves why actors - even as poor as Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington - are on the big screen and your neighbors! <br /> <br /> I'll say it all - the better moments show a little base to be really funny (not just wacky), trying to try, maybe take a few classes and time use to learn how to make a good movie. ("Dude, Where's my car" and the "Scary Movie" series has it all about this ... patrol.) <br /> <br /> The lighting was not; the production was not; and the writing had moments (the conversation from space - very nicely tried to be relentlessly executed). (It reminds me of "Dark Star" - it's about "lost in space" - but this movie is just lost.) <br /> <br /> The talent was the bartender (he has such a "dog") "so annoyingly said I knew he had to act ... wasn't he? ... now it's acting!), The Mark Hammond guy and Marty. I think I gave the movie a point for each of them ... 3/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> my belief: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
