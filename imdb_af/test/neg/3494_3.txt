Well, it was very good ... but Best Photo? Please, not even close. Munich was better, Capote was much better, good night and good luck was much better ... Brokeback Mountain - well, it must have won! The Academy voters look like modern-day Democrats - just be a bit of everyone, but don't take any concrete positions. That's why we have a complete moron in the US office. <br /> <br /> It was the WORST AA presentation ... and forgot about 1987 ... because of that. Hollywood is so scared of the bottom line that it can't be straightened. Many voters have apparently not even seen Brokeback Mountain. Get real and get it. <br /> <br /> It was the most pathetic year since I looked in the mid-60's and I was just two. Wake up, whoever you are. Hollywood is mainstream, and this happened to the Box Office in 2005. King Kong, the latest Star Wars movie, another Batman movie, a reproduction or any of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, and much more in 2006. <br /> At least there was original best pictures, that is Munich, but hear the one ahead, Capote - big; Katherine Keener had won, although we now know that Reese can sing like a Cash / Carter, etc. Syriana was a much better picture than Crash. The movie has been done since the early 1960s and we have to make it the best movie? What a terrible Oscar night and a horrible year ending in 2005 and another boring year in 2006. At least the BAFTA went for the best photo to Brokeback, and what about the terrible song that won? Pathetic. I think we only have about 20 years to go before America or the US before someone comes in and changes things a little. Perhaps it will be China, since they own so much of this country ... or India, because they have all the high-tech jobs and are the largest democratic country in the world. <br /> <br /> America has become the land of fat, pathetic and stupid. Garbage can be found in more places than Florida, West Virgina, South Dakota, and in the Midwest. <br /> <br /> Drive for a local McDonald's or Burger King. Order everything you want until you have a heart attack. Put yourself out of your misery.
