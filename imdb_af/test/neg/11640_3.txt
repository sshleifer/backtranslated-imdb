Our story: Two American naval deep sea divers are looking for silver coins hidden under the ocean of the Philippine coast. We prove: Extremely dull entertainment at its best, without plot in sight. Jim Brown has been completely wasted, provided his help in the manufacture of this 70-year-old war turkey. Richard Jaeckel is in his usual form. Don Cornelius and Richard Pryor are among those who have given special thanks in their contributions! BOMBS AWAY !!!
