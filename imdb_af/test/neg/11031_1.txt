This movie is an example of a small budget, ineffective starring, poor storyline and poor entertainment. These kind of movies are made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of the hard-core fans of bollywood movies. I went to this movie because I thought the previous gangster was tolerant, so it is. All I appreciate in the way the new actress puts herself into the movie in a very brave way is much like the Bollywood actress Nandita Das. she is good, sexy and behaves well. She definitely goes on her career. our mithunda was always good at his job. Finally, he has a little good at the movie. I didn't like imran because his role has to recommend him to improve himself now, as he has done many movies as a new actor and he has been seen as an established actor. This movie has nothing but the brave scene done by the new actress. Never try this movie.
