A wonderful semi-humorous tribute to expressionist black and white films by people like FW Murnau, Fritz Lang, Carl Dreyer, Marcel Carn√© and others. Allen plays a character captured in a Kafkaesque nightmare. At first thought he was part of a vigilante group trying to catch a killer and slowly realizing that he could be a suspect. The writing is a little forced (it is Woody Allen who is trying to be a concise Kafka), but the point is made and no evil done. The cinematography is interesting, about 100 shades of gray, but make sure you look in a very dark room with a good screen, or details will be swallowed in the mist. It is an amusing little movie with a few laughs that is actually "uh-huh". The acting is good, considering the strange vehicle, and it's worth checking out if you're a great Woody Allen fan. Also of interest to those who have knowledge of Expressionist films. I'll give it a 6.5 out of 10.
