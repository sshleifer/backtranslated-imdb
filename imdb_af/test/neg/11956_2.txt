This is an excellent example of a bad b movie. There are worse movies than this (for example, Titanic), but it definitely shares the stack of movie stunts. <br /> <br /> OK it's been shot in Kansas City, explaining why everyone is so lame. The chief looks like Steve Guttenberg, and is even more lame than he is! I didn't even think it was possible! In fact, he and the film's main girl are never responsible for the WORST DRAMA! It's not just that there was acting waaaaaaaaay about dramatic, and it was, of course, the scary one that combines a deadly one-two punch into a bad, terrible, uncompromising drama. <br /> <br /> The scarecrow can talk about him. The whistle you hear every time he is around is stupid, and of course chosen. Now his costume, I can't get over it - it's a man wearing briefcases and a stupid mask! I'm simply determined, maybe if your 3 year old with brain damage is scared of him / her. <br /> <br /> One of the characters, the token black man, actually uses the line: "It may be a chance to earn my red wings" if you're trying to get on with one of the girls at her time. try kicking. Wow, yes, this is the kind of dialogue you can look forward to. Oh, in the beginning when the slenderly dressed girl walks through the wheat, why is it turned off? I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be clear, but just one of the many obvious mistakes made throughout this movie. Another is the bad dubbing of the music number (that's right), there is everything on the beach and one dorkaziod gets the courage to sing a song and play guitar for everyone, and that is so obviously called his funny . Luckily the scarecrow answers all our prayers and throws a spear through the man's chest when he has finished singing. Overall, the gore is so good, it's one of those movies when you're rooting for these people to be murdered by the murderer. OK, there's a scene where the two guys bury one of their friends. in the sand, then stand up, swear their penis and blow over the man in the sand. Who does this? Really, imagine. "Hey, we can bury the boys in the sand, then get up and take our genitals out like not doing it." This brings gay erotica into this movie, what is hell? A good part of the start of this movie is the jocks in the underwear in the dressing room and maize field while doing the hazing. What's the hell with that? Traditionally, in movies and in real life, the girls and nerds do not. It doesn't really make sense, since all nerds think, girls and sex are, and apparently jocks are sports and being in their underwear is not. <br /> <br /> Lets come to sex. As someone who watched this movie with me, it said, "I've never been so disgusting to heterosexual sex in my life" and that's true. If you like a cup of action, or ugly old woman boobs, then this movie is for you. I swear, they've ever found a girl with the smallest breasts and that's who they get to do the naked scene? Then the ugly old woman's nurse shows her bounces a few times, and man, I just didn't want to see it. <br /> <br /> Now I have to talk about the timeline continuity of this movie, which is really really bizarre. It starts in the day, then everyone goes to the lawn, and within 2 minutes they are immediately dark in the middle of the night, as they drive from there, and they go to the beach. It's right away again, and apparently they stay at The Beach until night, and until the next day. So basically these events in the movie cover 4 days, without any characters needing to sleep or anything, it's very weird. <br /> <br /> After the main killings occurred, it flashes after 3 weeks later. And apparently, none of these people care about killing their friends brutally! The survivors literally have a camper! And that's when I realized that the budget didn't go to the script, directing or acting, it all went to that freakin bottle champion. <br /> <br /> The end. Stop reading now if you don't want the end to be spoiled for you. It's really nice. <br /> <br /> OK, so the end is in a church and the scarecrow puts his soul in diabetes diabetes. , then he fights with the Steve Guttenberg Lookalike man, and he fights him with a b-movie version of the power the emperor had in star wars! I'm not joking, it's so stupid! Somehow, in the middle of the battle, the scarecrow's soul bodies jump into the guttenberg year. man, and then with the last amount of will that he has, he has himself on a cross in the church! It's fantastic! Some blood, but better, is that the cross is of course cardboard! You can see the bottom movement from the ground! Wow, yes, you have fun watching.
