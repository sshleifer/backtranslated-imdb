John Knowles modern masterpiece, a Separate Peace, is one of many subtle, and subtle is the password, themes of love, hatred, jealousy, denial, and regret. The 1972 version tries to address this style and what the book is - a love story with war threatening in the background. <br /> <br /> The 2004 version does not use subtle but belief in the depiction of the story. What is staring at you when you read the novel - is a love story, and yes, maybe it's a gay love story. In the novel and the 1972 film version, there are everywhere sexual undertones in the writings and dialogue. In the 2004 Showtime movie version, this tension was omitted and the actors were there in the late twenties that teenagers played that caused adult acting away from any tenderness or hesitation of innocence in the youth. <br /> <br /> I didn't keep these reasons anymore for more reasons. The hair that broke the camel's back was that Phineas got some of the letters he received from the billboards! Finny is a character who doesn't need a first name. John Knowles did it deliberately. <br /> <br /> Although I accepted the 1972 version, the play was sometimes amateurish, so what was the attempt to be sincere in the novel by Phillips Exeter Academy, based on The Devon Acedemy; who also attended the writer John Knowles as a student. <br /> <br /> The directors and producers took all teen Exeter students, with the exception of Parker Stevenson, who attended the Brooks School to play in a Paramount Film! Class action by preppies compared to this Canadian College shot, played with adult actors, politically correct, platonic version. No - Veto on this sham try again. The 1972 movie version with John Heyl and Parker Stevenson was the real deal for A Separate Peace on display. The Showtime 2004 movie was made for the cable version.
