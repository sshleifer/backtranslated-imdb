One Chinese gang attack and erase another gang in the beginning of the movie. Unfortunately, the patriarch of the winning family is being killed in the process. Strangely and without prudence, the gang urged a volunteer to blame the bloodbath and leave until the police decide to stop investigating. Now how ONE person alone is, the one responsible for about 50 deaths, past me, so the one sent away was just stupid, but that's the plot. Later, when this man came home, betrayal and twilight took place. This results in almost one and fifteen minutes of inevitable murder. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a Chinese martial arts movie with a lot of a plot, then you should probably overshoot this movie, as it is virtually uninterrupted and virtually no plot or character development - even compared to other martial arts films. I would estimate that 80-90% of the movie is fighting scenes - endless and reasonably well-made combat scenes using knives. Again and again, fight scenes! If you want a movie with a body number that may run in the hundreds while people are cutting, kicking and cutting, then this is the movie for you. The problem was by the end of the movie there are literally no people to kill and the movie really lost my interest !! It's not deep, but if you just want to see excitement and action, then this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie is in contemporary times and no one is thinking of shooting the hero until just near the end. And if they finally do the logical thing, it's too late and the trouble is really real lamb! Logical mistakes like this and the woman's suicide (why ???) make it a "turn off your brain" type movie.
