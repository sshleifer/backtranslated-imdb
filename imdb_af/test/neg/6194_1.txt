Director / chief actor Dutcher unveiled in this tin-on-my-movie, in which he seeks to seize worldly acceptance to strangle the otherwise optimistic world of Mormon missionaries. Some of the plays are fair. But some roles are unrealistic, ie the ominous (rather than paternal) mission president, etc. The film gives a fair look at how some missionaries can wrestle with their faith, but the actual mission program he claims is far from his concept of it, in terms of optimistic, coherent and inspired. The only inspiration I see in this movie is Dutcher's self-inspiration. The movie is slow and boring, and the shooting and screen look like a college student project.
