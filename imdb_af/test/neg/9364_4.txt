Tonight's film course was The Legend of the Suram Fortress and in its 87 minutes it managed to quickly jump into my top five toughest movies of all time. It's hard to watch; Movies so different from everything else that you see something totally alien. A brief summary would be: A group of Georgians are trying to build a fortress to defend themselves from invaders, but every time they are about to end, it's not clear. So they'll see a fortune teller recommending that if they want to leave the fort, they need to get a youth, a long blond blue-eyed boy who must be buried in the walls during construction and his presence. will ensure that the construction is completed smoothly. And probably enough in that closing season, he would be smeared in cement and eggs, giggling while being buried alive, with only his mother grieving. <br /> <br /> It's actually a pretty simple story. But the director, Sergo Paradjanov, worked in Soviet Georgia in 1984, not too long after he took a fifteen-year sentence. He doesn't follow any of the movie rules we're used to. There are very few close ups. Very often, the action we must follow is hidden in the lower left corner of a landscape shot, extremely easy to miss. There are very few close ups and sometimes it's hard to tell who does what for and why. The movie occasionally deals with abnormalities that are not relevant to the main plot and usually confuses the viewer. The music is completely insane, with noises, on screen instruments and church organs, seemingly dropped randomly. At times when nothing seems to happen, someone in a gig will break, almost playing until the next scene comes together. But uncomfortably there is a clear movie behind it all, so you have to understand the message whatever it is. One of those times when your eyes are glued to the screen, simply because you can't believe what you see.
