Charlie (George "Norm" Wendt) and Rhonda ("Just Say" Julie Brown) are a few cheerful, murderous strangers stranded on Earth and bumping into a small western town. They become deputy officers and form a lethal form of justice for speedier, murderers and others, while coming on the bad side of some locals (led by Wayne Grace). Meanwhile, their sexy alien daughter (Anastasia Businessman) comes in a slim / shining outfit with her black man (Christopher M. Brown) to find them and TV reporters and government agents come up to fill up time. <br /> <br /> From what I can tell, it's a deliberate attempt to cover every possible genre (comedy, sci-fi, horror, western ...) in one movie, and what a stupid, Relentless mess is this, despite energetic performances by the two stars. The script is very horrible.
