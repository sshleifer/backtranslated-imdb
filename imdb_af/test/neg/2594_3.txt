Family old. Once the show was aired, it was fresh, original, and actually pretty funny. Now I stopped watching. It is one of the worst shows on television, combining unprecedented jokes, repetitive, jokes and hoping that every joke can become funny with the inclusion of the word "bitch." Seth Macfarlane has obvious problems with himself and of course he is listening to the 13-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> I just don't understand how something so funny started, so different from everything else, can be divided into this horrible mess of a "comedy" show. I seriously heard one linen from a puddle. <br /> <br /> It is really sad to see how big performances fail, and watch as drunk as this. Seth Macfarlane stopped trying, or he believes this show is hilarious as it is. <br /> <br /> Anyway, God helps us. <br /> <br /> I hate this show and will dance an Irish gig when it's finally canceled.
