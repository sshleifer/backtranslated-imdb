Usually I won't waste the time reviewing a movie like "Human Pork Chop" (the 2001 version, not confused with the previous movie of the same title, which is probably better known in the West than "The Untold") Story "), but since the reviews already here are pretty vague about what it actually does, I thought I'd put the best details in the picture, so nobody was actually tempted to buy it because of the movie's mysticism. I will honestly say: STAY AWAY. <br /> <br /> **** GREAT SPOILERS are under **** <br /> <br /> "Human Pork Chop", I expected to be like a Chinese interpretation of the popular Japanese "Guinea" films. Anyone who has had enough of the series can see where their makers come from. There is a strong sense of humor running throughout. You can't watch the ridiculous 'Never Never Dies', without laughing and 'The Making of Guinea Pig' is a fantastic turn of the whole thing on its head, proving it's just made, With a some joy, by pretty good, natural ghore. All the GP movies have a punk rock, DIY, lap-to-video aesthetic, occasional flashes of real artworks ("Mermaid in a manhole"), a fierce political agenda and a confused, zealous zeal that them in a league of their own. <br /> <br /> "Human Pork Chop" has none of the above. <br /> <br /> It is shot on 35mm film (with alarmingly good production values), it is 90 bad minutes long and it is completely without any reason. The plot tells, in the backstage of a police questioning the suspects, of the systematic torture, death and eventual dissolution of Grace, a heroin addict street walker kidnapped by her pimp and his henchmen and cruel when his money comes from him. steal. br /> <br /> Despite its brief efforts to be a morality game, the film has a detached, inhumane feeling and cannot help to support the minds of those who find it. Although painfully saddened by Grace as an innocent victim, the constant spirit of his script and the protagonist's constant ominous dialogue is a shocking, totally unwelcome, "deserve it!" view that makes the whole thing almost impossible to look at. Much more time is spent describing Grace's decline and when her prisoners are eventually found guilty and sent to jail, it seems like a hurry memory on behalf of the writers who have long since ceased to care. <br /> <br /> What makes it overwhelming why someone wants such a movie is that even the kind of people who really go to careless sex and violence in the movies are seriously missing out. The torture is just a constant stream of kicks, slacks, verbal abuse, psychological abuse and increasingly bizarre prison power displays using Grace's heroin addiction to make her do. And if I say that, don't get me wrong, incidentally. Unlike "Guinea Pig", with its regular Nazi rule, which results in an almost teenage sense of spotprinting, despite the ultraviolet, Human Pork Chop does not have such sexual overtones. There is no real nudity in the film and the violence is purely from the evil of the horrific protagonists (seen early in the film, sticking a dog in a bag and tied to a brick wall - don't worry not, not really, just a cheap special effect!). The only real bloodshed in the film is to the end when they unleash Grace's body and cook the legs, all very poor, special FX (nowhere near "Guinea Pig" level) and at that stage you'll probably feel too miserable and sick to even see what is going on. <br /> <br /> The movie is depressed and uncompromising along a similar line to Buddy Giovinazzo's "Combat Shock" and I even think can be compared at a push. Both movies deal with the gradual physical decline of an individual who exists in a nightmare environment, without any social or moral redeemable characters and both movies climax in a particularly visceral manner with the individual's inevitable, inevitable punishment. <br /> <br /> In fairness, not “glamorises” it's not violence (while 'Guinea' can easily be accused), but one can't help but wonder where the place for a movie like this is. It fails to make many real points in its fair representation of such brutality and lead speed, a virtually non-existent plot line and the aforementioned lack of any entertainment value, I just can't understand what would encourage someone to look at something like this. I just made it to the end, purely for the purpose of fair review ... which I hope I have done now. <br /> <br /> Overall score: 0 out of 10. Welcome to the bottom of the bar.
