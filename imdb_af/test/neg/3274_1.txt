My brother is playing "Moose" in this movie. Although most of his scenes were left on the cutter floor. The funniest line is the movie is nothing with stat. So anyway, it's filmed in Portland, OR, where we grew up. The dance club is / is called "Up Front FX". What I loved about this movie is that the main character (not named on the box, because Bolo wears more clothes) is a police detective. A great opportunity to drive around in a red convertible Porsche. I gotta get a copy of this, preferably the director's track, so I can see all the screens my brother is in. The only scene he's in is the start when they're in the dance club. He got the place because he was this cheerleader of a semi-pro soccer team called The Oregon Thunderbolts. This is interesting because his name appears as first entry in IMDb. Fame has him, luck, not so much.
