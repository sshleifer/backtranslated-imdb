A stupid teen-suspected comedy that compromises a serious misunderstanding, including (but not limited to) a hooker confused with a foreign exchange student, a beating girl, a gay girl -man loves and the straight man who loves her, and bitter gossip. Neither of the following is funny or even amusing. Nation Lampoon's use to be hilarious back in the day. Unfortunately, the name is synonymous with crap. And this one is no exception. I used to think Topenga was kinda cute when she was on 'Boy Meets World', but she seems to be leaving her (and yes, I know she has a name, but in what she still deserves, she remains Topenga ) <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Biscuit: Kati Lohmann becomes topless; Boti Bliss relies on a body double (BOOOOO !!!)
