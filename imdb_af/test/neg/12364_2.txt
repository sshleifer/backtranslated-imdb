My expectations were high after seeing the trailer. They were even higher when I saw the movie had the same director as Independence Day and Godzilla. The special effects in Independence Day were much better than in this movie. The whole movie is waiting for the spiders to show up. The rest of the storyline was really boring. And when the spiders came, they had a very amateur look, like the special effects of a movie made in the 60's. I didn't watch the whole movie. When I played about an hour, I turned off my DVD player. I almost watch three movies every night, and I have never walked away from a movie, even if it is boring. The only thing good in this movie was the beautiful sheriff. That's why I voted 2 instead of 1. :) So don't see this one, instead of fetching Starship Troopers, it's just the same as 10,000 times better. .
