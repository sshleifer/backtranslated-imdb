A colleague of work told me to watch this movie, seeing this movie as one of the best movies ever. So I looked at it. First, I have to admit that I don't like ordinary movies and prefer to watch movies with real meaning. <br /> <br /> And that's the point why I don't like this movie. It has no meaning. It's just a combination of funny, silly, boring, entertaining, absurd and exciting pieces. <br /> <br /> Initially, I thought this movie might be a real thriller (like reading German packaging), but the movie was too secretive for me. <br /> <br /> David Lynch can make a combination of most different images, but the composition tastes as horrible as a combination of milk with beer. Both for themselves are pretty good, but together?
