WARNING !! This review may contain spoilers. The back of the box is misleading. It says all this crap about ghost story kids, what they do, but it implies that everyone will be killed by some murderers in the forest. It doesn't happen. The stories they tell are a bit interesting, specifically the one with the dog and everything that licks, but most are boring, monsters in the forest, a dumb girl and the head one, the whole movie.
