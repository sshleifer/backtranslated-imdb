I'm a fan of this generally excellent but sometimes rather boring show, but Season 3 has some horrible plot directions. The episode HERO is an example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> The story as it finally unfolds is that the Cylons deliberately allow Bulldog - a pilot captured several years earlier during a black ops mission - to escape, steal Cylon ships and come back to Galactica. The plan is that when Bulldog returns, he will find out that Adama has left him to his fate and is so angry that he will kill Adama, which he does almost. <br /> <br /> Now the problem is - the Sylons set it up so Bulldog thinks he has escaped himself. This means that Bulldog comes off the Cylon ship without help. So he kills a Cylon and walks out of his housel - so much we see. Then we have to assume that he is following the hangar flight, succeeding in a Cylon combat ship and learning how to operate, take off and fly back to Galactica. Just like that. <br /> <br /> Now, Starbuck has managed to get one of those working in Season 1, which was hardly credible, but she just had to fly it off-line visually before making contact with Galactica. Bulldog has to program his ship to make several jumps by hiperspace and succeed in removing Galactica somewhere thousands of light years away, in an unknown direction. How does he manage to program a ship that contains totally alien technology? Sylons connect with their computers by touch, there are no visual consoles or keyboards. And how did he do the miracle, then how does he know where Galactica is, since Galactica has declined about 3 years ago and has since tried to evade the Cylons - it doesn't leave beacons behind? Even for the suspension of unbelief that should apply to any sci-fi show, this episode is still absolutely no sense.
