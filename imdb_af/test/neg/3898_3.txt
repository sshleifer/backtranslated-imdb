I consider myself a fan of Jess Franco and his garbage films, but almost every time I see one, I see only missed opportunities and plots that don't play well. Unfortunately, this movie is no different. The movie had a lot of potential, as Franco melted the intriguing theme of the classic movie 'The Most Dangerous Game' with his usual brand trashy sleaze, but the plot here disappears too often, and it takes Franco forever the main point of the movie. Since it's a later Franco movie, you can be forgiven for thinking the director would have been better, but actually I found the opposite to be true; Like this and the horrible 'Killer Barbys' are two of his worst movies. The plot focuses on a stripper and her messy boyfriend. The couple are invited to a private island by a wealthy woman and her lover. But they soon find that they have not been invited there for social reasons, as they are released on the island so the rich woman and her friends can hunt for sport! <br /> <br /> What attracted me to this movie was the cover and the fact that it was directed by the king of sleaze flicks. You will then think that I will be pleased that the movie contains an abundance of sex and general sleaze; but I am not. The reason is mostly that the sex and sleaze in the film is very boring and most of the time just served to give me the condition known as 'itchy fast forefinger'. But my inclination to observe everything to the end made sure I had to hit it. There was a time when I didn't think girl on the girl could be boring, but I've been wrong since. The only positive thing I can really pick the movie is that the soundtrack is tough, and despite being undoubtedly foreign pop music; actually mixes well with the sex scenes. I enjoyed the last ten minutes; as it is when the plot finally goes on, but it was too late and unfortunately it is a very dark movie. In general, I recommend this movie to those who feel that they should watch all 180+ Franco movies. Everyone needs to kill Vampyros Lesbos, Faceless or She in Ecstasy.
