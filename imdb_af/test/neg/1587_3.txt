(Spoilers) "Cash Crop" goes something like that. On top of their luck farmers grow pot to meet ends. DEA agent blows in town. Farmers hide the pot. DEA agent leaves town. End of the story. <br /> <br /> This movie offers solid performances by some second-level actors, mediocre direction, and such a screenplay ... but it has no story. And since the story is the basis of every drama, "Cash Crop" is a total failure. Too boring to recommend.
