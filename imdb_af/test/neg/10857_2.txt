This movie is on the side of several super bad sturdy cars characters, flyhalf, but without a real story. Some of the screens are nicely filmed. If they took the same casting and crew and made a movie called Ghent that was the coolest character in the movie and came up with an interesting and ongoing story, it could be decent. Prepare for a lame set of hard characters, all of which do nothing, but run all day running and trouble, while never burning on the sun and keeping their hair and clothes perfect and never looking for . a house or money, etc. There was a kind of story about the characters past several people killed and a treasure that was probably supposed to be the plot.
