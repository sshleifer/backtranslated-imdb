Steven Seagal is back! Here released his third film this year. Of course, as a once-off fan who has become increasingly dissatisfied, I can say it's not surprising that it's pretty lame. First, the movie made headlines because of apparent production problems due to Seagal. He will arrive late, change the writing, crew etc. And usually causes problems for the director, Don E Faun Leroy (his lack of talent is his trouble!). It also happens in their second co-operation the upcoming mercenary who promises to be just as bad as this garbage. It's also a major turning point in Seagal's career, as this film is the first of its kind to really dig out the stock. There was a bit in Ticker, but this movie takes the cookie. They borrow pieces from The Order (a Van Damme movie, Seagals biggest competitor in DTV movies!) No Code of Conduct, Undisputed, and also a complete action series from the well-known Peter Weller lead vehicle Top of the World. Interestingly, the car hunt was stolen from Weller's epic, made almost 10 years ago and ironically probably cheaper than this garbage, actually by far the best action scene of the movie. I was shocked enough when Dolph Lundgren had a brief stint in the stock action video world, which he happily escaped. However, Seagal is the leader of the DTV action market, with Van Damme and Snipes being its main competitors. Seagal still manages movies and for my life I don't know how. Surely the fans must be bored with this horror, and long for a return to the love of the law. The story here is completely paralyzed. In fact, the movie has so many plot holes that it can't consider. For example, at the end of a movie there is a girl who apparently knows Seagal at an orphanage where he gives a necklace. Why don't I know, but we never see her in the rest of the movie, or hear her. Seagal has a girl in this movie at the beginning of the film with a psychologist and she is haunted by visions, which are never explained and meaning nothing at the end of the film. The film is so ridiculously glued by a series of meaningless porridge that it becomes headache inducing .. This is far Seagal's stupid movie! Seagal itself is like wood as ever, but to his credit he is not as talked to as I could say. However, Seagal feels the need to speak as he is a gangsta rapper, longing for the days he would give his Brooklyn / Italian-American accent, in his classic early films. He also has a painful double action with Treach, which I accept is a rapper. It's funny how producers seem to think the combination of Seagal, plus hip-hop star works, because his team with DMX in Exit Wounds has been his most successful movie since Under Siege. Clearly, although none of the rappers have heard, it won't work. However, this is an action movie and therefore the action itself must be judged. Unfortunately, the action that has not come, the NOW Image Back catalog is strictly routine. There are a few small combat scenes with some classic Seagal aikido, but when 90% is double-stunted, which really does a hard work in this movie, it's really not much impressed. There are also some standard gun battles that really just make some pretty violent and bloody squibbage for them. All in all, this is a painfully boring experience and again I am left to give the same verdict: Seagal lost it! Now I'm asking the year old question now, "Why do people still watch his movies?" It is very good and good as a question, but the sad bastard that I still see his films in the confused hope, he can do well again. Chances are slim, unlike Seagal's ever-increasing waistline. * 1/2
