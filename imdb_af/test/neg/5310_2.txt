The movie while slightly flawed was totally entertaining. About half an hour in Cool, I started Hollywood heavenly flashbacks. But guess what? It's worse. Even the dance number is bad. I like most of the movie in this movie, so I feel bad about writing a negative review, but I feel compelled. The Rock, Andr√© 3000, and Vince Vaughn were in a comedy. No one else has decided to decide which movie genre they are performing. I feel bad for Travolta because he brought the same Chile Palmer from Get Shorty to this movie. He was quite consistent in the role, but this movie is so different from the original that the character protrudes like a sore thumb. I'm going to give this movie 4/10 because I love the actors so much, but there's a talk in the movie about a certain song that is soininine. I couldn't believe the artists actually said it. If you go to the movie for the weekend, there must still be Oscar contenders. It will be a much better way to spend your time.
