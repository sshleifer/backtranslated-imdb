Neal N Nikki is named the worst movie of the year by Planetbollywood. It's hard to believe the famous Chopra's, this lousy movie made. It is presented as a movie for the family, but seems to be a ridiculous sex comedy. It also doesn't let you laugh, but weep for boredom and also not sexy girls to make the movie sexy. The title song is the most annoying song of the decade, I'm Neil, I'm the man, rock star superstar. Uday Chopra is one of Bollywood's worst actors ever without acting. After making a lot of Superflops, he didn't receive any films from a producer, rather than his family. He gives a total crap performance, which leads you to death. Tanisha, who is and will always be known as Kajol's sister, gives a terrible show. Both actors have the most annoying chemistry, and are very immature for their age. It has a special appearance through the very cute Richa Pollad, in a pathetic role. The end was so diligent and stupid, I can't believe I actually paid money to rent this crap.
