It's a really really bad movie. It may seem like an oversimplification. A voluptuous, childish retort that is comparable to a small unintentional insult. The truth is, I can't say enough about the confusing senseless plot, the truly horrific act (I'm talking nasty people here) or the random imagery of violence against women who make the chaotic pastiche of radically horrible film-making errors that cause this round for everything that is good and proper in the world of cinema, no, human culture. Please, take my word for it, don't look ... ever. I'm serious. Stop. You will thank me later.
