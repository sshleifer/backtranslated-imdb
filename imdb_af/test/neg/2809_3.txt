What a pity. It could have been good. The main problems are the writing and the star. The film cannot decide whether it is a slapstick comedy (of a very uninspired and routine kind) or an informative satire on the old East Germany and its mores. His attempts at the last flop are, however, completely. The movie doesn't coincide well and the end is very artificial and incredible. Any stereotypes you may have about the German comedy are unfortunately strengthened. <br /> <br /> The characters are all stereotypes, and the main characters played by Kim Frank are colorless in the extreme. He just can't carry the movie and looks largely for his baby's face. It may not be the actor's fault (he is a pop singer), as the writing doesn't give him much to work on. <br /> <br /> One plus - the relaxation of the East German 'style' and era is good. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the movie feels dishonest and humiliating. The film seems to be cut out by people who don't necessarily do their best and just wanted to make a quick buck from some cheap laughs. (If they did it best, it was indeed a sad case!) I watched it at a theater with an East German audience and I was sorry for them. The GDR regime was terrible in almost every respect, but those who lived through it deserved better than that.
