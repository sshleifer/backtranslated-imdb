Typically perfectly crafted HBO production with a first-rate casting, a rich village atmosphere and a few narrative vignettes, characterized by above-average production values. <br /> <br /> But it's a big 'but', the various subplots, placed with some nice, mostly annoying caricatures, are paper thin and go dull for longer than three hours. <br /> <br /> The often stupid story is uncomfortable between melodrama, without being entertaining. enough and personal drama, without being deep. <br /> <br /> A shame because some scenes really shine. Two or three, that is. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 dirty Paul Newmans
