From nowhere alien riveting lasers, to an elementary school style crash, "Nightbeast" is better classified as a pharyngeal mixture of fake blood and bare breast. The almost pornographic style of the movie seems to be a failed attempt to recover from a lack of coherent or effective story. However, the acting is not nearly as far-fetched, but many of the young, aspiring actors show a hidden talent. Especially Don Leifert and Jamie Zemarel, who cast a well needed light on this other horrible movie. Nightbeast would never have set up if he knew the terrible film-making talent of this small Maryland village.
