Try as I please, I just couldn't go into this one. Maybe it was the washed out colors; Perhaps it was the protracted approach - I'm not really sure, but although it wasn't a bad movie at all, I didn't really see it as an "effective" movie (words I understand so much more arbitrarily as their common uses. <br /> <br /> So, basically, the deal here is that a series of adolescent boys' deaths emit an investigation and anxiety into a small provincial town, causing a witch hunt. What did the boys' death involve with the mysterious, sexy woman who appeared in the town? Is the crazy hermit woman involved? Is it voodoo? The story is a mix of crime drama and horror as the various townspeople are all suspected and bodies appear while bloody violence takes place. <br /> <br /> Well enough, but most of them fell a little flat, oh, it had moments ... the one boy looking beautiful naked seducer walked, was pretty good, and the scene where the fathers hit the hermit was a bitter comment (even though the effects failed themselves, as her skin peeled off as if she had flung her with a reddish iron). <br /> <br /> My biggest problem was the end. I already have spoiler tags on this review, but be warned, HERE IS THE GREAT SPOILER: I don't believe it. I do not believe that a priest can convince himself to kill young boys to become sexually aware, without any hint of that psychosis that occurred earlier, with other boys, with a history or any other personal influence. The movie did not really deserve its end. END SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Fulci is a big name and I'm more than sure there's an audience out there. I definitely need to find out more that he has finished because it might have been a bad introduction. Most Italian giallo is hit or miss anyway, so I'm waiting to see what else this man can do before he writes off. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
