For any Nickelodeon fan who used the network in the 80s and 90s, there was always something good about it. You've had entertaining acts like you can't do on television. You had strange but good performances like Pete & Pete. You even had cartoons that taught moral like Doug. But like Disney, Nickelodeon dropped the tubes, limiting their demographic constraints to unnecessary excuses to compose new, innovative performances. As I tried to watch Zoey 101, I shook my head in horror. <br /> <br /> The environment couldn't be more fake than this one. Each character goes to a boarding school called Pacific Coast Academy, with everything a spoiled child wants. A sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat screen TVs in each room, cool dorms to hang out, etc. The children in this show are rarely seen in the classroom and there do not seem to be true teachers. It looks more like a place you will spend on a nice summer holiday rather than working and studying while preparing for college. <br /> <br /> The characters were also a factor that turned me off. Every episode consists of boy problems, situations that caused themselves and problems to be solved. Each character is a stereotype. Zoey (Jamie Lynn) looks perfect in anything she does, and each of her friends asks for help if they feel they are in serious danger. Just guide her to have no other side. I'm through school and I can tell you, nobody is like that. Chase is stupid. Logan plays the arrogant, difficult man. Quinn plays a nerd that is highly unrealistic in what she does. Michael is an idiot. Lola is a clone of Nicole. Dana is just fine, a difficult person. Why not use some originality? Something unique to these characters, and different from other personalities? Is stereotypical the best that the creators of this show can pop up? Instead, these actors are dull personalities with the sense that there is a lack of creativity that involves their roles. There is nothing here to be surprised or surprised. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but the show is clear for the purpose of striving for children of adolescence, facing the stage of being a child's development. to be an adult. Throughout that period they must learn to study independently, make their own decisions and do what is right for them. Zoey 101 doesn't contain any of those values. In this case, we believe that it looks good and has a stereotypical personality, all you have to do is succeed. I'm sorry, but it's simply not true. People can't expect things to be handed over to them, as the actors in this show are, and just leave those things there. If I expected things to happen in Zoey 101 in real life, then I would have been in a dream home in a fantasy world. Nothing in this show is related to those who face health and money issues. It also does not relate to children who want to learn something meaningful. <br /> <br /> Finally, Zoey 101 is a show made by Nickelodeon that just falls flat on its face. It shows a terrible message for kids and I think the show itself is just inappropriate for them. Sure, it doesn't have morbid violence, but it teaches everything to make a child act and stupid. A horrible performance, and must be forgotten with the rest of the garbage that Nickelodeon made in the past year. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10.
