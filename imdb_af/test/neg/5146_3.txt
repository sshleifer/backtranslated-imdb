During the production, this LWT series was titled "Rocket To The Moon", a title everyone was currently considering. Then came the word that it was "Reach for the Moon", as if it would add this new word to heavy metaphorical meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters. The same heavy-handed lack of subtlety and understanding is evident throughout the entire range, and the same, tired and boring love-triangle story is actually stretched over 7 episodes! Any television program that decides to use the 'love triangle' storyline for even a single episode, pushes it, but smearing seven episodes is unforgivable. There are reasons to watch the island of Wight offer a beautiful setting, and the seemingly effortless display of Lynda Bellingham hits all the right comedy points. However, this is not enough. A number of appearances are striking, especially when placed against the static and emotional desert that Jonathan Kerrigan refers to as his face. I already mentioned Lynda Bellingham in the role of a naughty mother (yes it is so far as character development and storytelling), but I was impressed by actor Maurice Roeves (who by far the most experienced actor in everything, has in everything appears from classic movies like Richard Attenborough's "Oh What a Lovely War" and "The Eagle Has Landed" and TV including Baywatch, Holby City, The Bill, Eastenders, Cheers, Doctor Who in the 80s, Star Trek, and even Hollywood with Sylvestor Stallone in 1995 Judge Dredd) whose performance reminds me of real teachers I met - often unknown men, whose lives have been plagued with a very sad streak. It is refreshing to see Roeves still getting a job, which also appeared in the 1998 British film 'The Acid House', and even recently alongside the wonderful Maria Bello and Sean Bean in 'The Dark'. The real reason to look at this series, even though its appearance is very few. Another actor who tries his best to elevate the program is Ben Miles, in the role of the sex-mad "typical man" brother (again, an original character!). As with Roeves, the CV says it all. After raising it, Miles has since appeared in the Hollywood movie 'V for Vendetta' and the 2001 Stellar film 'The Affair of the Necklace' with Brian Cox, Adrien Brody, Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce. Unfortunately, the reasonably skilled actors I mentioned relate to relatively small roles compared to the dramatic driftwood, Kerrigan and Saira Todd, who have long been in casualties and have not yet learned to act. Even the tolerant Frances Gray is made to suffer in the presence of such theatrical fetal mannequins, and unfortunately for her, the lasting memory I have of her is the AD that calls for another task of a relatively complex shot , because during the take, she unconsciously "pulled her knickers out of her crack!" Well-known faces appear in every episode - child actors from CBBC programs and dramas such as "2 Point 4 Children" and other tribal advertisers such as Mr. Ben's ("they'll remember me"), Lynda, the Oxo lady "Bellingham, and others I don't even want to remember. Every episode tries half-heartedly to deal with problems such as teenage pregnancy, disruptive pupils and rocket firing (!) ... things Grange Hill did better when my parents were young! Overall, this series was a disappointment, and a wasted opportunity to produce a really interesting and well-developed drama series. Unfortunately, they took the easy route for them, both in writing and (mostly) in the casting. I would recommend both Waterloo Road and The Street to good drama fans. The latter, in particular, managed to achieve this. If you like the Isle of Wight, don't "reach for the moon", rather reach the holiday brochure - it probably has more character development!
