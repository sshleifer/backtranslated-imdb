As the above suggests, I wasn't ultimately aimed at this movie. It's beautiful to look at, the scenery is lush, but the details of the story, especially the characters, are absolutely incredible. Movies don't have to be credible, but movies like this, with a political edge and social commentary. <br /> <br /> Similarly, I have no problem with commercialism as such, but once again movies like this do not make decisive decisions based simply on box office accounts. This is absolutely the case with Sutherland, which is actually junk as Doyle. His accent was far from authentic, but he falls into the greatest fall of all, his accent is his achievement, and we end up with a caricature of Irish with no personality beyond his nationality. I find it totally unreasonable that anyone involved thought he was the best man for the job. All in all, this is a clear case of commercial interest in quality and when you try the mission, this kind of thing lapses your chances of success. <br /> <br /> Speaking of accents, there was a more hassle, one being the striking modernity of Boy's accent, which turned to driving the feel of transport to another time. More surprising was Samantha Morton's much-promised Irish accent, which has changed the least. Her voice turned between strong north and soft south, even in voting, where I expected such deviations to be picked up. <br /> <br /> However, there are few grips compared to the motivation and actions of Sarah. She never looks at home with the English, and almost immediately at home with her son and his tribe, the dilemma between life she knows and the life she has offered looks like a no-brainer. Perhaps much has been lost in editing. Maybe it was a three-hour movie or a mini-series where these things could have been, but I can only judge what I saw. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, Sarah's (Morton) relationship with Doyle (Sutherland) is incomprehensible. The fact is that her love for him is not conveyed in any way until she has to choose between her and her son. The conflict she is now experiencing was frankly ridiculous and killed the movie for me. <br /> <br /> As you may guess. This movie didn't work for me at all, but it is also to look at, you really see nothing more amazing in terms of scenery, there are some good performances and my wife likes it.
