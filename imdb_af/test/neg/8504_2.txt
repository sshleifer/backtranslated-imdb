I give this movie 2 stars pure because of its slightly liberal plot line. Without going into too much detail. <br /> <br /> The play in this movie is terrible. Really terrible - wood, level. <br /> <br /> The graffiti on the show is poor, so bloody weak that I can only wonder why they are bothering to use graffiti artists at all. It was clear in the spray scenes that they got other people to do the 'work'. They can also let the actors do the painting and save them a few sentiments. <br /> <br /> I will avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> Earlier, the child's loco soundtrack was something I listened to on my iPod, it would be a while before I could go there because of the fear that this movie would come back into my mind. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. Unless you think of yourself "Wow, it's been a while, because I've seen a very powerful movie."
