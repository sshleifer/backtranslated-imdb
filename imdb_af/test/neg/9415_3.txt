You know I've just watched this movie for 15 minutes, so I can't really describe how good it is. I mean the concept alone is so original and intriguing it just didn't let me go. Then there is the mass of academically-acclaimed people involved, plus the academy-nominated director. You just can't miss. I mean, it's the middle of the night and you're not sleepy yet. This movie is coming up. You look at it and are shocked. It's so brilliant, so originally it's so BIG. It will feel you half an hour later, you turned off the screen, but as you go to your bed, you see it is only 15 minutes after midnight. ENJOY! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
