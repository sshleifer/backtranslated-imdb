I went to this movie that really wanted it - it made a film festival earlier this year and got an all-cast film. But (and you can say there was a "but" coming) it is a movie failure. Outstanding character acted by Sarandon and Walken is destroyed by editing and the antics of the supporting role. Turturro's performance is slim and most of the comedy is overheated. The repetitive puppet shows are useless, and some scenes are completely out of place. <br /> <br /> It's been said, there are some wonderful moments sprinkled in the movie. A truly enjoyable moment, several of the temptations, and some of the comic color actually work out. Unfortunately, they are overshadowed by the diffuse, incoherent script and some bad acting.
