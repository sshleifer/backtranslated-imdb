I've watched this movie over the past six months (which I go through so you don't have to). The first show left me half crazy and babbling. The second look at 5:00 on a rainy morn was a little better. only shouted once. <br /> <br /> Looks like Pocona (The Aztec Mummy) had the hots for a certain Aztec Princess who "had to keep her stomach". It was clear that they gave each other the business and died for it. (Now it's really bad!). But before them, the film is trying to kill us with a screaming Aztec ceremony. The song will bleed your ears. <br /> <br /> In any case, there is the usual reincarnation nonsense. Not to mention a treasure map on a chest and bracelet guarded by the sweaty slab, Pocona. By this time, Pocona looks as if he was a 2000 year bender and is after the polluter of his grave. His luck and moans sound like he was a bad case of Montezuma's revenge (or he reads the script for this movie). It will stink your breath. <br /> <br /> An evil dr. Von Krupp seems to want the Aztec treasure (possibly to finance lessons and writing writings). for the cast & crew). He is called the Bat, because in the curse of the Aztec Mummy he wore a bat like a hat, hat and something like a ski mask over his face. Better than Laughing Fat Man. <br /> <br /> The Bat in typical crazy scientific fashion wants to rule the world. He emphasized it by rolling his eyes, laughing male and enjoying the scenery. He combined an invincible robot together. It appears that the bot is made from a rubbish cloth, a candlestick and a 1957 Buick grille. It will make your eyes. <br /> <br /> Well, the mighty performance between Pocona and the Robot takes place in the Mummie's new tomb that was previously homeless. <br /> <br /> About half of this movie is thrown out of "La Aztec Momia", never released in the US in its original form, but in a choppy horror of Jerry Warren (see my review of the attack) of the Mayan mummy) and the curse of the Aztec Mummy. "The robot is frankly silly like most characters. If it and the plot don't make you cry, nothing will go. <br /> <br /> My first impression was so bad that it was one. see from "Mayan Mummy" (who earns a movie that is burned) and again looks at "Robot", it gets a 3. You should not see it at all, then it can be naively pleasant.
