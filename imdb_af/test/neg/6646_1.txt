I saw this movie, but not in a single meeting. What happens when it is playing on the TV, I watch for a few minutes, find that I take everything I can take and then leave the room. During those few minutes I didn't even laugh, enjoy no pleasure in doing so, and find myself more depressed and angry. Interestingly, I am told that psychological states are incompatible, that is, one cannot be angry and depressed at the same time. This movie tests the theory. <br /> <br /> I think part of the problem is that I have spent nearly ten years in Chicago, so I look at the scenes I think of my own experiences in the rotten village and therefore I bring many of me luggage clearly after the piece. It's quite possible, I'm willing to admit that if you're not a Chicago denizen, you'll find that piece amusing. If so, I envy you. <br /> <br /> A train. John Hughes put his movies in Chicago and those movies worked for me. I think the difference is that Hughes was a first-rate writer. I think it's obvious that he knew how to balance his situations, and to make his characters sympathetic and credible. In a comedy (as distinguished from a farce), this balance is essential. And it's not easy to reach. If it were, everyone would make good movies and we don't have to fret as we wonder in the real world whether genius will ever appear. In "Babysitting Adventures," it doesn't mean. I hated those characters. <br /> <br /> There is a difference, deep and real, between sympathetic and just pathetic. <br /> <br /> For me, every scene in this movie is a clunker. There is no humor, no man, no people can admit. Just actors read their lines as if all they can do to keep themselves from shouting them out, sure it will eventually happen, this time for sure! It's like watching the antiques of very bad comedians. It is embarrassing and after a while, usually when I get up and go, I feel sorry for all those involved, which is a kind of emotional connection, I think. Elizabeth Shue is terrible. She does not act, she certainly does not come, and it is quite possible, she can not. But sir how she tried. She looks older than 17, and behaves as younger as a seven-year-old parent in a school, making sure that she gets an award. And she's not alone. It's like everyone can't relax and let the story flow. As if everyone simply has no idea what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Now it was an early attempt by Chris Columbus and he would clearly improve and better writers (eg John Hughes himself) definitely helped, so maybe some forgiveness is in order. But the movie just a series of despair. Yet, as I said, it can work for some. If any of the above calls you, and it has clearly been done by the judges, then the DVD and knock yourself out. Otherwise, avoid this mess as if you would like a dark Chicago alley, because as you hurry, you can only see shadows and hear mutated threats.
