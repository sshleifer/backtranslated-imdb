Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie. Less than 50 billion out of 10. If you want hard-boiled action, don't rent it! If you want a good independent movie, look elsewhere! <br /> <br /> I never thought I saw Burt Reynolds in such a crazy movie. It has the thinnest plot line ever. From Damm flicks must win an academy compared to this one. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe once again proves why he is not the hottest actor in the world. Even Hasselhoff would have made a better drug addict than he did. I no longer want to drill you with more facts about this crappy movie, except to say that you are better off renting something from Hulk Hogan or Dolph Lundgreen. This should prove my point if you get my drift. <br /> <br />
