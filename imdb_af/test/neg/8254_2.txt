Oops. I hired it because I thought it was Bitter Harvest (1981), which is recommended. After the release of the terrible Patsy Kensit, I checked the recommendation and discovered my mistake. OK, It's watches, because the main characters are very sexy, but the acting is terrible. Stephen Baldwin looks more and more morose, understandable, seeing his co-star. Patsy competes with Liz Hurley for the title of the most obviously useless actor on the screen?
