I've seen this program several times and the more I see it, the less I like it. Jamie Lynn Spears was approached to do so due to the fact that she is Britney's sister and it is a pity to say that it is obvious in the show. They created the Zoey character as everything that people believe Jamie Lynn is clever, original, clever, beautiful, popular, etc. The characters around her are just there to make her look better, by being smarter, they are more popular. if they wanted more by boys than them. There's nothing original about it and it's poured out with money, so every child has the coolest fashions and things. I also have to say, because a 13-year-old girl (or how old she is, can't be much older), she wears many mature clothes, the short skirts are too short, it allows young people to wear them, and all that make-up. it adds to the rising problems of why young girls get so much trouble. The only thing I will say is that the opening credits are sung by Jamie Lynn and, according to her age, not bad at all, much better than her sister anyway when it comes to vocal abilities. Sorry, it's too mature and still dark. It is poorly performed with predictable story lines and there is too much stereotyping going on.
