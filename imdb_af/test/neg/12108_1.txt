If you want a real traumatic experience, it's a horrible movie for you (if you might consider mentioning it). A movie that is worse than the postman, sizzle Beach USA, Batman and Robin, Kazaam, fair game. Well, you get my point. This film directed by French television sensation Patrick Sebastien (Jerry Springer with an IQ of 25) can really be considered the worst movie ever made. I hope that Troma or someone in America will spread it so that the US can experience the French stench.
