This is one of the strangest things on TV. It's in a bizarre, underpopulated, Midlands wonderful called Leatherbridge, which seems to be the busiest place in the country. It has a bar with no visible staff or clients, a university without students, a police station with no criminals and a doctor's surgery with more doctors than patients. The story lines are frightening - every episode revolves around a bizarre medical issue that is responded to by a variety of humming extras that can never actually act, and for some reason the doctor always ends their house to solve their problem . Pleasantly entertaining for its pure comedy value, but I can't believe this thing is actually being mutilated as a serious drama. Bonkers.
