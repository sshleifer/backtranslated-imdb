FC De Kampioenen's only reason for existence is the local popularity. This has caused this sitcom to run for more than 15 years (and still count). <br /> <br /> It's about an amateur soccer team with the emphasis "amateur". Every storyline deals with the same topic: some misunderstandings that take ridiculous (and predictable) relationships are finally resolved. <br /> <br /> The show has been going on for over 15 years and production has probably not decided. to change a winning team. This means that the show has smaller changes over the course of the year (except that some actors are being replaced (they almost all left themselves rather than being thrown from the show)). The humor didn't change over the years and it was already outdated when it was first broadcast in the first place. <br /> <br /> I think you should be Flemish to get it, and over 60 years old, to enjoy such an old-fashioned TV show like this.
