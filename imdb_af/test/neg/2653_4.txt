I really like Harrison Ford, so I just rented this movie just to be disappointed after disappointment. Mr. Ford apparently walks through very hot water looking for a place to urinate. His co-star was very good and had the better lines. The story irritated me, but the mistake - BIG MISTAKE - as everyone is identified by a driver's license or passport before driving any US commercial aircraft, has left many plot questions in my mind. <br /> <br /> I could care less about these people. In fact, the subplot of the Internal Business investigation was more interesting than the two lovers who were killed while flying their first class in Miami. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed in the director, Sydney Pollack, who gave us the classic Tootsie. and other movies. This one is a waste of time and energy.
