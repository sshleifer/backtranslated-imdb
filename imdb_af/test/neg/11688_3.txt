What on earth was that? My family and I just spent 2 hours of our life throwing this piece of garbage! There was no plot, no tension, just a lot of boredom !!! My kids can do better movies with our video camera. <br /> <br /> But maybe we just didn't get the point of the movie ... oh wait, my mom did it. She was the only one who likes the following reason: "At least a movie without cars." If you are looking for a war film without fighting it, it is still interesting and gripping and has a strong anti-war message, then you have to watch "The Trench". <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10 because it's good enough for a midnight and because I'm too pretty ...
