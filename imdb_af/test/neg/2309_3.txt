To suggest my remarks on the movie, I know the subject is horrible and words can't adequately express the sympathy any decent person would have for people who dropped the post-horrors of an atomic bomb near them. <br /> <br /> However, this film does not deal in a horrible way, except for the first 10 minutes. Some of the images there are awful, and should be a reminder that can produce destruction of nuclear weapons. Since burnt people who walk around aimlessly or a man combing his hair and hair coming out, etc., is not a pretty sight. <br /> <br /> But after the first twenty minutes, this Japanese film pertains to people dealing with the aftermath of Hiroshima in the mid-to-late 40s. I actually developed the story quickly into a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> Almost all of the story takes five years to the bomb and deals mainly with one family's problems at that time. That is why it has become more of a melodrama than a shocking story of nuclear power. It's just a story about how these people of about 1950 on their lives, or one of the women is permanently damaged and if so, should they marry? <br /> <br /> It could have been a real impact movie, but it didn't go in that direction
