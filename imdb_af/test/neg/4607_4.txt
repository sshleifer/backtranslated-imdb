An excellent throw that does their utmost with a horrible script, irreverent direction, and the worst score I've ever heard. More TV movie of the week than serious drama. What is sad if you think the source material is very serious and very real. The filmmakers have decided that instead of building drama and character, it was better to show only the most graphic and violent pieces and hope the audience would be shocked for sympathy and caring. In my opinion, one of the most blatant forms of cutting and pasting film is customizable.
