It's a pity. There is an interesting idea here, but it is completely lost in a confusion of Commodore 64-style computer effects and bad storytelling. The plot, as it is, is about an abundant hunter of souls. It has to be a fairly simple hunter / jolly kind story, but the director and / or writer seems to have forgotten what the movie was when they were shooting for about three days. Things aren't helped by the fact that the biggest bath looks like he's wearing a cheap Darth Maul mask, trying to disguise them with flowing CG colors. Not much to commend on this, even the title seems to drive it in darkness.
