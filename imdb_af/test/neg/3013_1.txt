This show just sucks. I don't think I should even say it or why I have just repeated the number of comments I have already made. keys to the VIP are like turning on your TV and throwing it on you. That's exactly what it is, I don't even dominate a bit. These guys are so stupid, not funny and not at all with the ladies that it's not even funny. I sat through four episodes and I want to have two hours back. where do they find the participants because they are obviously defective. If I were the man who got this idea for a show and put it on TV, I would make the world a favor and get off the longest building I could find. how does garbage like this get on TV? especially the comedy network shouldn't be a show on something called the comedy network at least a comedy show or maybe funny so often?
