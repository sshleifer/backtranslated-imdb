One of the comments is wrong. It's not the only Pat Patterson movie and he didn't die two years after it was made. He shot a movie called the "Electric Chair" in Pineville, NC. He shot it a few years after Doctor Gore shot. Patterson died in the late 70's. I know this because he used my house and he left a cat there! It also sucked. It was a big problem when the movie came out. No independent horror films were made in the NC. This movie didn't help. Patterson did gore effects to H. G. Lewis. He was also good at magic. His gore scenes in Body Shop were actually well done. The film was shot in a building that also housed a 7/11. You can actually see the tops of the walls. The budget was less than $ 20,000 and the writing seemed like a kid wrote it. Only Patterson could understand. Yet ... it's fun and it's a classic.
