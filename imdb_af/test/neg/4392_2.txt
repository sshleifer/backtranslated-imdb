I have little or no interest in seeing another horrible movie, which is nothing but creative or funny, and abuses the National Lampoon tag. How something got my eye in the movie of this movie. I see Danielle Fishel's name I'm a big fan of the boy meets world! But the movie shes in is terrible. More than a fan, I am not rewarded by seeing her horrible movies with the naked chest treasure. So that's where my question comes in. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen this movie? And if Dan Danielle Fishel gets naked? Will save me the 2 hours of my life, I will never look back at this horrible movie. Thank you very much
