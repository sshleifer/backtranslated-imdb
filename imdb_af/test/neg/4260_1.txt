It is by far the most pathetic movie Indian cinema or any cinema has come. It's quite a piece of crap. The story line odes does not hold water. It is disgraceful that such a respectful actor was so low-minded to make such a shameful movie. The little respect he had was lost forever. He had to retire long ago instead of making a fool of himself and losing all self-respect. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Furthermore, I suggest Amitabh should retire. I wonder how IMDb gave some recommendations to this movie. There are no movies so terrible that any recommendations can be made. Seeing such movies as Devdas in the same line as this movie makes a serious injustice to a decent movie. I can say shamelessly to his overall.
