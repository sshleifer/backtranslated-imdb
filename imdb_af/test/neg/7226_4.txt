Has some very good music and performances; Kid Creole and Coconuts, James White and Blacks, DNA, Tuxedo Moon, the Plastics, Melle Mel, Vincent Gallo, Lydia Lunch ... etc, but in addition there is not much more. The dialogue, especially the storytelling (by Saul Williams), is pretty good, but the performances are all pretty, straight or straight, no matter how many hipsters are thrown in; Debbie Harry and Jean Micheal Basquit (the latter is the leading role) both do not have enough cultural credo to keep this film of a novelty point. It's about a Jack Kerouac style that is spontaneous, but doesn't have the insight to make it move. That's where the group's performances come. I think it's pretty balanced in this regard between great music and bad acting, and I enjoyed it, but I just expected more. Although it does end up with a fairy tale.
