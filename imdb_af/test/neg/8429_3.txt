"Disappointing" is the best word I can think of for this movie, especially given the glowing reviews it receives from other users. <br /> <br /> One thing that really spoils the movie is that it is partially shameless (in both senses of the word). Not only does it offer a very selective description of the games (it focuses on the American athletics team), but it also contains several inaccuracies, most of which exaggerate the problems faced by the American team. <br /> <br /> What's even more disturbing is that all the omissions and errors (?) prevent American sportsmen from being glorified by the exclusion of other athletes (with some celebrated exceptions). For example, the viewer led to believe that the US won the majority of medals in the Games. In fact, they only won one in four gold medals and one in a total of 6. Likewise, many athletes are portrayed as caricatures of their respective compatriots (so we have an arrogant Briton and a French winemaker). This attitude has very little service to the Olympic ideas that the film is supposed to celebrate. <br /> <br /> Finally, I believe this film will appeal to that part of the American public looking for a quick boost of national self-esteem. Those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games are advised to look elsewhere.
