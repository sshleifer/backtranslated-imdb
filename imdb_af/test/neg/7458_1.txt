Everything about this movie is bad. everything. Ridiculous 80's haircuts. Ridiculous mustaches. Ridiculous action and fighting scenes where you can actually see the adversaries do not hit each other. Bad, bad, bad 80's music. Repeated scenes of people running through the bushes. A bad man with a silver plastic hand and stupid hair. Stupid dialogue. The acting is inconsistent. Everything looks very cheap. This movie even outperforms "Plan 9 from outer space" in its extreme bad. <br /> <br /> It's not "funny bad" it's just bad.
