Scott's collection of 80's icons can't save this teen disaster. But then I think that's why it's just a TV movie and not a big movie. William A. Schwartz (writer) comes closer to "Stewardess School", except this movie is more boring. This movie is not really stupid, just boring and completely relentless. The only reason to see it can be to see Tina Yothers in a real role after Family Ties. After this movie and equally dumb "Class Cruise", I think, Mr Scott woke up and went back to direct his sit-coms, which was his best move. 4 out of 10
