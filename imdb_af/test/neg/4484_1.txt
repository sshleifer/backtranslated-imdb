After reading the reviews I was so relieved to know that I was not the only person who was very disappointed in this movie! I'm a GREAT Nicholas Sparks fan, have read all his books, most of them more than once. Of course, I loved the notebook and a living to remember ... I haven't seen Message in a bottle or nights in Rodanthe, so I can't comment on those ... <br /> < But I did it. go see Dear John this past weekend and I was terribly upset! The movie was not good at all! If you just watch the movie and don't think about the book at all, it was still a terrible movie. I don't have the speed and variety of emotions of this movie I got from other movies I enjoyed, especially The Notebook. I didn't laugh and laugh and cry and worry and scared ... ever! From the beginning I could only see how they changed everything! The only thing about this movie that is similar to the book is that there is a man named John who is in the army and a girl named Savannah who doesn't ... the part of his father who is obsessed with coins is the only other part that went with the book. Everything else was completely gone !! First, in the book was Allen Tim's little brother, NOT his son! WHY they had to change it, I didn't understand. It felt much more like it was in the book when Tim was just a little older than Savannah, and they grew up together and Allen was Savannah's inspiration to work with horses and autistic children. It did not happen. In the movie .... Ugh ... And in the book they spent a lot more time than just the first 2 weeks and then the 1 night ... why did they leave those times ??? I can go on and on, but then I'll leave the room! So basically, if you're a big fan of Nicholas Sparks, don't waste your time or money on this movie ... just read the book again ... because it's terrible and nothing like the book!
