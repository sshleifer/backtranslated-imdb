It was an unfortunate performance. In short, it was about this child, Doug, who was very guilty. Seriously, he can feel guilty about the death of a fly and then feel guilty if he is guilty of killing the fly and so on. The animation was red and unpleasant and the jokes cheap. <br /> <br /> It was broadcast here in Sweden as part of the "Disney Time" program, and I remember enjoying it, but then I became 13. <br /> <br /> I never got why some of the characters were also green and purple. What happened to that? <br /> <br /> Actually a terrible show. Appareantly made it a movie I have never seen, but I also have no great expectations for that one.
