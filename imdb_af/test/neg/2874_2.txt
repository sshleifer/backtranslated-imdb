To put a word in simple words or rather will best suit PATHETIC !!!!!! The movie starts with a bit of interest on the plot, but BUT if a few minutes per audience becomes restless for toilets and snacks, or to get fresh air outside the closed dark hall. <br /> <br /> It looks like a 1960s movie, where the colors were dull, directed by a debutant and acted by high school students! Film revolves around an American lead that is active in the film, and is trying to make a return to movies by playing in one of the not-so-big Indian movies. Her acting is really Sad, supplemented by the worse dialup. <br /> <br /> About Everyone: I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie. Still want to watch: then try to watch it at home, if a TV channel airs it, I believe it will be fun, as this movie will not get a single ad and no sponsors. <br /> <br /> And better to wear an aspirin, you might need it if you can't find a remote to change the channel! P.S. I have no idea if the other reviewers have even watched the movie? I wasted $ 10 on the ticket!
