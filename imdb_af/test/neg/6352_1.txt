Buy this movie for one dollar and thought I could never go wrong, my big mistake looked at it. Enjoy the play by Ice-T and the rapping that gave class to this Los Angeles movie and the world of pimps. There is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a practice ring and has a career, but because of mental problems from childhood and killing this other boxer, he retires. He is hired by a pimp who is looking for a guard to protect the girls who work for him in their trade and make sure they are not beaten. This boxer falls in love with the boss's friend and all sorts of problems. It's entertaining and it becomes a big laughing comedy.
