I caught it in a Philadelphia theater for a short while. In spite of his local origin (and his relationship with a hometown scene, namely the raid of Eddie Polec in 1994), I have to get really hard on this movie. The director decided to shoot the entire movie guerrilla style, with non-stationary cameras and cuts. Such a technique can work for the scenes of violence, but is completely inappropriate for the rest of the material, making up the bulk of the film. A walk along the pavement, a brother-to-brother discussion on a couch, hell, even a shore on a prime, are all shot, and this leads to the distraction of this viewer ever in the drama to go. Martin also undermines his story by packing too many topics: besides the birth of violent violence, we get anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, parental abuse ... have I missed something? Undoubtedly, a better cast (and better focused direction) these threads, as Martin surely had planned, combined to demonstrate how one moral error leads and maintains a host other ... but good intentions are not necessarily " make a wonderful movie. Just a turbulent mess. Martin, I know you're from my town, and I'm with your husband, I'm really ... doing a better job next time, as you did in Two Plus One.
