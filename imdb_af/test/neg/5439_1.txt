I will give this movie a zero if I could. How anyone can rate it is higher than I am. Until I saw Rollerball, it was my choice for the worst movie ever of a big studio with a real budget (after which Mangler 2 or Leprechaun in the Hood is claimed, since the worst never says much, it's bad) /> <br /> Tim Curry's mother had an operation or something for him to agree to this non-sensual rubbish. I'm really not sure what happened here. The novel was wonderful, director Frank Marshall had a good record with Alive and Arachnophobia (maybe they had to change the title to Africa), the role was good and the budget was there. You might think someone would have bothered writing. <br /> <br /> You'll be better off looking at Battlefield: Earth than wasting your time. Congo makes you long on the return of MST3K
