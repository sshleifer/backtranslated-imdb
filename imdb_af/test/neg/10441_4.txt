The recent issue of Mad Dog Morgan on Troma DVD is disappointing. It seems to be a printed print for television. Some of the more violent scenes have been edited and portions of the colorful language have been removed. Anyone who considers the movie rude will be angry with the toxic DVD version. "Mad Dog Morgan" deserves to be released on DVD in the original play. But even as released on DVD, the film is one of the better portrayals of bushranger life in the nineteenth century of Australia. After the Old Melbourne Gaol, with the death masks of convicts on display, was toured, it was 'Mad Dog Morgan' coming in mind.
