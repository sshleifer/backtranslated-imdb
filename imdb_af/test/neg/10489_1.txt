I'm a fan of bad horror movies of the 1950s and 60s - movies so ridiculous and stupid that they laugh well. That is why it goes without saying that I would choose this movie - especially since it was with John Agar, it is virtually guaranteed to be bad. Unfortunately, while it was a bad movie, it was the worst kind of bad movie - rude and indifferent. At least with stupid and bad bad movies, you can laugh at the horrific monsters and terrible direction and acting. Here you never see so much of the monster (mostly because of the darkness of the print) and the play, while it is bad, is lower energy bad ... listless and boring. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a few young adults going to Satan's cavity to the neck. Well, considering the name of the place, it's not surprising if they are later visited! Duh ... don't go to Satan's cavity !! Well, there are reports of some sort of crashing object from the air, so, how are the teens going? Yes, throw a dance party - a very, very, very slow dance party where the kids almost dance in slow motion. So it is up to the Sheriff (Agar) and his men to ensure that the teenagers can dance in peace without fear of mastic. <br /> <br /> As far as the sample is concerned, it's a guy in a gorilla suit with a dull mask - a bit like the monster in ROBOT MONSTER. Not exactly original and not exactly high technology. To make it worse, it makes noises and moves very, very slowly - so slow that even the most corrupt teenager can easily overtake it! How to kill it repeatedly is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Overall, too boring to keep - even if you're a fan of an evil movie.
