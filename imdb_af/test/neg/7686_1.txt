I just watched the first twenty minutes of this movie and personally I think it's the worst movie to make in the past year. <br /> <br /> The plot was so bad that it would have been possible for a 10-year-old to write it. The acting was also untidy with almost an unknown role and not only that the action series were so horrible in the first half of the film, it was incredible. <br /> <br /> I don't know how the producers got the budget to film this movie, but the production company is right now. <br /> <br /> For anyone who can come to this movie in the near future, I encourage you to joke about this movie.
