I just saw Princess Raccoon at the Asian Film Festival in New York. The man who launched the film congratulated the audience on their fine taste. "You can be with Herbie: Fully loaded," he said with a smile, "but you're here to watch Seijun Suzuki's Princess Raccoon." The audience applauded and applauded. Well, let me tell you, I'd rather have watched Herbie: Completely loaded twice in a row. Princess Raccoon, an alleged musical based on Japanese folklore, easily qualifies for one of the ten worst movies I have ever seen. It's so miserable that she really likes my other Seijun Suzuki movies. This is quite a feat. <br /> <br /> There is such a wide variety of things that are wrong with Princess Wax that I almost know where to start. Perhaps his worst mistakes are aggressively incomprehensible and sensibly monotonous. If the rules are mixed or if half of them are lost, the audience will not know the difference. If you do not believe me, I dare you to steal a pressure and make someone rule in the random order. If you can tell me which one goes where I will give you every penny. <br /> <br /> The first third of the movie contains a mishmash of scenes, songs (including a cringe-penetrating rap number) and images It doesn't seem to be related in any way. Terrible integrated computer animation is thrown into the bargain, and another brick added to the enormous, and rapidly growing, wall of incomprehensibility. It won't surprise me to learn that the author wrote down any Japanese folklore that wrote down a lot of note cards, stacked them, shook them, took out the cards on a table, and wrote the script according to their order . <br /> <br /> About thirty-five minutes in the movie comes a plot on the scene. Something about a shape-shifting raccoon princess (in human form) and a regular man who falls in love. I was hoping it was a sign of the movie, something different from a series of confusing scenes, but not so much luck. The movie continues in the same absolute baffling way. I wish I had come out, but I was caught in the middle of a narrow drive. In retrospect it would have been the awkward scene. <br /> <br /> I'm exhausted, just think of the last few roles. I went every moment and hoped and prayed that it would be over. Every big dolphin movement, swelling in music, or remotely watched scene, as it were, was the conclusion of things that renew my hope that the credits are about to roll. For a malicious minute after a malicious minute, it continued. And over and over again. Finally, after dozens of false alarms, it cut to what I was sure, an abstract pattern should be about which credits are about to appear. Then, unlike any reason, cut it to another scene. How can I forget? The completely unrelated subplot of a ninja caught, flavored, and cooked in a soup was not yet wrapped. <br /> <br /> I'll never get that 111 minutes back, but you can save yourself the pain. Unless you want to pollute your memory or future enjoyment of great Seijun Suzuki movies like Youth of the Cattle and Tokyo Drifter, you don't see Princess Raccoon. I'd rather regret my time.
