Now let me first say I love God, terrible movies. Especially horror movies mainly. I watched hundreds of movies at Mystery Science Theater 3000 without any pain. But this is the absolute worst movie on the planet !!! I had to turn it off, it was so bad. It was indecent and just insoluble. Return me 3 times to the view of Manos. The Hands of the Fate or Monster, go about this every day. Avoid this movie like the plaque !! Excuse me now as I stretch my eyes to clean them of the filth I had to look to get a decent judgment for this movie. Just one decent gag in the part I watched, the hitmen were now an extinction for Hitmen Exterminators. Even that wasn't too big of a gag.
