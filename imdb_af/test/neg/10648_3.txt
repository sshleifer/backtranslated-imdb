After the failure of Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth, the chapter that served as a kind of "manslaughter" for the franchise, another embarrassment for cheapo entry, did not come as a surprise. An unrelenting attempt to explain every secret of Pinhead and the puzzle box, which literally covers centuries of history, in a movie that lasts under 90 minutes. On the screen, sub-pairing is too miserable, subject to miserable B-movie. special effects, and a ridiculous and insulting attempt at dark humor while STILL is trying to keep the whole project very serious. I wonder how many freaking directors did this thing? Poor Pinhead has so much screen time that every little mystery and threat possessing this iconic character is completely lost. After an hour of obedient speeches and dramatic attitude, we just want to tell the guy! a bit entertaining in spots, especially in the first segment, this rubble looks and feels like a cheap, ugly TV set that splashes after a while and ends in the most ridiculous way imaginable: Pinhead, along with his pet Cenobite dog, killing a lot of idiots ... in outer space! I'm sorry, but a real fan of the first two movies in the series, which has given this abortion of a movie more than 3 stars, must be ashamed. On a synot, the movie that follows; "Hellraiser: Inferno" is actually a surprisingly intelligent and stylish film-noir piece that brilliantly restores 'Pinhead' as a master of illusion and cruelty, and brings back the concept of inherent evil into human nature, which was the centerpiece of the original movie, and the whole point of the story. For a serious horror fan, see Hellraiser I & II, beat the bad III & this one over and continue with "Inferno." You won't miss a thing by overloading this garbage ...
