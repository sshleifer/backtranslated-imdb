I know this movie was shown on local TV when I was a kid, but I can't remember watching it or not; see it now, considering how absolutely forgetful it is, I still don't know ?? so i counted it as a first show! There were several films with the title character, a creation of the visionary French writer Jules Verne; These include: 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE OEE (1954, with James Mason in the Role), MASTER OF THE WORLD (1961; Vincent Price), MYSTERY ISLAND (1961; Herbert Lom), CAPTAIN NEMO AND THE UNDERWATER CITY (1969; Robert Ryan ) and the MYSTERY ISLAND CAPTAIN NEMO (1973; Omar Sharif). <br /> <br /> This version star Oscar winner Jose Ferrer. But even if the point of departure is not half bad? Awakening of suspended animation in his submarine, "The Nautilus", and finding itself in modern times, Nemo accepts all his ingenuity to help the US fleet defeat Megalomaniac Scientist Burgess Meredith ?? It's so easy his most childless adventure! For example, five seconds in the movie, Meredith's assistant ?? donate a steel mask? shout that "the world will be!"); equally hilarious are the zealous gestures of the similar vast midget, whose task it is to fire the Professor's everyday "Delta Beam". And how about the Android-type minions aboard Meredith's vessel that never looks much like everything? ! <br /> <br /> Ferrer retains his dignity throughout, but Meredith is embarrassing (in what is virtually a review of his 1960s BATMAN TV series and film penguin characterization) where the budget was so tight? mostly invest in flower production design and bad special effects, no doubt, and both apparently influenced by STAR WARS (1977) ?? It may not even afford a decent costume for him (he looks positively idiot with a tie in a sub)! The supporting film includes Mel Ferrer (a saboteur of Joan Fontaine from another Irwin Allen production, VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA [1961], and who enters a goat routine with his namesake in the "The Nautilus" engine room, Lynda Day George (unexpectedly, she is the only female character in the world) and Horst Buchholz (as the king of Atlantis, for whatever reason, Nemo is obsessed with finding the famous Lost Continent ). <br /> <br /> Incidentally, the movie of a three-part mini-series for theater exhibition has been reduced, does the film feel slack? although one can still distinguish where one episode ended and another started.
