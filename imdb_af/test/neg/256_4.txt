On Humphrey Bogart's first trip to Hollywood, he has his first leading role in this B-picture, Love Affair. The first thing to realize is that this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the classic love affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne or the two remakes that followed. It's not half as good as any of the movies. <br /> <br /> In fact, Bogey was second billed to Dorothy Mackaill as a deceased heir to find out that she had experienced her excessive lifestyle thanks to her father's best friend and financial adviser Hale Hamilton. It comes as a shock to Mackaill. She sees a business career as a means of income. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a pilot pilot who is also an aviation engineer and designs an ultimate aircraft engine and seeks investors. Mackaill is prepared to do this, and she also likes what she sees in Bogey. <br /> <br /> Given the cynical roles that Bogart later made a specialty, it is a bit disturbing to see him as this highly moral and self-righteous character in love affair. The part doesn't look good on him. <br /> <br /> Love Affair is your average B program second feature, nothing terribly special about it.
