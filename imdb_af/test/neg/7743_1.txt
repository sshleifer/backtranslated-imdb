And the title says it all: a cheesy sounding title that is a cute sounding joke of a movie known as "Alien from L.A." Why just call it 'Alien from South Africa,' as it is where this movie is filmed? My advice for the movie that appeared at Mystery Science Theater 3000 doesn't look at the original movie version! Period! Always watch the movie with the scene shadow at the bottom of the screen, with a man trapped in space with his two funny, sensible robot friends sitting in the right right corner of the screen. It just looks better that way. <br /> <br /> Films as originally seen: Awful! Movie as seen on MST3K: Genius!
