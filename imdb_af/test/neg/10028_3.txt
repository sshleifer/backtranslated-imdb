Fool walkers will camp in the Utah mountains just to run into a murderous, deformed gypsy. <br /> <br /> The Prey is a nice run of the mill-treasure movie, mostly suffering from a lack of imagination. The victim characters are all too famous idiot teens which means that one doesn't really care about them, we just wonder when they will die! Not to mention, it has too many chaotic moments and is full of endless, unnecessary natural movements. But it does have a few moments of interest for shooter fans, the occasional ghostly atmosphere attacks, and a decent music score by Don Peake. Yet it is as usual for dead-camper movies. <br /> <br /> There are much better movies this year, but the Prey is all over the place for the hard-treasure fans. Although one can be rewarded to watch Just Before Dawn (1981), Wrong Turn (2003), or even The Final Terror (1983). <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
