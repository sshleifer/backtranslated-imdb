Yes, a real stinker. I saw this movie on the advice of my "lovely" friends who told me it was a great "psychological" movie. This film makes it all possible to not be understandable. I was aware that I was a stinker after I saw the first 20 minutes. I was waiting because I expected to see something valuable, and most importantly, I pay for this movie. The guard was unbearable. After watching the movie, I talked to my friends and learned that this "film" in the intellectual environment (They call themselves under this title) of Turkey as a masterpiece. Yes, a masterpiece, but in the stinker category. I think a movie should be self-explanatory. This film is just the opposite. Keep away from this thing that calls him a "movie". Bring your money instead of paying for this "phenomenon". Rate: 1 out of 10
