Los Angeles doctor Tom Reed (Vincent Ventresca) survives a tragic car accident, but eventually gets into the high desert of California. When his time is up, he lands in a small, wind-swept town called Vagevuurvlat. His first stop is a bar where he quickly relaxes a beer and is appointed as a bartender. So much for ex-cons has a hard time finding work. This is the first in a long line of absurdities that makes the plot of writer / director Harris Done's foolish attempt at modern, desert-set film noir. <br /> <br /> His first night at work, Tom meets a sexy femme deadly name Sunny (Alexandra Holden), which is associated with a family of bad boys: the Oom Dean Mecklins (Gregg Henry) and his two cousins, drug addict Owen (Kevin Alejandro), who is Sunny's husband, and AWOL soldier Randy ("90210" Brian Austin Greer). After his shift is over, there is a shooting, and Dr. Tom stays close. He agrees to treat one of the wounded and, more importantly, do not tell the police. I'm not sure it's a good move for a man who's fresh from the pen, but this writing (written by Diane Fine) has little to do with logic. <br /> <br /> Tom made a series of poor decisions that caught him further and further with the criminal Mecklin Boys, including the stealing of medical supplies and with Sunny in the pocket. Everyone in the theater shouts, "Don't do it! Walk away," but Tom does. <br /> <br /> In a classic movie noir like "Body Heat" or "Double Indemnity" and empathize with William Hurt and Fred McMurray like them on the web of bright, sexy, devastating femme-deadly like Kathleen Turner and Barbara Stanwyck sucked. It's not their fault. We will probably also be tempted by all that money or that particular woman. But Dr Tom's weakness seems to be stupid more than circumstances. Sunny is sexy, but not a very compelling character, and there is no money to tempt him. You are going to wonder if he attended the same medical school as Dr Nick Riveria of "The Simpsons". <br /> <br /> The folly will believe that a redneck's rural home has almost everything you need to treat. a shot in the stomach and the one so wounded can easily get attention and participate effectively in a fist fight. It gives us an unquestionable car hunt with one of those "The Club" stuff clinging to the steering wheel. Oh, that oil tanker that just exploded - nobody saw it. <br /> <br /> I wonder how such a ridiculous writing ever turned green? Maybe Brian Austin Greer has more juice than I credited to him. It is obvious that he had the relatively small role of Randy - a cold murder - to show producers that he has more acting range than he showed on 90210. <br /> <br /> It is also a bit sad to see Nicholas Turturro playing a stereotypical Spanish drug dealer. He deserves better than that. <br /> <br /> If you have an IQ of more than 50, "Vagrant Fires" will shake your head in disbelief. I will give it 3 stars for the unintentional laugh and the scenes with the sexy girl. Holden walks around in her red panties.
