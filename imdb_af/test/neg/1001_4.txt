I am a huge fan of both Emily Watson (Breaking The Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (Normale) and am amused to see them up by Upington (Dellamorte Dellamore) staged in this shocking, rather small movie that had all the ingredients so much . more. The short plays in which he portrays a cowardly, infinite dish, worthless son of a rich Lord, are mocking and entertaining. But for a love triangle, there was remarkably little chemistry to talk to someone. The music was annoyingly movie-of-the-week quality, and the voice-over-shoot and totally unnecessary. Obviously, the work of a director for the first time with a small budget that gave good or not enough advice. Too bad. <br /> <br /> I can appreciate how the people you kind of hate are at the beginning, the one you like at the end, and vice versa, so there's a kind of character character, at least in terms of perception. For example, Watson's character, while she was refreshingly honest with her husband about her feelings for another man, almost ended me, especially when she announced to her husband that she simply had no control over her actions. , and later when she simply stated that she would go back to their marriage apartment, without permission, no excuses offered. And I came across Wilkinson's control freak / moral relativist character to understand him and didn't really want to change him (unlike his wife). <br /> <br /> This movie uncomfortable from a whodunit to a "Love Story" or "Steel Magnolias" disease drama without informing me enough about the fact, so I am inferred to guess what the following story can be long after they were all revealed (Was it the Lord driving the car? The Lord's dog?). The scene where Lord Wilkinson visits and tells how brave Watson is, the best nurse that a dying boyfriend can ever ask for, Florence Nightingale, etc., was OK until he jumped on top of the baby like a baby. Good God! If you ask me, she's just another movie-rich rich person with too much time on her hands, and so she runs hard at work, and gives the spouse fun with unnecessary drama. Her screw was just another way of occupying her empty life; The dying thing was an added bonus for her, as it had completely upset her previous actions. <br /> <br /> Look, everyone would have been better if Wilkinson just left her for his secretary, who seemed to appreciate him for whom he was. Instead, he acted like an abused dog, his open desire to increase his wife's love with every kick she gave him. I'm not an anti-computer or anything, it just didn't bind faithfully, even though we took into account all the hard realities of the middle-aged. The end to me was (and not the director's intention I'm sure) depressed. The movie has spent the last 80 minutes and convinced me that these two people are not just together, so I have no joy in the promise that their relationship will continue. I'm not above because my emotions are manipulated by a story, it just has to be a bit credible and not broken. Is that too much to ask? <br /> <br /> My Score: 4/10
