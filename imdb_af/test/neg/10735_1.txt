I can come across the political parody; even though it was SUPPOSE to be a "Masters of Horror" movie. <br /> <br /> But what I can't overcome is the blatant use of our war heroes (and their sacrifice) as pawns in some crop up horror maker's political statement. <br /> <br /> For me it was purely insulting to profane Arlington and our heroes. I have a family at Arlington. The idea that this guy (Dante) would even show that the Arlington tombs are disturbed just makes me do it. <br /> <br /> I'm done with Dante, and done with MOH.
