Like the poster mentioned above, I burnt the title and thought I got the other Piranha. This movie is all that the above poster said and worse .... Poor camera, mean acting and simply horrible story ... <br /> <br /> There was very little here even worth watching ... How this movie was even released is outside me. <br /> <br /> Make sure the movie you buy is the one you want ... and not the one. <br /> <br /> The movie I bought was "Piranha" and not "Piranha, Piranha!" what is it ... This is the only way they sold this movie. <br /> <br /> Peace Out.
