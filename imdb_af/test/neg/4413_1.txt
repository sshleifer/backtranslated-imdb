I saw this movie once at a kiddie matinee at the North Park Theater in San Diego in 1959 when it was released and I was 11. It was one of three features shown that day. <br /> <br /> I didn't see it but wanted it, because I'm a movie buff and appreciate the terrible with the good, good and average movies. <br /> <br /> What I remember most alive is that the more sophisticated audience members, aged between 8 and 15, cry with laughter at the tree monster. <br /> <br /> A threefold account at a 3-adventure movie theater is something that an 11-year-old doesn't forget, but I can't remember the names of the other 2 movies. (One star George Montgomery and David Farrar.) <br /> <br /> UPDATE: The other 2 movies in this triple account were much better. They were "Watusi," 1959, with George Montgomery and David Farrar and "The Angry Red Planet", 1959, staring at Gerald Mohr and Naura Hayden. Mrs. Hayden also wrote some books on health and fitness.
