I went to see this movie at the cinema on the basis of his potentially interesting subject, a good movie, a director who previously did the highly rated "Once Were Warriors" and my taste for noir-ish movies in LA in the Forties and Fifties. I would argue that I am fairly easy to please in this movie category; I appreciate the classics of the genre, but I will also enjoy half a decent and derivative effort. Yet I found this movie quite unbearable. <br /> <br /> In spite of a good situation in which the story is placed, no one seems to do or say anything that is remotely interesting or entertaining throughout the two hours plus of this sorry mess. Good actors are wasted in endless scenes of dialogue ranging from banal to embarrassment. The narrative is slack and unbearable, and none of the events depicting it are handled well enough to do anything other than to kill the audience. There is no drama, no atmosphere, no tension, absolutely no entertainment and in the end I just didn't mind what happened, because I didn't believe in the movie. <br /> <br /> L.A. Confidential came out a year later and regardless of whether one version of the story is more true, the latter gets all the rumors for its excellence in every section. Mulholland waterfalls fail in every department, but the fact that the amount of talent involved is all the more tragic. If they ever show it on a plane, I'll still walk.
