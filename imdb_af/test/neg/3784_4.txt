As Corky St. Claire in WAITING FOR GUFFMAN led the Blaine citizens into a horror movie with comic undertones, the result would have been much like the MILPITAS MONSTER. <br /> <br /> To be generous, it was the longest hour and twenty minute movie I've ever seen. To name the tempo glacier must be good. <br /> <br /> Almost no one associated with this project has ever made another movie, except Ben Burtt, who did the particular admirable (taking into account the budget) special effects. He also did sound for movies like MUNICH and several other great budget projects. The narrative is by veteran voice-over actor Paul Frees, who has probably donated his efforts. <br /> <br /> Watching the opening titles and seeing the Milpitas Unified School District as one of the producers you know a long, strange journey. <br /> <br /> Pollution at the drop in Milpitas, California, becomes so poisonous that it creates a monster. Remember that it was 1975 and ecology was a hot topic. Just a few years earlier, filmmakers were treated to GODZILLA USA. THE SMOG SAMPLE. <br /> <br /> So far so good. The monster is a winged creature that is at least fifty feet tall and has the ability to tear the town apart. Instead, it steals rubbish bins. <br /> <br /> Central to the premise is the idea that this monster can taste a small city and leave eight foot-long footprints but not noticed by anyone. There is a pretty imaginary scene where it runs in the middle of a carnival at night, but somehow no one notices. <br /> <br /> The only person who sees the monster to the final scenes is George, the town drunk. All the movie I hoped for and hope that George would be torn on the camera, but that didn't happen. Drat. In fact, no one is killed. George gives himself up to save Priscilla. He is tied to a helicopter to lure the creatures. George smells worse than garbage and the monster is attracted to the smell. <br /> <br /> The nominal lead is a group of high school students. There are beautiful Priscilla and her indescribable boyfriend and some "bad" boys who surprisingly surprise themselves to defeat the monster in the final stages. <br /> <br /> The sample is involved in four main chapters. He dropped a Browning-Ferris refuse truck and left it next to a highway, but no one knew it. He walks through the carnival, again unmarked. He broke up a building (nice miniature work) and no one saw him as George. Then he falls to high school during a dance and grabs Priscilla and carries her off as a certain very tall monkey has done several times, mostly in the winter. There are intriguing ideas that come out. Nowhere and Don't Drop. Local citizens poster at city hall because they want their refuse bins back. An extensive secret weapon for monsters being watched is flown by private jet, examined and forgotten. <br /> <br /> So why did I watch the whole thing? Because these people warned so much. I had the idea that firefighters were firemen, filming businessmen in their own offices, Priscilla could live well in the suburban channel, and screens of people in their sites might be in their own vineyards. <br /> <br /> They may not be good actors, but they are real people. No one is surprisingly beautiful. In fact, I would estimate that four out of five adults on the screen wear glasses. As it is in the mid-seventies, we see some very bad clothes and some of the men have terribly bad faces. A dignitarie that is being run at Ciry Hall before a meeting has such a hard tie and sports jacket that you think he is about to play Marcellus in the MUSIC. <br /> <br /> And this has the movie two extra stars. Zero for the story. Two points for the sometimes decent special effects. And two points to the fact that people in the community actually came together and did it. They could actually say they were in a movie; In spite of much experience and work behind the scenes in live television, I can't say it, and I'm happy for them. <br /> <br /> Remember the old old movies with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland? At one point someone will say, "Let's do a show! Aunt Edna has all the old clothes on the attic, and we can use Uncle Ned's barn!" Then they will do 'environmental shows' with sets and costumes that will cost well in seven figures if it is duplicated today. <br /> <br /> This is the spirit the good people of Milpitas had for this project and bless them for that.
