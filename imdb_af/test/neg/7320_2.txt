I had a lot of hope for this one after reading the back of the DVD: "In the spirit of American Pie and Animal House ..." After getting through, I realized I just blew $ 2.50 for rent it. This movie started slowly and just got slower. Short and brief moments of rule have shown that it was in the spirit of American Pie if you mean "spirit" as a dead thing. not very entertaining or fun! Don't be fooled as I was and expect anything scarcely vigilant because this movie will push you more than entertaining you. "Must fill in three more lines for this silly movie that doesn't deserve ... what a stupid, ignorant mess. This movie woke up, even the short nudity sucked!
