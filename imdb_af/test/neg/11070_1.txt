If I could give this apology for a movie, I'd have a 0 or negative rating. I was stupid enough to pick up this DVD in the store, read the blurb and think, it sounds very good, I'll spend £ 10 and buy it. all I had at the end was a £ 10 carriage. Quite awful, I don't even know where to start. I have no idea why someone gave it more than 2 stars, because I can't think of one good thing to say about it. <br /> <br /> The plot is basic, 7 people go into an untapped cave, one of them is a reporter. Nobody knows they are there. When they enter the cave, they cannot get out and are killed by a monster one by one. There seems to be no reason for the reporter. One of the characters has a few demons where his ex girlfriend drowns in a cave 2 years ago ... it also seems as if there is no reason or reason, just a rubbish attempt to take on character building. Anyway, the monster seems to be a man wandering in the cave as an ordinary little child and lived there throughout his life. It makes him no superhuman, capable of glowing, seeing in the dark, taking bullets, breathing underwater, being in two places simultaneously and having insane strength (rocks can move, wearing men as dead weight, etc.). <br /> <br /> In the end tones, there are 2 women who are alive, awake naked, just covered with a little back or something. They then find a picture of a child. The monster then breaks into the door in a carpet with a kind of animal skull over his head (in the commentary of the director, it was a crow's skull, if it was the biggest crow I saw in my life) Quite literally go "Raaahhh" like a kiddie on Halloween. I watched it with my boyfriend and at that stage he literally laughed. The man then saw a picture of himself as a child and jumped back to him under a tree, with his face, burned everything up and then got up and walked around in the cave. This is the scope of the background story why he cripples people and it makes you a bit cheated for a story. The monster then murdered one of the women and raped the other one brutally, cutting to end the credit. I know the rape scene was designed to be shocking, but as a woman it just got me sick and was the thing that affected me the most in the whole movie. He could have killed her and cut her into pieces and eat her and it would be less horrific than the rape scene. <br /> <br /> There are so many things left unanswered at the end. Apart from all these things, the scenes where there were minutes at a time of just black and nothing else were annoying and the constant misleading camera angles where it's all upside down and you can't see what's going on, make me one point so much I almost switched it off. An absolutely horrible movie. You can get as much money as you would spend on it and close it down. It would be better spent money, as a smart person who brought me above me said, if you looked at it, you couldn't look. This.
