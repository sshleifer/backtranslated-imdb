It was like watching the fan of an emerging movie, except that there was no movie. The film is so unsatisfactory and apparently unfinished to be almost laughing. The subject of this movie is about a very short time frame and frankly, nothing really happens in the 90 odd minutes of screen time. I was hoping for the definite Australian film about our soldiers in World War II and how they fought at incredible chances in terrible conditions. It certainly is not. <br /> <br /> That said, the acting was excellent and light. It could easily have been a good movie that gave more money and time, but it's not even mediocre and I can't recommend it at all.
