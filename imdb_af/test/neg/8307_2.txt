What a terrible movie! The play in this film is about the quality of a high school game or a story-driven pornographic film. This is not pornography in this movie, but there is definitely a lot of free nudity! This is one of the only redeeming features of the film, one of the only things that saved it from receiving a rating on one star. There is also a million police who die in this movie. Hardly offensive, although the violence is so unrealistic, we can only laugh. But breasts pop out and are exposed in the most surprising and hilarious times. If you really enjoy very bad movies, watch this one. This is a Bonnie and Clyde-type story, where a mother and her two daughters come from revenge. This movie also has a sex scene with two of the oldest people I've ever seen to roll naked!
