This movie is really BAD, there is nothing appealing or commentary on it except for the beautiful settings: Chilean landscape. I know I have to deliver four lines as a comment for this movie, but the thing is that it's such a bad movie that I can only say it's BAD. Michael Ironside is the only one saving the money in the movie.
