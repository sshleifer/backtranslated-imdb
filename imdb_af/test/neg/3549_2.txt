Request not to watch this movie ... It starts with a promise and as it goes on, you long for the movie to end ... Predictable, not entertaining, wasted movie ... Save your time and look at better thrillers. ... The synopsis sounds good and that's why I watched the movie. But it was too predictable with nothing to get you started. No great tension. No good direction. Nothing phenomenal about the acting. ... shy of this ... low rating ... Nothing to write about this movie, so I fill out the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how long a time wastes this movie ... really annoyed about how good a performance was and how bad a script is written ...
