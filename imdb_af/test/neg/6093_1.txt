If you make a suspense movie, it's so important that the "villain" is no longer sympathetic to the "victim". And it failed miserably. It was so terrible and frustrating to see that I was actually moved to register and comment. OK, so the man is rich and shy. There are worse objections, and the cabana boy and woman are showing a lot. The man is for a while because he does not approve of the cabana boy who physically assaults the woman - the witch who had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. The cabana boy threatens the man and repeatedly tries to deceive the woman. He then forces him on her - which finds the woman so hot that she stops raping and starts thinking she wants him. Uh huh. The misogynistic, inferior complex thoughts that the director exhibits are only rebellious. This is one thing when a fine movie like American Psycho deliberately tries to empathize with the villain but in Survival Island I felt like I was watching a movie about Ted Bundy, but the director didn't make him unequaled and instead, let us hate victims. What did he think ???
