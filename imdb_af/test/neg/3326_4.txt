I thought this movie was too absurd for me to complete it. The premise was too stupid and predictable. I didn't make it far in the movie. <br /> <br /> Let me see. She is of course older than the cabbie (unless she is much younger than she looks). He is black and she is white. She makes more money than he (he's just a cabbie). It's 3 of the society's most statistically failed trade unions, all emerging in one and we have to pretend they have a chance in hell. She will be better with the man she doesn't love. <br /> <br /> I just watched it partly because I like MJW as an actor. His performance was excellent. Hers, meh! It was OK, but the point of departure is too stupid. Didn't see the end. Couldn't make it there, so I don't know if it differs from what I predicted the end would be. I can't imagine a black woman holding this movie. There is something sick about looking at a black man eating such a white woman. And an old one. PLEASE! Not in the real world!
