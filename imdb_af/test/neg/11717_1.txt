Upon completing this infernal piece of waste, a friend and I vowed to vow never to talk about how we'd just washed away the last 90 minutes of our lives. This movie is completely useless, a two-dimensional hero and heroin we can't give, whether they survive or not, and some of the ugliest villains to obscure the screen of horror (or any other) genre. To further prove how utterly useless this movie was, I'd like to add a plot synopsis, but I can't write fiction. All in all, the only reason I can see it is that someone would ever want to see this movie if they killed their entire community and were looking for a self-controlled punishment that will haunt you for the next few years.
