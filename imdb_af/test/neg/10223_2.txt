Walt especially loved quality. So how will producers at Disney release such a terribly edited, coarse-activated (even family-owned) movie trash? THE GREAT GREEN had a good concept. And since it's Disney, you know how the movie will come out of course. But the BIG GREEN is terrible. The jokes are lame. And Steve Guttenburg, who is still alive, is still showing a terrible show on his CV. <br /> <br /> Children with too much time on their hands in the small town of Elma are given an opportunity by their new teacher to play football. However, the children know nothing. And merciful to us, we see that Steve Guttenburg is trying to hit the teacher from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The fast camera work doesn't work. THE GREAT GREEN is full to speed up the speed of characters to move the movie. Children are not idiots. They will catch if you give them enough of a hint without showing all that garbage. Guttenburg, once in his life, had to reject an offer to join this movie. The beautiful Olivia d'Abo also had to call this one. THE GREAT GREEN can be known as the Big Bomb.
