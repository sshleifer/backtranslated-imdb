overestimated, poorly written, poorly performed. did the academy even look at it? I do not think so. The political content guaranteed it an Oscar nomination - indo-pack border - a little boy, terrorism. Anything with the word "terrorists" gets attention in <br /> <br /> this post 9-11 world. It's like holocaust movies that are guaranteed an Oscar nomination, regardless of their merits. <br /> <br /> And please cinematography does not mean shooting landscapes that are beautiful in the first place. you must be a rotten shooter to screw to make the desert beautiful. at least it didn't win the Oscar. they were right. would have been a travesty.
