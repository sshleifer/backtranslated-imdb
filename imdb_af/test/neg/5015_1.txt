If you want a character in a movie, a disturbing sexual encounter that would embarrass the character in later life, was the only thing that would be regarded as scandalous by an audience, bestiality and now it is done . Judging from some of the other comments, it didn't even succeed. I can't remember one funny scene, though I have to admit, I had to turn it off before it was finished. I watched part of the director's comment and it seemed as if he was as surprised as anyone who did the movie well. If you want to get the same feeling, get this movie cheaper, keep your head in a heap of fog and breathe deeply.
