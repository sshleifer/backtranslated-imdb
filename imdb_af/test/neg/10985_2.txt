A few years ago I saw The Scent of Green Papayas by the same director. My feelings about both films are actually the same: beautifully shot, but terribly slow and boring. I saw this movie in a Sneak Preview and left after half an hour. Couldn't stand it anymore. How can one make an interesting movie about people telling each other how happy they are and how perfect their lives are .........? I had a fantasy about a forgotten American G.I, still wandering in the Vietnamese jungle, who was not aware of the war. How he would suddenly appear in the movie, and would start emptying his M16 with the characters in the movie. The red of their blood will make a beautiful contrast with all the green plants in the movie ........... So I was not much gripped by this movie! Time to leave!
