I think Trash really sucks. I watched it a few weeks ago and I didn't see that kind of c ** p at the cinema, since Female Trouble was by John Waters and it was even worse. The dialogues, the acting; It really stank, it was so bad, it made me leave to leave the theater and ask for my money back. But I'm actually glad I saw it, because then I could tell my honest opinion about it. One must see this movie, even if it stinks.
