WOW! What a terrible, horrific waste of time has found this celluloid atrocity. I remember it years ago and think it's nice, but now ... it's just stupid. Not to mention the fact that it is a blatant rip-off of "The Exorcist" to the point where it was released at one point under the title "The Sex Orcist". The only real difference is that the producers have the gall to discredit themselves by complaining about the claim that the events in the movie are REAL! Who in their right mind would actually believe such a brave lie? To make matters worse, there was a video release circulating with cover art that blatantly attempted to enter the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" by throwing a few lips on the cover! How low can one sink? Don't be fooled by the false claims, blatant lies or title separations, because you will be disappointed if you do!
