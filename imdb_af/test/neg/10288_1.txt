After a very frightening rough opening that gives you the crazy "chain saw masses", everything falls apart. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT: As soon as the two FBI officials start jabbing, you know they're the right killers. Anyone who has seen enough of these "crazy-ya" movies can portray it. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the things in mind: portraying brutal murders. Why isn't the girl tortured and murdered? Will this be for our filmmakers? The torture and abuse of children? What's wrong with your people? Lynch really has a disgusting, ugly thought.
