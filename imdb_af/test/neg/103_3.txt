too bad is this movie. While "Nemesis Game" is particularly entertaining, I have found it hard to suspend my entire unbelief, especially the situations Sarah has introduced herself. Do we have to believe it: <br /> <br /> 1) In the middle of the night, this hot chick will go unconscious around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels, just to solve puzzles? <br /> 2) The main players are presumably such experts that they play puzzle games for fun, but don't put the whole "I Never Sinned" puzzle to the end ... and then ... and then ... get it ... she must do the whole mirror thing to put the pieces together? I know it's the filmmaker's device to show the audience what's going on, but do they really think we're so stupid? <br /> <br /> 3) When Vern and Sara go to Chez M to question the blonde, there is not ONE topless chick in the whole building. Nada. C'mon. I know it's Canada, but I would expect more from a country that we gave Shannon Tweed. <br /> <br /> And anyone else notices that when Vern followed the web and found the mystery site, that when he switched over the pointer remained an arrow, and didn't have a small hand does not change (like ALL COURSES DO YOU CLICK A HYPERLINK)?!? I mean, if you play the internet so prominently in your movie, at least the little things get right. Geez.
