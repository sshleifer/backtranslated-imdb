*** MILD SPOILERS *** Dear Inman, kind words are hard to find for me to describe the movie I just subjected to those stars. The problems are very wide and painful for me to tell. . . Yet, I feel I should, if only to prevent others from experiencing the same anxiety as I did. It's not a movie for anyone under the age of 50, it's sloooowwwww, soooooo slowwww, and when the big reunion of Ada and Inman happens. . The biggest and most important scene in the film, nothing happens, it's an epic decline. Now, as the director had to do, I'll keep my words short and end with this warning. Your movie is unpleasant, boring, has no flow and Jude Law is tragically wrong. He has more emotion than a robot in A.I. - Be warned, the movie must be put. . . Bored Mountain. Love, Ada
