Human traffic is purely a "there, done what" experience ?? just this time it's pretty loose. <br /> <br /> Key themes explored are paranoia, male impotence and jealousy? but only light and weak. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie looks like Trainspotting (drug / `clubbing 'culture) wants to imitate? but it fails to include the low times / deposits that Trainspotting handles (eg death / dependency problems, etc.). It even tries with a similar monologue to Ewan McGreggor's classic "Choose Life" speech? but `The Milk Trees are on me! Yes! "What is the fudge about it? <br /> <br /> The characters are trying to analyze their lifestyle, but when their lifestyle is so level, their analysis becomes dull and repetitive. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (for a movie that is cool) is pathetic, including the likes of Fat Boy Slim and CJ Bolland ?? coming people on? Good dance music is better than that! <br /> <br /> The characters become red and annoying (especially halfway through the movie) and the lack of care for the characters starts soon. <br /> <br /> There are some funny scenes but they are little and far between. what caught the boy in the bedroom was quite amusing. <br /> <br /> But PLEASE I am sick to the death of Star Wars analogy scenes, I thought it was much sharper in some of Kevin Smith's movies (ie: Clerks and Chasing Amy) According to the characters Yoda is a drug flight, therefore he is short and naked ?? huh?! <br /> <br /> My score 4 out 10 Do yourself a favor and see Trainspotti or go instead!
