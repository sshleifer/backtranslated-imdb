It's just a bad movie. Not as bad as R.I.C.C.O. but bad. It was me at the beginning, and then I was completely lost. The play was far from now and then it went very far away. Don't see this movie at all costs, trust me with my whole heart !! The directors who are brothers are not the next HUGHES BROTHERS, who really made good movies such as DEADPRESIDENTS, VAN HELL, AMERICAN PIMP and MENACE II. The only person who showed me was Paris Campbell's scene, which will be. a great actor one day when he makes better movies than that. Christina Caparoula also did a good job for what she got. I hope the best is 10 times better than this piece of crap!
