How on earth can you have such fantastic actors in such an unhappy creation? This is one of the most stylized pieces of garbage I have ever seen. Not only is it poorly written, it is a product of unashamed direction and editing. The cinematography is so terribly manipulative and inextricable and the montage believed beyond belief. The real ideas behind the plots (cloning, toxic waste, climate change) are all good to start with, but where the production / direction team takes them, it's a huge stain of dirt, as seen in one episode. And this is a scientific series? I am a doctor and all I can say is that science in this movie is full of shit, almost embarrassing to watch. I really felt bad for the actors involved, as they were all extraordinary.
