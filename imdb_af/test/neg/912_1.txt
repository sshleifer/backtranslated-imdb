The first 4 episodes of season 6 are just to throw up, to predictable and the worst scenario I've seen. Will not and hopefully buy it. Also seen in the seasons back that episodes about the space they did suck even more. All I want to say to the people it makes is: don't do the whole episode about space, because they suck. The point is that season 6 is even more difficult than the seasons before. Feel worse from season to season. I was so disappointed and frustrated to see first 4 episodes of season 6 I just had to write. Only people who are brainwashed can see this shit. Looks like people who write the scenario have come out of ideas long ago. Think my 2-year-old cousin had a better idea for the episode than these people do.
