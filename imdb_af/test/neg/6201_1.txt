I didn't know what to expect when I started watching this movie, and then I pulled out my hair. It was one of the most pathetic films of this year ... in the last ten years. David Dhawan should just give his career as a director. I'm still on an original script that David Dhawan worked on. This one was a full bit, and you got rid of Hitch. I have nothing against remakes as such, but this one is just as common that it hates even the original one (which was pretty decent). I don't understand what actors like Salman and Govinda saw in this script. I read somewhere that it would be Govinda's return vehicle. If that is true then only God can save his career. Salman only helped over. Govinda, what I think is a very high-quality actor, has been completely wasted. Katrina Kaif and LAra Dutta had nothing to disassemble to wear designer clothes and did not smile for any rhythm or reason. Please stay away from this form!
