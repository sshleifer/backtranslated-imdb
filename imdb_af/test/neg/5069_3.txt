I came to realize by watching this kind of movie I don't like many of them. Caged Women is another "women in prison" movie, and like most of the rest of the genre; The plot is completely abandoned in favor of just nude women. Do not misunderstand me; I love nude women, but I also like that there is a kind of plot that goes with the nudity, and since this movie has only the basic 'women in prison' running through it (as well as the essential escape, of course), I got a little bored before the end. The film is good because there is hardly a moment in which women wear clothes, but it's about the only positive element. Director (and author, ha ha) Erwin C. Dietrich is nice to see near the naked female body, but it is never very erotic. The director was the producer on a number of garbage dumps, including some director of Jess Franco. According to me, he should continue to produce as his writing skills do not exist, and he does not seem to film a sex scene. This kind of material is very dry, but I think Franco could have made more of it. Overall, it can be enough for people who are really into these kinds of things; but I can't say I enjoyed it.
