Turd Pie: <br /> <br /> * Take x2 franchises * Cook for 5 minutes * Stir mixed cardboard characters (not actors work best) * Add 2 tons of cliches and bake in your Plot-Hole microwave until it is bored. . * Serve with a sprinkler of Dawson's Crack (not a tick) <br /> <br /> Voila! - Money-spinning Brain Rot for the Emo / World of Warcraft Generation <br /> <br /> Looking for the keys in the drain was the best bit (?) <br /> <br /> Apart from the first 5 minutes, is one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Extreme, Extreme, Nonsense.
