'Helen of Troy' follows the story of Helen and the outbreak of the Trojan War. It's more of a love story between Helen and Paris, which is shipwrecked and in love with Helen without knowing she is queen. The film portrays the couple as a love story and wants nothing more than to be together. (Other films and books have different depictions of the characters, but in this one they are simply hopelessly in love.) The movie is quite slow in some places, but the battles and details of the scenery are done fairly well. There are also good achievements. I thought the maid did a very good job, and she was one of the most popular characters. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good fit if you look beyond the slow moving story. places and look beyond some of the cheesy romance and dialogue. In my opinion, a perfect Iliad movie version has not yet been created, but this one is entertaining and has good bits and pieces.
