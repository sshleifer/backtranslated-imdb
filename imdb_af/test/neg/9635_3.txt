This representation of the popular children's story on film is pretty pathetic to watch. I know this is one of the earliest attempts at the film, but this 15-minute photo is unimaginable and poorly shot. "The Great Train Robbery" (1903), on which I also commented, is much more creative and exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> We see a little long-haired Jack trades a cow (2 men in a cow pack) for a bean of a trader and later grows a cowl where his mother puts them in garden throw (I think arm Jack has the wrong kind of reach). Jack dreams of a goose (actually it looks like a chicken) and golden egg and the next day the stem climbs into heaven. <br /> <br /> There has been no attempt to be creative in this movie. The stem looks like a rope with leaves on it, the giant is just a tall bearded man in a house with nothing abnormally large compared to Jack and the climax to the movie where Jack makes his escape with the goose and his golden egg no. is miserable when a filled dummy falls out of a snapshot instead of the giant and then the actor takes his place. He rises on his feet in an exaggerated death dance as in most early films. The bone limb (leaf-covering rope) comes from the top and rinses neatly on the giant forehead. <br /> <br /> See something else.
