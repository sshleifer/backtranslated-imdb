And you know why? Because they thought (or at least horror fans thought) that a bunch of indifferent, dirty mouths, teens scream, some silly demons (Where do they come from? What is their purpose? Who knows?) And a dark house is everyone you have to make a horror movie. Needless to say, they were wrong. You also need a script, some logic, some rules and some inventions. This movie has a scene that leads to its reputation (of course the lipstick scene) and a few funny moments (the child's brother's description of his mother's cookies, Linnea Quigley's "don't look at my" scene). It also has more curse than any movie I've watched since I last saw Reservoir Dogs. Literally every fourth or fifth word is a "f ***" or a "b ****". Then again, when a movie starts with FOUR false scares in its first 5 minutes, you don't know what looks like good movies. (* 1/2)
