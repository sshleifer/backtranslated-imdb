It's a bit slow for a horror movie, but the quality is better than you can expect for a director's only effort on IMDb. The camera work and lighting were both surprisingly good, and the acting? although variable ?? is better than often found in Indian genre flicks. <br /> <br /> As the lead, Robert Field is quite stiff, which is particularly regrettable as his character, Claude, is the narrator of the movie as well as the center of his action. However, it was the entry of Christopher (Brandon deSpain) that I saw the turning point of this movie? and not in a good way. A twist is introduced in a clumsy way, and slowly moving is pulled out and becomes too much. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Pete Barker is consistently entertaining as Father William. He is the easy outing in what is a fairly ordinary offer. While the first half-hour caught my interest, I finally felt disappointed about how things were playing.
