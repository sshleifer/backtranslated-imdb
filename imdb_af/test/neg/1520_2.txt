Being a big fan of the bottom line, I really look forward to the release of this movie. I was eagerly looking for a nice little trip ride. Altogether. <br /> <br /> Where does this mess start? I think it's a good start to say that it's hardly rich and eddie on our screens in the first place, since nothing of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well is funny. I'm still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minute viewing. Many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the movie was full of the bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave the final track. <br /> <br /> The overall set and atmosphere around the movie is dark and the thing I think is good if they want to portray the "horrible" guesthouse is the 2 buffalo's attempt to run, but to me it is just a higher damper on a sorry state of filming that should never be created. <br /> <br /> The acting is sometimes pathetic. Fellie Fielding is wasted as the loony Mrs F oxfur and I have seen Simon Pegg have much better outings. <br /> <br /> I would recommend Guest House Paradiso to anyone who is blind drunk because they can appreciate the terrible words much more. But to any bottom fan who didn't see this movie and expecting the true rich and eddie action you warned
