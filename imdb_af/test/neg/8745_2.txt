I suppose you can say this film has a potential boundary, but nothing more, because the boy has bound the filmmakers. The plot is virtually incomprehensible, the pacing is fun and the acting is pathetic. And what the hell is a trading mess? However, the worst of this film's climax is the anticlimax of all anticlimaxes; plus the title doesn't even look remotely accurate. The only redeeming feature of this movie is the pretty dark-haired woman. Well, the blonde girl was also beautiful, but she was annoying and not as beautiful as the brunette. Anyhoo, as with many movies, is one that can only be seen on MST3K.
