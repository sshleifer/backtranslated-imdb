A Delta Force Army unit dedicated to finding a group of missing Green Beret bad donkeys who are not known to completely miss will be in a fight to survive against a covered skeleton man, the supposed spirit of an old Indian warrior who was revived when archaeologists disturbed his grave. The Skeletman man drives a horse and has the ability to continue with a type of dimensional gantry, and looks unaffected by bullet fire and explosives. The skeleton's horse leaves no prints behind and he can quietly drive from behind and around his prey. The film's point of view through the Skeleton Man's eyes looked at his prey with a different color. In other words, he is not seemingly human, so how can Captain Leary (Michael Rooker, like grizzled and intense as ever) and his gang of wills stop this threat? For some reason, the Skeletman Man kills employees of a nearby chemical plant. What are the skeleton's motives to kill endless people? And why are blind Indians living in the bush inhabiting our commandos spared the Skeleton if one slaughtered his entire tribe to prove himself? <br /> <br /> As completely silly as it sounds. Just incredibly terrible. This is the kind of film that can derive brain cells. Casper Van Dien receives second invoice in the credits just below Rooker, but is anointed with a ridiculous underwritten character who leaves the film very early. Rooker deserves better than that. If I were an actor, I wouldn't want this movie in my CV. The Skeleton Man is an indignant Knight Knight of a de Ossorio movie. He has a spear that can only bend certain people while the head of a woman explodes. An arrow shot of the Skeleton Arch actually destroys a helicopter's propeller. For almost 99% of the film, bullets are shot at the Skeleton and he can go inside the portal, at the end, suddenly he becomes vulnerable to attack. Oh, and the horses also change if the Skeleton man freely moves through the forest from that portal. The film is written and edited by clowns. The attacks are poorly built and the characters, who are supposed to be predecessors, make really bad decisions in this movie. The mind falls on this movie. Good for a few laughs, and a few gore screens make this hup of pure shit watch like a trash film.
