Sorry to not be with you, but I found the DKC series to be quite enjoyable. So much so that I invested in the SNES system and my own copies of the games. This is in mind, almost ten years after the initial release of DKC 1. The graphics were for their time, the first vector graphics games for home systems. The music and characters are all memorable, and the games have entertained me and my girlfriend for hours. True, the second match was better than the first, and the third might be the "edge" of the second installment. But all three offered different games, and I enjoy them to this day. By the way, I'm old enough to remember when there were NO video games (and TVs were black and white!).
