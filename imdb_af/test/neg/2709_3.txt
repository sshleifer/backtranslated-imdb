I was actually planning to watch this movie when I saw it in my TV guide, but after about 5 minutes time was definitely more valuable than "Who is that girl" ever worth. Describing how Madonna's acting looks is impossible and the end result is one of the most annoying characters ever captured on film. This crap is an insult to movies and intellect. I almost never have! Rate a movie I don't see from start to finish, but in this case, the former is impossible. 10/02
