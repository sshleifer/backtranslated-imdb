I haven't seen this movie in years, but the terrible "taste" of Quaid's performance still lies on my tongue. Some have commented on how Quaid Jerry Lee Lewis "has a tea", but the fact is that he only has Jerry's extreme stage in mind. No one works the way all the time, and the show comes down as hopeless clownish, which reduces Lewis to a buffoon caricature. The nuances of a man's life are lost in the mess of pure overworking. <br /> <br /> The author of the book based (Nick Tosches) is a good writer, who has written several fine musical bios. (I especially thought "Dino" on Dean Martin); In the books Tosches gives us a full human, both separately from and involved in the "biz." Quaid's play seems to imply that Jerry never acted like a man. If people were like that, nobody would bother to hang them. As cartoons go, it's almost amusing, but otherwise it's one of the most sincere movie-destroying performances I have had the honor of watching. Terrible ...
