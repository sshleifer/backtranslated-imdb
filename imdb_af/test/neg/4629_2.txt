Sex is a most popular aspect of existence. This is perhaps the most interesting activity between birth and death. LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN studies human sexuality in a dry and boring way. Actually, worse than just being boring, as new age 40s are, it's unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I think there are some shocks to being adults as old as our parents talk about sex, but after twenty minutes, it stops being interesting. Perhaps if the characters were 20 years younger, the movie would be more visually fascinating. <br /> <br /> LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN is not worth it.
