Anyone awarding this movie over a 3 has a very distorted view of movies, anyone who rated this piece of 7 or higher, I have absolutely no respect for their taste in movies and doubt they are ever a good one seen. I'm always giving a movie a shot and I've done with this one, I tried to pay attention. I tried not to let my money go, but 2 minutes in my friends laughed at me because I was listening. 2 my iPod, 25 minutes later I couldn't even watch the overworking thing that took place in the movie, so I did and I've never walked out of a movie. To this garbage. Anyone who said they enjoyed it is a liar or they should be banned from this site. I am so angry when I see that a person evaluates it 8 when the Godfather's overall rating is 9.1. It's like saying that movie was close, that's not it.
