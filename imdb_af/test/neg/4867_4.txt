It all looked pretty promising. An emerging presidential advisor was set up for a series of murders, as he was determined to have a conspiracy in the White House. It dies the excellent Donald Sutherland among several skilled actors. Yet very few people have a good word to say about it. <br /> <br /> The whole thing really needs depth. You can pick up the idea that the President is left with his ideas, and some within the government want him dead to stop the ideas being executed. Conrad simply seems to have the country justified, rather than the way the elected leader. <br /> <br /> The action scenes, however, had some logical holes - the sewers and elevators already mentioned, and the rather haphazard method - and Linda Hamilton's character is completely uninspired. Her 'the President's My Father' 'distraction' was ridiculous - that would make the president about 10 when it happened. Even worse was her predictable final scene with Bishop. <br /> <br /> But they could have made a challenging, inventive political excitement, but also bottled or failed. They could have gone to special effects to the town, but the goods were wasted. They could have achieved so much more in general. It was hardly worth the Â£ 1 it cost me.
