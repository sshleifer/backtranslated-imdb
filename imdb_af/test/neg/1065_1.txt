This movie is so copy-cat, cliché-ridden, clumsy and laborious. I find it astonishing that someone was unable to get through the session experience. <br /> <br /> Here's the variety of idiotic clichés, ridiculous psychologists, and simply unspeakable storytelling in this "hard-hitting" show of high school: The tough old jock is really a homosexual. The A-student is unhappy because his father pushes him and somehow causes him to incite. A teacher is common to a student who shows his pants in class. A girl who goes with the above jock is really in love with him and wants a family. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only saving grace is the student counseling tales that are vaguely interesting, but most of the devices in this movie are so loaded that they believe beggars. <br /> <br /> This movie shows me no insight into teenagers and I won't be surprised if it's bombs, especially with teenagers. The people who like this movie seem to worry parents about their teens, and the boy blows up the wrong tree if they think this movie will help understand teenage problems. I mean, what is the moral of this movie? "Hey guys, let's all look out for each other and hug each other." Give me a break. Anyone who thinks you can get through to a 14-year-old with that kind of message should think back. In the 1980s we looked at Kentucky Fried Movie, Xtro, Porky's, Evil Dead, Terminator, and so on. This movie falls on deaf ears. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is right there with another Australian "in-depth" movie, "One Perfect Day," which was as bad as this movie's turkey. Thank God, no taxpayers are spending money on this boloney. <br /> <br /> AVOID !!!!
