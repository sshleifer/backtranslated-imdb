As I returned to watching Wong Kar-wai's 1994 film Ashes of Time ?? More specifically, the 2008 redesign and reload with the word "Redux" clapped at the end of the title ?? I wonder what went wrong. I wonder why the movie just didn't work out at all. I wonder why the movie didn't play any important points in my book. In particular, what was it about the movie that dragged it down and made it the director's worst movie of his career? <br /> <br /> Well, it's not too hard to really figure out. Let me just say that it is really a pity that Kar-wai has so suddenly taken down this hellhole of mediocrity and weakness in the film, especially in view of the fact that in the same year he was Chungking Express, one of his lasting legacies and an absolutely sublime film. So ?? what went wrong? It would be appropriate to consider Ashes of Time as a bit of an experimental movie. Our director puts his own unimaginable style of movies and places them in a completely different environment, atmosphere and atmosphere. The result is a catastrophic film that is all over the place and simply doesn't work out. So it would be even wiser to call Ashes of Time a failed experiment. Fat, brave and innovative, yet a failure. <br /> <br /> Let me work out. Those who watch the movies of Mr. Kar-wai, a Hong Kong-born movie author who, since his late 80s debut, made his mark on the world of art, knows that there is a dominant aesthetic that binds all of his films together; In essence and frankly, they are all colorful, enticing, amiable, subtly humorous and meaningful feelings of life, love and loss. The same formula is converted into As of Time; However, the regular area of ​​Hong Kong is ridden and in its place we are placed in the vicinity of ancient China, and the country of the legendary martial art warriors and clansmen. <br /> <br /> Intertwined in this quasi-adventure / historic caper is the typical Kar-wai love story, this time with an elegant hit that moved to the middle of the desert and executed contract murders. However, I must stop myself there; character description is a useless thing to do. Why? Because not a single character in As of Time is worth mentioning or nothing. What a mere cast and what a waste of talent (Ashes of Time contains almost all the usual Kar-wai co-workers). <br /> <br /> Not only that, but the movie is essentially endless in a terrible, almost non-existent story structure. One of the main reasons why opponents of Ashes of Time are rhetoric is because it seems to have no plot, let alone a shine or an indication of one. You can definitely see what they get, even from the first two, three minutes, maybe less of the movie. Perhaps it is just the atypical setting of ancient China that is inappropriate and inappropriate for Kar-wai's typical movie style. I like to think, no matter how unlucky, Kar-wai just filled a lot of time here. <br /> <br /> One thing that a reviewer can actually compliment in Ashes of Time, though said compliment is strongly isolated, is another director's trademark ?? wonderful, colorful and happy aesthetics. What joyful color is put on the screen, which glorious textures are painted for us, and which breathtaking landscapes and images are captured by us throughout the film. We can at least take it as a sign that Wong Kar-wai is still there, and it is just the film that is so atypical and usually buries his laudable nuances. Although the footage is not enough to evade Kar-wai fully for this disastrous business, is it enough to make the movie worthwhile? and at least we don't get out of the movie in a completely and totally cantanker mood, now that there's something we can think of nicely. <br /> <br /> The movie is essentially a wuxia art film, which follows the style of, say, legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. One thing, however, distinguishes Kar-wai's film from Kurosawa's best, and it is that in the Japanese director films everything gels and just works. In Ashes of Time, nothing seems to work. Kar-wai's attempt to make a truly profound Wuxia film, leaving an intellectual and challenging film in general terms, is a useless pursuit. <br /> <br /> Kar-wai claims that Ashes or Time exhausted him and needed time to clean his head. It must be a difficult effort for him, as his effort is embodied in the film and conveyed directly to us? I mean, just watching the movie is an exhausting effort, and now I need time to get rid of this unpleasant movie experience.
