I expected this movie was originally supposed to show up before the election. CBS's last shot to throw a dig at Bush. This movie was just awful, but I still watch it. ** Mr Spoiler ** I think CBS has the same people who "provided" the memos to do the half-cut in half-order. What's with the bad boyfriend story? Can the play be more confronted or the dialogue more like an Ed Wood movie. Whoever ever came to this writing, please stop us from writing a favor. If you want to see decent B-grade disaster movies, see Earthquake, Flood, etc. Avoid this mess of a movie. Hint to CBS avoiding showing us this crap. Instead, give us CSI again. Better acting and more credible.
