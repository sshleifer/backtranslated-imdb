2001 is one of those movies where you, if you don't like it, told you you didn't get it and you had to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism. You are told that you clearly have a slow attention span, and just want sex, explosions, and give the plot to you on a dish. <br /> <br /> Let's break down the movie, will we? Three minutes of blackness, with something like a dying hippo in the background. Then we get the opening credits. A moment of fascinating shots of the Savannah. Then a lot of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with legs. Cut to the first of many 20 minute shots ships that do things while playing the "Blue Donau" in the background. A lot of useless dialogue and a group of lunar scientists find another monolith. <br /> <br /> Cut into a spacecraft that is too long for the crew complement - three berths, two people named Dave and Frank, who are just slightly more personality than the stiffs in hibernation. And then there's HAL, the 'perfect' supercomputer that drives the ship. Predictably, he snaps and starts breaking the first law of robotics. Now it's something that has potential. An evil, cold, relentless super-thought that controls the surrounding environment and can predict every move. And what does he do? He drives one man into space and turns off the hibernation machines so that the three sleeping guys die, which Dave drives in a pod. He simply uses the hatch, attaches a space lever, and slows down HAL agonizingly. There is apparently a psychedelic 'evolution' at Jupiter. <br /> <br /> Here is the movie with the pauses pulled out: Monkeys see monolith, kill things. Scientists find moon monolith. HAL killed people. HAL dies; Dave gets a prescribed message and develops at Jupiter. <br /> <br /> It's not me who doesn't get it. 'It's bored me by long regions of absolutely nothing. Sure, it's realistic, but I find I have no reason to care. No matter the message, no movie can be good without being entertaining. Frankly, every character can be replaced with Keanu Reeves, and nothing will change.
