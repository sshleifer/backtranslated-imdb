As a pilot and war movie buffalo, he stands at the bottom of my list. It is historically totally inaccurate and the sound sounds and acts as if they just walked out of a high school play. The acting, script, direction, production standards and decisions are all rubbish. The only saving grace is from the flying rows. If the people they portray are fictitious, I can evaluate it a 2, but if there is one thing that annoys me more than anything else in movies, it makes sense that it is history and that the great people they are trying to be, actually it did! It is almost as if they are trying to write in so many notable WO1 personalities. There are many good WW1 flying movies and this is NOT one of them.
