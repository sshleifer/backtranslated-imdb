Some of the biggest and most beloved horror movies have a bad sense of humor, but when a movie comes together, it's not as original as the classic, but just goes there to laugh, then a bunch of poo -faced- critics completely beat it off. This film laughed aloud to me a few times, this is proof of the way this film was approached and pointed out. The two main lines seem natural and credible and this really helps this movie. You root them completely and laugh with them, everyone has friends like both guys. Another highlight for me was the monster truck, it's great, intimidating and very well shot. With inspiration (completely stolen) from numerous films, the obvious Duel, Jeepers Creepers and probably in reference to the Jack Black equal acorn Orange County. But really, you can choose any road trip that went wrong and find a reference here. But so, what is not trying to win Oscars, just give the viewer a good dose of fear and laugh and at that point it's a 10! Obviously it doesn't get a 10, I give real meaningful reviews and scores, other than 99% of people on IMDb. There is no way this movie can get zero because so many lazy idiots give too many movies and just as fun is not a 10. It's just a great movie for everyone with a sense of humor and a taste for fear. You can't really get that simple anymore.
