BARNYARD sucked! I saw this movie last week and it's terrible. Which bull has udders? My 2 year old asked me if all cows had udders and tried to explain to her that it was simply not true and that the movie just confused her! <br /> <br /> In addition, the violent theme scared me 2 years old. They watched the coyote cruelly and it bore a fear of coyote in my daughter. I know coyotes for a fact are not cruel and are natural predators. The mother and son who sat before us shouted, "Kill him, kill him, yeah" in a particular scene in the movie where good vs evil says. <br /> <br /> It's a Lion King rip off and they have to stop using big name actors for a lame movie. Steve Oederek, who also did Thumb movies, such as Thumb Wars, Thumbelina and many others, is so bad! <br /> <br /> If a good Steve Oederek movie ever comes out in my lifetime, I will naked and swallow my diarrhea and post it on Youtube.com ... Enough!
