Unlike one of the judges below, I do not think that a great and glittering career lies ahead of the director of this turbulent and boring piece of umbilical certificate. While it is good to see a British director try to break out of the context of convention, AKA's only claim for innovative celebrity is based on the novelty of the triple screen. Initially you think it might be an interesting device, but its only real contribution to the movie is to test your sight and patience. Seeing the same character of 3 different angles in a two-dimensional movie makes it no longer revealing or complex. If you can forget the triple screen (which is assigned is very difficult to do), you should handle the unintentional hilarious text. The audience is beaten by Chiche about Chiche over the British class system. The film has the political and emotional sophistication of an episode from above and below. To summarize: the emperor's new clothes. And quite a poor outfit.
