I like most of the Full Moon Pictures, so I ordered this movie from the USA, because in Germany you can't get it anywhere. I thought it would be as fun and amusing as the Subspecies or Puppeteer series because they were full of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was happy when the movie finally arrived. <br /> <br /> But after watching this cute movie, I was very disappointed. The actors (I think you can't even say actors) are boring and unbeatable. The story was a poor performance and even the set and the monster were very cheap and common. <br /> <br /> I hope nobody will ever make a sequel or repetition of this horrible movie. :-)
