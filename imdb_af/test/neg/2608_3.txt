It had its moments, but when I looked at this cartoon as a child, I was bored with my thoughts. The only thing that watched me was the fact that it was a cartoon, probably my first anime exposure. This is also one of my least favorite anime's, I remember others who had a huge ship in space that didn't make sense, but were nicer because they were in space. I also remember one with these people who were dressed like birds that were a little strange but more entertaining. However, I do not like motor sports at all, did not do it and still not, it is probably one of the reasons I do not care about this show, although I am an avid anime fan today. The characters were also a bit goofy, and then there were the horrible scenes where virtually no action took place. It was probably used to lower animation costs and supplement the performance. However, the gadgets in the cars were cool and gave me some entertainment. Overall, I find this display quite uncompromising compared to new animes and some of the same era, but it's just a personal opinion. I'm sure many other reviewers of the show are cool.
