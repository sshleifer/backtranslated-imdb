I'm a pretty much a sucker for Ghost Hunter shows. Some of the Cheesy mockumentaries like Discovery Channel's "The Haunting" to Scooby Doo Reality are shown as "Ghost Hunters". When I saw promotions for A & E's "Paranormal State", I knew I was going to look. Especially when the "Paranormal State" is placed against a weak Monday night soccer match. <br /> <br /> At the end of the "Paranormal State" pilot, when the main character in this reality dance-macabre a Creepy Kid gives a bottle of Max Von Sydow Holy Water and reassures him through this boy he also had an unspecified bad experience as a child with things coming out of the closet and the (Catholic) Church gave him a Holy Water to know the things coming out of the closet I had to give another shot on Monday football. <br /> <br /> The link behind "Paranormal State" is a group of Penn State students who have all gathered and started their own. Ghost Hunting Club. Or society. Or Super Adventure Club. And they run around Pennsylvania and investigate the most horrific ghost and the lost plot of a M. Night Shymalan Movie. <br /> <br /> The "They" are kind of a misunderstanding. Really Paranormal State is turning to a Nittany Lion, named Ryan Buell, which is likely to perform the Penn State's annual Anime convention if it wasn't for this show. He is often accompanied by "investigations" by hot co-eds and other people who are seen in the credits, but rarely caught on camera. Hey, are they ghosts too? <br /> <br /> This is Ryan Buell's performance. Paranormal state is his "vehicle" as we would like to say in the Biz. And, oh, what a dull ride in a vehicle he can be. <br /> <br /> Did I say Ryan tells the whole episode of Paranormal state in a star-date-less "director's log" vote? Almost immediately it becomes annoying because the obvious intention is to hunt Ryan's ghost, but his filtered monotone does nothing but grunts and laughs. Seriously, every serious intonation sounds like the radio talk of a Call of Duty video game. <br /> <br /> The "investigations" - the plot that spins every episode - is interesting on the surface. No haunted houses or restaurants are found in "Paranormal State". It's a show about the stranger, like a good Catholic son, and by God they give you things to fear. <br /> <br /> Small children are harassed, things are in the dark, voices encourage life to kill, and the Aleister barely rubs my hands. Of the two episodes I watched, each one turned around to detect violent, nasty spookies on violent, nasty deaths. <br /> <br /> Maybe. <br /> <br /> Maybe not. <br /> <br /> Everything in "Paranormal state" is short-handed in half an hour, "Dog the Bounty - er, Ghost Hunter" blocks. Every time there is an interesting, verifiable difference - the murder of a family in a farm in the 1800s - the evidence is flown in front of the viewer, like an artist trying to give you a stack of paper currently under your control. is convincing. nose is proof of the ten million that came from Nigeria and then chased away before you could get a good rope. <br /> <br /> At least with the Sci-Fi channel's "Ghost Hunters" there is a somewhat excessive need to express every possible piece of evidence and present it to the viewer. EVPs that can be a rat, cool spots in a booth, and 'bulbs' that even Ghost Hunters discount themselves as dust. It's a kind of Scooby Doo approach that makes "Ghost Hunters" almost believable. While "Paranormal State" claims EPPs, the viewer gives a ten second video clip of a wave file in Garage Band without sound. Yes, see, an EPP, right? People claim to see dark figures in the basement ... Well, we're just gonna watch over ... while the night vision camera leaves on a staggering stationary lap shot. Ryan, the fearless leader of this pack of Penn State graduates, claims "visions" of a devil's name he knows, and who may be involved in a paranormal ghost. But he can't tell us, the audience, or his team has graduated, because ... he can't. You never say a devil's name aloud, Ryan lifts the wide-eyed co-ed that immediately asks. <br /> <br /> Well, how much, very convenient to you. Especially since it is a television series where the audience cannot read your mind. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal state" is everything Turn and not Prestige. The audience is told what is supposed to happen, but you never see a gram of evidence that the flu child sees the Dead People. Not even moving grainy video from a chair, or a black blob running between prison cells. Nothing. You just told me what Ryan did in another mechanical voice. <br /> <br /> If you're trying to haunt me, I'll have to dress it up a bit. If you try to swing me, show me an orb or a blob and get the thick chick that works days at Hot Topic, tell me why the black orb is the spirit of an ax killer. And if you want me to show a ghost hunting show, I'll give you something other than to put Lorraine Warren on the second episode. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal state" is badly sous. Not really worth watching, unless you have the TV time, or just a thin of a DVD collection. Or if you don't want to know what really happened in that closet with the Holy Water.
