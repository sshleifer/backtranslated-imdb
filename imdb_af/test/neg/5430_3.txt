I just watched DVD on Congo. In most cases, I love these movies, but this one is different. This made me write my first comment for a movie on IMDb. I was amazed at how such a team of experienced filmmakers could come up with this movie. You can see there was a lot of money for this production, but you can't make a good movie if you don't have a good writing. And as a producer, Frank Marshall, we've given a lot of movies to watch; he had never been another Spielberg. This one shows how hard it is to make a good movie, maybe you have all the ingredients, but if you can't cook, stay out of the kitchen. If you can make a proposal, don't spend your money on this one. If you want to see it, watch it on television first and make your own mind.
