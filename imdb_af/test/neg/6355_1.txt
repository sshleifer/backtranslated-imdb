In the aftermath of the matrix, this travesty of a loose-link film to VR was re-issued with the tag line "The Matrix Has Only Deadler!" Had, in a box with a lot of Matrix-inspired cover (still called "Expect to die" though). However, due to the choice of the font, the tagline looks like the whole world as it says "Beablier". Anyway. <br /> <br /> To complete the transformation to Matrix wannabe, they mocked a VR battle scene with a Morpheus-a-like on the back of the box. It may be important to know that this character is NOT in the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a travesty on every level. Jalal Mehri is a horrible actor and does not impress with his martial arts. But his partner Stone is played by Evan Lurie, who in this movie is just the worst actor I've ever seen. Obviously he was chosen to make Jalal look good in comparison. The worst movie I've ever seen.
