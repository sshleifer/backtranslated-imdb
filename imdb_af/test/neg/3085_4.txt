I saw this movie right in the middle as I went through a break. It was about 3 in the morning and I struggled with insomnia with a quick snack. It wasn't too bad, but every time I tried, I couldn't take it. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it was cute and I loved the variety of characters, although they could do better than Goran V, in my opinion. But the one thing that made me look was Heather's character and her sad "dedication" to her husband who didn't want her anymore, which made me feel sorry for her and at the same time for her. (Since I was in a similar situation at that time, maybe that's why I liked her so much.) Not a bad movie, but you have to be close to the character somewhere to appreciate it and let's hope you will never be. is.
