Actually terrible nonsense rubbish. This movie does everything wrong, except to make the running time within an hour. The Gore FX defends gravity and logic. There is no fear. The acting is uncomfortable, with everyone reading their lines. There is a surprise that's just foolish where we find out that things we've seen haven't even happened. Boy, I hate anything! They throw this thing out with long stretched shots of people who do nothing interesting (such as making or talking for what looks forever). They need to stick out a movie that is less than an hour long? Ridiculous. The story itself is pretty freakin 'thin. I mean it's just a variation of the film APRIL FOOL'S DAY, if I remember the movie right, and that movie wasn't that good either. The only good thing I can say is it looks well shot. Nothing bad happens it's very exciting.
