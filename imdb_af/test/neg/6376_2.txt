First, the title "DAILY" is a LIE. <br /> <br /> Every "Daily Show" program opens with a visible image of the date it was created, followed by a break and the opening condition. On the many days when they start a daily show, they slip the band and OMIT the date and start the announcement that gives the false impression that the show is a new one. It's a lie. It is not mentioned that it is a retransmission. And that kind of crap is just a small indication of how funny and deceptive this show is. <br /> <br /> It is only 4 nights a week. It's not quite "daily" - meaning Monday to Friday - another shortcoming, but I'm grateful. <br /> <br /> It is sad to think that many indifferent young people use this fake news program as their most important, often just, news source. This makes them badly ignorant and much worse - poorly informed. <br /> <br /> Although liberal, political, this performance can sometimes be. However, his truth is low. Facts and information are often cleverly crafted to fit the authors' agendas. It is often difficult to tell where the facts are leaving and the fiction and comedic writing begins. The result is pre-digested, reinterpreting information designed to persuade and influence. This is called the name "PROPAGANDA". <br /> <br /> Editing has severely affected the remote interviews. <br /> <br /> It really loses me when it comes to God and Christians - what it does too often. But you will never hear anything vague anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> If Jon Stewart and the company attacked anyone other than Christians, it would be considered an offensive outrage. The names in the credits explain the source.
