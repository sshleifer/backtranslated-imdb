Oh, how did the critics go about praising their golden boss Paul Schrader (writer of taxi driver) when this movie came out? I never saw the traits they found when I looked back at this movie, so I looked again to see if I misunderstood it. Mishima is extremely uninteresting. It's a cold, unbeatable movie about a writer living / working in a cold abstract culture. The flat reenactments do not keep your attention because they are emotionally disgusting and dumb. And the rest just got awful ... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they promised themselves, hairs of purity, admiration of swords, and so on. <br /> <br /> Learning to land Philip Glass should be a triumph; But then you have to get something out of him. Glass counting does not make a distinction from his other work, nor does it offer the perceptible value to the film. In 2010, it must be clear to everyone that Schrader has wasted his career on work of no impact or importance (Cat People, Auto Focus, Light Sleeper, Patty Hearst, American Gigolo). He can drill you down and kill the momentum of a movie faster than anyone else. Schrader has made a resume full of dirty, amateur movies.
