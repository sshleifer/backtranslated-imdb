I went to the movies and expect to see a good movie based on all the word of mouth and fantastic reviews. The moment the opening time started, I knew I was in trouble. The music and credits were so difficult to stir up emotion that I wanted to provoke. All I got from this movie was clich√©d characters, confronted dialogue and an unemotional script. director / writer Paul Haggis has managed to get good reviews with his manipulative, self-righteous writing, but it doesn't make me foolish. some shows were good. Don Cheadle is always good. I think Terrance Howard was slightly over-rated, but he was decent. Ridiculous was also on the nose. he must keep picking up. Brendan Fraser was good. Jennifer Esposito had no idea what so ever. I find nothing interesting about her. Sandra bull is always the same in every movie, she is just ok. Matt Dillon was very good and I enjoyed seeing him work. Ryan Philippe was also good. but as far as the script and the bad direction - this is actually one of those movies that is so bad, I actually took the time to write about it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, who is wasting time.
