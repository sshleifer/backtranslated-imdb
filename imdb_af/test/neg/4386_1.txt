This movie was like a gathering of people in other movies and they decided to make a very bad movie. It had a man from "Detroit Rock City", a girl from The Cosby Show who kissed the chick and bought that the sausage was in "Sorority Boys" and there was more. OK, it doesn't make a bad movie in itself, it's just something I noticed. The whole thing with the hooker and the French girl of the same name was stupid and the thing with 37 people writing these notes and if you think they're going to be mixed up ..... shocking enough ...... you mentioned it . And the purse thing, it was just stupid. It was so bad that I watched the movie in two and just made it to the 50-minute point. If you look at it and expect "Van Wilder" or a movie like that ...... Don't.
