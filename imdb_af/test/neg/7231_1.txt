Just finished watching this one after he got sick of getting ready for the Michigan Bar Exam. I wanted something that was unconscious and that I could just sit back and say, "What did they think?" I was not disappointed in this venture, but if I were in a serious mood, I would have been evil. The company that made this thing only split CGI footage from the first Octopus and made some imagery with a fake octopus that used the one used in the "Bride of the Monster" as a special masterpiece effect images. Since when did an octopus? The plot is that a NYPD diver briefly investigates a few murders / disappearances on the Hudson River shortly before July 4th. He and his partner (who are soon to be transferred, or soon clipped by a finger-kid octopus) are investigating in a rather dishonest way (although it believes a large octopus will kill people) and sometimes accompanied by a female of the mayor's office. Of course, you believe that an octopus can become so big that the attack attack and the mayor's office attack. Surprisingly, hell doesn't break loose and only a few policemen and a few more civilians are killed. <br /> <br /> Really paralyzed. Don't bother with that.
