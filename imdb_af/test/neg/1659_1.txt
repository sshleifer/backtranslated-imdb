I classify movies all the time on this site, but I don't normally write comments. In this case, however, I forced others to warn! This movie is bad! It's probably one of only a dozen movies I've recorded as '1 (horrible).' I know people say it all the time, but it was really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Anyway, it's easy on the bottom ten. <br /> <br /> When it comes to horror movies, I have very low standards. I will overtake all sorts of rude filmmaking for a fright. But this movie is embarrassingly bad. It looks as if someone bought a video camera at Sears and decided to make a movie with his friends. (The fact that each crew member's name appears in the list shows this theory, I think.) This movie has lower production standards than your average high school game. It's actually a bit shocking to see a movie that looks bad on DVD. The special effects are sometimes slightly effective, but at best it is still amateur. The best thing that can be said about the actors is that they remember most of the time not to look at the camera. I can't say for sure if they struggle to remember or make up their lines as they went along. Any and all attempts at humor are lame. This movie is such a colossal waste of time.
