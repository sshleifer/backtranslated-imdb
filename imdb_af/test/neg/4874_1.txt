I just saw it at a local independent station in the New York City area. The cast showed promise, but when I saw the director, George Cosmotos, I became suspicious. And sure enough, it was just as bad, every time as aimless and stupid as any George Cosmotos movie I've ever seen. He is like a silly man Michael Bey - with all the horror that promises. <br /> <br /> There is no point in conspiracy, no burning issues invoked by the conspirators. We are left to connect the dots of one piece of graffiti on different walls in the film to the next. So, the current budget crisis, the war in Iraq, Islamic extremism, the fate of social security, 47 million Americans without health care, stagnant wages and the death of the middle class, are all undermined by the mere terror of graffiti. /> <br /> A real, amazing idiotic movie.
