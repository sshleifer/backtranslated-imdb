Two movies: "the fifth element", "armageddon". Same topic: to save the world. Same chief actor: Bruce Willis. One difference: "Armageddon" is very inferior to Luc Besson's film. Some spectacular special effects fail to hide a real and worldwide conventional script. Several parts of the movie show it. I think of the president's speech and especially Willis's relationship with his daughter, "Grace". At the beginning of the movie, he tends to neglect and protect her. It makes her tired. Then, at the end of the film, it is true love and understanding that shines in it. On another hand, the movie falls into the next fall: Michael Bay takes his subject too seriously. Of course, the movie is trying to be funny, but the result doesn't work like the humor introduced into the movie is often rough and pretty low. In the "fifth element" the humor was much, involuntary and could be the serious side of the action. The film suffers from two other disabilities: it often falls into the ridiculous (Russian astronaut) and almost all actors are badly used. Bruce Willis is the opposite of the character of his fifth element. He plays the male, he prints it and sometimes he is unbearable. The other actors are hardly credible in their own roles, especially Willis's sinking crew. It looks like this crew is just having fun here. One of them is taken to be very qualified, but he looks like a fool. An arm Liv Tyler! She is on NASA to be just decorative. <br /> <br /> When the film was released in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis made the effort to save the world. His fatigue was probably justified by this spectacular but poor film.
