Should I expect anything other than Carrot Top? It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This is by far the worst comedy I've ever seen. "Chairman of the Board" did not add humor to my attitude, but it made me furious. That's right, Carrot Top is such a bad comedian that I became furious that this guy is making movies.
