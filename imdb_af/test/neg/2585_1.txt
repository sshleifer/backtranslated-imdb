Well, of course, everyone is entitled to have an opinion on something ... everything. The presentation was interesting: black and white film, the year 1968, student manifestations, general strike, youth, ideals, love, etc. Sorry, but I didn't feel LOVE, ROMANCE. A lover who is good at sleeping his girlfriend doesn't matter who? This is love? But not only that, the movie is very long and for no reason do I have to stop watching the movie, because I just lost interest. I waited for something to happen, but ....... nothing. The only thing I was impressed with during the movie: Gypsy fiddler playing in the streets, yes it was nice. I don't think art should be complicated, encrypted, hidden in secret meanings, confusing. Big disappointment and waste of time!
