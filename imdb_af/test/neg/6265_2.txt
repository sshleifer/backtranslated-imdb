Stop me if you're this one hard, some cheerleaders, their coach and a few guys get trapped in a cabin in the bush when an invisible killer strikes them one by one. Shame on me after writing down Jim Wynorski completely after the horrible "Busty Cops" (it was a long time to come if his last really good movie was 1990's "Hard to Die"), I still have some reason my hope for an alleged successor to "Slumber Party Massacre".
