I'm willing to endure almost anything in a scientific movie, but it was almost unbearable. While some special effects are very cool (landscapes), it is not 'battlespace', rather a strange foreign mother / daughter relationship with scientific concepts being thrown in. The acting (timber), framework and shooting With hand-to-hand combat scenes funny than any Hong Kong chopsocky movie, this movie is bored. The plot line is complicated and the devices used to move the plot together (narrator), unexplained theatrical films and many deus ex machina reinforce the idea that writer cum director is not a good idea. Save your love for Sci-Fi for something else instead of losing a little of it.
