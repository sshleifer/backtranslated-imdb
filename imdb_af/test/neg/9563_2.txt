It goes without saying that a number of grants must be made when a true story is adapted for the big screen. But if you shoot a fairy tale that has nothing to do with what actually happened - why does it call Bugsy and let the audience believe it was a half-true story? The Godvader trilogy processes many right characters and events. Once upon a time in America, they do, but they do not claim to tell real stories. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> In the film, Benny has this great vision of a gambler's Eldorado; In real life, Lansky had to argue with him to go to Nevada. Benny considered the idea of ​​a counterpart to Monte Carlo idiotically, and he would have preferred his life as a blazer in L.A. to keep. Not long after, Benny warmed up the idea. But of course he is the hero of the movie. Of course, the idea must be his. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Benny Count wants to use diFrasso to get close to Mussolini to kill him because he was Hitler's partner, and Hitler killed Jew in gas chambers. Obviously we like Benny, so the writers have invented this nonsense. In real life nobody knew about the gas chambers at that time, especially Benny who was totally uninteresting in politics. In fact, he used the county's connection and he visited Mussolini, but not to kill him, but to sell explosives to him. He even met Goebbels and Goering during his stay in Italy. <br /> <br /> The whole Greenberg subplot was nonsense. Greenberg didn't turn crutch, he didn't escape at Benny, Benny didn't kill him (it was Albert Tannenbaum) ... at least they got the right name. <br /> <br /> I think it's supposed to be very romantic to return Virginia to Benny, who offers him the money she stole. The movie even goes so far to tell us via the text panels that she returned the money to Lansky after Benny's assassination. Let me just say, revisionism is just no more indignant than this. <br /> <br /> This list is not exhausting at all - there is the problem with Benny's family who does not live in LA, as Benny deals with Dragna and Adonis, the portrayal of Costello (a similar corporate type) , Lansky (a lovely teddy bear), Benny herself (an obsolete windbag that would not have been 12 years old if he was often "bugsy" in situations such as those in the movie, and neither good looks nor charisma of Benny Siegel did not) and many others. Apart from some hard facts, nothing is right in this movie. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS CLOSE HERE * <br /> <br /> All in all, it's the one mafia movie that manages to be even more ridiculous. bad as Harlem, NY. But honor where honor is due: This is an achievement in itself.
