This Harold Lloyd card wasn't really much; not one of his nicer efforts. Of course, I never see bitter children as anything hilarious. That's what most of this story is, Harold and his wife, Mildred Davis, put two young children at his in-laws. One is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four-year terror doing everything except breaking down the house. The survival of the child did not entertain me over and over. <br /> <br /> The best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple think this big throw (Noah Young) breaks into their home. Half the time, this is the pet cat that scares the couple, but overall, that segment is nice with some good giggles and reminds me of another Lloyd card, "Haunted Spooks." <br /> <br /> However, the good end does not save the whole picture, which I probably will not look at again. Lloyd did too many other good things to waste another 25 minutes on this one. It's just not funny.
