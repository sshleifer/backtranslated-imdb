Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are the swinging bachelor's plans to hijack a casino, ala "Ocean's 11", and make it to hell's angels. Bad move. For a movie with the words Hell's Angels AND the number 69 AND with real Hell's Angels, this movie is surprisingly soft. The Hell's Angels really deserve a better movie to center them on. Not this choir party. Luckily, this is one of the DVDs that contains comment from Joe Bob Briggs, so the pain to put it in is much easier. If you see it in any other way, let me recommend you something. DO NOT !! <br /> <br /> My Degree: D <br /> DVD Extra: Joe Bob Brigg's Comment; Conny Van Dyke's message to her supporters (she has more than one?); Photo gallery; Theater Trailer; and Trailers for "Blood Shack", "Hell High", "Samurai Cop" and "The Hollywood Strangler"
