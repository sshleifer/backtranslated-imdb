Boyle Heights, Los Angeles: The legendary South American boxing-sucking vampire, El Chupacabra, is asleep, which is unfortunate enough for anyone to cross its path. Animal control officer Navarro (Eric Alegria) and Chupacabra expert / writer Starlina Divide (Elina Madison) endeavor to find the creatures, but find their progress hampered by some stupid cops, money-hungry locals who want to catch the animal for a fat reward . , and some devastating scientists who want the sample for their experiments. <br /> <br /> Stinking higher than a two-week-old taco, El Chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror movie that may even struggle with fans of incredibly bad horror movies. With its horrible script, terrible direction (by none, but two talented hacks ?? Brennon Jones and Paul Wynne), ludicrous dialogue, and some of the worst things this side of a porn movie is doing, I recommend this movie about as much as I drink the tap water in Mexico. <br /> <br /> As Navarro and Starlina continue their investigations, viewers are treated to an incredibly poor gore, the worst-designed book jacket in history, the most compelling dead person I've seen since the shining corpse in Dr . Butcher MD, and a high-tech computerized security system consisting of a keyboard nailed to a post. <br /> <br /> To be honest, for a man in a rubber suit, the monster itself is pretty scary (hairy, with big claws and a face like a particularly ugly bat), but its appearances are little and far between, with more screen time spent on the boring tasting and afflictions of Whiney Officer Navarro than on the killer of the titular being (how many times is it necessary to see Navarro h If you, like me, make the mistake of getting your hard earned wasting cash on these terrible latino-bilge (in my case it was a whole 50p), consider using the disc as a coaster for your tequila rather than actually watching it.
