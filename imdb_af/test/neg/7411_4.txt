A great waste of time is all you get from this bag. I rented it and hoped for an exciting movie with some credible scenes, but boy was ever disappointed. I think the title should be "Camping 101" or something that serves it. Well, anyway, hell goes away from this movie. It'll kill you. Don't be afraid of big foot, be afraid of this shit !!
