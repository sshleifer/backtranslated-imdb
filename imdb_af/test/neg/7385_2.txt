The man was having a hard time watching! It was not funny at all, not good and it had no sense or plot. the acting was terrible. It wasn't made good at all. It looked like a lot of kids, my age just drove around and made a senseless movie. it is by far the absolute worst broken lizard movie. If you are a broken lizard movie like me, you will be disappointed and bored. Please skip this senseless movie about ugly guys looking for chicks. You won't give advice. By the way, don't say you didn't find this review useful just because you didn't agree. It's stupid, like this movie. The only OK scene was when the chief played rugby and beat the crap. I like that reason because I found his character very damn annoying.
