This movie is truly incredible, in every sense of the word. I couldn't believe what I saw and heard, and I didn't believe it at all. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but it was ridiculous. Being myself, I know how it sounds, and it's not Kate's Back Bay accent. The only thing I found was the fact that the man who played Charl T Chan so many times, Sydney Toler, as another one of the hillbillies, was cast with the emphasis. Perhaps it was a practical joke, come to think. I can't think of any other reason for such peculiar decisions. Well, maybe this. I noticed that Natalie Schaefer, Lovey Howell on Gilligan's Island, appeared in this play on Broadway. Can you imagine what part she played?
