I give this piece of Hollywood rash 1 out of 10! Seriously! I mean, I like comedy as much as the next man. I can only take silly comedy and actually sit back and laugh. But this film did not laugh at OR together. <br /> <br /> I love almost all the actors in this movie. So I thought I'd look at what many people told me (my fault not to listen). I was just killed about how stupid this writing was! Just ridiculous and not even in a funny way. The only funny scenes were in the previews that everyone saw in the theater when they saw other movies or on television. I was very disappointed and I would really like to know why these other relatively good actors would read this script and then sign up to be in it! Bad decision about their parts ... <br /> ********************* MAJOR SPOILER *********** ************* <br /> <br /> Okay - here's my biggest question about this movie ....... If the characters look back on this story of Jewel (Liv Tyler ) after the fact .... how can Paul Reiser go to a therapist to remember the past!?!?!?!? He dies in the last scene by breaking through the dumpster !! Can anyone answer me this?!?!?!?!? Great goof of the filmmakers ..... No one noticed it?!?!?!?!?!?!
