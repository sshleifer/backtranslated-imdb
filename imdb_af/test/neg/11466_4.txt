Michael Bassett's film 'Solomon Kane' (based on the character of the same name created by Robert E. Howard) is a disappointing Fantasy Action-Adventure movie, which, despite the fact that a few scenes fall into the genius, falls with its uncomfortable pacing, poor characterization and general dullness. Solomon Kane (James Purefoy) is a mercenary of Queen Elizabeth's army fighting in Africa, where he comes face to face with the devil's mower? a devil who collects the devil's debts, ie souls? refusing to go to hell, he evaded the Reaper and started a new life in an English monastery. With this new life, Solomon left his culture of violence and bloodshed and now transforms the values ​​of peace and non-values. But as soon as he is driven out of the monastery for fear of the devil's reaper coming back, he must return to his home in Devon and travel with a traveling family of Puritans going to the New World. On their journey through the British counties, the family is attacked, and their daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is kidnapped by the evil wizard Malachi's army led by the mysterious Masked Rider in front. Now, a man of peace, Solomon must return to his former life as a man of intolerable violence and destruction to save Meredith. <br /> <br /> Despite having good source material to work on and building potential for an exciting and enduring medieval action adventure movie, the movie fails in three key areas. The pacing of this movie is terrible, which has a lot to do with its incredible short time of just one hour and forty minutes (and this is probably due to the fact that they want to turn this movie into a trilogy). Continuous jumping between drama and self-characterization to that of action and muddy bloodshed, which kills the excitement of action sequences somewhat. Instead of keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, which weakens the eagle's anticipation, the movie feels incredibly subdued and follows the following criticism, boring. Despite being regarded as an action adventure movie or in some circles, an 'action epic', 'Solomon Kane' is almost certain. The action is mundane and boring, and is generally done before you have the opportunity to admire the beauty of a decade. Finally, apart from Solomon himself, there is very little characterization within this film. For example, we know little and therefore care little, about the young woman who Soloman outlines on his journey to save. And I think again that the filmmaker will refer this criticism to the fact that there will probably be a second film that will hopefully affect these aspects that this movie certainly missed. <br /> <br /> It's not a very horrible movie. James Purefoy gives a fantastic performance as Salomon, the mercenary who has to decide whether to fall on his conscience or his blade, and how his decisions will not only affect himself, but also those around him. While respecting, admiring and recognizing Bassett and his crew, for creating vibrant places that reflect the time they were filmed, nicely. Sometimes it is difficult not to be turned away with the admiration of the beauty of the venues, the shuttle composition and the mise-and-scene at the show here. It certainly shows that much time and effort has been put into this movie, but unfortunately it is not the same for the story and characters on hand. "Solomon Kane" definitely has the potential to be something more than just an "action epic", but it seems that the lack of any real depth in the story and characters has led Michael Bassett to nothing more than one. - dimensional look at swordplay during the medieval period.
