This movie was really awful. It wasn't a little scary, or even scary. I went to see it with a lot of friends and by the end of the night we said, "The Ruins have ruined my night." <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend watching this movie in theaters, renting it or even watching the movie on television by accident. This is an absolute waste of an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The plot was almost non-existent, the characters were terribly underdeveloped and they did not give back stories about anything that was going on and then completely opened it as if they were preparing for a successor. .
