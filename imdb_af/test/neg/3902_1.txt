Wow, umm it was a lot, how to say, different type of movie. It calls itself a comedy ... but it wasn't really funny at all. It was insane. If you are willing to accept that 3 people survive a global scale disaster, why not 4? or 5? ..... and why did it suddenly end without something happening? They could have made it much better by just having another element in the plot, like a dumpy woman for the ugly man or something ....... sinking, ridiculous .... ahh <br /> < br /> i dunno .. look it ... it wasn't that bad ..... sorta funny at times .... i think ... <br /> <br /> cutter
