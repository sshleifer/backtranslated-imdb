Ben Affleck is married on a plane crash and becomes involved with one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock, forcing her to act crazy). Who should be guilty of this unclear, ugly morass? It was so badly edited, when I looked into the credits, it was not the editor's name to read - it was to see if the person really got the credit rating! Flat with clich√©s, contrivances, and Sandra Bullock in raccoon eye makeup, the film isn't even creating chemistry between the two main characters. Leaking is not there: the scene in the gay bar with Affleck may have gotten a big laugh if it wasn't so stupid (the barmakers - a big, rough bunch of them! - Shout for Affleck to strip and start digging their cash out). It is not supposed to have any meaning other than to loosen Ben a bit, but the direction of the whole scene is wrong and the outcome is invisible because the idiot editor cut off ... or was it all the movie? It's a small moment, but it's typical of this movie, an amateur-like piece of pop stuff that wants to be an edgy modern comedy, but it has no guts. It's tailor-made for the bottom shelf at your video store. * of ****
