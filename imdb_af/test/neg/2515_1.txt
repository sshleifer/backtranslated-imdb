How dare you? Adam Low, without apparent shame, puts his name to this false tribute. It's not even a serious study or analysis or commentary on the great Visconti's work. Yes, it is long and ominous, yes we have some wonderful cuts from the movies that most people who are interested in the subject have already seen. But what leaves the longest the most enduring impression is the gossip. The last and loudest voice comes from a third course German actor, ranting and raving. The appropriate name of Mr.Low did it, and I hope I can rate better than his previous, more to the point, but deadly boring documentary on Kurosawa. Well, I have news for your Mr Low and your cohorts. You missed a wonderful opportunity and I won't give you one.
