I heard what people were saying, but I ignored them. To be rushed to Blockbuster, I grabbed a copy of this movie and ran out. <br /> <br /> 45 minutes I fought to stay awake. There is an attempt to keep the film interesting, but it was just bad. A similar coaching takes place, but it was long and issued - the perfect time to grab a bite. By the time this movie was over, I didn't mind how ended, I just wanted it to end. Walk in and out of my room to see if it was over. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a cliche, the characters and their relationships. The plot turns are predictable as well as the end. The actors made the most of really terrible roles. Everyone can say: their clothes were nice, but the movie was just bad.
