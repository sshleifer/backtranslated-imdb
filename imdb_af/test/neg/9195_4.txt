As much as I respect firefighters for what they do. I was undisturbed and bored with this movie. The acting was OK, but Joaquin Phoenix was a poor decisive choice to say the least. <br /> <br /> What bothered me most about this movie was the Celtic music going on and off at the worst possible time in the movie. Directing and continuity were also bad! <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** For example, after Phoenix's character falls into various stories and is bad, he can hardly move to speak to his captain on the radio. Then he miraculously manages to crawl over a large space covered in rubbish and fire to make a mangrove opening in a double thickness brick wall using only a length of rebar. And to get it all off, he is again weak and rebuilt. <br /> <br /> Also, anyone noticed that throughout the film, when you see shots of Joaquin fighting fires and saving people, there is little or no smoke in the buildings. I would think the smoke should be fairly thick in a flame-retardant building. <br /> <br /> I also got tired of hearing the search and rescue team calling, "I need equipment up here!". <Br /> <br /> I really thought I would enjoy this movie, but I found it a poor effort to represent the real life of a firefighter. The intention was there, but I honestly think this movie could have been so much better. I couldn't help but think the producer was trying to meet a deadline with this movie and had to put it in the theaters in a hurry. More time had to be spent editing and ensuring there was good flow to the movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects were impressive in some scenes, but disappointing and almost ridiculous in others. Similar to a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. <br /> <br /> Call me critically, but I just can't see what's so nice about this movie. At least it wasn't as bad as "The Whole Ten Yards", which is by far the worst movie I've seen in recent months. <br /> <br /> I really hope there's no Ladder 50 in the making!
