"Season on the Brink" is one of my favorite books of all time - an insightful infallible look at Bob Knight and his Indiana Hoosiers. And Dennehy is one of my favorite supporting actors of all time. So I looked at this adjustment. <br /> <br /> It's disappointed on every level. Dennehy's performance was less than inspired, and he was unprepared to play Knight - as he accepted the role just before filming. The rest of the cast is not much better. <br /> <br /> And it was clear that it was ESPN's first movie. It was poorly directed, poorly filmed, and the lack of budget was obvious when games were simulated (smaller gyms, empty seats, etc.).
