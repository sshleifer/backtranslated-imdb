My wife and I never came to the movie. We thought it was a way to sloooowwww and many subtitles. I understood they needed them for Vietnam, but took a long time to get out of Asia. She wanted it off. I said it was going to get it. better. It never did. They had a difficult time coming to America, but I wanted to see him and get his dad. Not at the end, but a relationship. Then I said it was slllloooowww. I like a movie to feel good, not sad at the end. I know they don't make very good movies now days. I think action movies are the only thing to watch. I rented a lot from netflix and now it's maybe 20%. Worth to see. I didn't knit realism or facts, just a movie that's fun and good. Good
