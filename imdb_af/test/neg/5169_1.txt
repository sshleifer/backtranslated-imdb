Kokoda was inspired by events on the Kokoda track during World War II when the Australian militia slowed down and eventually hit 10,000 Japanese soldiers to move across the country and catch Port Moresby. What they really think is that the movie is set in this period, but it is fiction and everything that happens is just a lot of the standard scenes of other war movies. The first hour is just one clich√© to another. Some of the scenes are simply there to draw us in a sense that this conflict was terribly over, if there is little evidence of this. Both sides fought hard to control the track, and no mercy was shown on either side. Both sides suffered from logistical shortages and the terrain was much sharper in this conflict. As the Japanese came closer to Port Moresby, their supply line grew and it eventually led to their demise. On the other hand, when the Australians moved closer to Port Moresby, their supply line declined. Some of the screens appear to be straight out of the textbook about standard scenes to include in any war movie. The film was deceptive and highlighted the youth of the production team. At a time when Australia could do with a good film about one of Australia's best moments, the movie Kokoda is a low disappointment.
