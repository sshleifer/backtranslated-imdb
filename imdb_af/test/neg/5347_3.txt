Chip Foose is an absolute genius and the end result of the projects is truly wonderful. The hostesses are doing a good job. I especially enjoy watching the project come together. The end result is much better than coming down from the composition that is with today's mechanical and cosmetic progress. However, I get a little annoyed at the fact that the "projects" are the property of the already rich and / or famous. It's too bad that those who are being redone can afford the business. Let's see now, Vince Neill of Motley Crew gets a car that makes over for his partner. Hello! If he was a true friend, he would have paid to repair his friend's car. What a joke! Another episode shows a middle-aged seemingly good to do gal who did her '56 caddy called Betsy. The 30+ year old man was behind it all. The couple looked as if money was not too short. What a pity. I think the lunch break guys like me will have to save for the day that will never come. I owned a '53 Ford project Chip. Will anyone choose me?
