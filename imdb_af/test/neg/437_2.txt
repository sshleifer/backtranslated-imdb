AWiP tries to be funny, scary, tense and romantic ... and fails in all respects. The acting is at its best average, but mostly silly. The special effects are not enough to make silly plot devices, and the chemistry between ANY * character is youthful. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to be crazy about you, don't pay money to see it.
