It's pure CRAP, and probably the worst Biblical theme movie ever ... Absolutely inaccurate, I mean, they put Sodom and Gomora ahead of the great flood. They described Lot as a friend of Noah, although he lived after Noah. To make matters worse, Lot later became a pirate and attack Noah's Ark during the flood !!! ??? And how about the merchant who comes on a boat moving across the water with a bicycle mechanism ??? And exchange alcohol for food and water, and Noah is portrayed as an alcoholic! Mockery and continuous blasphemy one after another, and it goes on and on, and beyond. Movie producer and all the participants have ensured the front row in hell with this garbage ... <br /> <br /> Please stay out of this shit because you will save yourself almost three hours of your life.
