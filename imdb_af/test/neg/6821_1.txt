sorry, sorry but sorry. beautiful, very good production, very good actors, also funny. But these kind of movies with a dog (Rex German, Gery-Jerry American) with private detectives, with a nice rich woman ????????????????????? ??? Hello producer, how many movies do we have there with the same plot ?????????? What do you have on your mind when you make the screens like a puppy dog. Or any king of those dog activities ????? Micro chips that can make you rich? Microchips that had a fortune? There are three masterpieces, wow? And the creator of the chips can't make the same chips again? Hello, wake up. can we give something smarter than that? Dear, D
