This movie has promised a lot, so many beautiful and good actors, but with a plot that has virtually nothing to say. As many as possible promising conflicts between the family members who could be developed and expanded, but it is all dropped and not cared for. There was no story to tell, just a show of acting, technique, beautiful scenes - it was all empty. But again, the acting was excellent, so many of the individual scenes were entertaining, but as you became more aware of the lack of ideas, even the theater lost its meaning. From the promising start you have become increasingly disappointed because the non-story went along.
