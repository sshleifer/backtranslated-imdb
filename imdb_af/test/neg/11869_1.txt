OK, be short. This movie wasn't just bad. It was very bad, with line4s like "if you handle the devil you expect to get on your shoes," you know about the shelter of the movie. After watching this movie, I wanted to kill myself and my whole family, and it gave me such a great sense of self-rotting. I wanted to do murder. Don't see this movie. I'll kill again. But when I do, it will be terribly processed with a pathetic soundtrack and stockpile for action sequences and bad shirts. <br /> <br /> Fortunately there is a flipside, this is the first action movie about a three door ford. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it ends on its roof: (<br /> <br /> Ps: Worse than the Marksman
