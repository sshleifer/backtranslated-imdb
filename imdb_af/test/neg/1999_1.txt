It was the last weekend on SciFi, and I had to watch it out. After all ... it was science fiction, with vampires and Erika Eleniak. What can go wrong with this B-movie? <br /> <br /> Lots. <br /> <br /> To begin with: It can't even be classified as a "B movie" because it will put it in the same league as Roger Corman ... and this movie doesn't even meet its expectations. Most of the money they spent on the contact lenses for the vampires. <br /> <br /> Second, the casting was terrible. Yes, Udo Kier as captain of the Demeter was a clever move ... but the director couldn't even get Kieran to memorize his lines. Casting Eleniak, in a vampire movie, is also a clever move, as it means a lot of horny guys are going to buy / hire / record this movie to see how she is being seduced by a vampire. But the director, writer and manufacturer also screwed one. Granted, they enjoyed money from the poor, unholy souls, who like to watch vampire movies with hot women in them ... but no one will remember this movie in two or three years. <br /> <br /> Third: Little things that only accentuate the laziness of this movie. For example, Van Helsing calls a cross a cross, and when Mina gets stuck in the coffin, the viewer can clearly see that her "breast" is nothing more than pillows. <br /> <br /> Oh, and another thing: Why did they go to the George Hamiltion type Dracula instead of something that would actually look scary? Does George Hamilton have an overwhelming hold on our future? Why didn't everyone who saw Dracula laugh at him just getting up? <br /> <br /> A waste of time. Even with a TiVo remote control in your hand.
