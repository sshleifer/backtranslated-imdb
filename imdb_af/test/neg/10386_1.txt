Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set in a small town where teenager Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) is found walking around the dog's blood. Her parents Ely (Randy Colton) & Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own the farm and are very worried about their daughter. She has not become herself recently and is considered a danger to herself and others. Ranch hand and former priest Miguel (Del Zamora) recognize Isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession. When she starts talking old Latin in a strange voice, he is convinced. Blanche calls priest Jacob (Cameron Daddo), who is ex-husband her other daughter Claire (Madison Taylor) to see Isabelle. He confirms Miguel's suspicions and accepts the work of doing the evil that will hopefully banish the devil in Isabelle and an innocent girl. .. <br /> <br /> Targeted by Ethan Wiley I was seated in my home in front of me watching Blackwater Valley Exorcism. And I asked the same question over and over again, why am I doing it. Why do I stick to all those horribly low budget horror movies that seem to be shot on a camcorder? Right to do that, Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete and complete unashamed coaching of The Exorcist (1973) and you literally mark the big plot points that the two share. There is the busy teenage girl who starts getting horny and proposes inappropriate things. The demon who uses past crimes is the worried parents, the way the injured girl is avoided by doctors, the priest with a troubled past and the injured girl. is tied to her bed. I guess where Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different (unlike total crap), it's trying to give all the character's screen time and try to find out how the situation affects them, but it's so badly written and acted that It just ends up being boring. The movie starts with Isabelle who already owns, so we never knew how she was like a normal person, so we never really care about her or what happens to her, the rest of the character is poorly written and erupted. At times I wondered if Blackwater Valley exorcism was a ghost. There is a foolish scene in which a veterinarian tries to seduce Isabelle with horse-makers. After claiming that she needs a 'little dot', he goes away from her room with a big needle! There are a few scenes in which people are punched, accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect. The film has an uneven tone, because it is between a foolish spoof and serious horror drama, or at least it has. <br /> <br /> According to some opening credit text, Blackwater Valley Exorcism was based on "Real Events", yes real real events of 1973 that happened in a movie called The Exorcist. This piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were under the supervision of a true priest. There is not even a decent gore or exploitation to do things, there is a scene of a cut arm, there is a dead dog, someone is stabbed with a crucifix and it is about it. There is surprisingly no bad language in it, even though the devil is being offensive. I can imagine that the only reason Blackwater Valley Exorcism has an adult rating is due to one very short scene in which some breasts are seen. One pair of naked female breasts is not worth checking out or the money you can spend on it. There is zero scares, no atmosphere and a very amateur feeling for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> With a so-called budget of about $ 1,000,000, I must say I'm wondering where all the money went, the movie looks ugly & cheap throughout. There are no special effects to talk about and the production values ​​are rock bottom. The play is very poor from all those involved, genre favorite Jeffrey Combs gets the best award during the opening credits, but has nothing more than a cameo in about five minutes of screen time. Even he had feared how bad it would be, he hid behind a mustache and a horrible accent. He's better than that. <br /> <br /> Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete rip-off of The Exorcist without Anything that made that movie such a classic and the makers are in any case thirty and five years late. A total turkey from start to finish.
