One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yes, I know I'm not the target audience. Target audience is female, or college age or middle-aged or any parent I think. I'm not one of these, so the makers don't care if I don't like it. But it will not excuse the dialogue and the plot being terrible. The main character, Phoebe, travels to Europe to find out what happened to her sister, Faith, who committed suicide. Phoebe is a foolish character who I hope no one identifies. Faith is also a character with very little credibility. Wolf is the only person who looks a little reasonable. As I said, the dialogue is boring and uninteresting. The plot sometimes makes stupid things. The absolute worst is that Phoebe and Faith's father are artists, but his paintings are quite frightening. There is nothing new, interesting or refreshing in this movie. If you are a guy, you will pray for the end. If you are a child, you may be sitting there, but you will be unobstructed.
