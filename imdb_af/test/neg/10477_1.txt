I bought this DVD and bought it without a second thought, even though it didn't even know, it was one of my favorite books of all time. As soon as I got home, I rushed to just look at it to find myself very disappointed. Although it is true that this film is a bit based on the book, the similarities end there. The characters are changed (ie Finny looks more than a pompous luck than anything else, while Gene looks a bit like a hill), scenes are misplaced or completely changed (ie, Lepper), many characters are missing and well-known lines / thoughts are missing. The film attempts to make some feel that the previous one lacks, but it is done in a dark way that makes a flat, boring movie. This is the depth of character and feel that makes the book so classic and this movie takes things and destroys them in its rewrite.
