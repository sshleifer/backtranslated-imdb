"Black Vengeance" is an alternative title for "Ying hung ho hon" AKA "Tragic Hero" (1987). I just saw it on VHS, along with the first part of the story, "Gong woo ching", also 1987. (The poster and 2 stills appearing on the page are for a 4-DVD set of movies with Rod Perry (The Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist), the fourth film called Black Six, strangely, while the characters retain their original names in "Rich and Famous", "Black Vengeance" is called Chow Yun-Fat's character Eddie Shaw, and Alex Man (Man Tze Leung) is Harry and Andy Lau is called Johnny. Also confusing is the fact that 1994 was the copyright date on both films. The year they were US-baptized According to release dates on IMDb "Tragic Hero" was released for "Rich and Famous." Was there any reason to release the successor first? enjoy these movies, although they are not under CYF's best such as "The Killer" and "Hard-Boiled" which are really worst is not invasive. However, if I come across a 2-DVD series "Rich and Famous" and "Tragic Hero" one day, I won't hesitate to buy it. Hopefully, this commentary on "Black Vengeance" is clear to me, a mystery about where it involves Chow Yun-Fat's filmography.
