I'm looking forward to this movie. To be an old Robert E Howard fan, mostly from a Conan standpoint. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much and thought they couldn't waste it too much. Oh, dear - how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> The main mistake was it was pretty boring. It was necessary to cope with good help from supernatural goings-on, sword fighting and the like. <br /> <br /> You've had a little gore, but everything was just quite lifelong. The middle section just looked as if it was 40 minutes in a mud forest, with slow car carts and even slower dialogue and character development! <br /> <br /> On the plus side = Costumes and effects were good but not enough to keep your interest. <br /> <br /> I think it would be better to show the pitch better, increase the tempo and go for a 12A rating. As a 10-year-old boy, I might have chosen this movie. Probably, over the age, I first read the Conan stories funny enough. Maybe it's a lot about my expectation of the movie? <br /> <br /> Or ....... Go really "Art-House" with tone, direction, etc. But it's pretty high risk as far as Box Office is concerned. <br /> <br /> Oh yes .... Maybe the next Conan movie will look after it?
