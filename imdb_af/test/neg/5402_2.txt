Many of the people who saw it were, of course, confused. The original title of "Cottonmouth Joe" would make things look better for a better person. I personally experienced the condition of cottonmouth (often accompanied by a very bad hangover to a weekend bender) and it is indeed much like the movie Skeleton Man - a dry, sly movie that regrets recent choices and begs for a hot shower. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the choice of "Skeleton Man" for the title has been finalized by the distributor (probably the work of some Hollywood lovers, nothing of the studio that failed it) and not "Cottonmouth Joe." Those of us who saw the film know that the Skeleton is actually Cottonmouth Joe (a skeleton-manic appearance, not a real Skeleton man). The deception of the people who market this movie is unforgivable, and for this alone I can't give this movie a high rating. Imagine: when future filmmakers come together to create the true definitive Skeletman Man movie and need a title, they will be completely screwed down and we are all, as serious supporters of the genre, reduced to it. <br /> <br /> Cottonmouth Joe can become a horror movie icon next to Madman Marz, Black Claw, Mansquito, Humongous, "Nature Boy" Billy Conners, Morty the wooden doll, the Boogen, Eegah, The Moon Beast, Bloody Bill, the Driller Assassin, Mickey Rooney, and so on, but he will always be remembered as a heavy-knit cape dummy skull tied to a horse-skeleton wannabe. <br /> <br /> It's too bad.
