Apart from the fact that this film was made (I think it was a good idea to consider BOTTOM so popular) was the one thing that surprised me about GUEST HOUSE PARADISO, what happened to the lighting? There is absolutely no artificial lighting used in this movie, and I watched it on network TV so it wasn't a case to watch a dodgy tape. In fact, the film was shot so dark, it was impossible to see what the hell was going on. But if the dialogue was something to do, it might not be a bad thing
