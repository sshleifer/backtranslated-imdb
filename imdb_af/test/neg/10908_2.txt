Another first: this French film is my introduction to the world Eric Rohmer. Maybe I'm a little in a hurry when I say it's probably my last Rohmer movie, but I'm immediately turned off by Rohmer's reliance on monotonous philosophical conversations that are never over. There is a scene in the movie where the characters love discussing what I thought would never end. Honestly, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't understand why Rohmer is so highly rated under cinephiles. He hit me as one of those indifferent bloody people filled with hot air. If it's an example of what his movies are about, I'm not interested. I don't care for the French film (usually reflective and speculative for a mistake), so maybe I'm biased.
