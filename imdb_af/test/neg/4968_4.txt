How can it get a 6.0 rating? As horror fans, we are so used to horror movies being so bad that when one comes to it, and I repeat "just" the quality of the quality, we become too excited and appreciate what just a way a little too high? The director has a visual flair. No doubt about it. But between a few decent shots he forgot a good story, mood or fright. It has a very slow first act, lazy deadly scene, annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very amazing twist. And what is the portrayal of American teenagers in so many of these movies? Must always be this stupid, annoying and so godly superficial. I can't remember teenagers being so grown up in Holland. All in all, this movie can give nothing more than a 4 out of 10 rating.
