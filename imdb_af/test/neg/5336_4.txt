For "Miracle on 34th Street", Maureen O'Hara and John Payne made this, this, this movie. I'm going to describe it, but can't find words for how bad this movie turned out. The subject of child adoption and Maureen's disease are both very serious and sensitive issues, but it can be done much better than it was. It was so extreme in his portrayal that it was not completely overlooked. Probably his problem started with a poor writing. <br /> <br /> Another example of a scriptwriter who takes a novel and writes a bad movie. (See my review of a stranger in my arms.) The beautiful O'Hara was so often sown with clunkers, another is Forbidden Street (Britannica Mews), which I may eventually revise. <br /> <br / > If you have emotional ties to this childhood, you will be a little lifeless, colorless and slim film, but for something like this, you might find his TV movie recovery, which should be better. .
