The Giant Claw is in strong competition with movies like 'Robot Monster' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' for the worst movie of all time. A Phony watches giant vulture lions 'Lionel Trains' in this totally unconscious movie. The writing is so bad that everything the characters say to each other is ridiculous. It's no wonder this movie is an important target in the movie, it came from Hollywood, where this gem is hammered for the line, a bird as big as a battleship, with a lasting endless needle. The line appears inexorably through the film, so there is no escape. There are several shots out, 'The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms' and' Earth vs. The Flying Saucers, among other sci-fi films from the fifties to devour the villain's vulture attacks. At one point, the big vulture is responsible for a few deaths, so that the army places the whole world under the martial law and no one is allowed to leave their homes. Of course, the big buzzard is mainly engaged in the stars of these classics, Jeff Morrow & Mara Corday, wherever they may be. Yet the director is so lame that he doesn't even provide some beautiful Mara honey shots in a decent dress and black heels for some relief from the tedium of this zero star thriller. It's the second time this blunder has been made. In 'Tarantula' Mara Corday caresses in warm dresses for the entire film, but is constantly surrendered to pants, 'The Giant Scorpion'. The budget for this film should not be more than thirty or forty thousand dollars and I doubt Morrow or Corday has more than three thousand to make it. It seems the whole thing was shot right out of someone's garage.
