I totally agree that the reenactments kill what could otherwise be a good performance. I will admit that I saw 1 or 2 episodes last season and it was not clear that it was already considered. But when I recently caught an episode, it suddenly jumped out of my time and I lost interest immediately. Then I noticed the indemnity at the start before an episode that followed. Did anyone follow the concert enough to tell me, they actually made the "acting" and tackled parts in a more artificial way, or I haven't seen them before. I'm usually pretty good at detecting these things, but the recent episode was so artificially artificial that I almost hit it. Now I have no interest in looking and giving it up completely. It only has no real value if it is all written and performed. And at least lately, it seems VERY badly written and performed. The comment above says who cares if it's all reenactments, I do. Without visual truth, it's just a bunch of "you know what happened, once this man" heresay. This is information better read in a book.
