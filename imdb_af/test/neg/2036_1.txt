There is a reason to call it a teenage movie. Out of 100 possible points I will put it somewhere in the teens. It's predictable, the acting is terrible, especially the small roles, and above all it's super predictable. The end is so difficult that I had to leave early and maybe it would have succeeded. By the way, can you call the male a perversion? I know if this really happened, would anyone in my school district say it. Eventually, in school I grew up, although the average class had more than 1,000 students, we could have chosen a lot like Josie as a fraud and we would have donated her out of the crowd. My last word is saving you time, when it comes to TV watching something better, like the shares.
