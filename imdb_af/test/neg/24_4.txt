'Bloody Birthday' is a strange and sometimes humorous low-budget horror flick in the lines of 'Mikey' or a less intelligent version of 'The Good Son'. <br /> <br /> Set in a small California town, three babies were born of an eclipse, where planetary alignment means that they were somehow born without emotion. Ten years later, our three little psychopaths take themselves on a deadly spree, do away with parents, brothers and sisters, teachers, and anyone else who annoys them. Only one teenage girl knows the truth to stop them. There is no explanation why babies around the world who were born at the same time are not even distorted, but there you go! <br /> <br /> For a treasure trove it is very tame in terms of violence and gore, which I suppose to highlight the problem of decisive child characters as the killers, because there is just as much you can do to young actors expose. Instead, it is amusing and a little upsetting to see three ten-year-olds imposing murders and carrying out their plans using guns, knives and crossbows. The main reason why it is not completely ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they play the little innocents before unconscious adults as they show their dark side to the girl who knows the truth. <br /> <br /> "Bloody Birthday" is pretty mediocre as a horrorflick, with little scare and little blood, but because it has the shock factor to have children as the murderers, this is a bit unique. . . One to see if there is nothing else.
