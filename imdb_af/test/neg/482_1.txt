I love the so-called "blaxploitation" movies and have seen decades. Some, like cotton come at HARLEM, SHAFT and HAMMER, have excellent production values ​​and are very entertaining, while many others are very cheap and stupid, but still entertaining, such as BROTHER OR DOOD OR COFFEY. However, DOLEMITE manages something rare for the genre - it's just cheap and stupid and not the least fun! It's like blaxploitation for many, very stupid people. <br /> <br /> Years ago, I watched the Dolemite movies on Mad TV and unfortunately the right DOLEMITE isn't any better. Like the parody, the play is just horrible. Rudy Ray Moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of balsa wood. He can barely read his lines and his "karate" is a joke. With its kicks, the target is missing from time to time. As for the rest of the actors, many can be even worse. My favorite was the FBI man who couldn't even remember his lines and really struggled to get them out - but they didn't even bother to film these scenes! In fact, so much of it was unclear that I was difficult to determine if the film was intended as a joke. <br /> <br /> If you think that despite horrible action and action that something is worth seeing This movie, you're wrong. Even for the perverts out there who hope to see some skin, will be disappointed. The naked women in the movie really look like a hard luck prostitute and there is nothing sexy about their bodies. I think looking at old people who are naked - JOY old people naked - is no worse than looking at these "ladies". And like Rudy Ray, he has "man boobs". No black superhero or anti-hero should see that bad naked !! For the sake of goodness, put up your clothes and come up with a script that doesn't seem to have been written by winos. <br /> <br /> FYI - There is apparently a sequel to this movie! ! I can't imagine looking at them, so you'll just have to get someone else to review it. I watched PLAN 9 OUTSIDE SPACE, TEACHERS OF OUTDOOR AREA AND ROBOT SAMPLE, but I just don't think I can bring myself to see another Dolemite movie - they are so bad!
