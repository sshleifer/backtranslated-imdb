The first official version of World Wrestling Entertainment's film division is a fairly basic horror / treasure movie called "See No Evil" with Kane, one of their great men's wrestlers known for an intimidating presence, stubborn movements and one of the most winding back stories in wrestling. And let's not push here; While this movie is being promoted as the biggest horror movie of all time (mostly by WWE), it goes without saying that, having seen this movie, I can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> "See No Evil" sees a lot of young criminals sent to a hotel so they can clean up. Of course, there is also a monstrous killer (played by Kane) in this hotel and we all know where it is going. Without giving away too much of the movie plot, this movie intact the entire spectacle and structure of an early 1980s movie with most of the cliches, but without any fear accompanying those movies. And this is kind of the biggest problem with "See No Evil". It tries so many of the tricks implied by its predecessors in the genre that spells it out as predictable; veteran horror fans will easily recognize the gimmicks and even those who have only seen a few flashes should know what happens next. It's too generous to be scary. <br /> <br /> The movie is incredible, but it's just for the effect. The dark atmosphere illustrated in the movie initially gives the feeling of terror, but if you come to the end, it somehow feels out of place and becomes tiring quickly. The dead scenes are not as horrible and horrible as they are, although some of them are quite inventive. <br /> <br /> And the play in this movie is also bad, as the main characters aren't developed enough to care for us when they eventually get it. Some cannot even portray fear properly; they just scream and cry in a vain attempt to emulate. So when they die, just add it to the comedy, because you don't care enough for them, just considering the equivalent of Star Fleet Redshirts to the monster Kane. <br /> <br /> As far as Kane is concerned, he just portrayed his movie character in the same way he portrayed his wrestling character, using only axes and hooks instead of helmet and sulfur. There is no doubt in my mind that Kane can be a great game in the horror genre. He has the appearance and presence of it; He only needs better material (specifically a script not written by someone who wrestling shows) to work with. <br /> <br /> Now, despite what a hard review looks, I really enjoyed the movie. It's one of those nice bad movies you can't help but sit down and enjoy. My biggest gripe with the movie is that it's just an exercise to kill gory and don't have any frills. I enjoyed it, but I enjoyed it because it was easy for me to download from some supposed to be terrifying moments in the movie. If that happened because it would be so, the movie would have been higher. But it didn't. It laughed because it was a B-movie and it did not help the director's past experiences to be porn flashes and music videos; not exactly over complicated things to do anyway. Yet I enjoyed it very much. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fun B movie or funny horror movie, I would highly recommend "See No Evil." If you are a true enthusiast of the genre, I will wait until the DVD comes out before it is checked. Everyone else should surely look something else.
