Holy crap, the beginning picked up where the first one stopped (good start). Then it goes from there. You looked like you watched television and you keep on switching between this teen soap opera, a Predator movie and some cartoon detectives. The characters presented in the first ten minutes have nothing to do with each other until the last 45 minutes or so (the characters of the teen soap opera and the real Alien story). <br /> <br /> Then the producers soon came out of money and decided to end the movie so they decided to drop a nuke on the city. <br /> <br /> PS- What the crap is the deal with the cameras that are? zoom in you can't tell what's going on? Serious, filmmakers, do a good job with fighting scenes and make it where we can see the battle.
