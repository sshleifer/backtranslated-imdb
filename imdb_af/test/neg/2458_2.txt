What I got away from watching this movie was a guilty conscience. The film itself has a rather intriguing plot line and point of departure, but unfortunately it is a movie you can't see without being bombarded with pornography. If you are planning to view it and have a moral problem with breaking down the marriage contract for the pleasure of an audience, you make a big mistake. It's not the type of movie with the token sex scene you can hit on your DVD player. Baldwin's character is at the beginning of the film a video that knows his sexual exploitation without his knowledge. This band and others like to constantly appear in the film at unpredictable times. It seems the film is trying to make a statement about the dignity of women. Ironically, they made so many women in prostitutes. I just gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because they handled Baldwin's debauchery better, it would be an interesting movie.
