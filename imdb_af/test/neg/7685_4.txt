Ivan The Terrible is more a filmed play than a big-screen opus. Citizen Kane - a similar work in many ways - is actually the opposite (in the way we expect such a trip), as it has many place views. <br /> <br /> It's meant to hear a character's motivation and thinking to the audience; If it succeeds in understanding you, how does it matter? And considering the low amount of action, how else is one to express events that affect the story, and therefore the characters' operations and decisions except "exaggerated movements"? <br /> <br /> Also, there is a historical level why the play should not be surprised. The rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany and the USSR forced filmmakers to remain behind to make films as they knew. As they had access to more modern works that showed cinema's evolution and techniques, they only used what they knew. <br /> <br /> The Nazis' control over the government in Germany destroyed the great German film industry of the 1920s because of their total control over the film industry. And propaganda movies can "entertain" as many German troops. hence the need for popular German silent films of the 1920s, for example. Such a lot of Ivan The Terrible movie's techniques would be derived from such captive German films provided to film staff (as mentioned in other comments). <br /> <br /> There was no confusion anywhere and although it was personally overheated, it was by no means a bad cinematic experience - and certainly NOT among the worse movies ever. The acting is good, and part of the cinematography is excellent (even according to today's standards, more below). Certainly not a popcorn movie; One cannot leave their brain outside this one's door. Dated perhaps and very symbolic - just worth watching on the big screen if one can't see the movies with the lights at home, because many of the movie elements will be lost in the movie's mainly B & W -experience. It all depends on the expectations you're going to ... <br /> <br /> WARNING - SPOILERS: Don't read the following comments if they affect your personal view of the movie (s). <br /> <br /> ... and if one does not keep in mind the obvious communist propaganda (as opposed to capitalist propaganda). For Ivan is how Stalin has seen himself - clearly in his influence on the film's direction (see other comments) - and anyone with a world-historical awareness outside the American perspective will certainly understand it. Perhaps Ivan was an early incarnation of Stalin, or perhaps not; it's more a writer about Stalin and his motivation, decisions, loneliness, promotions of lackeys, etc. - by using the person of Ivan - as any true historical record of Ivan. Also note the obvious use of specific colors in the sequel: Red (for the USSR) in the banquet scene. And maybe blue (for the US) during certain shots when the usurper wears the crown? <br /> <br /> But it has many excellent footage, such as the profound use of shadows, or the outside of the people who come to beg Ivan's return to Moscow.
