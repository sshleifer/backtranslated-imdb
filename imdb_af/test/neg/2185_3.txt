This movie starts at A and never reaches B. The title promises much more than the movie produces. It's superficial and filled with the usual cliches of a story in which a man questions his sexuality. The people are pleasant, even the obligatory flamboyant type. The lead (Kevin McKidd) persuades him there is no reason to act. Simon Callow, who plays a horde straight, is always worth watching, and he is by far the only reason to stay with the movie. But the rubbish about his men's "meditations" or whatever they are, is extremely tiring in a short sequence. They seem to have been thrown into the soft mix of the movie in a wrong attempt to change the environment and non-stop impact. The same remark applies to a very strange and unconvincing camping trip. Don't worry about the break of the band so you can get a snack. Let the thing run; you will not miss anything. Hugo Weaving's character is superfluous. He appeared in a row with one of the smaller clues and didn't even feel the rest at all. The outcome of the sequence is not explained, and Hugo's property business has nothing to do with the story. The movie is a total disappointment at the end because there is no resolution. The thing simply disappears and we are sent to the final credits. It is an interlude without structure.
