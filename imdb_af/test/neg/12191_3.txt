WARNING: I advise anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet to read this comment. <br /> <br /> When I first watched the movie, my expectation was that it was a vampire movie, which would be great how Rodriguez and Tarantino both helped make the movie. I started there about 15 minutes and even though my hope for this movie was in the drain, I was shocked. First of all, the story about which it went was not attractive at all, and just plain boring and unaware of the point where I just wanted to shut down. I became more frustrated with this movie as it was dragging, but I believed I was hoping it would get better .... when it finally showed vampires, it was MY MIND, in a very bad way. I thought, "Okay, this movie started with a few alternating stories about these two criminals, then it changed very slowly into a vampire movie I thought it would be from the beginning, like the last 30 minutes?" " To add to that, they try to make the main characters all cool and awesome and mean at the end if they are not so; A bunny would be more intimidating than those characters! This movie is a terrible piece of crap !!! From Dusk to Dagbreek left my fright and a terrible taste in my mouth, disgruntled thoughts in my head and not allowing my body to move from the horrible shock that I was just 108 minutes of my life on a horrible movie wasted. I don't understand how George Clooney, Quentin Tarintino, Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, all the good and honorable actors they are, can participate in this useless filth. According to me, From Dusk Till Dawn is one of the worst movies ever made that I suffered from. Don't see it, you'll do a great job ...
