The idea that someone of such a trite, clich√© but unconscious comic movie could shock, is shocking. The last 20 minutes of this movie are comic glory; with six men digging enough excavations in 10 minutes to relieve the runway with 747 fuel, while a suspected 'big' landed the 747 in a 110mph crosswind land. The foremost one to investigate the misnomer of this movie. CRASH LANDING ... <br /> <br /> Some of the dialogue was equivalent to rubbing sandpaper in my ears, while the only aspect that saved this movie for one was the abundance of attractive women who screen filled much of the time. Not exactly a consolidation for this pathetic excuse for a movie, but my dumb button finally got a workout. <br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk! 2 out of 10
