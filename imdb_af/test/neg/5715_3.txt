It's nice to see Julie Andrews play a direct dramatic role here - something she hasn't done in a while - but her character from Judith (show she hasn't passed her as a "Judy") has created the old refined ways and tomboyish hairstyle of yore, and Andrews 'adults' like any other actress interpreting interpreter. It's a surprisingly common drama that takes place in Barbados with Omar Sharif (not the liveliest front man - not even in 1974!). Hopefully Andrews will make a spy and slowly lead her into the proverbial bedroom. Immaculate outing has some camp value: the James Bond-like credits at the start are a cute hobby. As for July: she's quiet and contemplative, but it doesn't do much for the audience or for the movie. Blake Edwards beats the freakin 'thing like a funeral. * of ****
