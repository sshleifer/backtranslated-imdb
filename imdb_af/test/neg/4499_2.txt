More of a Frisbee likes turtles that rise like a swivel grain. More battles with people in bird suits that look like people in birdwatching. A Pingpong ballroom ship. Two naughty boys who know how to do everything, including getting aboard the spaceship. More tiring music. More "Gamera is the friend of children". I remember Godzill and Rodan coming out. The movies were fun because the monsters were actually a threat to people. Now they are just a few silly costumes with very little behind them. The adults are all ridiculous and moronous. As in American sitcoms, the kids are the bosses (when they can't really think their way out of a paper bag). These monster movies should be the Japanese way of partitioning these little snots. Above all, however, after three of these movies (with the same plot seen over and over, look at the stock image), the ultimate conclusion is that they are boring. If you haven't seen this one, don't bother it.
