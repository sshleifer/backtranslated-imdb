Ughh this movie is terrible. The writing is stupid and of course chasing, don't tell me, he doesn't love her !!! Like every episode ... I never understand Zoey 101 (the show) Also, why is Logan's father doing so? And she's just about zoey and chasing some of the other characters. It's always the same in every episode that Quinn makes and invention, something goes wrong with the invention and soy brother always gets involved. If you haven't seen it, don't waste an hour watching this cuz, you'll waste your time! SMaybe can be interesting for an eight-year-old 8-10, but I can't think of this older movie anymore. But what can you expect from Nick?
