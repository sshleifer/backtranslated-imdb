This movie was really funny, though it wasn't meant to be! The acting was stupid and so was the voice. Almost all that was, was a man walking around a maize maze for an hour and a half. They threw this stupid super natural thing that made it thinner. It wasn't even like an ordinary movie, this strange, scary music was almost completely played by the movie. What is it with corn maze horror movies? Children of the wheat were very scary, I thought and I thought it would be something like that, but really it was just stupid. The main character just went around for these two little girls. And then, in the end, he likes to kill someone or something. It's worth seeing if you're with your friends because it's really funny how bad it is, but if you're looking for a horror movie, don't waste your time.
