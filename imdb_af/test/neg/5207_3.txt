I'm a big horror fan, and I bought this movie from all the hype it got on the message boards. Well, let me tell you, I don't know who gives it all the hype, but let me talk about a few things. <br /> <br /> First, this movie isn't quite a few things. It is not scary, not exciting, not excessive, not too sick (except for one season). Not beautifully achieved .... ALL. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie is that a few flights to a small island in Greece, because they did a little lie in London. We don't even know what they did, but they are suspected of killing someone. <br /> <br /> ** spoiler warning ** <br /> <br /> The male head kills some people from his perversion of "cleaning the island of perverts" strangely enough. The murders are cheap, the characters are cheaper and the effects suck. <br /> <br /> There is one part when he rapes a buck because his wife doesn't give him in the morning, but even that is done without care. for how it was shot. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is about the only thing that is not entirely predictable. I especially enjoyed the "shepherd" farts on the man. Anyway, if you can rent it and have 2 hours to waste, continue. It is nothing better than a processed cheese roll on stale bread. <br /> <br /> 3/10
