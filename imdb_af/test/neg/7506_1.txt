I live and work in Lexington, Kentucky, the town where Zombie Planet was filmed. I heard from the movie forever from several people who claimed to be a critical part of the production. Then, for a few years, I heard absolutely nothing. Imagine my surprise when I put it all by itself at the local video store, just a while for a rental. So, as the cinefile I am, I decided to give these local filmmakers a chance. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. <br /> <br /> Zombie Planet is overblown, boring, poorly behaved, miserably shot - and that's just the good thing. I tried my hardest to enjoy it, which included removing my brain and putting it on the table so it couldn't get in the way of the terrible storyline. Oh, nothing worked. Zombie Planet is so bad it's pathetic. And the idea that they are planning a successor leads me to believe that the director and his henchmen have heard nothing of the criticism, sure they have heard. Stay up, guys. Please. In fact, you shouldn't get rid of film making. Or follow a few classes about the tempo, storytelling and, indeed, basic direction. <br /> <br /> For the love of God, hang it up.
