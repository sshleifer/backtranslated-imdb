Okay, this movie starts and it looks like it's a cute comedy about a completely obsessed soap opera fan. She does not touch the reality beyond the soap (kind of the reverse of the main characters in Pleasantville) and walks away to Los Angeles to meet a fictional character. Well, it's a cute movie ... but at the same time it's a dark, very violent movie about two hitmen killing Betty for reasons too complex to tell here. Or a plot line would have been enough on its own, but "Nurse Betty" contains both stories simultaneously and the effect is very frightening. I didn't enjoy it much.
