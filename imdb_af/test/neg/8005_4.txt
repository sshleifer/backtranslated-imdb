Circus could have been so much better if they reduced the number of twists and each developed better. The film has a very gifted role that performs well, but it completely loses its audience. Everyone returns and does not hide them. The same time they hit someone else back and work with .... did I lose you? Well, the movie is even more confusing, clearly written by a first timer writer. It has some redeeming features, but in the play Famke Janssen in particular shines like Lily, but unfortunately many USELESS screen times just don't stand thereâ€¦ the dialogue is a little cheesy and the accent is sometimes annoying but it's still worth checking out if you're a fan of any of the actors, especially John and Famke who get the most screen time. Just remember to look at it with a notebook so you can write down double crossing every second.
