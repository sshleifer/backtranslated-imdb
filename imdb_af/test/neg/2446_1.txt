Cartoon-like special effects, horrible acting and dialogue, and dry plot! This movie has it all! My friend and I went to find a horrible movie we could enjoy, but it was just too much. The film begins with a woman and her son vacationing on a compound island in the Bahama region. The women, who are just a doctor / virologist, are in the area when a man collapses. He has a strange wound on his arm, and she knows immediately that it is an infectious virus. The story continues to show spectacular rapid romance between the two teenage leaders (it is justified by the girl who says, "I know it's fast, but it just feels good." ????) Anyway, the whole island infected with this virus and The CDC is introduced. We are told within three months if the virus is not being treated and that it will be distributed to the United States and kill millions of people. This app does not stop the CDC from leaving the island to save themselves. Fortunately, the healing of this terrible virus was found just in time, and the whole island was saved. To celebrate the death of those loved ones, the islanders have a crushing party where everyone enjoys dancing, having fun, and forgets about the terrible epidemic that has just happened.
