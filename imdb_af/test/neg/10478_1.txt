First, I must confess that a separate peace is my favorite book. So, of course, I have some prejudice against any attempt to adapt it to a movie or television movie. But when I started watching this movie, I was more than willing to favor it. The original version of the early 1970s, though shot at Phillips Exeter Academy where the author's author attended school, and although it remained as faithful as it could be for the book, had no real depth of feeling and failed essence of the characters. The original was simply going through the movements. If you read the trivia about the movie, you discover that it is mostly cast with non-actors. The original, therefore, has an amateur feel and it eventually ends. <br /> <br /> This new version, although I will allow it to capture the look of the period better than the original, looks like the book has been thrown out of everyone. Scenes are rearranged, characters written where they do not belong, characters not created in the book, and no attempt to obscure the deepest conflicts that make the book so compelling. And the cardinal sin of all: the tree is not treated as the essential, almost central character in the book. This is an inexplicable review of the filmmakers. How can they play the role of the tree? Why isn't it instantly instituted? Why start the dead pointer? And what in God's name was Gene's accent? This film is blunt, rubbish. A separate peace should not be a difficult book to adjust for the stage or screen. John Knowles wrote it in a fine, linear style. The filmmakers had to trust the story as it was written; make changes, sure; decorate here and there, sure; take some soft dramatic license, sure. But does one of the pearls of American literature destroy this process? What do they think? In their corruption of the story line, they cut any possibility of tension or drama. The whole movie falls flat and fails. <br /> <br /> If you are a high school or college student dedicated to reading this book, you think of skimming and just watching the movie ... don't even think about it. This movie won't help you. <br /> <br /> Oh, we'll have to wait longer for a version of this story to appear on the screen that really makes it fair.
