It's a case of taking a fairy tale too far. The enchanted cottage delivers Dorothy McGuire as a "terribly ugly" spider and Robert Young as a defeated pilot. Long story short: Scarface marries Spinster, after which their love miraculously relieves them (lighting, cosmetics and the removal of fake scars) in beautiful people? A magical change that they attributed to the enchantment of life in a cottage that was the residence of generations of honeymoon. <br /> <br /> If the story ceased, it's fine; It would be a fable with a proverbial message: beauty is in the eye of the awake. But it pushes ahead and reaches to reality. When Mr. A wife. Scarface greeting their audience, it comes as a painful shock to them that they are still home. You see, they just look good to each other? a situation for which the audience is well prepared because all the secondary characters preach that bad people really have to lower their expectations and find other ways to be happy. You know. Pick up hobbies. Spinster, for example, does woodcuts. Scarface is considering the collection of driftwood. <br /> <br /> The original playwright (Arthur Wing Pinero) and the filmmakers have zero in human nature. Their message is: You're either ugly or pretty, and no pretty person will ever love an ugly one. What's worse, ugly people have to imagine their lover so beautiful. Reality just won't. <br /> <br /> One wonder what Elaine Mason saw every day when she looked at her husband Stephen Hawking.
