Soultaker is written by Vivian Schilling. It also stood with Joe Estevez, Gregg Thomsen and Robert D'Zar as the Angel of Death. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the launch of Soultaker, played by Joe Estevez. We quickly learn how Soultaker's role in this movie will be. <br /> <br /> The youth college is getting ready for a summer festival, titled "Summerfest". In this movie, the battle of the classes is everywhere in the film. The girls come from a rich class, and the guys come from about the middle or lower class. The class roles seem to play a role in the movie for some reason, which is not really clear or pertinent to the story. <br /> <br /> At Summerfest, we learn more about the apparent class struggle of why Zach has not encouraged Natalie to date. Soultaker also makes an appearance, believing his boss, the Angel of Death. Here, Dzar's character indicates who is to die and whose souls are to be taken. It is also revealed that Soultaker will have a character conflict with Natalie, and how he deals with her because of someone in his past. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Natalie is being fired from Summerfest, and Zach convinces her to drive home with them. During the riding house, Soultaker takes an active role, causing them to be terribly destroyed at high speed. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story surrounds the Soultaker who gathers the souls of the dead passengers, and Zach and Natalie try to persuade him to return to their bodies so that they can live. The class and character conflicts lie in the story, but are never really brought to the fore or solved. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to end some of the drama, there is a lot of hunting and running that tends to be really boring. It is not really acceptable, and it would have been nice if it was handled in some other way, somehow to increase the drama, but not tolerate the audience. <br /> <br /> The story and acting are decent. The soundtrack is right, and even the production values ​​are good. <br /> <br /> Robert D'Zar, on the screen, appears to be a good job as the Angel of Death. Joe Estevez does, but sometimes she plays a bit flat. Vivian is beautiful and does a decent job as Natalie, although maybe a little in a few scenes. <br /> <br /> It may be weird, but this movie may have benefited with a sensible nudity. Vivian put us a little, but that wasn't enough. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this was a pretty serious effort to make a movie. The results, it's worth watching. Don't just expect a perfect production. <br /> <br /> 3/10
