About twenty or so years ago, Charles Bukowski was a hero of mine. I have blindly accepted the image created by intellectual types and seen in various films. Of course, I never met the intellectual types that Bukowski prescribed as a hero. They can usually be found behind the counter at hipster video industry and record stores. These people almost spoke and when they asked a question, they usually clipped and cut in a vague direction. They were useless if it was a specific title, but their shelves were always filled with strange and unique titles. To be inaugurated in the secret hipster club, I believed I had to build up my bourgeois and abandon the counterculture. <br /> <br /> My introduction to Bukowski started with the movie Barfly, the late 80's film that dies Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunnaway. I was a fan of Rourke. He also embodies a kind of modern, male-fantastic anti-hero, a breeding intellectual type. At that stage it addressed me. Barfly's hero spoke to convention. A mid-30 tramp, who lives with no ties, doesn't answer, and - and is recognized as a genius by a hot female literary snob, icing on the cake. Then I read Post-Office and Hollywood, and later Bukowski's experience with the movie. Now, allow me to jump forward to the latest movie based on Bukowski's book Factotum, one I read and enjoyed. Bukowski takes the form of Chinaski in this novel. I often wonder where Bukowski ended and Chinaski started. Twenty years after Barfly, the fictional movie Bukowski is still the same. I watched the movie for about an hour and I still saw signs of the facade cracking. Here's why Factotum Bukowski was my hero. Chinaski is attractive (played by Matt Dillon). He has clean neat hair, stylized but not over. When Dillon smokes and writes, he looks cool. Chinaski goes from work to work, ignores and / or fights with multiple bosses. He screws out two floozies, one of whom he lives, runs out, just to return with little repercussion. Chinaski is his own husband and we never see him emote. He is a sterile, one-dimensional, something, James Dean archetype. Factotum lies to the viewer. This does so by denying the idea of ​​a man (a writer) without consequence. A poor man who suffers for his art. What could be cooler than this? Let's say there are some truths to Factotum, because the events have taken place. What the audience lacks is the pain that Chinaski's existence adorns. Perhaps the point of this movie, and most movies, is 80 minutes. We need to escape the world filled with pain and pain and action with anti-social women who smoke, talk, drink with cool shade. One who rejects conventional behavior of work and family. My hero was ever Movie Bukowski. It would have worked long ago. It was easier then. Now I have another hero to claim. Things are not that easy. Hipster logic and movie versions of anti-culture icons offer no solutions or even questions.
