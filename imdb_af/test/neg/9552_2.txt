I saw it on the Fox channel early in the morning this morning (my dog ​​woke me up). I've seen it for years and thought I remember it pretty well. As a child I enjoyed it. But now? As another poster communicated, several of the rules were out of order, and while it was initially and bizarre, it seemed to fit the production. It was just terribly surreal and amusing. Music numbers for what I think was the "big" fundraising show ("you're in show business, I'm in show business, most of the kids are in show business, let's have a show") come out of nowhere BEFORE talking about turning a show on, and then fading without applause to completely unrelated "straight" scenes. The front man's friend points out, spits out lines and lines of dialogue, then disappears. I was half awake and loved every folly of it.
