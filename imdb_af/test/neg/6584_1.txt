The Polar Express. Director Robert Zemeckis, I love Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Contact, and who has Roger Rabbit (NO QUESTION POINT AFTER THE MOVIE TITLE !!). And Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors. The reviews of this movie were almost unanimous and said it was an immediate holiday classic. Ebert & Roeper gives it two ENTUSIASTIME thumbs up! Even Ebert's written review gave it a full four stars! Wow ... OK ... I must see that! But wait ... the motion recording used looks really weird. Hmm ... maybe I'm not that interested in seeing it anymore. <br /> <br /> "Well, you come?" says the train conductor for the boy in The Polar Express. The boy was first hesitant and the train started without her walking on his career. The boy quickly changes his mind and just jumps into the neck of time. <br /> <br /> Now, most of you have probably decided not to board this train and are waiting for the TV train or rental phrase (please, I'm so greasy and smart). On the other hand, I was like the boy who was initially skeptical, but jumped to see what the fuss was about. <br /> <br /> I just wasted $ 10 and two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> I can't even begin to explain the pain in my stomach. The Polar Express was so painful to sit through, it's not even funny. There is no story. There is no down payment. You sit there through this series of events and you wonder "is there any point?" It would be one thing if the screens were entertaining ... but it is not. <br /> <br /> This movie is invalid of any emotion, soul, credibility, and above all, any fun. This movie is not fine. <br /> <br /> And we're talking about how these characters look for a second. Saying it's the same technology (movement, sorry, "performance" catch) used to make Gollum is a real shame because Gollum was credible !!! Photo realism doesn't translate well into this medium. You use animation, why don't the characters design expressively? Or why not just film it with real actors? They can definitely have. We as people know too well how we walk, talk, interact with things. To see it on the screen is unconvincing, not impressive. Caricatures done convincingly are all the more credible, as The Incredibles proved. The result of The Polar Express is now as if they had dead bodies and changed them into dolls. They move and talk, but where is the heart? Where is the soul? This is what we see on the screen. UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH! This movie is so horrible! <br /> <br /> There is a scene early in the movie where the boy takes a girl's train ticket from her chair because she got up and left. He wants to give it to her, but you sit there and go "why?" Just leave it ... she's coming back! Of course, he lost the ticket and "adventure" occurred. And then there's a boy who's been stuck in the back of the train and they bring hot chocolate, but he can't get up and join the rest of the kids. And then there is this annoying "know all" child with the voice of a 35-year-old. It is so disturbing. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there are songs! One girl goes in the back of the train where the lonely child is. He sings a song for himself. And then she interrupted and joined him! They end the song, as they hold hands, see each other's eyes as if they were lovers. Very uncomfortable. I won't even go into detail about the song to serve hot chocolate while the waiters dance around the train. "Keep it warm, keep it warm!" The one scene where Tom Hanks slips on his knees with his arms in the air should be one of the most memorable BD scenes in the history of bad scenes. <br /> <br /> I have to stop now or I'll kill myself. I have to look at something to clean the palette. Yes ... crappy is better than The Polar Express. <br /> <br /> "The one thing about trains, no matter where you go, what matters is deciding." <br /> <br /> Don't get on this one. . For the love of God I have decided for you! It's just another movie taken from a children's book that is extremely thin in film form. It happened to the Grinch and the cat in the hat and it was terrible too. But who can blame them? I bet if I took the book, The Berenstein Bears Too much Junk Food, and turned it into a movie, it would probably be boring too. But at least ... there would be a story and a point, and that's what the Polar Express is missing.
