This cheap exploit is a few really uncomfortable things, thanks to Spaghetti Country Director Lamberto Bava, who left his name wisely. <br /> <br /> The basic essence of this excursion relates to the discovery of some brutally mutilated individuals living on the beach in the Caribbean Sea. Authorities initially believe they are the victims of shark attacks, but if the investigation unraveled, it seems much more sinister. <br /> <br /> All of these are ultimately very little, but we have here added poor dubbing by a similarly poor font, often made up of nonsensical jab, and is largely influential. Acting can only be described as subpar, which is par for the course in this case. Certainly, lax direction does not help. <br /> <br /> Special effect is mainly for many close-ups of several greedy bodies that miss limbs, et cetera. Of course, there are the compulsory creatures that periodically appear to be food-like, which resemble a large monster octopus thing, where its animation consists only of its pointed teeth upward and descending into rhythmic articulation. Overall, the end result is not too convincing, but surely it is almost entertaining in a cheesy kind of fashion. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the filmmakers are going to be a kind of lower-floor hire of Jaws and Piranha, but the final product is just a bloody shambles, much like the bodies that are constantly shown by this photo. I find it hard to think of any redeeming features to view it, so too strict for incurable monster movie addicts.
