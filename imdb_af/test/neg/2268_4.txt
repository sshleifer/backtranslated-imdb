Shwaas may have a good story, but the director is completely without talent. He doesn't know when to stop. When the story calls people confused, there are ten-minute scenes of people imitating the act of confusion. When the story is looking for some background history, there are ten-minute scenes from Konkan's green. When the story is looking for a child who throws tantrums ... you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the extreme imitations, so you can count people's rhinos. There are movies to be seen on a big screen. This movie should be seen on a 13 "TV. Amruta Subhash who plays Asavari is the worst actress I've seen for quite some time, practicing to persuade over years to accomplish what she's so effortless. <br /> <br /> I give it 4/10 simply because the subject is different, and the story is not bad The fact that a movie like Shwaas came to India's entry into the Oscars does not tell volumes about the state of the Indian movie but the state of the Indian Review Committees, a movie is not good, just because its subject matter is.
