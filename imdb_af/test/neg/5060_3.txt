After writing and producing the previous six years, Luc Besson returns to the Angel-A director's chair. I'm a big fan of Leon, and love the prospect of a black and white French movie from the same group. <br /> <br /> Andr√© is a liar and gambler addicted to almost every loan shark in Paris. He could not repay his debt, and was worth keeping on the edge of the Eiffel Tower. He decides to kill himself. He does it at the same time as a mysterious woman, whom he decides to save. Determining to thank him, she begins to help him solve his own life. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a few laughs, which run smoothly. The footage is pretty pretty and works well with Paris attractions. But that's it. It's all the movie that goes for it. And these mere two facets can't do anything to keep the speed of the horrible movie the movie makes. Although I cannot explain the main character badly (his inconsistencies are close), the parable is horrific. A horrible screen presence and bitter annoyance. The plot is ridiculously inconsistent, and sometimes bitterly stupid, especially the end; an end that looted the deadly salvation of the scenes immediately before it occurred. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene I've seen the observation is stupid, indulgent, melodramatic and far too terrible to be so bad, it's funny. The overall depiction of the film may have potential once, but it is cruelly tortured by one-day terrible implementation of its ideas. The movie was really a task to watch, and one that completely screamed me on the screen. <br /> <br /> Mass and immeasurably flawed, Angel-A is just bad. Although she occasionally succeeds in drawing out chortles at scarce intervals, it is obvious that this film is nothing but repulsive.
