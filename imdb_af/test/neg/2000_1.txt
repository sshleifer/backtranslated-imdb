This is my first comment on a movie here. I need it from all the bad movies I've ever seen, including Braindead for an example, it's really WORS! I promise. Don't even look at it. It's boring, bad acting, bad writing and plot, bad effects. That whole movie is a big piece of crap! If I could, I would give 0 stars out of 10, but since the lowest one is terrible, I have to vote it. But I will say the movie is worse than terrible. <br /> <br /> Don't get yourself hurt by seeing this movie and hope it will get better because I can tell you now, it won't! I was hoping there might be a single scene that would be worth watching. There was no good scene at all. <br /> <br /> What an excellent piece of crap. <br /> <br /> And Coolio as a vampire? LOL! LMGA! YARGH!
