Come on. How did all these talented actors / actresses end up in this mess? Was it a kind of extortion / lost commitment situation? Vinnie, you're a muscular man. Be what you were born. <br /> <br /> The hot tub scene? The Scrabble scene? I expected to hear the "needle over the record" at any time. <br /> <br /> And what was it about him carrying the valuable Dickens manuscript with him? Let's see, I'm drunk at a bar, why don't I remove the valuable Dickens manuscript? I'm going to meet some dubious thieves on the side of the Thames, why not take my valuable Dickens manuscript? <br /> <br /> Crapola. <br /> <br /> Terrible. Avoid.
