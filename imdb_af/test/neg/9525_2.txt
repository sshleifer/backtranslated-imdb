Duncan Roy's writing and direction is really, and often, under par. Actually, it's kind of smelly. AKA is almost as bad as its recent (terrible, self-controlled) remake of Dorian Gray - absurd, distorted dialogue between the 'upper class' characters, immediately idiotic and pretentious, amateurish, at the heart of the game. Characterization and dissertation - and sometimes the acting - is scantily like a school game ... but worse, there is a kind of peacock self-assurance about the direction that only soul destroys if the director did not understand ... he is just not good. Princess Quick should be embarrassed. DR, you just have to get out of film ... seriously.
