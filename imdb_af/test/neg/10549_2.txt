The Toxic Avenger, Part II begins with the exciting revelation that after the Toxic Aveneger (John Altamura who was shot during production and replaced with Ron Fazio) got his hometown Tromaville out of evil, it actually became a nice place to to stay. This meant that Toxie hadn't used more than a superhero and now suffered from depression and a sense of total uselessness (like directors, Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz should feel as if they were producing it). Toxie is now working as a porter at the center of Tromaville for the blind. It's not long before the trouble goes awry, but an evil chemical manufacturer, called Apocalypse Inc., plans to take over Tromaville for some insignificant reasons or others, but to do so, they need to get rid of. After the first plan of evil chairman Rick Collins failed, he stabbed Toxie's psychiatrist (Erika Schickel) to tell him to go to Japan and see his Father. Leaving his girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Legere), his mother (Jessica Dublin) and his home behind Toxie heads for Tokyo, Japan. As soon as Toxie sits on finding his Father and a woman named Masami (Mayako Katsuragi), he helps in his quest. Meanwhile, come back to Tromaville Apocalypse Inc. for death and without Toxie, the citizens are powerless to defend themselves. Toxie eventually finds Big Mac Bunko (Rikiya Yasuoka) he led to believe is his Father, but Big Mac is all part of Apocalypse Inc. plan to destroy Toxie once and for all. <br /> <br /> Produced and directed by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz this follow-up to the successful The Toxic Avenger (1985) proves basically the first movie was a complete fly, a happy accident to the right blend of bad taste comedy Combining, Cruel Violence and Bad -This is good movie-making, The Toxic Avenger, Part II is a cargo of crap in comparison. The script by Kaufman, Phil Rivio & Gay Partington Terry with a load of "additional material" credits does not contain a single funny moment during the total 102 tracks. The visual gags are awful, Toxie walks through Tokyo with a wig and glasses to mix in, for example, or a scene where he warms a bad guy in it. And as he cooks, Toxie throws in a load of vegetables & spaghetti, a scene where he sticks a woman's nose, puts an antenna in her head and a microphone in her mouth, after which a Japanese radio presenter speaks, a little where a Japanese bad man burned his nose in the form of a fish. , a little where Toxie grabs a swordfish head and uses it as a weapon, or embarrassing bad overworking and stupid idiotic facial expressions, a guy who literally has a fish head and literally becomes sushi, the terrible comedy music and sound effects and the whole film in general is a pale imitation of what made the original almost amusing and memorable. The bad taste gags are not there this time and the foolish childish humor of the first is also lacking, it just feels like a real step back from the original. Don't forget it's Troma here, it's definitely a bad thing. There are a few gory fights and some serious gore and violence, at least in the so-called uncut 102 minute version I have seen, bruised heads with the bodies that protrude blood, faces, intestines, roses in some's eyes and thorns wrapped in their throat, torn ears, cut arms and a very graphic and gory scene of a man who has been cut. Unfortunately, the special effects of Pericles Lewnes are not very convincing and usually come within the first twenty minutes. The acting is embarrassing as I have already mentioned. Action shows there is an ultra cheap car haunted and some unpleasant, slender battles with cardboard ninja throwing stars at one point. Grumpy way there is nothing a few gory set pieces apart. Comedy shows it's very rude. In fact, the Toxic Avenger, Part II really sucks at all levels and, moreover, everything that made it extremely satisfying, it appears that most of the role-players are taken from the nearest street corner, that continuity does not exist, filmography is basic & shoot and the special effects are anything else. One or two gory scenes apart, it's total crap plain & simple, make yourself a favor look again the original.
