I like Errol Flynn; I like biographies and I like action movies. It contains all three of the following .... but I didn't like this movie. It just went too long, though the last 20 minutes were excellent, especially in photography with some good low-shots. However, I looked like it took six hours to get it, and I really can't say why I feel like that. <br /> <br /> The action is interesting, Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland are good. In fact, it was refreshing to see that the Havilland was actually supportive of Flynn instead of her normal role as an opponent of him. However, something in this movie is missing. <br /> <br /> The film has already been criticized for its historical inaccuracy, but I do not hear the same criticism for many other films that did the same. In fact, she RARE when a movie is historically accurate. For this reason, this revisionist history has insulted most critics. If the movie General Custer did much worse than he really was, they would probably have liked it. Well, bad. In their distorted way, critics prefer villains to heroes. <br /> <br /> I really wish I could enjoy it, but I will take many other Flynn adventures on this one.
