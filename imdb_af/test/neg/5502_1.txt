Surely this movie was hacked by the studio? Perhaps not, but I feel there were serious shortcomings in the storytelling that if it could not be attributed to the change process, caused only by bad, criminal, writing and straightforward. <br /> <br /> I understand the effect Burton wanted to achieve with the stylized play, similar to the gothic fairy-tale atmosphere of edward scissorhands, but unfortunately it is flat and does not reach a mythical depth of tropics but only the offensive tribulation. ie bad behavior and level characterization even for a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's not frightening, and just a little amusing in its efforts. The use of dialogue as a vehicle for plot background was awkward and unnecessary. The mystery from which the headless rider would be would not be enough for the myth about a German mercenary, although Christopher Walken cut a staggering figure, but not as threatening. When he saw the horse's head, it seemed much more friendly that a predominantly inhumane nine foot spirit as in the original legend. <br /> <br /> No real rhythm or universal tone has ever been established and not a classic offensive. stilted and clipped when I said goodbye ...
