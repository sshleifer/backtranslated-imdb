This movie was offensive computer, predictable and clich√©. I couldn't imagine a movie that better illustrate the myopic, narcissistic predikiness of today's Hollywood. If you haven't seen it, don't watch it. If you have, show courage and tell people how terrible it really is. My wife, a minority in her own right, was insulted by the inherent and perpetual racist message of the film. This movie has nothing to do with the real world and has little to add to any discussion on racism in this country. Instead, it's the kind of cheap, sensational shit that is thought to be so deep and challenging. What kind of bubble do you have to imagine to think it's impressive?
