Target is the story of a special agent who, after making orders to kill Turkish "Terrorists" (note that it is one of those American films for guys who think of unceasing nationalist super-patriotic movie films) his former wife and two children take hostage. Charlie Snow has just a few hours to do what the terrorists tell him to get them back. <br /> <br /> It was by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And if it wasn't for someone I actually (and probably accidentally) got it from the video store, I'd never have seen this huge hope of waste. <br /> <br /> The movie plays like any generic action movie story I've ever seen. In fact, these are the kinds of things they spoof on variety shows, that's how bad it is. I expected half In Living the Color's "Homey the Clown" for Mad TVs, Will Sasso will make his Steven Segal impression break out halfway through the screen, reminding you that it was just an exaggerated action movie, but now our characters here To spoil how ridiculous it really is. There wasn't even a good fight or action sequence. By the way things are played out, you won't even think someone was kidnapped, there were any terrorists, or anything at all distant. <br /> <br /> Not only is the story completely and completely uninteresting, the acting is so horrible. Just look at the part where Stephen Baldwin, as former special agent Charlie Snow, speaks to the kidnappers on the phone. They tell him they have his wife, and they put her on the phone. She says, "Charlie, help!" or something about it. And Baldwin answers "it's okay, darling" in such a deadly way, you think he reads the script and tries to sound the words phonetically. I think, in spite of such a ridiculous movie (one at the bottom of 100 on IMDb - a list they have to expand to include at least 250 movies and almost every Stephen Baldwin movie should include), anyone with a few talent at least bothered not to hammer it so much. Someone. Anyone. I couldn't pass the fact that everyone sounded like they were reading a script. Save it is the only person in the entire friggin movie who has any talent whatsoever (and it would not have been here), Mad TV's Deborah Wilson. <br /> <br /> It was the capital cheese festival. How really embarrassing.
