It is indeed the movie that made kung fu popular in the 1970s. But if it ever had any excitement or even halfway interesting plot, it doesn't look very good. <br /> <br /> Short story short: extremely protracted, slow-moving, confusing plot with running choreography, typically annoying and exaggerated whiplash sounds with every punch and kick, and constant "plot twists" never ending don't come. By the time the film reaches its emotional climax, I have long been beating the wind to really care. <br /> <br /> Look at its historical value as a milestone of Chinese kung fu cinema - just leave your expectations at your doorstep or you'll be extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> Only for hardcore fans.
