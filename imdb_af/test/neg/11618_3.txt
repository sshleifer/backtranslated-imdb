Uh Oh! I just said this "classic" movie has a plot that STINKS! Well, that's true, so come on! This film was a vanity project for Joseph P. Kennedy in which his mistress died and money flowed to make her an even bigger star. Today, there is only a fragmentary copy - one that has been sneaked back for a few years. But even if the film was in perfect shape, it would have had much reason. And further, here are some of my reasons: <br /> <br /> First, Gloria Swanson, 31, plays a girl in a monastery school - maybe 16 or 18 years old! Come on - she looks old enough to be the mother of many of the children. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the film is all about the stupid notion of "love at first sight". While some believe it, it is ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw everything at a woman he didn't even know! What a lot of hooey! <br /> <br /> Third, the movie is histrionic and the plot is nuts! After school, Kelly leaves East Africa and then becomes "Queen of the Horns". And later, after the evil queen dies back in Europe (it's convenient), the prince can come out of jail, actually finding Kelly and marrying her and then becoming queen of a truly honest-to-goodness country! Gimme a break - it's RIDICULOUS, even in the days of the silent movie this plot was a groaner! <br /> <br /> So, briefly, it's a poor movie with great production values ​​(girls should look good) that turn around like a classic! There are so many better silent movies out there - see them first and avoid these trips.
