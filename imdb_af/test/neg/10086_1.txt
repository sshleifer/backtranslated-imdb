Tyra Banks must teach these girls that it is not all to be beautiful on the outside. The inside also counts for something. Many of the past winners have looked semi-decent, but are terribly cruel and start troubling the other girls. I see Tyra less involved with the girls every season. About the only thing worth looking at Topmodel is Mr. Jay Manuel. Tyra recently had a participant who was a pre-op transsexual. I felt she had to do more to encourage her. It was clear that she had insecurity about her original anatomy through her feminine appearance. Tyra had to give her tips, or maybe she had the resident Trannie Mev. Jay sent to help the girl. Instead, the contestant is critically criticized and not met with enough positive criticism. This is a pity because I really enjoyed the first 3 seasons. There is a reason why Project Runway already has 4 seasons on DVD and Top Model only 1 season on DVD. It is called taste. Topmodel needs a lot more humanity.
