OH MY GOD! After so many promises, Critters 2 began repeating the Karmic rule from what was coming around. It is clear that very few things were invented when this movie was made, and what made Scott Grimes win! It had to be the last expedition in the Critters saga, but more rubbish was on its way. This was the big reason I didn't watch Critters 3 and why is every bad movie series an episode in space? (Critters, Friday the 13th, Leprechaun in Space, Hellraiser, etc.)
