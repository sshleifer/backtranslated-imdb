Humor is a very individual thing and the audience at The Wog Boy's snooker preview enjoyed it more than I did. I found it an anachronistic relationship, more representative of the old-fashioned racial humor of the Australian theater of the 1960s and 1970s. The boy never met the girl's grave because of a lack of chemistry between Lucy Bell and Nick Giannopoulos as I laughed and laughed. If you want to spend your money on it, wait until it's on video.
