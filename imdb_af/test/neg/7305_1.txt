okay, let's cut after the chase - I can give it nothing but one out of 10; and yet you must see it! The acting is bad, but is nothing as bad as the screenplay that itself stands before the production values. Kartonasse? Yes, we did. Car floor mats painted silver and used as armor? here it is! <br /> <br /> The film itself proposes to be artistic, but is only cheap; The same shots are used repeatedly - especially in the stripped out scenes; there is very little dialogue, and there is a lot of 'artistic' music to hit the horror! <br /> <br /> And all this horror is compelling - just look through it so you can tell you saw it. I did not even come upon the barren sets, the plot or the excited special effects; It's really the "how to do it" school of film filming. It must be seen - spreading the word and letting the world all together in riddle about what is happening on earth, at the end <br /> <br /> The best thing is that they made a sequel.
