Although I'm not too much of a religious person, I still have relatively high expectations for this movie, as it has the amazing Steve Carrell, and his predecessor, Bruce Almighty, actually a creative and clever, Christian theme comedy. However, Evan Almighty does not come close to the originality and freshness of the original, and cannot decide whether it is a comedy or a sentimental movie about faith and family values. If it had chosen a clear path to focus on these themes, it could have been to its potential, but the result of blending the two is a movie that has a very flat and dry sense of humor, stocking dialogue and motives that try to give the film's proficiency, but instead obstructs the intelligence of the audience, and also a very confused and cloudy representation of the film's opaque message. It was very clear that Evan Almighty was very poorly written, there are many plot holes and elements in the movie that make absolutely no sense. For example, although a large variety of exotic animals from all over the world swam to Evan as he builds the ark for their salvation from the flood, their inclusion is really needed as the only "flood" that happens in the movie is the city center of Washington DC and a suburban area, which means they have no risk of being wiped out? The filmmakers found that they did not have to modernize the Bible story at all. Instead, it just happened in the present time without changing anything to the plot. Many elements that do not add up and make it clear are not the idiotic motifs and writing within the film. Overall, this work is tragic because the acting talent of Steve Carrell and Wanda Sykes is not exhibited because of the sheer characters they portray and that it is so poorly written that it skews much of the film's attempt at themes and makes a mockery of the first movie. Finally, Evan Almighty is also an insult to the brilliant actors in it and any semi-intelligent filmmaker, because both of them fail miserably.
