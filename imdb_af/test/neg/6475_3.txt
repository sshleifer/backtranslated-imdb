Chris Ricci sleeps the way through most of this, but then quickly gets bored and disdain - much I did when I looked at it. Without her, it would no longer be a cheap child movie, but she added at least a quality air. There are few, if any, more visually striking and charismatic young actresses in the business. <br /> <br /> There is not much wrong with it as long as you accept it for what it is - a cheap Disney make-up for many special kids. I could see Ricci all day long, so I'm probably unaware of many of the movie's shortcomings, but if you're also a Ricci fan, a cat lover or a very young child, you doubt it very entertaining.
