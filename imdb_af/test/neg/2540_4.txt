This movie was different from most of Jimmy Cangey's 1930s movies because it was NOT done by Warner Brothers / First National, but was a loan for a smaller studio. Being a studio-row studio, the production value is lower than you used to watch with Cagney movies. Plus, the plot is definitely one of the strangest things I've seen. Instead of being a gunman, he was a good man in this one - fighting for the law. It's not that unusual, as Cagney regularly played judges - such as an OSS leader (the ancestor of the CIA) of the FBI agent. BUT, to make him an investigator for the Bureau for Weights and Measures, was indeed strange - especially since he sometimes acted the same way he did in the movie G-MEN! <br /> <br /> All in all, a passer-by and it's about. <br /> <br /> Finally, the videotape I've seen from Memory Lane. Video may have been one of the poorest I've ever experienced. . The sound was terrible and scratchy and the print looked very white and had very torn film and gaps.
