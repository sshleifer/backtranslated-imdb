This Second World War movie, which is in Borneo, is trying so hard to work on so many levels. It's a pity that it's not all of them. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte is a US escape that testifies to the executions of his comrades by the Japanese. He wanders deep into the jungle of Borneo, lost. Cue Nigel Havers, who finds Nolte's adopted tribe. Nolte, now resembling Robert Plant, became his tribe's new king. He defeated a sturdy battle in a bloody battle and had a tattoo on his chest (a dragon). Now before you go out and get painful tattoos and a one-way ticket to Borneo, things aren't going well in Nolteland. Havers want to help the tribe fight the Japanese, invading the island. He teaches the natives how to use machine guns, and lots of shooting starts. As the tribe becomes more successful, they run counter to a new squadron of Japanese who are not like the others. This group cannibalize the villages they conquer to maintain their strength (talk about your sushi), and they even move faster through the jungle than the tribe. Knowing the outcome of the war, we finally know the triumphs of the tribe, but with heavy casualties. Here are the spoilers: Havers were injured and returned to "civilization." He gives the place of the kingdom and Nolte is captured. Havers then go through the trouble of releasing Nolte, and the final credit roll. <br /> <br /> Milius's direction is certainly adequate, but the script here is rather vague in his motivation. It offers story ideas and then leaves them to get the next story idea. Nolte is terrible when the soldier has become king, and is trying to outrage the spirit of Marlon Brando's colonel Kurtz. He speaks of freedom and the beauty of the jungle and the riches of his people, and you will not believe the words he speaks one second. He is often inadvertently funny, especially his initial jungle mistake, and he spends the rest of the movie sounding like a hippie. Nigel Havers spent the movie at Nolte, as he was Raquel Welch. The vague homosexual demise between the two goes beyond friendship, not really sex, and settles into an unspoken relationship the natives had to speak. <br /> <br /> Adulterers are often around and have an internal conflict, fired at Chief but in Nolte's attention. His fellow straight-dressed British soldiers will soon be the Bounty landing party in Tahiti, but everything I've seen about Borneo is that it's very humid and green. <br /> <br /> The climate treason where Havers give away Nolte's place is completely uncovered for no reason. There is no idea why Havers do this, except to keep the film going. I was angry, and then Havers and Nolte came on the same ship to the Philippines. The ship happened to run, and Havers walked to the container to free the freshly cut Nolte. Don't kiss goodbye, but Havers say goodbye to the king, who explains the title. <br /> <br /> If you fight a war and an enemy squad eats your allies, it will not disillusion you? This elite Japanese team is not shown enough, although their eating habits are so terrible, I will immediately become a conscientious objector. The same kind of ghostly enemy is much better handled in "The 13th Warrior." <br /> <br /> Other types of interesting ideas are dropped. What about the fact that modern technology causes the death of so many backward people? Why did King Nolte use the British to use his subjects without too much hesitation? Why can't Hollywood find a decent actor to play General Douglas MacArthur? <br /> <br /> In the end, "Farewell to the King" is a decay, not anchored by a strong lead, and trying too many things without thinking and exploring the options. I can't recommend this one. <br /> <br /> This movie was named (PG13) for strong physical violence, strong gun violence, some gore, some curse, some sexual references and adult situations.
