4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> A little amazing storyline with some ghostly type of "shocks" that doesn't really fit. <br /> <br /> Gary Oldham's performance is very volatile ... not so much the performance but the consistency. His character does not behave in a consistent way. Sometimes calm / relaxed / methodical / thoughtful, sometimes violent / hard / almost crazy. It's just not credible. <br /> <br /> Did many 80's movies date dated? Will they be more fun 20 years from now? <br /> <br />
