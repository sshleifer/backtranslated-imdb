Movie based on Jacqueline Susann's best-selling novel. It's about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law), a ruthless TV anchor that climbs its way to the top. It describes his love life which focuses on Amanda (Jodi Wexler) and Judith (Dyan Cannon). It also shows his total inability to commit and strike someone in the place of any woman he can get. <br /> <br /> The novel is not a work of art (it's not even good literature), but it's a quick, stupid, trashy read. But this movie makes it like "Gone With the Wind"! This is a manual example of how NOT to do a movie adjustment. First, they condemn the novel terribly. In the book, Stone's inability to commit is dealt with and it is revealed why. Here it is educated ... and ignored. There is also a really rebellious scene in which a woman is brutally beaten. It's in the book - but there's a reason completely out of the movie. And the book treated three women - not two. Don't start me first on the homophobia. <br /> <br /> Adjusting the play is pretty terrible. Law is just as horrible as Stone - VERY wood and boring - you seriously wonder why all these women are to him. To be fair - another actor was thrown, but had a very bad accident before the shooting started and the law took the last minute. Wexler is terrible like Amanda; Maureen Arthur is really surprisingly bad like Ethel Evans; Shecky Greene is unbearable as Christie Lane. Only three appearances stand out: David Hemmings (with a BIG time) camps it as a gay photographer; Cannon is really good and Robert Ryan is just fantastic. Also Dionne Warwick sings the catchy opening song ("He Moves Up"). <br /> <br /> It's bad, but I've watched the whole thing and it's (in a foolish way) fun. I give it a 3. <br /> <br /> Also Jacqueline Susann has a cameo as a newsletter.
