Here's what's good about "The Slaughter Rule:" <br /> <br /> - Ryan Gosling, Clea Duvall, and David Morse are all performing well. Gosling is, as always, beautifully outstanding. The places are often breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Here's what's bad about "The Slaughter Rule:" <br /> <br /> - Everything else. The writing is terribly confused. And while I definitely appreciate a good movie, this movie is just boring. Great performances can't make a movie with a silly performance and a script filled with throw-away lines that don't make it. To come just by the first hour has become a pleasure. <br /> <br /> I held it because of Gosling, but eventually I did myself a favor and changed the channel. Spoilers here brought the end to me. I didn't miss much. Do yourself a favor - if you want a good Gosling movie, look at the believer. <br /> <br /> My score: 2 out of 10.
