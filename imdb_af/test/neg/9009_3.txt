I tried to write a plot summary for a few minutes now and can't seem to. But with a movie as bad as Night of the Blood Beast, the plot doesn't matter. An astronaut accident landed and believed dead. His body is resuscitating later, but apparently the embryos carry a strange foreign life form. But how did they get there? And where is the stranger who has the strange creatures in May. John Corcoran's body implanted? <br /> <br /> IMDb calls the runtime for the night of the cattle at 62 minutes. Is that right? 62 minutes? It had to be longer than that. It was unmistakable to me. Even with the MST3K commentary (which was very funny), the real movie was much, much longer. And this is quite a snoozer from start to finish. I love many of these alien invasion types of the 50's, but not this one. It didn't grab my interest at any level. The baby strangers were too stupid to take seriously, the titular animal was pathetic, and none of the characters did anything to me. Add to that the usual low-budget Roger Corman steps and you have a real loser of a movie.
