Nickelodeon went down the toilet. They have children who say things like "O my God!" and "We are screwed" <br /> <br /> This show promotes hatred for people who do not look good or are not in the crowd. It says that sexual debauchery is good by girls beating the shirtless boys. Not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt. The main characters basically avoid someone extraordinary. Carly's friend Sam, who may be lesbian, knocks the snot out of someone crossing her path, saying it's good to be a b ** ch. This show has so much negativity that no one should see it! I give it a 0 out of 10 !!!
