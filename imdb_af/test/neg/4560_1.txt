The comment for Commune makes it a very interesting movie, of which I would be very interested. Unfortunately, the producers did not see it as suitable to include closed captions for hearing impaired and deaf people. It leaves me and many others like me, who are dependent on closed captions to follow a movie completely. <br /> <br /> It is inexcusable for any movie produced in the year 2005. In a world where all kinds of disabilities and disabilities are accommodated, it is filthy and ironic that the ever-enormous entertainment industry fails to demand that all productions and films be closed.
