I never want to see this movie again! <br /> <br /> Not only is it terribly bad, but I can't see my hero Stan Laurel looking so old and sick. <br /> <br /> Mostly I can't stand watching this horrible movie! <br /> <br /> First, there's no reason to watch this horrible movie. The plot is just stupid. The actors surrounding Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are really very bad and Laurel and Hardy are happier in any of their previous films! <br /> <br /> I warn you don't see it, the images will haunt you for a long time!
