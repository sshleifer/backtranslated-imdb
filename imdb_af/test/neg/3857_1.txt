I can't believe there are people who voted 10 for this garbage! Did any of you get access to a computer in the madhouse where you are undoubtedly kept, or is there a special colony where people in particular are in prison that I don't know? <br /> <br /> If I was to say what I really thought of this movie, it won't be published. <br /> <br /> Starting out with his 'star' is a talented idiot acting as a bad pre-personal by Jim Carrey, who has had enough hovering. Engel bumps his nose to give up the Sahara desert again. His name will be a total guarantee that I will not see a future film with him - even if he plays a rock hidden by a crowd. <br /> <br /> As for the plot. Another crime we can get to the Nazis is that they are so terrible that they can be regarded as a bad thing as a bad thing. mere criminals and murderers will have the audience on their side in a trick. <br /> <br /> To the people who made this movie - Give up making and submitting movies, then limit yourself to making ads, where at least your efforts have the virtues of being in the long run . <br /> <br /> Finally, a criticism of IMDB - Why don't you have the opportunity to vote for a movie? Or maybe not. To express my contempt for this trip, then I have to double double or something.
