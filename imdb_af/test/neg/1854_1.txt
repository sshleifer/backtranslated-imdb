It's hard to imagine two actors of such class and experience as Michael Caine and Michael Gambon become involved in such an embarrassing movie. The responsibility for this poorly judged production should be the author, Neil Jordan and director, Conor McPherson. I doubt I saw such a bad movie with so many good credits in a long time. The comedian, Dylan Moran, who made his mark as the irritated and incompetent bookstore owner in the TV sitcom, Blackbooks, becomes in the same routine here, except with so much residue and lack of comic control as making one. It is easy to see how the story could be made to work, because the situation is an interesting one and is loaded with comic potential. A classic actor (Caine) tries to hide the gang (Gambon and co) with the help of a clumsy wannabe colleague (Moran), with predictable results. It could and should have been good. Unfortunately it wasn't.
