"Hood Rat" is absolutely terrible. This is an urban version of "Willard". I just can't believe this movie was made, let alone spread. Someone in Universal Studios thought people would watch and watch this movie. The only good thing about this is Ice-T as the landlord. He was funny. <br /> <br /> The one thing I hate in movies is acting. Once or twice is bad enough, but the whole movie is like that. Each stage transition is a fast-moving special effect. The director should be prohibited from making films forever. <br /> <br /> Trust me, never see this movie!
