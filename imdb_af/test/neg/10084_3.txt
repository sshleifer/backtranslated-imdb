Tyra and the rest of the modeling world must know that real women like me and my daughter don't mind seeing all the ridiculous modeling to sell anything. Weird places, too much makeup and too much skin are not needed. Sex doesn't always sell when you sell to women. The same goes for the horse pounding runway that looks unnatural. People come in all shapes and sizes and they must have it on show. My daughter has a 36 cm input, is long and slim and a bar 5, I am more on a size 12. We would like to see both - I can't see anything on me looking like a friend 2 It doesn't wear it, it won't fit in the same way. I don't buy magazines because they are one-sided on this issue. We will really like the show to consider women of all sizes.
