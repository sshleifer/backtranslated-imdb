This movie is very disappointing for one who read the book. As written by Rafael Sabatini, it was a clean-cut story of piracy in the Caribbean, and that would have made a big move. Also, it would have been very easy to make. All the action takes place aboard the ship and on a deserted island. Unfortunately, the screenwriters took the title of Sabatini and threw away the rest of the book. Even the name of the main character has changed, and his peculiarity was quite different from that of the individual described in the novel. It is a sad loss for one who loves a good sea story.
