It was bad enough. I really hope there is no successor. Maybe it gives away some of the plot to let you know it's open to the possibility, but no, it's really not. <br /> <br /> There is really nothing special about this movie. Well, the special effect was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. <br /> <br /> There were some hot babies in her, especially Elina Madison and Alexandra Ford, but nothing to see people. PG-13, definitely not an R. It also tells you that the slasher aspects were less than spectacular. The head kick was the only thing that was unusual. <br /> <br /> Tame scarce rate.
