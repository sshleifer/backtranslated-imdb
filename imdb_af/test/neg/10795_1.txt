I've seen both the MST3K version and the unencrypted version. I rather enjoyed it. Anyway, it wasn't that bad of a movie. Sure, it sometimes moved a little slow. I liked it. <br /> <br /> As far as MST3K goes, they only had the movies they could get the rights to. Not all the movies tore them apart where bad movies were, it was just as easy to make fun of them. Take SoulTaker, for example. <br /> <br /> Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar's characters are so stupid and annoying, I can't help but laugh. I couldn't take them seriously. However, it really created a unique feeling. <br /> <br /> Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the screenplay. A world better than 95% of garbage in theaters today. Her role played well. Not to shout, not male, but just right. The camera likes her a lot in this movie. I would have thrown her into the roll after the script was finished. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie deserves a bit more credit than it's given. Please check the uncut version if you see the MST3K. It earns so much.
