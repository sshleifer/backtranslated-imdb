I can't explain what a garbage rubbish is this movie. As I really can't. it's just as bad. <br /> <br /> plot = crap acting = crap budget = so low it is legible <br /> <br /> Jesus, it's just the only good thing in this movie is the fact that the main character was pretty hot . <br /> <br /> The only people I feel that thinks this movie is good is the one that participated in the movie. I'm sure they're not the ones who funded it because there was no money in it. (HAHAhaha to the bit where the heads are sharpened) <br /> <br /> This movie has wasted too much of my life, so I'm not going to waste more time writing my review for it.
