"Yagyu ichizoku no inbo" (let's just say "The Shogun's Samurai") is somewhere between terribly boring and surprisingly painful to watch. As a historical epic, it could have had so much more chances to be a rich saga. But it's really just another cheap '70s action movie with a story about real-life events and an eye-catching sporty Sonny Chiba. Before this movie's halfway I was even asked to commit seppuku! The music is like a thousand dogs crying in your ears, to a song made by Ennio Morricone (it's not an insult to Morricone). The use of zoom lens cinematography is more appealing than captivating. And in terms of action it is nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and not-they-have not been shocked. What a terrible movie.
