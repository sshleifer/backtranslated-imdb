I usually like Casper in his movies, a real credit to STARSHIP TROOPERS. But the box cover on this video. At my local video, people who expect a (PERHAPS) sponsor like vampire hire, and instead get a bad repeat from Lon Chaney. It had great potential and fell very flat. Ireally think I could have written a better story line and screenplay. Why is it in EVERY science fiction film, they (the cast) constantly refer to a solar system as a galaxy? Did any of these writers or writers stay awake in the science class? It's my pet, but a solar system is a single star with planets, a galaxy is a lot of solar systems. It's like referring to a can of cake as a gross of six parcels. Let it sound even thinner.
