Ni√±as Mal is not a movie, it's a bad episode of a cheesy pregnant opera. <br /> <br /> The play is not a bit better in soaps, I think the author and director saw too many Mexican soap operas and can't try anything else. <br /> <br /> Give it up, go back to your soap operas so you heard. <br /> <br /> Stop our time and money and give a bad name to the Mexican film industry. <br /> <br /> It's NOT an OK or good movie, it's a mediocre soap opera!
