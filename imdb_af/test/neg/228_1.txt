The first few minutes of the cold and crusty Willis character were pretty pleasant, especially with Jean Smart, but it really did. It's just hackneyed great man and a little annoying kid stuff from the road back with no innovation whatsoever. I know the casting probably chose the child to show that Willis was just as annoying in his younger self, but I found this kid especially irritating and whinney.
