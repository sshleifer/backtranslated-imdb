It is definitely not worth spending money or time. It's the same cut plot of an old man and a girl who encounters and falls in love. But it's with a western touch. But it fails to either portray a love story or give it western touch. We never feel that the hero and heroin are in love. There is no depth to one of their characters. Probably, with a better throw, there could have been some justice to the characters. Lastly, it is a movie without fun, no acting, no theme, no plot, no comedy, no action, no excitement, no novels (I link novels to something more passionate). Definitely not a movie you want to go with your family. Overall, if you are looking for a movie with a little content, this is definitely not an option. I'll wait for the day when bollywood movies are something I can wait to watch and I can refer to my friends as a "must watch" movie.
