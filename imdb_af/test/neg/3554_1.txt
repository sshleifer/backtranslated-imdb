One of the most boring movies I've ever had to go through is completely formulated. Just cutting out a cookie from a movie, you can predict every scene in the movie just because you know the genre, because this movie doesn't add anything new. The dialogue is never funny, interesting or intelligent. The acting is weak and the soundtrack is annoying. It basically seems to have been done by an amateur movie maker. Nothing fresh, memorable or entertaining in this movie, combined with the fact that it is LONG, gives it an easy thumb. Sorry, fans. <br /> <br /> Overall Grade: F
