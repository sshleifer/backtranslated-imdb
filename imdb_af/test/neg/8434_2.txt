And one of them is bad movies. The title, as it turns out, refers to a killer of human variety, not fish. It is not the Dante-directed '78 'Piranha (which had the fish) and is also known as Piranha, Piranha. A trio of photographers, 2 men and a woman, make a local hunter / staircase named Caribe somewhere in the Amazon jungle. Unfortunately, they are not familiar with the movie resumption of William Smith, who plays Caribe; otherwise they would immediately know he was the villain of the piece. Smith may also have refused to end or cut out before filming (see end of comment). <br /> <br /> As mentioned elsewhere, this photo has many filler-long shots of the local game (birds) - and the central stem, a motorcycle race that has been running for too long. The reason why it gets a second star from me is, of course, William Smith, who can't really save this mud, but once again prove why he was a man 30-35 years ago if you needed a lot of nasty . villain; Smith can be really scary at best. He is the kind that might kill, possibly in a sadistic way, and you get the sense of the evil grin he usually sets when a mood hits him. Physically, he is very impressive, and you know the other 3 characters are pretty much damned within the first half hour. That was what Smith brought most of his roles; It looks hopeless to the other characters against this male monster. Unfortunately, the movie remains muddy until the end, as if a minute of footage has been lost - a confusing, incomplete climax.
