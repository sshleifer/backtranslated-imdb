1st watched 8/7/2004 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Brett Thompson): Silly, young-focused movie about three children put in their favorite cartoon with their parents' experiment. The writing left a lot to be desired in this Hanna-Barbara as rip-off of a few Saturday morning 'live action with people in dinosaur costumes kids show' with some goofy cavemen hanging. Nothing really to admire about this and to say nothing. I'm just surprised that I found it at a Blockbuster video store, as bad as it was and how the stores snatch old VHS movies. I think they couldn't even sell it, so back on the lease it went.
