A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a fatal young man. Not sure who was lost - the flat characters or the audience, almost half of whom walked out. <br /> <br /> Attempting artiness with black and white and clever camera angles, the film disappointed - has become even more ridiculous - as the play was poor and the plot and lines almost didn't exist. Very little music or something to talk about. The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo tried to find a song running through his head. He goes to a used record store to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two sales services before they get the album. Nice scene gave promise, but it went down from there. The rest of the movie had art, charm, meaning ... If it's about emptiness, work it because it's empty. Wasted two hours.
