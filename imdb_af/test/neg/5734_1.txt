In the mid-1970s, my NYC apt. built is finally wired for cable TV and since Showtime (instead of HBO) was the only premium channel that recently released movies, I reported it. As a writer and night owl in nature, I soon discovered that the canal appeared quite late in the evening and until the late morning I had never heard - most of them American independent films and foreign films that never had did not give an American scene release. Many of them have recognizable stars and fair directors, and thanks to Showtime, I discovered that many prospective movies I (and other Showtime subscribers) would never have had the opportunity to see. Most of these films were indeed "dogs," but often they were inadvertently hilarious. Onetime unveils Showtime a small Italian-made call, called "Redneck" (filmed in 1972, with a limited European release in 1973). Although the film has never been released in America, the MPAA rating is listed as "R". Since the director was one Sylvio Narizzano (the director who made his name with the glorious "Georgy Girl"), and the three leaders were Mark ("Oliver") Lester, Fabio Testi and Telly Savalas, I decided to try it . And I nailed my TV screen in disbelief for 89 minutes. As I recall, Savalas and Testi played two criminals, the former an angry maniac who, in a stomach-grinding scene, sent a German family to their death by plunging their trailer off a cliff and thereby to drop depths of the wilderness. So far, so bad. Then, Testi (like the "fine" psycho) and Lester (already 14 when the film was made) is seen, is the latest, in a man's room, Testi snowing at the child's body while shaving, and poor confused Lester fit on close-ups of Testi's naked buttocks. As an unfortunate member of the film industry, and a card-carrying liberal (I was so much against censorship as I am today), the whole movie made me angry (and in the early 70's when I thought everything had seen anything in it - go movies of the liberated era - including the rough version of Altman's "The Cold Day in the Park", a true jaw drop until it's cut for an "R" rating and would have spelled The end for Altman's career he was not later called something called "M * A * S * H". I wonder if anyone else except I ever saw Redneck and was terrible as I was. The actors and films that are audiences are extremely unfair. The filmmakers have been happy since the beginning of the day. But a highly respected and talented child actor (Lester) exercised a highly respected and talented action when he began to make the difficult transaction of child to adult actor. ") ... Mr. Narizzano, you have to put your head in shame. (By the way, I soon made friends with actors who appeared in Narizzano's future, incomprehensible efforts. They both despised him. Surprise?)
