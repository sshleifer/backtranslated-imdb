This movie is not that good at all. It is pretty stupid, very annoying and very weak. I really just saw this movie because one of my friends said they hated this movie. Although I didn't hate it so much, I still found it to be a pretty bad movie. The only thing that makes sense about this is that sometimes it was a bit of entertainment, and I also feel that if it was done a little better, it would be equally good. What I mean by a little better is that if it was completely restored, it didn't seem to have been shot for a movie festival, and if the script was improved, it would have been an old treasure movie. Instead, it's a crappy movie instead of what it is now. The play is horrible. I felt like I was watching some teens like a Halloween show or a Thrill ride or something. Death is pretty cheap (like the movie itself), and basically everything else is low class. In general, this movie is really bad and you won't miss out on anything if you decided to hit this movie. <br /> <br /> 3.8 out of 10 stars
