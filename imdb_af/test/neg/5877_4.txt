You can see if the movie is not directed by his brother, it is the best he can do. And sad to say, his best doesn't cut it. "Ice Cream Man" is a very bizarre horror movie, it's a real blast to see if you're in the right mood. In the wrong mood, it is known that people are being violently destroyed by loved ones, so please be careful. <br /> <br /> Clint Howard stars (Is there anything really Clint Howard?) As the "Evil", "Psychotic", "Bizarre" (Yes, everything is quotes, he is not quite any of these, but he gets close), an ice cream man who tortures the local kids with bumps that are really melting and chopped ice cream. people and dogs in them. Ick. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot is really an excuse to show off the ... well, the ... um, well, it's a plot. Oh wait, I know! This is an excuse to show that all ransom has come! There is Jan Michael Vincent and Lee Majors II (The successor?) As police who follow the illegal man's cream. And even Doug Lleyweln appears as a supermarket clerk. <br /> <br /> Better than that, some of the bizarre goofs in the movie are. I really like the fact that, for some reason, instead of appointing a fat actor to play the unlucky "fat" child of the group, this one child only wears under his clothes. And the whole assumption was that someone would throw ice cream from an ice cream maker with ice cream. Who buys ice cream cups from the ice cream maker? Then there is the whole psychiatric ward scene in which Jan Michael Vincent's play of moderate interest is bored beyond the state of consciousness. These are the policemen who also rub the ice cream's place for clues, but they can complete the iron truck (where, of course, the various bodies and such are kept). Oh, well, better luck next time troops. <br /> <br /> Howard himself overworked as he made sure people could see and hear two towns over him. This isn't all stupid. And pretty fun to laugh in the fine tradition of The Pumaman or Gymkata. You will have a good laugh with the right sense of mood. I love that one. <br /> <br />
