I love Half-Life. I'm still the fan. This was frightening, intelligent and challenging. I'm not telling news, it's one of the best FPS ever made. Maybe I'm too hardcore Half-Life fan but the so-called Half-Life 2 is not Half-Life 2. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: is this the next chapter of Half-Life? Perhaps the creators are -Valve so think, but I don't. Where are the intelligent enemies? Where is the frightening atmosphere? Nowhere. I believe they wanted to make Half-Life a little bit different (instead of another research station story), but they didn't just make a whole different one, they made something to do with Half-Life, such as Quake Doom. The whole game is so unsightly and unreal that it is almost lost. <br /> <br /> Although physics is really good and there were some good levels to play, the idea of ​​making a revolutionary physics-driven game has completely failed. If you get the Gravity gun, which can move objects, you can expect to use it as a weapon. This will change the schematic FPS game on its head. The truth is, you can't use Gravity gun as a real weapon. Why? Because the best you can do is throw boxes and barrels that don't hurt much. If you want to keep an object in front of you to protect, it can fall from about 3 shots. If you want to throw an explosive into your enemy, it can explode in your own "hand". The gravity gun doesn't work as a weapon. The best use is to solve physical puzzles. I ask Valve: Why? The truth is, you should use your boring, schematic FPS weapons to the end (except for the last level). Weapons are not the original Half-life, a classic. If Gravity gun were always on the last level - a real weapon - I would admire what Valle did. But not that. This is disappointing. <br /> <br /> So if you want Half-Life, you're looking for the wrong place. Perhaps you will enjoy it, but I repeat: it is all but not half-life and not even a faithful persecution. This is the biggest disappointment of all time. Valve has shown that they can also make terrible games. They did it.
