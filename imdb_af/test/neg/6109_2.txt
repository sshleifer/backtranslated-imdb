Here is a film that is clearly forbidden to be marketed as exotic for audiences not familiar with its subject. <br /> <br /> An attempt at clash of fiction and document, "Kadosh" falls damp between chairs. As a documentary, on the one hand, it is neither accurate nor informative. To realize the sloppy handling of detail, one should not go beyond the opening scene where it is very clear that the ultra-orthodox protagonist does not even know much about how to properly put his t'filin. More generally, the boring rot-style presentation of details (in this case Jewish ultra-orthodox ritual) is the role of a manual, not a good documentary; the latter must provide an organizing principle (a gestalt, if you wish) for the viewer, so that she may appear with a better understanding of the look. This is clearly not happening here, since ultra-orthodox ritual is still being made mysterious. The director apparently did a decent job explaining it orally during the film's release campaign; Kinetically, however, this is a serious case of stuttering. As a fiction feature, on the other hand, it suffers from flatness of character, simplicity of plot and bluntness of the message. On some points I felt like I was looking at a cartoon. (eg the wedding weekend play - without going into detail in angles, positions and dimensions ... well, technically it may not be a realistic depiction of human sex because it may be.) <br /> <br /> There are no subtleties in this movie. The clever manipulation of tips, which stimulate the viewer's imagination and thoughts to play an active role in the film, which I believe is a good feature, is completely absent. On the contrary, look at the movie I sometimes felt, as if it were repeatedly fed with the same chewing-up and striking content. It is, after all, as director Gitai himself in an interview, placed an architectural "shifting of objects into space", and then coloring the screens with the appropriate emotions when requesting and promoting the plot on his appropriate and predictable track . but the spark, the creative, showy, dark, unspeakable spark (let's not forget "Kadosh" is supposed to be a tragedy), that which casts on a two-dimensional screen, the game that makes it an extension of the viewer world , is missing without a trace. Perhaps a work of a visual engineer, perhaps of an unsophisticated ideologue; definitely not a real movie maker. What I saw was a passion game for animated issues rather than flesh-blood and complexity real people. The acting, in general, failed to outdo this direct flatness of a thought (sometimes even tortured) in film. A striking but relatively minor exception was that of the mikdame and the mother, both played by the excellent and seasoned Lea Koenig. <br /> <br /> It takes more than strict adherence to a winning formula (namely, a portion of exotics, plus heartbreaking but simple melodrama, plus a popular agenda, preferably politically correct) to defuse my interest cups. The bottom line here, all said, is that I was just bored for a significant portion of the movie. Despite the novel, perhaps even a pioneer of using an ultra-orthodox neighborhood as a movie set, for which Mr. Gitai and his crew deserve praise, I also found 'Kadosh'. Nadosh (Hebrew for "trite").
