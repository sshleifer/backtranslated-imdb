. . . And that's only if you like the eyes of a beautiful woman with jumping jumping around the so-called African jungle. There is therefore no problem for most men out there. <br /> <br /> I saw it as one of the bundles bundled together. Forget about the plot that is basically just a thin storyline to let our heroine flash her jar on the screen at every possible opportunity. Just to give you a sense, our heroine swings from the vine to the vine and climbs on top of animals at every possible chance, not to see you at all. Again, no complaints. <br /> <br /> The "scenes" are laughing and borderline on pornography. Our heroine was caught in the movie at least five times by the bad people. At times when she has to fight, "fighting" involves rolling around in the dirt, dissatisfied grounds and basically fighting like kittens. I'm surprised no hair pull is involved. It gets so bad that the chiefs had to remind the "fighters" that "I said, the one who wins first blood!" to prevent us from watching more stupid birds. <br /> <br /> Witch doctor Kuku was a bloody blast. From a big, cuddly bear in the beginning, he became depressed when he was caught and then, totally psycho. He spent all of the film-music lines without irrelevance. <br /> <br /> Except for Liana (our heroine) who reflects on topless, you also get many other Amazonians and one woman who decided to jump naked. Lake for no good reason to swim. Yes, it's that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Look at the beautiful Liane in her bouncy glory. Despite the fact that the film is more than 20 years old, the appeal of blonde women flashing their beautiful whims on the screen is never old.
