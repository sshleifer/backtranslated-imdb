Consider "I know everything" Action hero is a cigarette in the dark. While trying to hide the bad guys. (Probably giving a signal to say here, I'm coming) <br /> <br /> It's one of the 100 scenes you can laugh at. (I think the movie should be in the comedy category.) <br /> <br /> Terrible directing, horrible writing, bad action, cheap special effects. (They used a tunnel so they could hide there in the dark) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (it also makes me look at those pathetic errors)
