With the abundance of repetitive and derivative sitcoms that capture fall, summer, winter and spring roundings, it's a pleasure to see a show that is in more than one area of ​​fate. <br /> <br /> 'Earl' takes an unusual approach. It's not about the "daily mockery of an eccentric family" (zzzz ..) or the other boring things you see anywhere in sitcoms. The show is about this little white rubbish head (Earl) scraping a lottery card and recording big time. At that moment, Karma took it away from him. Overtime he learns that that unusual incident is probably due to all the bad things he did, so he puts on a mission in the wrong way he ever did. He has all his acts on a paper. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant point of departure for a sitcom. Fortunately, it landed in the right hands. Performing the performance produces extremely satisfying results: you get an innovative comedy that is actually funny and really touching. You can't help falling in love with Earl's sincerity and steadfastness, Randy's simple mind, good heart and observations of life, Joy's wild, flamboyant personality and Darnell's soft, chillin demeanor that gives him a lot of ease . <Br /> <br /> When you combine the show's innovation with its true humor, good heart, interesting characters and well-written dialogue, you really have a custodian. Of course, with such shows (and the incomparable "The Office"), NBC is on something. Did they finally release a block or two for quality assurance? Let's hope so. And let's hope for more quality shows like this will occupy the line-ups; show that we cease both TV viewers and NBC officials crying over the long days of NBC's golden days (Frasier, Seinfeld, Friends)
