Feeling of Minnesota, led by Steven Baigelmann, with Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio. The tense relationship between two brothers, Sam (D'Onofrio) and Jjaks (Reeves) is being pushed to break point when Jjaks comes to Sam. wedding and joining the bride, Freddie (Diaz), a former stripper, with Sam to pay a gambling debt to night club owner Red (Lindo). Baigelman's writing and directing debut is a frustrating mess, full of hate characters and lack of coherence. To put Keanu and Diaz in the same movie, at least some candy should be in the eye, but Baigelman even falls out at that point, refusing his actors little positive effect. Very weak.
