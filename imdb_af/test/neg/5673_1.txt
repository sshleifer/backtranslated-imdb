Look, I lost almost all hope in Nickelodeon after watching their latest hit, The Naked Brothers Band Show, and "ICarly" is no exception! If you haven't noticed, ICarly is now the # 1 hit tween sitcom on television! After hearing that, I decided to watch some episodes myself to see what the hype is about! I have one word to describe this show in general ... "EFFORTLESS !!!" I can't believe Dan Schneider is going to do this army and do something! IT'S BEAUTIFUL !!! Let me give you the details ... <br /> <br /> The ICarly strip starts with a girl named Carly Shay, played by Miranda Cosgrove! Carly, unfortunately throughout the episodes, doesn't really have a personality to speak like that! I think she's supposed to be the average girl in the show! (Because many people have an army veteran for a father, an artist for a brother and a popular teenage web show that is stuck and manufactured with thousands of dollars of equipment!) And to say the most about Miranda, her work is pathetic !!! She sounds like a 3-year-old girl with Tourette's syndrome at a high sugar half! <br /> <br /> Next, we played Sam Puckett (good GOD where do they get these names!?) played by Jennette McCurdy! Sam is the "CO-HOST" of Carly's webshow! (Wait a minute, if Sam holds Carly's shoulder, the show should not be called "ICarly and Sam?" I bet Sam feels she's been ripped off!) Sam is supposed to be the bully in the throw! (Yes, because every girl bully wears cheerful field shirts and pants with blonde hair extensions!) She also thinks I should be a tomboy too. I will find it a little funny, but it's her Cliché. PUNS WHAT RUIN IT !!! The "Give me a bucket of fried chicken" play is too much use, too much! Give this girl a letter !!!! and give her a coffee because I don't misunderstand. Jennette's play is good, but in half of the episodes she seems ready to fall asleep !!! <br /> <br /> Next we have Freddie Benson, played by Nathan Kress. Freddie is the technical manufacturer for Carly and Sam's show! There is not much to say about Freddie except the fact that he is a techno-geek and Carly has a loved one, who never works out! HERE, we're going with the Clichés !!! DO NOT STOP !!! Nathan's acting is also okay, but sometimes looks excessive! He is also for rent !!! <br /> <br /> Finally, and my favorite, we have Spencer Shay, played by Jerry Trainor! Let me make it clear; IF IT'S NOT FOR HIM, IT MUST REALLY DIRT CLUSTER OF A BEAUTY! Spencer is the one to keep the show alive! Spencer is Carly's older brother! If you had a little 5 years old that was both high on a caffeine and had constipation, you would have summed up this character! Spencer also deserves money to be an artist! (Hmmm ... I wonder ...) You'd think a professional artist would make promising sculptures ... yes, I just love sarcasm! HIS ART IS VERY LARGE EXTERNAL CRUISE !!!! I mean, what kind of sculpture name is MERRY SNIFFMUS !!? WHAT !!? THIS IS AS LIKE CREATIVITY AS A HILLARY CLINTON SPEECH ON DRUGS !!!! THIS IS STOP !! <br /> <br /> THE PLOT SETTINGS AND MORALS ARE LOCAL SAX OF POOP! These shows now tell kids who are stealing, lying and being an asshole for your parents is a good thing !!! IF THIS IS THE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT POWER, THERE IS IT IN THE CHILDREN, THAT I HAVE NOT HAPPY TO KEEP A PART. THIS IS BIGGEST POINT OF CRAFT I have ever watched TV! BAR NO !!! NICKELODEON, "I AM WITH YOU!" END OF THE STORY !!!! 10/01
