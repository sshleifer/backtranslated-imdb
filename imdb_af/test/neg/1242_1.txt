Maybe I'm here alone, but it's a crap show. I'm sorry, but I was lured when I found out about Lil 'Bill O'Reilly (which I haven't had any idea of ​​this show until months later and has honestly lost his appeal since) the show gave a fair shot. Spike is trying hard to make himself into something he is not, that is, he is trying to be human. Fox didn't even bother to hide the strings when they took him out of the coffin. His sketches are trying hard, he himself is not funny, and the authors struggle to write material for a non-talent host. There is too much good TV out there to waste your time on this show, and Fox ..... Fox has had good times, but you need to get your f $% * ing action together and get something original . to be just another "Me-too" network.
