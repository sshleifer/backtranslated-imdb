One day I thought to myself .... what is the worst thing that can happen today? I answered myself with a simple answer: "Oh, this has already happened. I hired Killjoy / Killjoy 2" on DVD. Well, what is there to say? The budget wasn't big enough to hire a police uniform, the film cut out sex scenes and dead scenes. There is one funny line I can remember, and the play is much worse than the first one. There is no lighting on the set (the forest) anywhere and the killer game known as Killjoy (which looks like Leprechaun like The Exorcist) is less than spectacular. This time he is not portrayed by Angel Vargas and he is completely changed as a character of a crazy, annoying fool, to another kind of crazy, annoying fool, who says a "CHILD" a lot. Somewhere between Freddy Krueger and a lawn ... this version of Killjoy lies. Somewhere between a pile of dirt and a pile of dirt lies Killjoy 2. This is bad value. This movie does not have a redeeming feature, except the song that is ultimately about the credits ... which gives leash some pleasure. Killjoy 2 is not even a movie, as much as an exercise in tension. Killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be considered as the worst movie I've ever seen. MINOR SPOILER ########################################### ????? ?????? A girl is locked in a wooden shed of some kind (perhaps an outbuilding?) When Killjoy enters a hole. He has a few small clogs (like those you can buy at Spencer's gifts) and he does something to them (maybe they get windy?!). Then he holds them in his hands and says a terrible line (which cannot be written on IMDB). From what I gathered at this scene (not from the movie shown), the teeth went into the outbuilding and killed the girl in an interesting but unfamiliar way and then returned to Killjoy. If I were that teeth, I would run. Walk far from Killjoy so he can never get his hands on me again. Killjoy 2 is hopefully the last Killjoy to endure. Even as a fan of movies, other people would say very badly. I think this "movie" can unite the human race and create world peace if it is promised that this film and everything we remind it will be destroyed. I give it 2/10 - simply because the creators managed to make the pictures move.
