It started out as a good sketch comedy. The first few shows were very good and I'm looking forward to a long term. What was really funny was the Mariah Carey simulation and the turnoff at Beverly Hills 90210 with the hair fights. The Delta Burke vs William Conrad heavyweight game was also good. Unfortunately, the following performances went down relatively quickly. The writing has become uninspired and o so predictable as if the performance gained a cult in its young office. Nothing fresh was offered and the repetitive sketch was boring. One example is the rifle family (or whatever it is called) that has become a weekly feature. This sketch was not so funny to start, let alone a regular feature. An example of a quick promising start then is a sudden fall.
