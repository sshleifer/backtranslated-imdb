I loved the book a little princess for most of my life and was very excited there was a movie. But I was surprised at this adjustment. Not only is the acting wood, and the plot is a winding mish-mash of various incidents in the book, but the theme is wrong. The real theme of the story should be that a girl can first be a princess if she does like one like Sara when she gives 5 of her 6 balls to a begging child, even when she is very hungry. The theme of the movie seems to be that all girls are princess, which greatly simplifies Sara's actions and looks more like they should be written on a Hallmark card than applied to this story. <br /> <br /> There are many other things that are wrong with this movie, too much to list, but here are just a few of the bigger ones: This story should be set in Britain in the mid-1800s , not America during the First World War. Miss. From the beginning, Minchen is Sara, who makes her actions worse when Sarah is left, much less frightening than she would be if she was sweetly sweet at the beginning, as she was supposed to be. Nowhere is it mentioned that Becky is black. Sara's father doesn't come back, he's dead. It is his closest friend, and co-worker in the diamond mines that Sarah finds, and restores her to her right place. In fact, the diamond mines are not even mentioned, although they are the source of Sarah's wealth. <br /> <br /> All through everything Sara faced, she always acts like a princess, giving what she can, and forgiving those who hurt her. She would never have called Lavinia a "creepy two-color bully". Such a thing is completely out of character for her and undermines the whole philosophy that she should be well behaved, no matter what. <br /> <br /> This is by far the worst fit of a book on the screen I have ever seen (with the notable exceptions of Ella Enchanted and Anne of Green Gables, the Continued Story). The plot of the book was written wonderfully and skillfully so I did not understand why the director felt it was necessary to change to make it interesting. I suggest anyone who wants to know this story should see the 1987 version, which is much better. Or read the book better. This will make your time worth more than the one and a half hours on this release on the movie mess.
