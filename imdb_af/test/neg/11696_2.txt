If I just looked at Acacia, I found that I had to agree with the negative reviews on this. I love Asian and Korean horror, and I had great expectations for this movie. Man, I was disappointed. Looking at it, I thought "they just do it to catch up with me later" and for a while I expected something skillful to happen. However, I realized the movie was really bad. It's the cheapest cash in the Asian horror market I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> The basic story may not be that bad, but the way it is filmed seems like it's the best plot ever. The tree as a "scary" device can be good when used smartly, but all the movie maker does, we give different shots of ... yes, a tree, over and over. He looks like he hopes the tree will do all the work for him in terms of tension and build-up, but it feels like it is: shots of a tree. For the sake of good! <br /> <br /> Slow upgrades can be very effective, and a movie that offers the viewer with only a few options of what's wrong can deliver good scares, but not Acacia. Certainly, we get a look at a child on a tricycle that disappears around a corner, and again, significant shots from the tree above or below, or the side, but these scenes are just not scary. They feel stupid, especially because you realize that the director makes them frightening. They are simply not. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the characters are ridiculous. In particular, the one character's 'descent into madness' is ridiculous. But what Acacia really breaks down is the terrible editing. It's hard to see why scenes were cut together like they were, but it's bad, and it kills any spark of interest it might have. It also makes me enchanted, because I can see what they are trying to achieve with that, but I can't believe they think I will fall so cheaply. <br /> <br /> There are many good Asian ghost movies, and very bad people, but it's by far the worst thing I've seen. They had to go through the list of 'what to put in ghost movies' and mark them all, but eventually they forgot to add the real movie.
