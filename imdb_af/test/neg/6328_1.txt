I caught this movie on late night TV. Honestly I have seen most of it, and all the time I have been completely and completely disbelieved. <br /> <br /> Is there any genre that is senseless as softcore pornography? If there is, I don't want to know about it. Softcore porn combines all the horrors of pornography (lousy production values, horrible acting, crappy scripts) with the ease of sex scenes in regular movies. So the end result is awake or entertaining. This movie also has a strange approach to a science-fiction environment, and it works terribly. All the sex is performed in a kind of virtual reality environment where the crew of the future learn about physical love. And yes, it is about as confused and silly as it sounds. <br /> <br /> But there must be positive points, right? Well, there's one ... Krista Allen is incredibly hot. It's about the only thing that was less than terrible in this movie. I don't know what it is about her, but she has a wonderful sexual appeal. The rest of the cast looks like the standard porn cast already. Rather unattractive women with poorly-shaped false breasts, and men who have spent too much time in the gym. Probably a gym in Germany, as well as changing and changing clothes. <br /> <br /> Summarizing things. If you enjoy Krista Allens' presence on the screen, you can look for the short moments where she shows her seductive potential (most of the time she tries the dialogue of the dialogue). If you don't enjoy Krista Allen, you can also stay away completely. <br /> <br /> I rate this 10/10 for Krista Allens sex appeal, 1/10 for everything and 2/10 for entertainment value as it is a unique crappy porn / science fiction hybrid that's not really like me yet ever seen.
