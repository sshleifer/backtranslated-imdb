I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just because I'm a polite person. This movie lost me 90 minutes of my life where I could do something useful to human or just me. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is poor, the actors never seem scared! Even if it's supposed to be a horror movie. For example, the scene in which Kurt collected the bones of his former colleague. He must be scared, but he looks pretty normal. The chick of the movie is such a clich√©. The one thing I liked about her was the dress she wore in the final scene. And by the way, the end was extremely predictable with the cocoon that cut pink in the box. In fact, I think more of an ant running on the back seat of the car. But it didn't surprise me yet.
