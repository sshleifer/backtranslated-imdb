It's by far the worst movie I've ever seen. It was a few years since I saw it and nothing has come close to it and I doubt that there is ever a movie that is as bad as that. It tries to make fun of a variety of movies, for example 'Nell' (!) And instead of funny it is just pathetic. Whatever you do, do not rent or rent this garbage, and if anyone throws it at you .... turn around and turn the other side !!
