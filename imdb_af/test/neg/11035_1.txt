Watch this movie with an audience of .... 5 in total! Had a choice between Lakshya and Asambhav ... (realized when I had to go to Lakshya). A typical plot ... India v Pakistan .. just not cricket, because you have Kashmir in the middle. An Indian superhero is on a mission to rescue the president of India from some Pakistani rebels involved in a mass-human smuggling missile. I left the movie halfway because it was just boring and the plot was confusing and over the place. The songs were terrible too, the film was trying to hide the mistakes with its special effects, but unfortunately they were also outdated. <br /> <br /> Overall ... avoid it if you can, be the worst movie. I saw this year.
