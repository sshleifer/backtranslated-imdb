This movie is a really low budget production, but I will say nothing further about it as it is already covered. I give this movie a low rating for the story alone, but I met the director the night I saw the movie and he gave me an additional reason to keep the movie. He asked me how I enjoyed it and told him it wasn't easy to keep. My main objection was the lack of foundation for the relationship between the two main characters, I was never convinced they were close. I also told him that the scene where the main characters were presented as children to become friends was too late in the film. <br /> <br /> He told me the playback scenes were not in the original script. The fact that they were added because he felt that I had done so did not get the two main characters near. He further explained that these scenes were not filmed to his satisfaction because they were out of money. I agree they didn't do much for the movie. <br /> <br /> Another fact about the movie, which I was not aware of, was the lead actor, writing the script on the basis of his own personal experience. This is usually a bad move as some writers do not consider the viewer's emotional response. The story is so close to home that the writer is over-assuming about the audience's response to his own tragedy. And the story is tragic. However, it didn't work for me, because I never dealt with any of the characters, least of all. What was offered was two evil people making a money, no matter who was hurt. When mrs. Young's character decides to give up his anger, it seems she does because she is ineffective, not because she knows she is doing wrong. If the movie has a message, I suspect that only the author is aware of it.
