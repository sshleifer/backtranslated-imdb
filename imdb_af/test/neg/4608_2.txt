I would have given this movie a 1, but I laughed so hard, so many times that I had to give it a little credit. In the shutdown, the film was supposed to be funny. A movie so bad, you will think chimps have written it. You would wish chimpanzees wrote it. Dialogue so canned that only that and the cockroaches will survive the upcoming nuclear helicopter. The film exaggerates its horror through interspersing scenes of the original Carrie (a very good movie) in scenes of this one. Like transfer scenes from Taxi Driver in Baby Geniuses. Don't rent it alone, as you will NOT enjoy the experience. You will need someone next to you to confirm the bad you are viewing. The worst actor of the Millennium goes to poor poor Amy Irving as the stone-colored, monotonous, disastrous school counselor. Worst movie of the year so far (see also _Arlington Road_). --FRINK 3
