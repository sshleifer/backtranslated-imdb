This movie is not a horror movie. There is nothing scary about it. This is more of a torture movie. And that doesn't make me sense, there are some plays with disappearing bodies. For the moment, he has wife in the beginning of the movie. It's turned away for a scene in the toilet with Nicole and she and she's completely gone. Then she killed the police officer to get him out of his misery and he disappeared. He must kill him in the head twice to kill him. I don't think so, especially if you can see his head. Half-blown and didn't kill him. ? At the end she set the killer's truck on fire. However, this is not in it. He stands behind her. Then it's cut to the rest stop completely rebuilt and some people are at rest and a new girl comes in and Nicole asks for help like the first girl totally no sense in this movie. Save yourself some money and skip this movie.
