This movie is absolutely horrible! I thought it had good actors in it, such as Gabrielle Union, Hill Harper, and of course the infamous Billy D. Williams. The film is long, and continues with a documentary style in which Gabrielle Union, who died in the movie, showed that she was talking about her family. which is incidentally a confusing family because you never know who is who and who is related to who. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, and I wish I could bring it back to where I came from. I fell asleep from time to time because of the boredom. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. It could have been more truthful with more drama and less boredom.
