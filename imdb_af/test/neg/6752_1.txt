they have to make terrorists look at this video as a torture, and not just for the disturbing final scene in which a woman with spiritual problems is beaten and beaten, apparently a source of comedy. About half an hour of this will even convince the strongest fundamentalist beliefs to waste the beans, rather than one more minute of this disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. I hired it because a friend said it was hilarious, just to find he was talking about the blowhard director who did the comments rather than the movie itself. I think if you find unbridled arrogance, funny, you'll love it. It is obvious that he is concerned about the chicks he is "afraid". The most tasteless example is when the main actress comes on the screen. <br /> <br /> Actually, CJ Stacy was the only good part of this movie - Her charisma shines like a diamond in this horrible bug. This is apparently the only movie she did in IMDb. I hope she is involved in theater or indie things, because I think she has the talent and natural beauty to really be an asset to any production.
