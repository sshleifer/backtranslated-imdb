"Death Wish 3" is the film equivalent of a shooting gallery. All the characters (except Bronson's Paul Kersey, of course) just exist to be murdered, either as "provocation" (the good guys) or as "retribution" (the villains). The director just throws the ceaseless violence (people are even burned and inflated alive), turning it into an urban version of "Commando" (and Charlie, like Arnold, rarely struggles to protect himself from the enemy firearm). Fans of this short thing (and apparently there are many) will enjoy it, others .... beware. (* 1/2)
