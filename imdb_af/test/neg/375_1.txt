This time the Beastmaster (Marc Singer) is just returning to see a new enemy Arklon (Wings Hauser). As a result of an annoying teenager (Kari Wuher) they are transported to the future where they then lead it. Many (lamb) fish from the water jokes occur. You honestly don't get this rotten to the core. Beastmaster 2 is a painful movie to watch. The references and "hipness" date the movie badly (It was made in 1991) and really who wants to see The Beastmaster in the present time? Also note is Wings Hauser, whose embarrassment is the best asset of the film. Singer seems uncomfortable, Wuher is annoying and the entire 1991 snake makes the movie straight. It's easily one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4- (terrible)
