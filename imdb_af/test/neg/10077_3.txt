(A possible inferior spoiler) The first "Jurassic Park" was an effective but silly movie that did it and was actually pretty good. The sequel "The Lost World" had a few decent moments, but it was ruined by the lame end of the movie that had a T-Rex amok in San Diego. Now in Jurassic Park III, which little story was in the first one and the sequel, it was thrown out of the window and replaced by just 90 minutes of basically non-stop action that would have worked if the movie hadn't been so poorly done. <br /> <br /> Sam Neill is back as dr. Grant, who is given a proposal by a couple (William H. Macy & Tea Leoni) to come with them to an island to help them find son, who has been lost for over 2 months. But of course this island is only populated by dinosaurs, and of course the plane they are going to just happens to crash and they let them flock to them with a bunch of dinos. <br /> <br /> This one, of course, was meant to be a thrill ride, with no real story whatsoever, but even at that level the movie doesn't deliver. Director Joe Johnston ("Jumanji") somehow managed to determine which little magic was left in the Jurassic movies and expressing life straight. <br /> <br /> The dinos seem okay, though now they're just top notch and not very scary. The bottom line is that it is not a very good movie, even as a thrill ride. * out of 4 stars.
