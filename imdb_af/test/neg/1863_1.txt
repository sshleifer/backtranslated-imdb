Ghoulies IV starts in a museum storage facility where PVC and leather-colored Alexandra (Stacie Randall) are looking for an ancient gem. After he ordered several guards, she approached the devil Faust, whom she worshiped and wanted to have sex. Unfortunately, she lost the jewel. so he is not very happy and commands her to get the last remaining one. It involves Jonathan Graves (returning from the original Ghoulies (1985) Peter Liapis) who is experienced in demonic possession and things like that after the events of the original Ghoulies. Alexandra proposes to find the jewel so that she can bring Faust permanently from the 'other side' to the Earth, well, I don't really know. Erm, it's really about ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Jim Wynorski whose many names are the backbone of my spine when attached to a movie. I'm wasting 90 minutes of my life on Goulies IV. is as I expected complete, complete and complete crap from start to finish and it is as simple and straight forward as that. The ahem, "script," cough, by Mark Sevi, has virtually nothing in common with the other Ghoulies movie except in the title. And they managed to persuade Liapis to repeat his role, which may also have the added bonus of using footage. of the original although not at all relevant. The story is almost nothing, the whole movie is a real job to look at, it's incredibly boring and moronous, it's slow, it's predictable, it's squeaky clean as far as blood or gore goes and it has two comic lighters what I accept. supposed to fill the Ghoulies quota, although they look nothing like what they did in previous films and actually just embarrassed to look, I actually think they are practicing to be ventriloquist during most of the movies, like when they don't move their mouths ... You know I don't want to talk or think about Ghoulies IV anymore, so believe me if I say this is a big piece of khaki elephant-size relationships, don't waste your time or money no. br /> <br /> Dirctor Wynorski turns into a thorough rotten movie about every level, the special effects are horrible like the whole movie. Apparently Ghoulies IV is meant to be a kind of horror comedy, but it misses both targets through the proverbial miles and it's not funny or scary. The best thing about this movie is the actress Randall in her PVC and leather outfit running to find the gem and it's hardly worth seeing through this garbage. There is a half decent runaway car scene with a few crashes, but it seems to have worked out in a completely different movie and given Wynorski's track record. I'm sure it was. Forget about any gore as there isn't. <br /> <br /> Technically, Ghoulies IV sucks, it is obvious that it has a low budget, but it's simply not an excuse that it's so bad. Liapis is back in the cast, though he probably wants him to stay away, PVC-dressed baby Randall is easily the best thing about this movie that many say. <br /> <br /> Ghoulies IV is a bit, there is nothing else to say really. I honestly can't see anyone enjoying movies, get anything out of it. I just can't. I can't believe I would recommend the original Ghoulies about anything, but it is going to happen now, even though it is so good, it's a hell of a lot better than Ghoulies IV, one to avoid people and you can me thank you later. The things I go to, you shouldn't be honest ...
