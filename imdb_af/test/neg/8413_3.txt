For a movie that has received so much recognition and judges this spinoff to "Rosemarys Baby", one big mistake is. It starts with the fact that Andrew / Adrian, regardless of his name, is so confused that he doesn't know who he is anymore, walks away from a cult with his mother and is soon kidnapped by a strange woman who eventually take care that she was his mother. The play is horrible as Andrew grows up in his twenties and looks awful with his sunken face, and never ends with grin and Dukes or Hazard clothing. He looks more like a drunk than Satan's son. In fact, it's all he does, drinks and falls completely over himself as he tries to get hold of his past and the last memory of his mother driving on a bus screaming at him. He finds a friend who looks like an angel, but he is quickly killed and electricity in a hilarious scene in which he looks more like a Christmas tree. Andrew gets bought and the cult with the first part members tests him to see if he really is Satan's son. His dumb self fails the test and climbs on the altar that shines with my-make-up and jumps from the stage of a nightclub and dances like a clown on crack !!! This scene is unforgettable and worth a watch. The end is terrible and somewhat predictable in light of how stupid he is in the whole movie. Do not see this piece of trash or you will lose respect for the first part.
