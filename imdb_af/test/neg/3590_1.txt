I evaluated this movie a 1/10 and did it in good nature. this movie is not as it seems and i don; t get the point. Take the first joke for example. They are that sign at the beginning to start. Well, it was OK, but then they started talking about the hood and then he died, they are the other guys who talk, then he dies after the other guy, people say, they will not birthday with their birthday no. and now he gets a cake. then he dies. <br /> <br /> The jokes are just stupid, they're not; it is smart and i would have thought they would have been better off somebody like the directors of scary movie: <br /> <br /> Shawn Wayans (written by) & Marlon Wayans (written by) & Phil Beauman (written by) <br /> <br /> But it sucks and I jump next time they want to make another comedy, they make good jokes, not lame.
