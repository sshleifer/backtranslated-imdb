This movie was such a waste of my money. it was both disgusting and disturbing. Honestly, I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Who thinks of a movie where a girl blows her dog? serious ... it was a waste of my time. I kept looking at the movie, hoping it would get better and a plot would come out, but it never happened. I'll review the movie an F-. This movie had to be classified R for its disturbing nature. I will never allow children of any age to see this movie. this movie sucks. this movie is terrible. this movie was a waste of my time. I could have spent the night making my time worthwhile instead of renting this movie. This movie was a waste of gas to come to the store and definitely a waste of two dollars to see it. pretty much, no one should watch this movie. this movie must be banned and burned.
