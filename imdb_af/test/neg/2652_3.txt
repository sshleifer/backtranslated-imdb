Two things - too long and totally lacking in credibility. This movie didn't make sense and was excellent to go through. I'm usually pretty patient, but man ... It doesn't keep your attention! I think I'm nice here too! You keep thinking it's almost just to find out that it's still half an hour! Good actors.
