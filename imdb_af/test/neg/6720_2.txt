Three words: What a hope ..... Two words: Don't bother! One word: sucked! There are no reasons to see this movie. Even these Seagal groups should be ashamed of this movie. The martial arts, the typical Aikido, are terrible. The martial arts move themselves are good, but cinematography is pathetic. The movie is actually slowing down as Seagal gives its victims to its victims. Even worse, the same movement shows three times in rapid succession from three slightly different angles. How stupid. Seagal's play was simply silly, but I still give the movie a "6" for acting because of the supportive role the "rogue" roles were actually entertaining. <br /> <br /> The plot is just stupid. Seagal is playing a Federal Express agent with a license to kill. His character also has that dedicated work ethic which means that all his packages are delivered to the right people on time - at no extra cost - and nothing is in his way. Not an assassin, political leaders, explosions or even death. <br /> <br /> I expect a certain level of violence in a martial arts movie, but there are several scenes in this movie of random and horrible acts of violence that lend themselves in no way to promoting the movie or his story. There is a reason why this movie went straight to the video and there are many reasons to avoid it. No one should clash with these trips. <br /> <br />
