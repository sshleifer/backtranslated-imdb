In spite of a good soundtrack and the presence of the incredible Rappaport and Woods, it is still one of those moronic comedies where New York throws him into a bid by the writer and / or director to show what a good place. Yes, there are other things in the movie that also suck, but that's important. The trend for independent filmmakers in New York seems to be: "I don't need to be talented, I have NEW YORK!" Okay, to be honest, the movie has moments. The backlash on why one man named Wacky Jack was pretty amusing. The writing is not a story or a plot, it is a bunch of non-good scenes linked together by having the same character. <br /> <br /> One of the worst things is that there is no motive behind what the characters do. Uncle Sam, does the child have the drugs, why? If so, why didn't Sam do it himself? Then the main character lays his ass in scene to scene with absolutely nothing to get from lies. The man falls in love with a flight attendant, and none of them has any reason to fall in love. The characters are a lot of pioneers for the writer to move around to see if he can do something. <br /> <br /> If you are easily amused or watching bad movie films, because they make you feel smarter than watching bad mainstream movies, watch it. If you want to see a GOOD light crime movie look, then Takeshi Kitano's "Brother" looks. "Kick In The Head" is the perfect example of why so many people hate fast-paced movie films: a bunch of them. And a note for the director: Don't be afraid of exchanging, entertaining, relieving or entertaining the audience from time to time. Being boring does not make you a better movie maker than those who can interest me.
