In the light of the encomie of praise for this movie of viewers, I must again accept the role of the turd in the punchbowl, as Lowell Weicker said, I scratch my head on the sheer number of noisy comments. "The African Queen" is not. The period fragrance is wonderful, yes. The play is good, but no actor no matter how good it can bring life to the seemingly endless stream of perfectly boring and insignificant party and dinner table conversations here and I don't care how much it is taken from Joyce's text. Imagine spending half an hour as a fly on the wall on a Christmas dinner from a particularly interesting group of people (it is not clear to me that this is a family like one suggested) and you has the essential experience of this movie. Absolutely nothing happens. And nothing important is said, but it is said at intermittent length. As I said, the popularity of this movie is a mystery to me. Talk about mysteries, rather than good ones.
