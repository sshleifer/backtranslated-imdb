An interesting point of departure, and Billy Drago, is always good as a dangerous nutshell (side note: I'd like to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a movie, talk about angry cheekbones!). The soundtrack was not terrible either. <br /> <br /> But the acting - even those of such professionals such as Drago and Debbie Rochon - was terrible, the direction worse (perhaps contributing to the former), the chimpanzee dialogue, and the camera working, barely tolerant. Yet it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my oy-vey scale. I don't know where it was filmed, but I would like to make a guess, it would be either an open air museum or one of those re-movement villages, where everything is just a little too well maintained to do more than set the "rights" old west "for. Okay, so it's shot at a college's child's budget. That said, I could have forgiven one or two of the above errors. But all together, and I was generous, I couldn't give it more than three stars.
