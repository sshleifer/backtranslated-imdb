Special sneak previews are always a good time. No matter what movie it is you see, the theater will always be packed by people waiting for the movie, like free stuff, think it will be something to do or just get lost. Anyway, how good or bad the movie, the audience alone makes it enjoyable. Now that the movie is a PG-13 pseudo-horror movie (can you really dread when the MPAA is on your back and everything censors?). You know there will sound, laugh and breathe. With the messengers, the crowd did not disappoint to give numerous characters to the characters on the screen. Regarding the real movie, I feel sorry for those involved because it could have been really better if it was right and allowed to extend its legs to the fright-to-black / show after progress these movies have. In the end, we are shown a boring wrestling story with no surprises and a few moments of real tension. <br /> <br /> The story is a common one. A family is moving from the big city to the country after a traumatic event trying to rebuild their relationship with one another. Once established, the spirits of the home come to the reformed troublemaker child whose past makes it even easier for the parents to tell everything they have told. Of course, the child is not a wolf who is crying, and those who surround it just find out when it is too late. I will presumably re-confirm the Pang Brothers (directors of the award-winning The Eye that I would like to see more than what they can do without Hollywood interference.) The messengers were done by someone else, but the brothers retained credit It is a pity that our studio system does foreigners, especially when it was creative independence that made the films they bring in and not underlined interference), to really have an appropriate style and to keep the tired plot line slightly fresh. Unfortunately, however, I must also acknowledge them for the almost unbearable inertia. Similar to why I didn't like what Lies are under, I couldn't stand the stretched tension that went so far to make it laughable. When our heroine and her brother stand behind them with a ghost, the scene lasts about eight minutes with only static, strangely composed close-ups and depth of field-focus changes that eventually climb to absolutely nothing. To be just 84 minutes, I almost think it would have been better, even shorter. <br /> <br /> In addition to a very effective opening series, with the fantastic Jodelle Ferland, who plays a boy strangely, and a good atmospheric credit sequence, the only thing that saves the movie from total garbage is the play. Apart from Penelope Ann Miller, who first made me wonder what happened to her and then, after a few scenes, I understood why I never asked the question in the years she was absent, and Dustin Milligan, who was not credible at all. acting is very strong. Dyan McDermott does a good job as the father tries to keep his family together through all the difficult times. He has many small moments of light comedy to counter his serious, dramatic role. William B. Davis (everyone's favorite Cancerman) is used effectively as an almost precarious character, unfortunately no longer used. Our true stars are Kristen Stewart and John Corbett. Stewart plays the emotion very well and shows a promise as an actress with this and Panic Room on her resume. As for Corbett, if he didn't pull out his role, the whole movie would have completely unraveled. I wish he would get more work than I enjoyed him since the undervalued series "The Visitor"? I still have to check his first role in "Northern Exposure", a show I haven't done yet. able to catch up. It is a pity that he will probably be the most recognizable for over-estimating My Big Fat Greek Wedding. <br /> <br /> As a matter of fact, the messengers gave me a good introduction to the Pang Brothers work and my desire to check out Chinese horror catalog. The mood and performances were there; It was just the simple and rude story that needed far too much padding to make a movie. Throwing more into other characters, rather than just Stewart's, could have been more effective while showing nothing more than ten minutes. If our protagonist is the only one to be attacked, there is no tension as to how far the creatures will go to hurt her. The moments of danger had no gravity for them, and in the end it was just like filler. However, I am excited about the free comic strip that is given away to the special screen, for hopefully the medium will allow a faster temple story to be surprised before it tries to surprise.
