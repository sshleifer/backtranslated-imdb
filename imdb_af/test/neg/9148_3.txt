The positive: It is well shot. Have some interesting peripheral characters. Equal main character (though weak). <br /> <br /> The bad: Plot / story. Editing. Characters wasted. Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of juicy movies, but this movie is badly intrusive. I don't understand how anyone can hand over $ 12 million to this Guy Jenkin. And before I go further, I just want to say that I don't like Jessica Alba. I really wanted to keep her in this movie. However, Jessica Alba in her fake accent and her model made me unhappy. She has absolutely no screen presence in this movie, and she destroys every scene she enters. The romance doesn't come out as credibly (not even a little). <br /> <br /> Everything I've seen throughout was the actors flashing their wings, trying to get this thing off the ground with how little they were given - but unfortunately, all this movie is sinking. There is no emotional connection, no emotional conflict and nothing is gained. It's a nice blank movie.
