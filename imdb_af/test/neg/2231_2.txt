I hired this movie because I knew it would be bad (I only saw one good Disney successor and it was toy story 2), but it went far below my expectations. I'm a death fan and I don't believe in sequels with Disney movies. For someone who has not grown up with the classics (whether they watched when they came out or hired them since birth), this is a cute story. I just feel that the plot was dragged a bit too much and was predictable. The one thing that most annoyed me was the voice of the girl children of lady and tramp. They were pitched too high. Although most reviews say it's not that bad, I think if you're a real disney fan, don't waste your time with this one. <br /> <br /> Hopefully Disney won't follow any of the other classic anytime soon.
