Am I ready to think I saw the same movie as everyone else. This movie was terrible. I am a fan of all 3 series of gentelmen league and have always respected the originality of the authors, even if the format has changed in series 3. However, this movie was a blatant half attempt, the plot was extremely poor with the characters going in the real world, making this movie more like the last action hero. There were about 5 moments in the film that had a soft visit, but for the rest of the time I wished it would end. It would have been better than a 10 minute short on the DVD. It was more of an explanation of what they were planning to do, and it seemed as if some of the authors differed on the fate of the characters and made a joke by killing him in the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you are a real fan of the human race's ability to stay fresh, you will hate this movie. If you just watch, because there was nothing better on TV, then you will love it. <br /> <br /> someone makes me back !!
