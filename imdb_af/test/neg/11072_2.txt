What a shocker. For starters, I couldn't stand the constant, screaming and noisy panic all the time. It didn't scare me, shocked me or made me sympathetic to the characters; it was simply irritating. The rugged camera movements were also annoying. The plot was the same as almost every other cheap horror. There were some pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work in the rest of the plot. And then there is the end. I'm not really sure what to do about it yet. I think it was supposed to be smart, then the light shed light on the situation, but it was just stupid. <br /> <br /> The case had some of the little winners / nomination symbols on it, so I guess it can't be bad. I was wrong. If you see it, just put it on the shelf.
