As the characters start with "Unknown" identities, they are not identified by name, so start with the handsome James Caviezel waking up in a warehouse. He finds out the place is locked up. Don't ask - the windows are made with safety glass, and it's impossible to get out. Four other waking men make it a quintet - Mr. Caviezel in his "Jean Jacket", Barry Pepper in a "Ranger Shirt", Greg Kinnear with a "Broken Nose", Joe Pantoliano as a "Bound Man" chair and Jeremy Sisto shot and "Handcuffed Man". Oh man ?? <br /> <br /> These five men have collective memory loss. They think three of them are kidnappers, and two are victims - but they don't know who is who or who is who. The forgetfulness is due to a pipe leak. Don't ask - it happens. Meanwhile, chief executive David Selby (as Parker) sent his police to solve the kidnapping while one of the men's women, Bridget Moynahan (like Eliza Coles) was waiting. But the criminal element's gang leader, Peter Stormare in "Snakeskin Boots" is also on his way to the scene. <br /> <br /> As the DVD summary says, "As secrets are revealed and clues unraveled, men) have to jump in time to find out who is good and who is angry to stay alive." unfortunately reads much better than it looks on film. When the secrets are finally revealed and memories become clear, there is not much interest in what has happened. Simply, director Simon Brand has a good point of departure with Matthew Waynee's idea, but they invest light investment in the characters holding the short end of the stick. <br /> <br /> **** Unknown (11/1/06) Simon Brand ~ James Caviezel, Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear, David Selby
