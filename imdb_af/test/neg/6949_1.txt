Terrible, waste of time. There is no camp or rubbish in this one. See better amateur movies done by 10 to 12 year olds in movie clubs. How can anyone spoil film about vampires and lesbians? <br /> <br /> It is not a movie to combine and just shoot a few vampire / sadomasochism enthusiasm in a room. <br /> <br /> Nothing good about the movie. There was no plot, no real actors, no real special effects, no humor. A few overweight guys touching each other can't be called a sex scene. Nothing. <br /> <br /> Well, cemetery was nice, but you had to make a vampire movie in the dark. <br /> <br /> Purpose was probably good: make a garbage film in a spirit of Ed Wood. The problem is that you can't deliberately make a bad movie. It requires talent and an effort to make a "real" movie. Ed Wood may have had money, but he certainly had trouble. These guys lacked everything. Ed Wood was a genius compared to these guys.
