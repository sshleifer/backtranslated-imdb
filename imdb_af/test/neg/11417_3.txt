To put it simply, it was a quirky piece of dog pop. Too many stages and everyone is the total melodramatic drama queen at any moment. After a while, I began to wish every character in the movie wasn't such a stuffy anal retention. <br /> <br /> And this movie still has one of those really annoying things that has recently come in fashion and shouldn't have: all the screens are in some sort of washed out, blue-steel gray. Hmmm, the last time I checked in, candles and flares are quite capable of placing quite a wide spectrum of colors. In fact, the light they protrude is likely to be more in the hot, yellow-orange spectrum. So where does all the blue-steel gray light come from? <br /> <br /> This movie has fancy sets and shines cgi fx, but it's still drunk. It is pathetic junk that is challenged for today's movie goers who are easily placed by pathetic junk. <br /> <br /> I enjoy a lot of vampires and werewolves as movie plot devices, but it was a total hack job. <br /> <br /> Universal Studios' 1941 "The Wolfman" is infinitely better than that, even though its fx is pretty primitive compared to what can be done today. <br /> <br /> I've finished this franchise. The first movie was pretty decent. The second still somewhat entertaining. But this one I couldn't quite finish until the end, because it was so boring.
