I won't waste your time describing the plot for this, the other reviewer has done pretty well. However, I will give you my opinion of this movie. This movie is basically anti-Japanese propaganda. The Japanese are portrayed as incredibly malignant assets that have no respect, as well as having poor martial arts skills. (Groups of Japanese men get asses kicked by single women on more than one occasion.) The fact that Japanese fighters are losing almost every (if not every) battle in the movie takes away the tension. The plot is actually pretty solid and perfect for a kung fu movie though. The problem lies in the fact that there are not many battles. When there are battles, some of the battles are pretty good, but other scenes are badly choreographed. One scene angela mao takes up six Japanese in a church and kicks all their asses. The problem is that they show that they fight them one by one when they all attack simultaneously. I collected this movie was incredibly cheap considering how cheap some of the sets are. They use the same village when they are in Korea and when they are in China without changing it at all. However, some scenes are filmed in the right places and they look good. Overall, the only real problem with the movie is its slow and uninteresting. Since there are few fighting scenes, we have to rely on the plot for entertainment and, well, I was not entertained. <br /> <br /> one and a half stars out of four
