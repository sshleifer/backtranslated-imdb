And again, I find myself in the minority. <br /> <br /> I didn't like this one. This is the only Varney work I didn't grasp, including Knowhutimean. Slam Dunk Ernest pays the credit to be the worst of the line, but it is a clear contender for that dubious title. <br /> <br /> This work is too rough and too basic to love. Charity was one of Ernest's key components, and this element was completely lost in this. Unfortunately, most people think it's the best of the line, but if you love the essence of Ernest, Ernest, you will realize what I refer to about fifteen minutes in this work. It was too blatant to be fun. <br /> <br /> It's a 3.5 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
