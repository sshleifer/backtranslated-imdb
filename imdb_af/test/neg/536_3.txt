This movie ceases mainly. The only reason I gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi-charming. It is totally negative for a plot and the lack of even insignificant character development made it seem like a lot of nice drawings. This is by far the worse anime that came from Japan. I can't believe they actually put their names on this garbage. What a rip off sells this thing for $ 20. If you haven't seen it, bother. If you have, I'm sorry for you.
