I broke my own line to buy this movie from Walmart's $ 5,88 bin. Basically, if a movie has a big star in it, and you've never heard of it, it's usually for a reason. Well, in the case of this movie, the reason is because it sucked! They patch Sandra Bullock's photo and call the entire cover of the DVD as bait, and this has corrected this little vision. I thought it was the disk to charity, or give it to the library, but I don't think I want to subject someone else in the world to this movie. Worst lines: "What do you mean by lower friends?" "What do you mean to your father?"
