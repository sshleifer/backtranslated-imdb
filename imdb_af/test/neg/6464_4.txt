Not long ago I bought a cheap VHS band, entitled "Just Rambling Along", probably Laurel and Hardy. Knowing their output and not recognizing this title, I made the painful decision to share with a whole dollar and buy it. When I played it, I identified the movie as HOP TO IT. Of course, Mr. Laurel was nowhere in the throw, which deliberately mislead the packaging of this product. Worse still, the quality is terrible. It seems to have been dumped from an 8mm film source. It had a somewhat appropriate musical score. Actually, in all seriousness, the band is worth the money if you just want to get an idea of ​​what the movie is like. In my opinion, this is a decent but unavoidable short. IMDb should just add RAMBLING ALONG as an alternative title for this movie, which was incidentally the name of a 1918 Stan Laurel movie!
