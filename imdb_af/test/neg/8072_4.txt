Cuore Sacro combines shiny film effects with a lot of things to be desired. With a script that the authors of "Touched by an Angel" may have regarded as indignant, Ozpetek still keeps us interested. In fact, I wanted the positive focus, but I found the last act so shockingly bizarre and terrible that I think the couple who initially jumped to their death could be the lucky ones. <br /> <br /> This movie is at heart (pun intended) a story built on a great twist-style end. This kind of turbulent foundation can lead to a tremendous success such as Tornators' Una Pura Formalità or a terrible rubbish like the films of M. Night Shyamalan. Cuore Sacro is somewhat closer to the latter. I have generally seen cinematography in general. The detective shot of Irene who did her quotidian rounds in the pool was very impressive, as the atmosphere witnessed through the inside of her mother's home. For me, the large-scale parody of Michelangelo's Pieta when Giancarlo comes from the rain and Irene is with him is a bit of a piece. One major problem I made in this film exception was Ozpetek's method of turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions. It worked out great in Facing Windows, but if it works here, it seems that Bubolova is not a Mezzogiorno. In fact, besides the ridiculous story, the main problem with this movie is the greatest achievement of the main character. This made the final breakdown scene even more unbeatable. <br /> <br /> In this movie Ozpetek continues his crusade against our corporate-driven societies by requesting us to be more spiritual (not necessarily religious) and more altruistic. And while I'm definitely one that is very sympathetic to this view, I felt as if the audience was banging over the head with a blunt object. Could the characters be more two-dimensional? I tend to find this movie very ingenious and silent. Was the "evil" aunt Eleonora anything more than a caricature? It's also for the people on the side of "right", like the "good" aunt Maria Clara and the elderly gateman Aurelio. And only if we missed Ozpetek's point, he decided to hold his opposing powers in their own deliveries. <br /> <br /> This brings me an interesting point about the director's use of color. He clothes the opening couple who are briefly fleeing in all black, as well as Irene (when we first meet her and after her life conversion), the evil aunt Eleonora, and of course the good but confused Padre Carras. Black is a color that represents a definite course, the wearer's mind is set and emotional. It's the color of choice for that indispensable item of contemporary weapons, the bag. It's also the mourning color, like the funerals played by the suicidal duo. Finally, black is the color of piety, such as the simple clothes of priests and nuns that emulates Irene in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> The other main color, and a very appropriate choice for a movie about the holy heart, is red. It is a color that has an extremely inherent emotional component. The character wearing red is bold, emotional, receptive to new ideas and indulgent. Red is a risky color in modern times; It challenges our perceptions of the carrier and at the same time makes the carrier vulnerable. Nevertheless, red carries a great deal of history and mysticism, as the earliest members of Cro-Magnon's man buried their dead in red ocher. Indeed, the first man named in the Torah is named Adam after the Hebrew word for red. Red also has an anachronistic flavor, looking back to the past where red (and by association a less self-driven attitude to life) was more accepted. So when we meet the red-filled room (the mysterious frieze-covered walls with a red accent menorah and a red painting of a Whirling Dervish!) Of Irene's mother, the "good" characters have Maria Clara and Aurelio a brilliant outfit of red. finally the painting of Irene's mother in a formal red gown, we can see where Ozpetek's sympathy lies. <br /> <br /> A word or two about the soundtrack, I perfectly suited the original musical themes to the story. Irene's quasi-Baroque theme was great for his monotony and sense of resting malaise (the absolute best use of a continually repeated Baroque theme as it should be in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, with his masterful repetitions of an 8 bar sarabands attributed to Trade). An absolutely inspired choice was a few seconds from an opera aria that we heard as the power flashed while Irene Benny chased the house. It is from the famous aria "Ebben? ... Ne andrò lontano" from Catalani's opera "La Wally". The aria is sung by the main soprano who leaves forever. Since Irene's mother was a dramatic soprano, we can guess it's a recording of her song and she says a terrible farewell to her daughter. As in the movie, Irene is planning to never see Benny again. I have only one small issue of the soundtrack, why does the famous tango include Yo Soy Maria? I love the song and could always hear it myself, but it didn't really fit here.
