This short review does not contain any spoilers, as the movie is spoiled. These are wood and pedanties. It has no salvation grace whatsoever. If someone invites you to his house to look "Mr. Empire", don't go. Even the title of the movie is terrifying and tells what rubbish is. The whole plot is so bad that it can drive Mother Theresa to despair !!! It wasn't a stroke that led to the early demise of poor Ezio, but it had to act in this clover. He had to haunt him for the rest of his days. Perhaps he was an enemy alien and wanted revenge on the Americans for his birth. He found a perfect vehicle for his anger in this travesty.
