We see Thomas Edison, with a glowing smile on his face, to explode a 5 ton living creature. Eventually he was successful, and so the first animal snuff film was born, cleverly disguised as an incredible technology performance. This is scientific arrogance among the worst people. It is there with the doctor who overpowered a monkey to prove that he can hold his cut off for 22 minutes. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is the absurd excuse that the elephant was convicted of "murder" and sentenced to death, and that it was a just and human "execution". To all the people who are satisfied with this sophistry, please form a line on my right. I'm going to give you a great collective Three Stooges over the head. <br /> <br /> See "The Advocate" (1993), a movie based on the true trial of a pig in Mideval France. 500 years later, people are still a lot of morons I see. <br /> <br /> What's next? We arrest birds for stealing our blueberries? Arrest pushes bushes for assault and battery? Thomas Edison, I hope you now have a large fat worm that crawls through your eye contact. Oh wait, it would violate it, wouldn't it? lol
