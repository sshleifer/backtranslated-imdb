If you like silly jokes and a terribly predictable story, then this movie might be for you. Courtney Thorne-Smith, Jack Warden, and several other members of the supporting role-player actually have talent, but it has been completely pushed through the paper thin script. It is a generally boring and joyful time warmer of a movie.
