The Good <br /> <br /> Carrey is a good actor and he proved it in "Man on the Moon" and in "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". But hey, who can do an actor without good story and proper direction. He can do "number 23". <br /> <br /> The bad <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is a poor, overstated director. He proved it in virtually every film he made. What he did with Batman is just a disaster, but Batman movies probably should look good. Well, they didn't. Instead of gothic and macabre we have Disneyland. Sure "Falling Down" was great, but can you destroy the role with Robert Duvall and Michael Douglas AND with an excellent script? No, you can't. <br /> <br /> And such a good actor and poor director finally met and made "Number 23" ... <br /> <br /> The Ugly (23) <br /> <br /> I know it is stupid to start with, but Fingerling's subplot (almost half of this movie) looks exactly like another chapter of Max Payne2. VoiceOvers, quality of detective story itself, character quality, even colors, mood and music, editing and sound mix! Maybe it works for the game, but it's definitely not in the theater. <br /> <br /> Mise and scene are so bad it gets funny. It's not even annoying. Carrey reads the stairs in the park? Why? Is that natural? No, but it looks good. Why Suicide Blond cover walls in her flat with white paper? If she wanted to kill herself? There is no logic in it, but it still looks good. Guess what it looks like, it doesn't look good at all. It looks rather unnatural. <br /> <br /> All female characters are flat. Why is this so? Who cares, let's continue with the story. <br /> <br /> Who is this Fingerling? Private eye on the suicide? Hardly credible. <br /> <br /> Screens where Walter Sparrow argues with his wife about the weather book is really about him, could be the best part of this movie. Instead, we get Moulder / Scully routine. Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Interiors have no sign of people living in them, except the important objects (shoes, photos, etc.). Congratulations. <br /> <br /> Dialogues aren't that bad. But what about V.O? Well, that's another story. "There is no such thing as fate. There are only different choices." Captain obviously for the salvation! "Number comes to Fingerling. And now it comes to me." Clich√©. And so on. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the average housewife would break into the public building in the middle of the night. Successful and undisturbed. <br /> <br /> The subplot of the dog dragging main character to the cemetery. It is so old and so comfortable to the writer, and it had to be banned. I mean it! <br /> <br /> Flashbacks and editing similar to "what happened in the previous episode of X files" is not the best way to present the most interesting part of the movie. Is it? <br /> <br /> I wish I could say that this story deserves a better fate, but not. It does not make sense. Telling in chronological order is poor and incredible. All the time we have undeveloped characters is a chain of situations that are nothing but poorly written fiction. It can be fun, but - as the whole movie is dead, it's not. For many accidents, it's just bad for every story. And the "mystery"? It's predictable and easy to guess. <br /> <br /> Losing touch with reality is a good theme for good movie, but I have never seen it in Hollywood's productions. If you're interested in the subject, just watch "Repulsion" by Polanski or something from David Cronenberg, "Spider" or "A History of Violence", both of those movies dealing with similar issues that "Number 23" wanted to show. Wanted, but failed.
