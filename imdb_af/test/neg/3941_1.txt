Honestly, I was a big fan of 'Stay Alive' trailer when it was released some months before the time. I kept telling my friend how this movie had a good story - and maybe a good one. Anyway - this movie is somewhat under my expectations. <br /> <br /> The plot has great potential but how the story unfolds, along with acting, directing and bad CGI - this movie is a disaster. The ghost does not make sense, and concludes the murders - it is all too hasty, creating a sense of 'unrealistic' in the mind of the audience. <br /> <br /> This movie may be scary for some audiences, but fears in a sense of shock (due to the sound effect, etc.) rather than staying fearful of some valid factors in the movie. <br /> <br /> You should consider watching this movie again.
