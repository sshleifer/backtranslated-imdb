it's just the second time I've been moved enough to write a review. Unfortunately, they both worked for movies that can be described with several 4 words that can be defined as faeces or faeces. the other movie of such a caliber was masked and anonymous. <br /> <br /> anywa, on the review. There are several important things that are wrong with this movie that I will describe below. <br /> <br /> 1) Toss lost the plot (ie in all its other movies, family / friend is killed. Toss gets angry. Toss kills people). <br /> <br /> 2) stealing lost money was a good car pursuing scene at first, but I think he has blown his budget over it and couldn't afford a decent writer or editor.) 3) Steven no longer seems to do his own action. Instead, the (of memory) 2 battle was shot down and shot from behind so you couldn't see his face. probably a stunt double. i guess chuck norris. <br /> <br /> In summary .. worst seagal movie ever. second worst movie I've seen in recent history, and I've seen very bad movies.
