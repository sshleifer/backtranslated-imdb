The lifetime channel broadcast it in October, but I just came around to watch it now. It's the old eternal triangle again? Dave Ford, the small town of Connecticut, has a quick flight with his girlfriend, Emily Darrow (Emmanuelle Chriqui), on the eve of his departure for the law school in New York, over the next five years thinking about her not doing contracts and underpants, walked back into her again when he returned home five years later after the death of his father, and became romantic again with her. But director and co-author Matthew Cole Weiss is completely over the top, working the whole thing back in flash, because Dave confesses to kill Emily, her husband and one of her lovers before (here comes the spoiler) A Lesbian police which is also a flame of Emily's. Weiss exaggerates the "flanking" effect with which Dave can see his bits of his previous life flash before his eyes even before he is actually dead, while Dave and Emily get sex and thereby destroy the soft core porn shots that even give some others nice Lifetime movies, at least a little hearing aid.
