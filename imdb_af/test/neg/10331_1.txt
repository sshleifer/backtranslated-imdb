Remarkably, as the acting debut of the future big-time Hollywood star, Sandra Bullock, this ridiculous action movie is so full of holes that one can easily suspect the infection. The storyline is incomprehensible and very poorly thought. The production values ​​stink of cheese. In fact, a total shortage of production values ​​would have been better. In any case, the movie might have been so much louder. The ADR is lower and bad in the movie. It is debatable whether any of the dialogue tracks of the actual shoot were used. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the performances are terrible, though there are a few exceptions. In such exceptions, however, the actions are undermined by the fact that the director obviously gave the actors poor guidance and sometimes make them character. (ie passive-moving characters are blown into the eye of an eye.) The constant "weapon sound effects" (magazines being loaded, slides, etc.) are completely over-exploited and, more often than not, completely out of sync with the screen actions. Add to this cute "Bad Guy" voice twist for the main villain (mainly to know he is the villain in this incomprehensible mess of a movie), and you have a recipe for disaster. <br /> <br /> The situation in the film goes well beyond the standard "suspension of unbelief" and is laughed straight. One main character spends a good portion of the movie stuck on a chair before deciding to use the butterfly knife in his sock to free himself. So, my questions are ... why didn't he do it earlier and why he even had the butterfly knife. He wasn't looking for? Right. It's one of a hundred examples of completely ridiculous situations that were somehow packed into this 90-minute package. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Hangmen" plays like an unbearably bad R-rated TV movie of the 80s. If not for the subsequent success of Sandra Bullock, it would never have found his way to DVD. But it has, so my only advice is to be clear. Watching this movie can actually harm your IQ.
