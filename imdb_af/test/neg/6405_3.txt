One would believe that this game is about a man who is obsessed with a number. And that's probably an interesting topic - can one become so obsessed with something marginal as a simple number that he touches completely with reality and becomes hopelessly delusional and paranoid? <br /> <br /> Well, maybe somebody will make a movie about it. This one unfortunately has nothing to do with the above, but cares what the trailers (or even the movie itself) would like you to believe. I'd like to say that this number is just a MacGuffin, but it's not even that. It's useless. A gym. A hook for unsuspecting audience. <br /> <br /> Well, where's the movie going? A dog catcher (Carrey) who becomes obsessed with a cheesy noir crime book because he feels it somehow reflects his own life. There. Certainly, the character in the book - detective Fingerling (sigh) - is (for some reason) obsessed with number 23, and Carrey becomes obsessive and begins to see the number everywhere. But it's just padding, and totally irrelevant to the story. In fact, you can cut out all 23 references and have the main character (s) obsessed with cheese or something and you will have exactly the same story. It is painfully obvious that all the "23" stuff is written after the story has already been finalized, rejected and sent for "rewrite". <br /> <br /> What would be OK. The movie wasn't sowing and sowing. Half of the film is being told, for chrissakes. You don't look at the movie, you listen to Jim Carrey who tells the movie. About fifteen minutes in Carrey, the book begins to read and from then on the terrible clich√© ends, we are forced to see "real life" scenes of the captive's life (where nothing happens) between the narrated art film noir-ish " book "scenes that will make you sob or just be depressed. It's like a poor man's "Sin City" with all the violence cut out, told by Carrey and shown in slow motion. Ugh. <br /> <br /> It's a simple case that a C-movie script is somehow filmed with an A movie. Probably due to the "number 23" hook that I supposedly scared on paper. guarantees the premium Hollywood treatment. Since, as I have already said, the film about 23 as much as it is about cheese production in Switzerland, one can feel nothing but cheat. <br /> <br /> I give "Fingerling - the movie" 3 out of 10, because I think it didn't insult my intelligence as much as "Lost" did or did my suicide like "Battlefield Earth", and the bottom of the bowl should be reserved for abominations like this. But don't worry, it's still a nice movie.
