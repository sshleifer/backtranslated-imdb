Conclusion: many, but very, very boring, but I looked at the end and hoped for some upside down effects, but the end was worse because it was nothing. The old black-and-white game didn't help at all, it usually helps psychological movies, but it wasn't. The script, the plot, etc. Was linear, had no substance, nothing in the hallway. When dealing psychologically, you deal with analysis, with details, the unity different formula .... there was no being, no detail. Just a story, there are many stories to tell, but something makes them unique and difficult to forgive with the tools and creativity of movies. Well, that's not the one.
