It's a movie that really makes me. In 1951, MGM and Looney Toons made some of their best cartoons - with great animation, exceptional backgrounds and good stories. Then in the late 40's a new animation style (like the "Crusader Rabbit" series on TV) - animated with extremely simplistic artwork to save money. Unfortunately, Columbia Picture's cynical ploy worked !! Instead of the public who hated the tone (as they should), many accepted it and the Oscar people (AMPAS) gave this film the best animated short-lived legitimacy for an inferior product. Unfortunately, it soon began to crawl into the dollars and sensible world of Hollywood into the products of legitimate studios - which have quite sly cartoons. Later on, it even got worse than in addition to animated animations and backgrounds, the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch. The cunning and style of the classic cartoons was gone. And for this tragedy, I blame, partly, GERALD MCBOING-BOING - one of the overdades of cheap cartoons. The story is not that bad, but the animation is an abomination and listens to the child and continues to say "buoy-buing" is a pain.
