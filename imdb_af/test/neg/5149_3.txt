A 'Wacky Chick' flick. A beauty contestant is killed and the usual suspects are rounded off. Another entry into the bait of the Texas Cheerleader, this is an average example of its kind. <br /> <br /> Yasmine Bleeth turns into her regular healthy girl performance, and Jill Clayburgh does a great job as her stressed obsession. <br /> <br /> Some mildly funny moments that listen to the vapid self-service PR come from the mouth of the participants. ("I want to have a restaurant so I can give the rest of the food to the rest.") <br /> <br /> Ask yourself what people use for brain when they think of a cheerleader or beauty worth killing! <br /> <br />
