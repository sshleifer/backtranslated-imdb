I think it's very interesting this movie is called a thriller. This is all but exciting. <br /> <br /> Most of the time you hear piano sounds. Then you hear piano sounds. Then some people talk about facts that no one touches. <br /> <br /> Then the keyboard sounds again. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie was the reason why I had to register with IMDb because I think this movie is one of human values. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: By the way, the most action-like part happens when a can of hot chocolate is spilled. <br /> <br /> Also very interesting: The "actors". Yes, the quotes are intentional, as you can imagine, because they do not act. They play the piano and do little, but it is not observing that they are doing it. <br /> <br /> I think before this movie I never left a cinema and feel angry. Really, this movie made me angry. Angry for the time and money I spent on it.
