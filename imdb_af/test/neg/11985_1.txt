Obviously, it had potential in more capable hands, but it would have been surprising if your Boll's record would have been if there were any merits for this farce. <br /> <br /> The first 5 minutes are classic monster movie madness - even the terrible one-liners rendered by GI Joe-type soldiers feel as if they have lifted another venture in the same genre. <br /> <br /> If you leave the movie at this point, you will do yourself a favor. You have succeeded in all the highlights and you will have bothered to put yourself through the worst values ​​in recent history. <br /> <br /> Then follow absolute garbage talent. The front man has the same amount of charisma you will find in garden night. <br /> <br /> There's been an awkward bit of confronted romance thrown in - it feels so wrong that you can just speculate why this scene was confronted in the first place. Normally, the genre uses intervention of romance and nudity to inject humanity and sympathy into other cardboard cuttings - here it is back on all cylinders. <br /> <br /> The effects are bad and the action is incredibly boring. Where other classic artists face originality and imagination of budget constraints, everything seems to have been spent on catering. <br /> <br /> There are actually no redeeming features here - even the "it's so bad is almost good". It's just bad and bad. <br /> <br /> Our hero asks the leading asterisk over the night they spent together and how she would judge him. She gives him 2 out of 10. I give the whole thing 1 (I wanted to be 0 if it was possible). <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this dribble, there's a lot of crap cinema out there, which exceeds this ridiculous junk in the jungle. <br /> <br /> And finally, the movie has nothing to do with the popular game Far Cry (at best it is extremely loose on it). <br /> <br /> Awful, move along!
