There is not much to say about this one, except that it is probably the worst of the early wave of zombie movies (I might see another one, REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES [1936] before the month is out) ). For all stars John Carradine's intention to build an army in the service of the Third Reich with them, they are not seen at all! James Baskett (Uncle Remus of SONG OF THE SOUTH [1946]!) Play their leader, who also serves as Carradine's slave. Black comedian Mantan Moreland returns to the movie of his "treacherous cat" coffee maker from KING OF THE ZOMBIES (1941), as well as the exotic name Madame Sul-Te-Wan as Carradine's housekeeper. Unfortunately for Carradine, its highest achievement ?? the zombie's wife? brings him all sorts of problems: not only does his family arrive at his remote home to investigate her sudden death (meaning he has to expire a funeral service!) but actually proves disobedient and indignant, ultimately "persuading" her fellow zombies to stand up against their master !! Also involved is cowboy star Bob Steele (still known for his little bit in Howard Hawks' THE BIG SLEEP [1946]) who plays an American secret agent representing a Nazi post as a sheriff! Fortunately, director Sekely will have much better luck with his next genre effort, THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (1962).
