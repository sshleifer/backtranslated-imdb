This movie is an almost complete waste of time. I am studying the book for my English level, and the film only contributes in one way, and the whole scenario is set in a rural idyll. The acting is wood, the filmography is laughing, and the so-called dramatic scenes in the film have cut most of my class (including me) in their lyrics. The book, although not my favorite literary choice, is miles better than the movie, and the soundtrack is just annoying. Don't watch this movie unless you are looking for a timeless, quality story that is turned into mindless, media waste.
