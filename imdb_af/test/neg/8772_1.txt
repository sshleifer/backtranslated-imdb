One of the reviewers wrote here: "Good acting, good special effects, good <br /> <br /> place. Still better end." All I can say is, "Ugh." This movie was painful to watch. Let me start by saying this: I am a Christian-wise very conservative by many people I know. So, what I intend to say is not biased by the <br /> <br /> "movie content" of the movie. I'm not going to spoil it because it's Christian. I'm going to give it a 2/10 because it's a terrible movie. The writing is bad - over the top, WAY to preach, and many of the "beautiful" things are just unimportant to the story. It just makes for bad writing. Whether I agree with the <br /> <br /> author's beliefs is irrelevant - make a good writing that flows well, stays on track and credible. The acting was at best amateurish. But hey, if you throw amateurs, you get <br /> <br /> amateurs. Dirk may have been on "Survivor", but the show <br /> <br /> requires ZERO acting ability. Playing on its name and reputation to sell units is in bad taste. Throw in strangers who can act and you will have a much better movie. The effects were satisfactory. The scene with the hail and the subsequent fall of the stars was embarrassing to look at. And what was so nice with the end? It does not make sense. Yes, I know what Tim Chey is going to do, but it missed the point, big time. I bought this movie and expect so much more based on reviews and the <br /> <br /> incorrect information on their website. And although I hope even more, I always get what I see when I watch "Christian" movies - an under-budget, poorly written, pathetically-maintained, badly-produced piece of art. Maybe someone will end up on the board with an end-time movie as well written and made as good as Gibson's "Passion ...". 2/10 stars.
