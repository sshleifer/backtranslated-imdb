I watched the first episode and I considered it a lot of wood performance. <br /> <br /> I watched the original of the early days at Big Girls Blouse after the last series on Channel seven. Kath and Kim were a great documentary and it is humor that most people get. <br /> <br /> But in this American version I found it dull, Molly Shannon is fashionable to be Kath Day, Kath's wardrobe is supposed to hold onto her crazy perm in the 80's. While Selma Blair's figure cuddly clothes aren't as good as the original Kimmy wore. I also found that Selma was very fat in her belly, of course she is an (Australian) partner 12 where Kim (16/18) should be 16/18. <br /> <br /> Of course, the exchange of Molly and Selma was written like this and there are breaks where there should be no breaks, or the breaks are a bit long. As someone suggested, there might be a laugh track during the breaks. It's like Molly and Shannon are not used to each other, there is no Mother / Daughter chemistry. <br /> <br /> Phil was okay, he had the eccentric air around him like Kel. However, Craig was attractive and not the sweet, simple, humble Brett of the Aussie version. <br /> <br /> I found it to be like a very bad play. The play was pretty much wood and the exaggeration of Selma's expressions turned out to be funny after ten minutes. Especially her counting scenes. <br /> <br /> In summary, I find this show a waste of time, the manuscript is, of course, plunged to Americans, who say the most on the board they prefer the original. If NBC Kath and Kim wanted to show why the producers didn't pay the money to screen the original. <br /> <br /> All I can add is Magda, you are one clever cookie not to use the producers of your Sharon character.
