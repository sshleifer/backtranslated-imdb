Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. The person who shot this movie probably never learned not to roll directly into a bright light. You can't see anything in this movie. It's too dark. The parts where you can see something are the camera straight at a light source so you get big lens flares. So you still can't see. This movie had to be a radio or something. Some parts of the movie are actually edited upside down for some kind of crap effect. Low budget movies can be done much better than that. And low budget is no excuse for this. An editor had to say something when he started editing and saw you couldn't see anything. Perhaps the creators of their low budget should spend on a preview monitor so they can see what they have shot. The only good thing this movie is so dark is that you can't see the terrible play. It also covers the crappy sfx. People at beginner film schools then make better movies. Movies shot with handy cams look better than that.
