Although it is the first film of the broken lizard group, it is the last one I have seen. After having enjoyed Super Troopers comfortably and managed to sit through the crap that is club threat and beer festival, I was surprised to hear they did a previous movie. Now I didn't have high expectations, but hoped for a funny campus skirt. My friend asked me to keep in mind that they are younger (of course) and that is their first fall into film. I did and was still disappointed. Not taking away the acting and comedy skills of the BL guys, they were OK. The whole movie was tiring, clumsy and honestly boring. Some of the other role-players in the film were really poor to act on. And the Rugby match didn't even look like rugby. Poor display. They have improved dramatically with Super Troopers and have since declined. Let's hope they get back on shape with Super Troopers 2
