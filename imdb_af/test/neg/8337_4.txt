Incredible cheese-like lava spits from the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. Even if you try to suspend unbelief by ignoring this ridiculous outlook, you will still laugh with the inane dialogue, unbeatable plot contracts and wild reckless scientific plot holes facing the screen. <br /> <br /> I have a theory: every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his / her career. That was Tommy Lee Jones' turn. Although he does a decent effort, the writing is just as pathetic, even if he falls into flames (oops, sorry for that). Most of the supporting role players are also choked by the chopped writing; Some of the actors simply call in their roles. Anne Heche deserves special Hall of Shame recognition for her awkward portrayal of a scientist. She is about as convincing in this role as Pee Wee Herman, and even at least he would have done a better acting job. <br /> <br /> Because the scientific plot holes are too much to list here, I'd rather suggest that you screen the movie with friends and a game of "Find the Scientific Absurdities." The loser can be forced to listen to ties of lime lines from the movie like "Everyone looks the same" over and over. Here's an example of the kind of nonsense you can expect: A building blow-up scheme is designed, designed, and dynamically set and deployed within a space of about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget about the mandatory disaster movie clips: divorced fathers, scientists ignored by everyone, stubborn policemen, tough street children, bratty teenagers, greedy investors, etc .; everyone is present and abundant. The movie also captivates you with a relentless barrage of political correctness. <br /> <br /> Only for lovers of cheese and silliness. All other viewers: beware.
