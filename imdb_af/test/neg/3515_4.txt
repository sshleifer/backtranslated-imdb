I recently watched this movie on The Sundance Channel and it was of interest to me from the beginning. However, it seems forever to find himself where it wants to go and in the end I have a bit of a visit. In a nutshell, Noble Willingham (from Walker, Texas Ranger celebrity) plays a boat salesman who is being harassed by a man claiming to be his son. According to the mysterious caller, Willingham has a dark, dirty little secret that touches the boy and he (the boy) enjoys reminding him. I won't spoil anything for spoilage, but for me three things I love to like this movie a lot. One, the movie combined more foul language than Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino and Glengarry Glen Ross. 99% of it is sprayed from Willingham itself. It didn't take long to carry me out with constant four-letter words. Two, I simply couldn't believe someone would answer the phone that many times, especially if you know that a hooker is on the other side of the line. No matter where Willingham is in the movie, whether it is at work, at home, at dinner, etc. The phone is ringing and he always replies that it is poisoning at the "boy" and then stops to answer it again when calling. CALL BACK IN UNDER TWO SECONDS! How many of us will do this? Now I realize that we probably didn't have a movie if he didn't answer, but I couldn't suspend unbelief on that particular issue. Three, and this is the least of the criticism, why is the director so unfamiliar with showing us the "Corndog Man" (i.e. the caller / boy)? Most of the time he was just a redhead on the other side of the phone. I could have been with that one if other things went wrong, but because they didn't, it's just another to complain about. I give the movie credit for a somewhat original idea and to pay attention to my attention from the start, but it is about it. See it if it's just once. But if you're like me, you'll say, "Triple K Marine!" in your sleep for a night or two after watching.
