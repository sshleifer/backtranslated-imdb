This film is generously entertaining if one is neglected to acknowledge its numerous plot irregularities and its lack of credibility. Bruce Willis as "The Jackal" never seems to track his reputation as a cunning master brain of the underworld. Instead, he stumbles across the daylight, with a mishmash of careless disguise. Why this man has never been caught (or even identified) is beyond me. Not once was the audience impressed by its cunning or daring; Due to the price he is claiming for his services (an excessive $ 70 million), his methods are definitely low-budget and stupid. <br /> <br /> As for those who aspire to him, they are at least as ridiculous in their behavior. They show no knowledge of expertise, but rely on half-baked assumption that overtakes them across the country. Incredibly, this rushed guess (maybe he bought a boat, maybe he's in Chicago, etc.) leads them straight to the Jackal, escaping their clumsy grip. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere, whose Irish accent fades like a distant radio station and plays the inexplicable role of a prison sentence released from prison to work next to the FBI. He's actually a compatible partner, even if it's just because his means are amateur and indifferent to his professional friends. At one stage, he actually confronts the notorious Jackal, but unfortunately the FBI, although trusting him to leave his face, did not equip him with a weapon or any means of communication. What kind of operation are they running here? <br /> <br /> The movie also appears too much on gruesome violence, which is completely redundant and does not give up. The so-called stealthy Jackal acts more like a demented and senseless serial killer, eliminating people for sport and writing on a victim's cheek with blood. <br /> <br /> The movie's action scenes are predictable and unrealistic, and many moments are destroyed. with melodrama. This movie is poorly executed on many levels, the one light spot being the ever consistent Sidney Poitier. Avoid this movie if you're in the mood to think while you see it. <br /> <br />
