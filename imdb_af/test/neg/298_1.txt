How can you make a joke about Mafia? It's not the kind of subject to laugh at! A close movie can't make me laugh because I compare it to Jane Austen's Mafia! Mafia! was not a good movie, but Hoods is really worse! In Mafia! There were some good jokes, but in this one there might be two or three ... which makes you smile. Not too bad actors, but very bad scenario !! We definitely prefer something serious like The Godfather. I give it * from *****.
