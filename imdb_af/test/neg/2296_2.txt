Calling this movie is a decent or enjoyable horror reward, too optimistic. Heck, you can't even call it a nice spoof of the genre because it's below average (it's funny but not "haha-funny, you don't know.) But still I want to say it Just look at the huge number of trivia elements in it. By the way, all the people complaining about this movie are just blaming themselves. If you see the DVD cover of this movie, you already know that it will not be on the same level as "The Piano", so do not come afterwards. <br /> <br /> Evil Ed could have been something, but it totally screwed in. I think the main idea behind this movie is criticized the growing 'abomination' committee in the horror these days, showing an editors named Edward who are slow (good, not too slow) nuts by seeing all the violence and gore in the movies produced by his company. Sam Campbell ... Funny, isn't it? Personally, I also expect a character named Bruce Raimi, but after my surprise there was no. Anyway, this guy got rich by making movies called "Loose Limbs". They function (and I'm not joking!) Scenes in which a girl is raped by a BEAVER (?) And then shot by a bazooka in the head !!! Now, who says horror is no longer original? <br /> <br /> With all the gore and the 'loose limbs', it's hard to believe, but it gets very boring. After a decent first 25 minutes, Evil Ed becomes completely bored and never comes back. The only thought to do then (except for pushing the eject button) is, of course, looking for the clear amount of references to other, much better horror movies. I saw scenes that were obviously stolen from The Evil Dead, Silence of the Lambs, Braindead and several others. And there are a lot of classic horror posters on the walls to admire too. Evil Ed originated in Sweden. I am convinced there is a lot of talent there, far north (take the Danish "Night Skaters" as an example) ... but none of their talents joined the cast or crew of Evil Ed. Just to see if you're in a stupid mood and you don't want to use your brain at all.
