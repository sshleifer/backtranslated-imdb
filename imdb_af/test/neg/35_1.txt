Maniratnam, often compared to prominent world filmmakers in India, is considered a genius in film making. He again proved that he could only visually make the frames look good, without giving much thought. pleasure that can be derived from the theater as a very old art form. <br /> <br /> While I wouldn't want to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies around the world, still a thoughtful and slightly educated filmmaker can identify that his films are not innovative contains no lagging effects and contains mostly ridiculous ending and a lot of melodrama, which are commonly seen in Indian films. <br /> <br /> Overall, Maniratnam once again confirmed my dislike for his films. <br /> <br /> Sorry for those who claim this advice otherwise. My suggestion for you: Look at some wonderful flowers made around the bulbs.
