This is by far the worst of the toxin series. The play in Tokyo is terrible and you can understand about half the time. The big problem with this movie is all the sudden changes to the original. As there is another girl friend of toxins in this one or it may be the same character just with a different name and played by another chick. Why was this movie made like a Disney movie. After about fifteen minutes it starts to work well with everything. There are 2 awesome killings, then the movie goes straight to the shit. After 20 minutes, the movie is a movie carrier. H * LL THIS IS IMMEDIATE WATCHABLE. Well, unless your drunk doesn't watch this movie. YOU ARE WARNING.
