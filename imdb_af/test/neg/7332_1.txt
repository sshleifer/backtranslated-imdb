This man is a real piece of work. An angry, immature boy in an adult's body, packing all the charisma of a rock, goes to places most people just want to visit and do their best to be as miserable as possible. <br /> <br /> Give this work to someone else who really appreciates it. <br /> <br /> I could find an endless list of all the silly things this man does in his "episodes", though I will only highlight the worst: Crete. While the locals' picnic is sitting in its "honor", this clown has the gallows to act like a spoiled, spoiled child. He complains about everything, including the fashions of the people living there. What an imbecile. <br /> <br /> When he went to Sweden, he spent at least five minutes on a bunch of chefs who were incredible (who probably had better things than talking to some American Americans like work) because they didn't think Abba was terrible. Everywhere he went, he raised Abba. This is the kind of talk you will hear from 13-year-olds who watch too much MTV. <br /> <br /> When he was in New Orleans, he was upset that a certain restaurant tasted better than she did, so he accidentally threw some wine on them to destroy them. What a strange, emotionally unstable person. <br /> <br /> The worst of all is his clumsy voice surplus where he tries in vain to add some perspective to a situation he was too fat and ignorant to appreciate. He tries to use all these "big" words to sound like a writer, but he's really just a pretentious hack whose lack of awareness convinced him to have something to say. This is one good thing about this joker's TV show. It will show you, no matter how unknown you are, as long as you take yourself seriously enough, the world will be the same. <br /> <br /> Then there's the way he talks to local guides whose English of course is just rudimentary. He will use a writer - as he believes he would be - will instinctively know, will probably not be understood by these people. Does he care about No. Even important schmucks like this Bourdain clown don't use language to communicate; They use it to make themselves important. <br /> <br /> Mcg13jthm's review on this same page is a perfect example of the kind of thoughts Bourdain puts on - that of a low IQ social misfit. Notice how the reviewer tries to justify Bourdain's sociopat nature with simple, childish excuses that scarcely make sense. "Bourdain can complain, but he goes a long way and it's not a" forced "to do this show, but tries to save himself." A hidden lure hides, and if you read Mcg13jthm's review, you should know it well if you are the kind of person who wants to enjoy this totally useless, useless show. Finally, to estimate a bit of 'fairness' to me, I admit that Bourdain would have been amusing for a moment if I met him in a bar. But as a TV host of a travel show that shows the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures, Bourdain is an unfortunate, impeccable, hopeless, grim and depressing failure. <br /> <br /> A failure.
