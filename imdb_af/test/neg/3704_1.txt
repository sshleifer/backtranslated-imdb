This movie is the worst I have ever seen. You might think you've seen bad movies in your time, but if you haven't seen this one, you don't know how terrible a movie can be. But wait, there is worse news! The studio will soon feature this masterpiece (I'm ironic) for everyone to see! The only thing worse than the plot of this movie is the effects, the acting, the direction and the production. Bill Rebane, poor man's Ed Wood (not that there is a rich man's Ed Wood) (I like Ed Wood's movies though) managed to move things into a snake's pace throughout the film . It opens with the catching of a baby bigfoot (a small foot - it can't help) by some unlikely hunters killed by the parent. This causes the whole town where the hunters go on a Bigfoot hunting jay. This is almost for the plot. Nothing even remotely interesting, and we can never care about the viewers about any of the characters. If you are interested in the films of Rebane, I would recommend almost any other. As I have already said, it will soon be read by Troma to wear a new generation of movie goers.
