The only reason I know this movie is because I wanted to see what Nancy McKeon was, as the facts of life ended. When I searched her name, this relatively new TV movie came. After much investigation I managed to find a copy and was thoroughly disappointed with what I was looking at. D Grade acting, poor writing, terrible FX - it looked like a toned, more stupefied version of Day After Tomorrow that went for 3 hours. In spite of the long time, the characters remain reasonably underdeveloped, we do not care about them in the slightest, and usually desire their downfall. Combine this with horrible lighting and filmography and you have a real disaster of a movie. How they saw so many "name" actors (ie Dianne Weist, Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy) in such a trash is thinking. In summary - I want to return those 3 hours of my life !!!
