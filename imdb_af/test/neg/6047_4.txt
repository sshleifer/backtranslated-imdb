In Chicago, four electricians are led by dean (Richard Grieco) to an old building to disconnect. They accidentally activate a portal and come in a different dimension, where Chicago was destroyed by a Spider Queen and inhabited by mutants. The group meets survivors led by Crane (David Nerman) and Elena (Kate Greenhouse), and finds the inventor of the portal, dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who has been living in this dimension for thirty years. They enter forces, trying to rebuild a portal to bring them back. "Webs" is a visible plagiarism of "Sliders", just worse. Most of the dialogues appear to be written by a person who did not close the basic school, so it is uncomfortable. Furthermore, the story is illogical, and it seems that Chicago is the only city in the world. The scientist is trying his sophisticated machine with broken wires as if stealing a car is very funny. Richard Grieco's face looks like a white version of Michael Jackson and is horrible. If the viewer closes his or her brain, he or she may keep this forgotten TV movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "After Teia Do Terror" ("In the Web of Horror")
