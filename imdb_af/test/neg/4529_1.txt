This movie sucked. The problem was not with the cast. I think the cast was great, very good talent, very good acting. But the writing was terrible! It was mostly just a framework in which Steve Carrell could do his improvisation. And that's what he does best, but it just hasn't worked here. The writing was difficult to follow, the story was non-sensual, and scenes were random and lacking in direction. Also, much of the action was extremely confronted and poorly thought. It was a good effort, but as Max says, they missed it by so much! I'm shocked to see how many glowing reviews there are for this stinker here on the IMDb. It is clear that film producers are writing very positive reviews on their movies and completing the entries on the IMDb. If you read the positive reviews and compare them to the negative reviews, it is pretty clear which one of the regular users is. The movie is full of problems and jokes that just didn't work. I love Steve Carrell in Anchor Man, and I love his comedy and style. But I will tell you that I never laughed once I watched this movie. Yes, I have a few light moments, a few chuckles, but no real laugh. Nothing struck me. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert! One ridiculous scene was when Max tied his hands on the plane and he went to the bathroom to try to escape. He uses his special Swiss armies ... but instead of just using the LEAD OF THE KNEE, he tries to shoot the bond with his miniature crossbow. And like the crossbow mistress and shooting little arrows over and over (almost his EYE protruding), Max doesn't give up or try the blade instead ... no, he just keeps shooting with the crossbow. What did he really expect to do with the crossbow? It was the WORST option on the knife to try to remove the bonds. It just made absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> This is a good example of the typical scenes in the scenes that made this movie. They were ridiculous, poorly thought, poorly motivated, and made of pure nonsense. And it was really distracting. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie was a big downhill, and I recommend you avoid it. A note to the IMDb: You need to do something about these nasty reviews that leave people. It degrades the authenticity of the site.
