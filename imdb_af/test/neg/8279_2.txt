"Graduation Day" - <br /> <br /> I bought this movie last week and waited for some time to play and relax and watch a good 80's treasure jewelery, I have it and Xtro watch , never saw one of them. I just watched it and realized my outside speakers were too. I just imagine what my neighbors thought when "Felony" sang a 10-minute hit? I'm sure it was loud and I'm sure they think I'm weird, with the chain saw sounding and screaming from other movies. <br /> <br /> It was a nice subpar slasher movie, no tension. , no story, a few cool deaths, looked almost on the amateur side, I usually like movies, but it just didn't click with me, now I will watch "Xtro" for the first time and have a margarita ! <br /> <br /> DJ Eric Austin TX
