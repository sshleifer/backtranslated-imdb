I felt as if the two hours I spent watching this movie might be better served by perhaps going to the local, used bookstore and looking for old-fashioned magazines and Halston ads. Or maybe by looking at paint. Those two employers would have had me at least a little more than "India Song". The most frustrating part was that I could see what mood conditions / atmospheres were created, and the idea of ​​this could have been interesting if they had flown more. Instead, what happened was a representation of an incoherent, silly nonevents chain - with the same scenes traveling over and over to beat some point in our senses. <br /> <br /> I loved spending more time writing this movie by writing some sort of review, except to warn other people against this wastage.
