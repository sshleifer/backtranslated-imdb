Let's see: what are the benefits of watching Piranha, Piranha? Well, if you have never seen anything with Venezuela, there are many travel pictures of both Caracas and the countryside (and jungle) and of the various indigenous peoples at work and play, as well as many indigenous wildlife. If you like William Smith, he plays a little git (as he always used to). <br /> <br /> It's about it. If it wasn't for William Smith, it could probably succeed as a fundraising film for Save the Children or any other organization that benefits the "third world". The only time you really see the fish of the title is during the opening credits. No mutant killer fish as in Roger Corman's single-named Piranha. You will get the fish twice in the title. There will be twice as many monster fish on the characters. But this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a photo journalist and her brother comes to Venezuela to do a story in one of the last untouched places on the planet, but their motivation quickly changes to one of those who want diamonds find, what seems to be pretty much there. <br /> <br /> There is not much of actual action or danger in this movie. What could have been an exciting motorcycle race was immersed in the masses of landscapes and animal material that set it apart. There are not many more actions to the last fifteen minutes or so of the movie (it's probably about how long the movie will last without all the travel stories). According to me, the only ways a movie can really be a BAD movie is boring or incredibly stupid. Piranha, Piranha certainly qualifies for the former weapon, and is pretty damn close to the second. The only reason I don't rate it is that the additional footage is more interesting than the rest of the movie.
