Unfortunately, with so many awesome flippers, it's a fresh air in the genre. Compared to classic ones such as the plane or the naked rifle, it's awful, but compared to recent ghost films like Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie, it's very clever and original. Don't get me wrong, it's not a good movie in any way. I laughed a few times, and there are some inspired gags, but any pop culture reference falls flat on his face, and most jokes in the movie. Lambeau Fields (David Koechner) was a bad coach in the past, but now he has been brought back to teach college football, and this time he will do a good job. His wife (Melora Hardin) feels far from him and his daughter is making a big shot of the football to upset her father. Spoofs of several recent movies come into play, just like a lot of points of view and non-stupidity. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the movie are the gags that don't rely on recent movies. Radio, Rocky, Dodgeball, Friday night, Invincible and many other sports films are not at all funny. It's mainly the smaller gags that get a few laughs, such as a bizarre cross scraper scene, or a chick spit-pop. This little throw away giggles can't carry the movie, and at the end it's hard to watch. The last 20 minutes are upsetting to go through. <br /> <br /> The characters are surprisingly developed for a sports show movie, but I'm sure the characters are built on genres. However, they are not bad. David Koechner can lead lead actor in a movie. Too bad they gave him so much material to work with. Matthew Lawerence has fine comic timing in a not always as comical role as a ballet dance soccer player with a cross-band father. Carl Weathers casts the cast, plays again in a sub-sport movie (Not the Rocky movies ... Happy Gilmore!) Overall, it's a goofy comedy. Sometimes it's funny, but more often than not, it's just very annoying and predictable. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 from ****. 90 minutes. PG-13 for language, sexual humor and drug humor.
