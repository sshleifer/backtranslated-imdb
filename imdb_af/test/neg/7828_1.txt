Tired, curly drink. The chemistry between Argento and Madsen was as exciting as a wet donut. Their dialogue was dramatically uninteresting. The storyline was a mess. The acting forced. The cinematography taught to those oninspired. Lazy and useless. Kim Gordon and her character had no reason to be there. And no one else. I couldn't have given two farts for any of the 'characters'. Their emotions skipped and jumped like a junkie she hates heroin. Empty and boring. Why should I write ten lines of text here to make my point? I think I summed it up in the first three words. But of course this is not enough. I think it's the last time I waste my time criticizing a movie. Anyway, I saw 'Clean' and thought it was quite ineffective. Again, I didn't care for the characters, whether they were alive or dead.
