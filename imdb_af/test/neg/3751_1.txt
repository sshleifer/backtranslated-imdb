Let's not do ourselves, these atrocities are not Plan Nine or Cat Women. It's bad, time! The performances range from drama school theater (Marla English) to a 'can't care less' walk (Tom Conway). Photography (even in good print) is so dark. It is sometimes difficult to see what happens. However, the real problem is the aimless, useless, almost plot less story and the guided, paceless direction. At a fast 77 minutes, it still feels infinite. <br /> <br /> The script is especially inactive. There are two story lines that just cut at the end of the picture. Tom Conway is trying to create a super race, using voodoo and modern science (though there is little science in evidence) that he can control telepathically. He keeps his wife prisoner (for no apparent reason). Meanwhile, a few little crooks and a white hunter's guide are trying the town where he works, expecting gold and jewels. When they finally arrive, Tom Conway decides that one of them, the woman, is the perfect subject for his experiments. She turned into a monster, killed Conway (natch!) And then normal again. She sees half a gold image drowning in a hot tub, trying to recover it and falling into the water and apparently drown. The white hunter saves the woman. In the last shot we see the presumably drowning woman acting again as the monster; <br /> <br /> The AIP producer, Samuel Z Arkoff, in a DVD-based lecture, is proud to spot the teenage niche market and satisfy it with ingenious low-budget movies. However, it is difficult to see how anyone can think that this rancid concoction will satisfy any kind of audience. What appeal do they think could be possible? The monster appears so rarely that it can hardly be called a horror movie. The jungle action is clumsy and boring. There are no teens in it and no characters that teens can be expected. <br /> <br /> The producers exposed 77 minutes of film, but they didn't make a movie. This is a trouble and Arkoff must be ashamed of his commitment to it.
