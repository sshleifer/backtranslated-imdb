One of the low budget horror schlockmeister, John Carradine's more animated roles as an implied Nazi scientist, who transforms people into zombies to serve the Empire. Mindless scuffling brain dead, only able to obey the simplest commands .... Stay as staff in McDonalds. <br /> <br /> Hitler is not named by name as America was not in the war They were filmed, but it is clear how the bad guys work! <br /> <br /> There are two types of zombies in film, the traditional voodoo type popular in the old black-and-white movies of the 1930s. and '40's. Empty eyes and just follow someone else's instructions as they stumble. And then there's the kind we know of later movies like 'The Night of the Living Dead' and 'The Evil Dead.' Still moving around, but only with the intention of killing and eating the flesh and brain of their victims. Both have their films in various movies throughout the year. <br /> <br /> 'Revenge' features the former zombie type, although it looks particularly goofy and looks more like home in an old age, is freaks like geeks as they bite the heads of chicks. One black zombie named Lazarus with his wild hair looks like a young Don King. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, the evil doctor decides to make his wife a zombie with the other and that is where he made his mistake. Although he allows her to keep her strappy heels as a pretty female touch as he changes her into one of the living dead, she is not happy with it. <br /> <br /> It's all terribly wrong and ends in tears. The story of the story should never ever change your wife into a zombie. It just asks for trouble. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting enough and it rolls quickly to an end, but never rises above it is the origin of poverty. Not a patch on any true zombie classics, but fun just the same.
