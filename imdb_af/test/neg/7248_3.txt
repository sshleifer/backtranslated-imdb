Yep, Edward G. gives us a glimpse of the criminal defense world. First, he is an exaggerated prosecutor who sends the wrong man to the chair (played passionately, but briefly by DeForrest Kelly), then he is so repentant that his only consolation is the bottle. Throw a colored romance, a real fast pace in the pen and no evil about who he is defending, and the next thing you know - Shazam! Black Leg Attorney (god I love that phrase). He saw the light just in time to save his loved ones from the chair. Yawn. <br /> <br /> But really, the courtroom action is pure melodrama. Seeing him witness a witness, seeing him drink poison, seeing him passionately arguing as he hooked a hole in his chest. Be prepared for melodrama. <br /> <br /> The movie of the movie, however, is Jayne Russell. With curves that defend the laws of gravity and an IQ approached absolute zero, she is something to see. Even singing a little.
