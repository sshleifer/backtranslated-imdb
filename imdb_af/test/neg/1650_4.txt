Frantic, somewhat moderate, childless humor is abundant in this city's son, wannabe farmer's story. It's not shameful enough to appeal to the Will Ferrell crowd, and not interesting enough to wear the feature length. Most I can praise "Sun in Law" is to say that it mostly avoids toilet humor. The biggest problem is that all the characters are not warming, and Pauly Shore is so abusive that he is the most unlikely hero. There are some entertaining pieces that involve farm animals, and that's about it. The story, which is there, is so simplistic and predictable, it makes "Jury Duty" like "Gone with the Wind". - NOTE
