Lou Costello (sans Abbott) plays a small town of independent "garbage collector" (and inventor of a timed machine!) Who secretly sues the cousin of the town's big shot court. After a spit, Lou's girl (Dorothy Provine) walks in a foggy cave - why it's misty we never learn - and emerges as a 30 foot giant. Provine is definitely a good sport, and she doesn't bother to be ridiculous (it would have been impossible anyway), but the scriptwriter is really cruel on this character and doesn't just change her into a giant, but a crispy harpy as well. Provide neighbors with Costello while creating a riot with the army troops being called in, but nothing is funny about the transformation. Trumped at "Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman" last year, the movie rang Lou Costello in his last bow, but offers a little different. The special effects are marginal, while the writing needs harder lines and the direction of snapper pacing. * 1/2 of ****
