I was Stan in the movie "Dreams Come True". Stan was the friend who worked with the main character in the factory and ended up breaking his arm in the machine and shouting (where was the ambulance?) The play in this movie was mostly pretty poor with mostly local actors from the Fox Valley, Wisconsin. I saw the movie on the big screen. It played 2 nights in 3 theaters and was something special to see yourself on the big screen. I can be biased, but generally I enjoyed it. The soundtrack was also the band Spooner, which later became Garbage. My brother, Steve Charlton, was also in the movie. He played Swenson, the man who came to crutches to talk to the police.
