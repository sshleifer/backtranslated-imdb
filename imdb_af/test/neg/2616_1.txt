Very disappointing 7th chapter of this slow-dying series. Very clear that the budget was very low. This movie is made for one reason and one reason alone. To Sell Poppe Master Toys! Fans, like myself from the series, decided what I had read and heard that the only one in the series was worse when it was the Pope's curse. We turn away from the series. <br /> <br /> The choice to make it a PG-13 movie, for whatever reason, didn't work in the movie favor. The plot was almost there, but was easily in the steady stream of nonsense. <br /> <br /> The only movie in the series worth watching, also directed by Decoteau, is part 3 - Toulon's Revenge. <br /> <br /> Allowed, I favor the scenery in the movie. <br /> <br /> Yuck!
