My wife watched this movie at a local video store. From the cover it looked like a science fiction movie, but when I saw it about my wife, Rebecca St James came in the movie, realizing it was a Christian movie and suggested we watch it. We are conservative evangelicals, but we also know that "mainstream" Christian films have a poor reputation. However, we decided to verify it. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there were a few things I liked about the movie. The musical score - much orchestrated - was pretty good. The cinematography was also pretty good, as it was a lower-budget movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, any virtues in this film's production work were lost on a pitiful script. The film starts with an interesting performance - UFO kidnappings - but at the center of the feature, the story jumps into an evangelistic crusade played by the film's two main characters. At least the Frank Peretti-inspired "The Visitation" (which itself was a deeply flawed movie) had an end game that tied the film's premise. "Unidentified" ends nowhere even near where it started, it's a big count. <br /> <br /> Regarding the acting? The supporting scene ranges from decent to terrible. (Rebecca St James plays a bit and is wise.) On the other hand, some main characters are man-made enough. Unfortunately, their talents are wasted on characters as one-dimensional in their personalities to be incredible. The "protagonists" are nothing else; you know it's bad when two Christian viewers find the most vocal Christian character in the movie to be the most annoying. <br /> <br /> A final note on the evangelistic tone of this movie, which will be of interest to Christians as non-Christian readers. In a word it is embarrassing. Other Christian films like Carmen's "The Champion" and Peretti's "The Hangman's Curse" have managed to communicate a truly uncompromising portrait of the Christian faith without being preaching or repressive. This movie, on the other hand, is a sledge hammer that feels so heavy and lacking that a non-Christian will find it difficult to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> I believe the filmmaker's heart is in the right place, and I am trying to create good Christian film. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. If your church is looking for a show of a good Christian movie, look at "Mercy Streets", the aforementioned "The Champion" or (if you are Pentecost) Robert Duvall's challenging "The Apostle." <br /> <br /> As for "Unidentified?" Hire it if you need to, but screen it before showing it to a non-Christian or larger audience.
