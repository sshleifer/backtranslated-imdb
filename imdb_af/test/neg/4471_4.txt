Steve Martin has always respected me for a very funny comedian and a good actor, and I loved "aircraft, trains and cars" and "bowfinger", but "definitely not the house" is definitely not one of Martin's its funniest works, and it doesn't even seem to be trying, which is just as sad ... <br /> <br /> I don't know; Maybe I don't like this movie because I rented it with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Telephone Store. Both are excellent movies, or maybe it's because I'm accustomed to much better from Martin, or maybe it's just because I'm in a bad mood today ... Regardless, this movie was just not very funny or entertaining, and I never had a smile or a bad visit at the movie's gags, which is really a shame as the previews of this comedy were so promising! I was planning to bring home a house, an all-out comedy bash, and I expected more slapstick comedy and interracial Martin songs. Instead, we are treated to see Queen Latifah move across the screen and try her best with her totally uninspired character. The funniest thing in this clunker is Eugene Levy, but even he doesn't get the screen time he deserves. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to enjoy bringing home, but I didn't. And I find it very difficult to recommend it to anyone except the hardest Steve Martin fans. Skip this one and hire "Plans, Trains and Cars" rather ... <br /> <br /> You'll have a much better time.
