European movies may be slower and less plot driven than American movies, but it takes it too far. It also shows a lot of unfinished characters doing unexplained things. It's not fantasy, it's not even surreal, it's just uncomfortable and bad. <br /> <br /> What's the message here? That people in France are thoughtful and look much more? That they like to watch other people have sex? They shout spontaneously or touch a stranger on his neck? Do not wear a watch when you watch this movie, because you will be surprised at how little it is about or learn about big time arrangements. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a "police superintendent" who is deeply concerned by the brutal murder of a little girl, but actually he seems to be upset. He is not only upset by his own personal tragedies, but apparently mentally rather slow, much like a learning-disabled six-year-old child. He stares blankly, walks with arms that are stiff like a little child, speaks softly, silently, shows, plays strangely in all his interactions (although no one is shining or watching, even though it is supposed to be a police business.) . He is not an angry cop, more of an outpatient. Picture Andy Kaufman's Latka character on taxi, but without the humor. He is not only credible as a policeman, he is not credible as an adult. That he won an award for this interpretation of his character is really wonderful - unless he plays the part exactly as written and the error lies with the weirdos who wrote this thing. The plot is clearly secondary. Don't expect to see anything remotely as the police would do if a girl were murdered. This is not so important, although the incompatibility of their behavior is offensive. The problem is that the rest of the movie doesn't make sense either. It leaves the long dipping near-ups of fields, vegetable gardens, people's faces, etc. The end has become so ridiculous - not completely supported by the events that come from it - unless you think, "What's the worst way this movie can end?" <br /> <br /> There is a lot of sex and nudity , which is supposed to mean something. You want vaginas? You will see vaginas. Don't worry, it's art. It has deep meaning, which I am not sure about. And the protagonist, in spite of his innocent strangeness, has some kind of homo-ootic neck or jowl fetish. <br /> <br /> Finally, the captions are in white and often appear on a white background - very difficult to read. of them. On the other hand, there isn't much dialogue, so it's not a big problem. There is also very little sound - not even surrounding sounds you would expect to hear - in the film, which contributes to the emptiness of the whole experience. The old Woody Allen would have had a field day parodying this work. <br /> <br /> It's an award-winning movie that is sad. I hate to see the lost movies. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
