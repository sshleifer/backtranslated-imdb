OK, this horror movie was meant to be a joke, right? Please tell me it's supposed to be a joke, then I'll understand it. <br /> <br /> A huge crawling bird with giant claws - or one claw anyway - hits unsuspecting people on the ground and gobbles them up. Mara Corday and Jeff Morrow persuaded enough to keep things interesting, but at least you will enjoy a hearty snicker when you see the 'monster'. It looks like a cross between an unleashed chicken and Mortimer Snerd. <br /> <br /> Either director Fred Sears made this photo fast and knew the bird looked completely ridiculous or he really thought his movie and being were really scary. I prefer to think - and hope - that was the first. <br /> <br /> P.S. The bird needs a haircut.
