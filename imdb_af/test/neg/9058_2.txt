BEAUTIFUL AND DANGEROUS is not one of John Candy's sizes. This film about a retired cop who eventually works for a small security system run by the crowd is very poor and not a comedy. There were a few moments I enjoyed, like watching a pilot in Candy, but it didn't look much. ARMED AND DANGEROUS is still a dangerously disappointing dud that we have brought by the director of the equally stupid command command COMMANDO. What a sad excuse for a comedy! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 5
