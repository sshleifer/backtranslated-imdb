I wondered what the organizers of the Victoria Film Festival had to include this film in their program. I think they have to agree with the others who reviewed this movie. I, on the other hand, consider it the worst movie I've ever seen. It starts with a bad writing, full of holes, and dialogue is so unlikely to be embarrassing. Ideas are being launched, then falling with no development. The acting left me completely cold and uninvolved. The decoration was suitable for the time, but a nightmare of a decorator. The only way the characters of this house can hold is if their former homes were horrible. The attic looked as if the items had been thrown into the scene, without trying to create the appearance of a real attic that was filled with litter over the years. Photography is loaded and lacking in variety. Save your money for something worthwhile.
