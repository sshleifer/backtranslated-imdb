I was disappointed in this documentary. I thought it was about the second chess match between Grandmaster Garry Kasporov and Deep Blue the supercomputer designed by IBM computer experts to beat any human chess player. Kasparov was and still is considered the greatest chess player ever. . The movie takes us back to 1997, when Kasporov agreed to have a "Blue Blue" story after defeating it one year earlier. But rather than focusing on the game, it focuses more on what happens before and after. There are fragments of the game, but not many. Much of the film focuses on Kasporov's paranoid obsession that tackled the game as part of a conspiracy theory and that he lost the game unfairly. The film also includes interviews with people who are not in any way interesting. . They even talked to the manager of the building where the match took place. Who cares? I also found it very dry and slow. This film was unsatisfactory. It's just my opinion, of course. If you keep up with race theories, this movie might interest you. For people who are not in chess or conspiracy theories, this movie will probably have no value. I'm a chess fan, and I just stuck it because of it. I give "Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine" 4/10
