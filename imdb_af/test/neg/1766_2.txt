I was very excited about the view of "Cold Mountain". Unfortunately, like most movies, I'm very excited to see, it was a letdown! Wasn't it for that amazing invention that a DVD called, I think I'd put my head through the monitor, I was so bored! <br /> <br /> I watched Kidman and Law when they met because their characters are so-called "destined" for each other. Yet, the face of the law showed nothing but stunned love, while Kidman looked the seconds until she could return to her trailer! Zellweger's character is pure Granny Clampett (as if we didn't get it, cornball banjos noticed her every entrance), and so on, that was all I couldn't laugh at! Ironically, her performance is to emphasize how stiff-as-boarding is. <br /> <br /> Ada is almost hungry for freeing her slaves; we never learn why. More confusing is why none of them were detained as Ada and her father were exceptionally benevolent, and (as shown in one play) it was a very dangerous time for Negroes (as they are politely called here). Why didn't the neighbors teach her how to milk a cow or grow a crop? Heck, why didn't she just sell the farm and go home? And for all Ruby's practicality, if she sends Ada's "evil" cock, the kibosh places them even more chickens! <br /> <br /> By the time her loved one returns, Ada doesn't need it. him or anyone else - what's the big joke! Indeed, she may be physically intimate with Inman, but her true intimacy is with Ruby, who changed Ada into an Ãœber-Babe version of herself. Did anyone else find out how they were holding the hill, hands were happy, like two peas in a pod, when they left Inman? <br /> <br /> I doubt Minghella acknowledged it because he was too busy an anti-Bush movie. Inman tells us he "was sent out like a fool to fight with a flag and a lie," and Ada's father said, "I think God is tired of being called on both sides of an argument." These "observations" are historically inaccurate and offensive. While slavery was the basis of the South economy, the reasons for the war were more complex. It was incomprehensible for a soldier to think that the cause was a lie (in fact, most in rank and file was indifferent). For filmmakers to stumble on their views at a time when such views were strange to those who lived in those days, is quite stupid. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the film is messy and episodic. Law and Kidman are mistaken, and it has zero chemistry! The script is a bit more than a half-baked dialogue, and a large group of clicks and banalities. "Little moments like a bag of diamonds?" Ugh!
