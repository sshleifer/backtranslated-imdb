Spheeris used this documentary to push a stereotype punks. This documentary is biased and guided, not objective. The cutting techniques performed from maintenance to maintenance can be used to contextualize the spoken word of interviewers. Looking at the movie, the blunt idea coming from the punks interviews is that they are pretty stupid. Band members and other punks seem to be of low intelligence and cannot explain their motives or give detailed or coherent answers or even answers. I very much doubt that if some of those who were interviewed knew what Spheeris had created or saw, the final product would allow them to be included in the project. This film puts punks in a bad light by making them look relentless and simple. Spheeris's film should not be a representation of the L.A. punk scene. If you want to see a good punk documentary, want a different state of mind, with Youth Brigade and Social Distortion.
