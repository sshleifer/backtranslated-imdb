I saw this "movie" in part because of the sheer number of good reviews on Netflix, and from that I lent a valuable lesson. Not a lesson on ethnic diversity ... the lesson I learned is, "Don't trust reviews." <br /> <br /> Yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but the people actually have to watch this movie. going those who are least attracted and least affected if they see it. The only reason I can think of the number of good reviews is that it is being reviewed by people who were not used to thinking, or who saw their first thoughtful movie and somehow thought that Haggis had invented the concept. In fact, he basically made this movie, called "Racism For Dummies", as emotionally distorting as possible, which apparently gives people who don't spend much time and think they have discovered some fundamental truths. Never covered in a movie. Zen and the art of motorcycle empowerment are not ... An after-school special for the unimaginative masses cuts into bite-sized, shifted ham-fisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection. <br /> <br /> It's as if they all portray as the worst possible extreme, just to make us happy to be such good people because we don't identify with the characters. Let's see it people. DO NOT identify with these characters because they are all cardboard cuttings and stereotypes (or predictable-reverse stereotypes). It's well behaved (even though the dialogue is frightening) and cleverly executed, so much so that you don't think "where's the beef?" until you can say the movie is down. The flaming motor situation was well executed, like a lot of the movie, but went nowhere. <br /> <br /> The messages are very heavy-handed, and from the back of the screens the producers watched another movie, as there is very little to laugh at in this movie, even during the intended funny parts. I have to emphasize that it is NOT entertainment, more like a high school diversity lesson ... it calls the "Blood on the highway" of racism. They could even show it at high schools if it wasn't for Jennifer Esposito's "naked" shot. <br /> <br /> In this movie everyone is a while and everybody learns a lesson (except Michael Pena who gets the best role but the most predictable storyline.) <br /> <br /> This is " a bad movie, with bad writing and good actors .... an ugly cartoon made by Paul Haggis for people who handle anything other than the bold strokes in storytelling .... a picture painted with crayons. <br /> <br /> Crash is a depressing little thing that causes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice. bad things.
