Enough talent and sincerity went into making this movie I wish it had turned out better. Everyone is doing their utmost to set an intriguing point of view, but it is too deep a vision, an appropriate attempt to eliminate spiritual despair to survive a transition to the screen. This is an attempt to capture the dimensionality of gossamer patterns on celluloid - the result is darkened and slow. I give it a 10 for effort, but a 5 overall.
