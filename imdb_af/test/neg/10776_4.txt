I don't even agree with many people here. but I really didn't find this movie as brilliant as the reviews I read. It was undoubtedly a pleasant story and the background of the partition gave the scope for an epic. but the movie was a debauchery. special for neons who have "gadar" seen. Despite the prospect being played by sunny deol and the incessant songs, I have to say that is the better of the two. the story is almost the same. partition failed to create any depth in its characters, as well as the scenes that were supposed to have an impact. about looking at Christian's crutch's accent and the little image, which in itself was not an easy job. the characters just didn't look too real. not that I criticize the acting by any of the principal. it just didn't work. The atmosphere was well set up, but the movie didn't really miss substance. Not that I die the hard rambo fan, but an action saw the movie or a character development. It was all like a rush to the end. and the end just added to the discontent of the viewers. <br /> <br /> Nowhere, I have to say that this was at least a good effort in the seemingly unknown area by the director. And if you haven't seen Gadar, your mites are even that.
