I had a bad feeling in the movie for ten seconds when some overworked tumble dry (probably left of a bad western one) blew across the scene. The bad feeling grew ten seconds later when the compulsory opening designer-worn human sacrifice for no apparent reason dropped its rear view mirror to see a shadow in the back seat. For the next five minutes over the opening credits we are treated with an overhead shot of the car swinging back and forth and only the dramatic TV movie tells us that there is a murder, not a make-up session. For the next 27 or so hours, we are treated to two idiotic psychotics who, for some reason, are obliged to drive through the wilderness of Suidwes, to go together like a demented Abbot & Costello. Even with the "shocking" ends at the end, we are just left to shake our heads and wonder if the producers and the director / writer feel ashamed and ashamed as they need to create this inconsistent, disjointed nonsense.
