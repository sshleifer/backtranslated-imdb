I don't know why it got proper reviews because it could be the worst horror comedy I've ever seen. Englund is just for a cameo and his performance is as unnecessary as most of the lame attempts to make jokes (and scare). The direction is terrible and the acting is worse. Every producer seems to be trying to make another evil dead, but these poorly ill-fated efforts only rise to the memory of a true horror classic. <br /> <br /> Whether its filmmakers say, "It's not a remake, but it's an 80-year-old backlash (which is just as original - Hatchet) or people trying to match it with other horror classics It is still deceptive and does not matter for the lack of fear, horror, comedy or even a decent movie for that matter. <br /> <br /> SUBSCRIBE ALL COSTS !!!
