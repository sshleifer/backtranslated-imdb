With all the hype around the stars of the movie, this movie fell in love with me. I expected a much better movie due to the inclusion of Murphy, De Niro and Russo talents, but found that the movie fell flat on his face. Comedy sequences were exaggerated and the superior performances of the stars, especially De Niro and Russo, could not save this one! <br /> <br /> ** from *****
