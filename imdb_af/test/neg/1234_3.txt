Photography is good, the costumes are good, but editing is bad. The various scenes are cut, or stopped at the wrong times, and the conversations are s-l-o-w and boring. This inertia continues throughout the show. It's a very boring show to watch. . . . I believe more scenes should be added, but it will make it a longer show. It is moving very slowly. The writers only had to make it a one-night show, and do not prolong our night's grief. There is nothing else, otherwise I change the channel (the first night). I feel bad for the Indians of the time and am angry with the white men for what they did to the Indians, but it's our history.
