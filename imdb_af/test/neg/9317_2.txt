Help! Paul Schrader once again sabotaged his own intentions with dull, pedantic storytelling. I rearranged a holiday so I could see this "world prize". What a mistake! Why did Schrader even want to make an Exorcist movie? Lofty intentions are good, but if I wanted 2 hours of theological babble, I'd visit my cousin's Sunday school. Father Merrin's struggle with his faith, as presented in his younger days, is a potentially interesting topic. But an Exorcist movie needs more! The relentless, messy presentation, along with ridiculous special effects, makes for a strange production. Who is this movie for? I didn't see the Harlin version, but at least tried to give some sort of visceral excitement. <br /> <br /> The Exorcist series was rather strange. The first movie was excellent, but every successor was inseparable and useless. Why do they keep making them? I think Schrader made it so much he could get a lot of money. But why should we go?
