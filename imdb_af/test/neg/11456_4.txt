This movie is dated in so many ways, it's sensational. You can also laugh at it or shake your fists in rage. <br /> <br /> This movie deals with many problems of American history, but with typical white-man Christian-American paternalism: The main character is one of those I can do-it-all-and-you 't love-me-for-the-friendly-of-the-old. He is so pompous and not to be taken too seriously. What a terrible creature! His wife is a poor little woman for the first part of the movie and yet a weighing but stronger character. Too bad she still forgets his cunning ways after leaving her for the second time. It's just sad that the character hasn't really changed. Although she is supposed to eventually portray a strong and independent woman, she is consumed by concern over her adventure-seeking husband. So 2 out of 10 points from the feminists among us (and that's just for the good intentions ...)! The problem of Indian oppression is treated fairly well, but there is another patronizing story. And the fact that all African American characters are typical stereotypes makes the film even more hypocritical. I was so furious most of the time! So one point (to try) of the civil rights movement. <br /> <br /> I know the movie was done at another time. I love old movies and I have a lot of patience with some of that dated stance. But it was just disgusting! <br /> <br /> What this movie saves is the parts without the main character. Mr. Dix's play is over and smug. Maybe that's why his character is so unpleasant. I looked at Mrs Dunne's performance, even though her character sometimes made me on time. <br /> <br /> But I have to say the famous landline scene is amazing. And the way the Oklahoma settlement was portrayed made the film worthwhile. It's just wonderful how civilization grew from the dirt and dust of the 19th century. And I don't understand the problem that some have with that church scene. I thought it was quite funny and amusing. Maybe it wasn't supposed to be, but I liked it. So 9 points for the scenes and the impressive storytelling of the Oklahoma State development. It makes about 4 points altogether!
