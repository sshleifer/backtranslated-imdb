By the mid-1990s, the career of animator-director Don Bluth declined to his everyday life. Earlier, Bluth made a series of popular animated films, many of which are still loved today such as "The Land Before Time" (1988), "The Secret of NIMH" (1982) and "An American Tail" (1986). But starting with Thumbelina in 1994, his films declined in quality and popularity, and one of the many unfortunate entries was the 1995 "Pebble and the Penguin" cash register bomb, which did not attract audience members. outside parents and children under the age of seven. First, the latter are the only ones I can enjoy enjoying this rather fine animated feature. <br /> <br /> The story is absurd. The film is a poorly-drawn, stuttering and blunt penguin named Hubie (pronounced by Martin Short) that falls in love with a female penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on her head (vote by Annie Golden). CARE OF as in real life, penguins offer their bridal-to-go with a pebble as a substitute for a ring. But when Hubie is swept away by the stream, he haunts a lonely rockhopper (James Belushi) with a dream of flying and their race against time to return to Antarctica before it's too late. The reasons why they might be late are one of the many underdeveloped elements of this poor story that would still be poor, even if they were there. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is why this animated children's music does not work and will not work for anyone older than six or seven. It just doesn't have any of the features needed for a good animated feature. Number one, the movie looks bad due to a very poor drawing style. The animation in this movie is very cartoony (even as far as animation films go); It is dark, gloomy, there are no vibrations in the colors, and in addition, the design of the film and its elements are universal and lagging. For example, take the penguins staring at the movie. With just a few background exceptions, every penguin looks absolutely nothing like a bird. Hubie, for example, looks absurdly ridiculous with wide cheeks, a blunt bill, big eyes, and the awkward hat he wears wherever he goes. Combined with his hand-like "flippers" he looks like Chris Farley in a penguin suit. Result: he is an ugly, poorly-drawn cartoon character. But the most absurd and absurd character is the evil penguin, Drake, who actually doesn't look like a penguin. He is a muscular man wearing a penguin mask. He has a chest wider than that of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and teeth larger than the teeth of the leopard seals and killers serving as the predators of the film. Basically, he is a two-dimensional, recycled villain. He lives in a cave like a skull, he wears a cap, laughs a lot, and gets angry when people laugh at him. Result: Who cares? And what's bad, and maybe worse, is that it is an animated musical and there is no single noteworthy or memorable song found anywhere in its running time. The opening song was harmless, not memorable, but harmless. But after that the songs became duller and duller and there was especially one that made me angry. It is the moment the viewers press the quick button when it comes. <br /> <br /> I felt "The Pebble and the Penguin" was around, except for the few moments when Hubie and rockhopper penguin Rocko were put at risk by the jaws' leopard stamps and murderers, which fortunately no dialogue have been treated and treated as animals instead of cartoon characters. But in a way, for this reason, I can't recommend this movie to children altogether. That's the reason. The film shows killer fishes are the natural predator of the penguins. My concern is that children known as "Free Willy" (1993) may be offended or disregarded by seeing their favorite denises of the sea portrayed as a bloodthirsty carnivore. The leopard seal was a better antagonist and was more funny to see how his jaws grew bigger than a rattlesnake and how he seemed to smile as he growled. But the point is really, these moments with the predators ?? and there are just a few? Are the only interesting moments. And they're not very interesting, you think. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, I can't recommend it to anyone under the age of seven. My advice: if you have children around the page, rent it to them. They may enjoy it.
