SO THIS is where Columbia's head of their short subject unit started his registrations, eh? Yes, no one but Mr. Jules White being credited (or rather "exposed") to the director of this entry in MGM's DOGVILLE series. Given co-credit as co-director is one Sion Myers; whose name we have unknown to date. Mr. Meyers was undoubtedly the man who controlled the four-legged theses and was responsible for training and "acting". In short, he had to be the Dog Trainer on the set. <br /> <br /> The TITLE of this comedy card is undoubtedly a play about the MGM feature of the same year, the big house; who dies Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, Robert Montgomery and a star stab in support. We must commit ignorance regarding this title; not seen up to this point. (Sorry, Schultz!) But there's a lot of doggy gags related to what we read about the movie; not to mention a specific character specific gags. For example, we observed a dog-belief st-stuttering and distracted correctly, that the bow-wow actor mimicked the character comedian, Roscoe Ates. We later crossed with the cast of the big house and presto, his name is there! (Brilliant deduction, one suitable for Holmes & Watson!) <br /> <br /> The PRACTICE of lampooning popular features has already been a proven practice in the kingdom of the comedy card. It was one that had no objections to the producers and copyright owners of the main films; but rather got totally opposed to tough approval. After all, imitation is the sincere form of flattery; In addition, any producer will even welcome some seemingly irreverent parody. ** As for the movie itself, we found it interesting in some kind of perverse way. As so much of "Man's Best Friends" is being artificially animated into one, long and boring kind of anthropomorphic gay, it has become very difficult for us to make the audience. I just mean how many smallpox are made to bark, unnecessarily, to reach the illusion of 'talking'? <br /> <br /> When it comes to pets, or "Animal Companions" as the Politics Correct crowd, we are pretty eclectic; promotion of not only dogs; but also cats, hamsters and parakeets. We do not enjoy exploiting any animal in such a strange, elaborate game format. <br /> <br /> AS INCREDIBLE as it may seem, the step Mr. Jules White of MGM's Shorts made to train Columbia's head. 2 Line production would apparently not just be a finance in the field; but all in the article content. We never thought it was producer director for such lights as the 3 Stooges, Andy Clyde and Hugh Herbert, as well as some who have seen better days, such as Charley Chase, Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon; would be a step forward. <br /> <br /> IN CASE We haven't made our point yet; We are officially panning this one. So, see it at your own risk. We warned you! <br /> <br /> NOTE * We read excellent accounts from both the WHOLE HOUSE and the Laurel & Hardy driver, PARDON US (Hal Roach / MGM, 1931) in both MR. LAUREL & MR. HARDY by John McCabe (1962) and THE FILMS OF LAUREL & HARDY by William K. Everson (1967). Both books have our most enthusiastic endorsement. <br /> <br /> NOTE ** The prison image has become its own genre; everyone owes the big house. In PARDON US, Laurel & Hardy, Hal Roach and his director made a first class spoof, the first of many; For a prison comedy has become a required theme for as much as a screen, funny guy who comes.
