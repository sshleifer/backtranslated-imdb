Sometimes novels change when they are made into movies are not just needed, but a good thing. However, in the case of Northanger Abbey, it is a very, very bad thing. Not only has the story itself been torn, but the satire is almost completely absent from the film, and the mixture of romance and plot does not even become the biting commentary that Austen put into her work. It doesn't get amusing or satirical at all, and instead the character's fascination with her fantasy world is mostly a drama. <br /> <br /> It also affects the romance. It is tortuous and aimless. Chemistry and interest are never established. The reasons Tilney is attracted to Catherine are completely absent from the film, and let the audience wonder what he sees in her. <br /> <br /> Hopefully we'll get a more faithful version a day later. as Austen's satire.
