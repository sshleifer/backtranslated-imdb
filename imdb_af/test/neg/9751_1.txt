Seriously I don't get why people all like "Oh my God Step Up is the best movie ever !!!" It's a lot of junk! The acting is, in the first place, ridiculous and let us not even start talking about the dialogue, because it was terrible. Movies are supposed to be entertainment, and that, let me be the first to say, was * not * entertainment. I actually laughed because I was so shy to see it. The music and dance didn't do anything to me either. And what is the Channing Tatum "hotness" about which all the girls talk? Whatever. The movie was pathetic. Don't waste your time - or your money. Unless you're a dance movie freak, but movies like it are * not * movies ... it's jokes.
