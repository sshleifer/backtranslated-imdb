It may have been a good TV movie, but the flashbacks don't make it easier to understand the movie. While giving the viewer information on the road (will the movie go), I found myself never saying or mentioning it at first. Then the whole route would probably not have been necessary. <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, you understand why she's shot, and of course she's not guilty. It is a pity that the producer / director used the flashbacks in this way, but on the other hand, the movie did not have the worth. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie for a rainy day, big bag slides to kill the night.
