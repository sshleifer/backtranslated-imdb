Sorry, I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director did not put it together. There is a lot of action, lots of promise, but everything comes from hokey. The director did not do his job. Promising action comes down. So much looks in a desperate attempt to save the movie. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV Credits it as 1996) is simply not worth seeing. Another director would have done a better job.
