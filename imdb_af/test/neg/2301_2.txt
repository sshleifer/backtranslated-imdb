This movie is the last straw in a list of movies I saw this week that pushed me over the edge and forced me to join IMDb and spread the warning to the public. It was absolutely terrible. The film was pulled out and painfully boring. The sound, effects and even the image quality seemed to have come from Willow (1988), or perhaps even Conan the Barbarian (1982). The battle of Bannockburn was absolutely absurd. This "greatest filmed reconstruction of the medieval battle that ever took place in the British Isles" made me snicker. There was no coherent formation at all, just a few guys with spears and horses running right through them. The scenes of Douglas, especially in the last battle, were just awful, as most of the acting was in the movie.
