A blind person could have shot this movie better ... seriously! The director is clearly a beginner. He has to be Dennis Hopper's cook trader or something to convince him to be in this movie. I feel so ashamed of Dennis. <br /> <br /> For John, the director ... PLEASE PLEASE please go straight. Your contribution is not necessary. The medium of film is stronger without you. You are terrible to guide. Hold on to the shopping or anything. <br /> <br /> This movie must be "straight to video" and go "tight to the trash." I'm a thinner person because I've seen this movie. Don't watch this movie if you respect yourself and respect the art form of movie!
