This top-of-the-range / Kung-Fu hybrid with an extremely bargain basement has been released in my country by a dubious DVD label that is usually only busy transmitting pure crap on the disc. It was not really a favorable heraldry. Several other titles have been released in the same series, such as "The Black Six", "The Black Gestapo" and "The Black Godfather" and judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews. None of these belong to the elite of the 70's Blaxploitation hype, either. "TNT Jackson" is a nice movie, without a significant plot, but with too much fake scenes and horrible acting to compensate. Apparently Roger Corman ?? Never be shy to make easy money? Awarded two of his most loyal acolytes quickly find out a simplistic story that will appeal to fans of both Oriental Kung-Fu movies and contemporary trendy Blaxploitation flicks. The result Cirio H. Santiago and Dick Miller came with "TNT Jackson"; the story of an ass-cheering black babe traveling to Hong Kong, looking for her missing brother. She quickly discovered that he was murdered by a criminal network of drug traffickers and swung to avenge him. Mrs. Jackson infiltrates smoothly into the underground area and meets macho pimps, helpful shelter agents, numerous fierce Kung-Fu fighters. Just one thing is certain; they all want some kind of TNT's surprising body. I doubt doubts about film concepts that are more elementary than this, but ?? Unfortunately - all the other aspects also suck. The battle scenes have survived and are also pathetically presented. Jeannie Bell and the other poor suckers are trying very hard to stare through and take a tough position, but eventually they are just in the air and suddenly bump into the rooms. The cinematography is horrible, the soundtrack is very disappointing (whatever happened to soul music), the few dialogues are poorly written and the acting performances are inferior. Talking, Jeannie Bell is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but she still can't hold a candle for Tamara Dobson or Pam Grier. There is only one very good and unforgettable scene in "TNT Jackson", namely the famous hotel room battle where Bell, completely naked, except for pants, turns on and off the light as he kicks hell out of some goons. Amusing scene ... I just haven't figured out whether it's due to the light-fitting news or Bell's perfectly shaped breasts.
