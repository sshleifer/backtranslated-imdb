If this film is to be rated on a scale of 1 to 10, a new rating system needs to be created as this one does not even qualify. The movie's plot (if you can call it) revolves around Charlie (Stephen Baldwin), an ex-special operative agent targeted by the brother of a man he killed while still working for the US government. If it looks like an interesting scenario, don't be deceived as this movie won't deliver its action theme story. <br /> <br /> Comedian Chris Rock once said that when an actor sees a bad movie making it, the actor wants to send $ 50, as the actor desperately needs money for such poor quality work to do. After watching this movie, you might want to send Stephen Baldwin $ 100. <br /> <br /> It seems that Baldwin made no effort in his role in the film. In the film, Baldwin is forced to run anywhere in the city of Los Angeles to protect his "honey cake" (wife) from being killed by a man's brother he previously murdered. In the picture, however, it seems that Baldwin can barely move to maintain a light jog. His sounds of performance succeeded in subtracting from any tension the film may have intended to portray. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who enjoys watching and laughing bad movies for their shortcomings, then this movie is for you. However, if you are looking for a well-made action thriller, it is better to look elsewhere than to rent this movie.
