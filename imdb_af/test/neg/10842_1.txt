This movie looks like someone had a nice idea for a movie, thought of two or three funny possibilities, played a good role, and then the whole thing was conveyed to a very bad scriptwriter and even worse director. The director filmed a romantic comedy in the screw ball, as if it were a dark, artificial film --- strange camera angles, blue filtered shots, dipping, close to raindrops. Steve Zahn was good as always. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, barely shy; He was perfect for a romantic comedy. Sandra Bullock bravely struggled with a character who was supposed to be, but whose wackiness consisted of things like kissing a man she hated, leaving her child, driving a carnival, offers to scramble for money and make a ride with a ride. fellow airline passenger. The writing had very few strange lines; there was no physical comedy; it was boring. This suggested potentially funny situations, and then cut them off before they could develop. To put it all down, the "twist" at the end was a slap in the face for anyone expecting a fun romantic comedy. If you saw the trailer for the movie and liked it, as I did, my advice is: Don't go to the movie. It will just spoil a nice trailer.
