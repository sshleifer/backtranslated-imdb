There is nothing that the viewer can show and call "good". The acting was boring and numb. The sets and cinematography look like they were developed by someone growing up in a Starbucks and trying to make the perfect Gap commercial. Characters have no drive, motivation or reason to care for them. There is such a lack of interest and tension that it is difficult to follow the banal action and dialogue. And the plot ... if anyone finds it, I'm sure it'll be as boring as everything. <br /> <br /> It's not funny, it's not romantic, it doesn't reflect on man's condition. If you want a good stoner comedy, see Half-Baked; If you want a good stoner drama, watch Trainspotting. The only reason I gave these 2 stars instead of one is because it is a pleasure to see some famous faces in the middle of the late 90s. What a shallow reason to give the movie even one star, but then it's a shallow movie again.
