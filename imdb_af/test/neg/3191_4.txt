I don't usually look at Hollywood dribbles, but I was dragged along with some friends to see this one, which seems to be amusing, but totally without any originality. Don't worry, you don't have to think. Tarantino-like storyline leaves enough over-sighting tips for us to predict correctly where this one fifteen minutes before every "turn". I worried that the movie was built. up pretty pretty for a Hollywood movie, but it would have nowhere to go to the climax. And boy realized my fears - YMCA couldn't save this one, but Liv Tyler almost did it. I think I was male and helped in my twenties, but she did a very good performance. Of course she didn't have to do much, except that she looked absolutely stunning about the top sexy, but what she did, she did well! McCOOL'S will definitely not be one of Hollywood's great successes (or should I say "shouldn't" because the mainstream US movie industry is not going anywhere, and doesn't have at least ten years, except hit the stranger like AMERICAN, TITANIAN AND SPECIAL RYAN, and even those had major shortcomings), but if you're a teenager, do yourself a favor and see Liv - she's one hot chick. Rating: 5/10. See also: anything from Quentin Tarantino, any American teen movie over the past decade, anything with sex as its main selling point.
