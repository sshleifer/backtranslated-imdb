Algiers is not a classic, it's a perversion of the wonderful original Pepe le Moko, led by Duvivier and with a much more attractive and beautiful Pepe, Jean Gabin. If you want to experience the Casbah and the characters in Algiers fully, I recommend you not even see this movie, and rather see Pepe le Moko, because it is much more complicated, beautifully filmed, the lines are not split not and the characters are much more like reality. Furthermore, the end is so dramatic and key to Pepe's character that you find the Algiers version unbearable. Although Algeria mimics an almost excellent work after each scene, the play falls short of the credibility of the characters. Plus, the wardrobe is really awesome in all scenes, especially Pepe's in the last scene and Gaby (at all times), but also when she is on the boat. Frankly, Algiers are cheap as far as imitations go.
