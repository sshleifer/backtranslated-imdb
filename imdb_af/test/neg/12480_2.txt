Lucio Fulci was known for his Italian explosive films, mostly his unparalleled films such as Zombie or The Beyond. Here he directed a black comedy of all kinds, but there is only one problem: his nausea. I say this to know that I like City of the Walking Dead (which is also gross, but not like this). A compulsive player gets money for his habit by romancing ugly and distorted rich women and then killing them and stealing their money. The movie makes this plan so easy. I think the women were too ugly to go to a bank, so they always had their money on the person. After the thirteenth murder I began to suspect that I had always heard of Fulci: he hated women. He must have. Anyway, this movie stinks, it's not funny, and Fulci had to stay with giallo and supernatural zombie movies. Avoid this movie at all costs.
