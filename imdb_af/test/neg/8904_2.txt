This movie has its heart in the right place, but unfortunately it's not much of a movie. It's more of a documentary under the guise of a narrative. Bamako is basically a newspaper op-ed piece on celluloid. However, your average well-researched on-ed piece is much more consistent and concise than is presented here. The filmmaker is trying to disrupt African life, especially the country of Mali, due to the unethical practices of the IMF, G8 and the World Bank, by attacking a mockery of the aforementioned use. There is an extra 10 minutes spreading through the film that makes a half-hearted attempt at a story plot, and a bizarre Hollywood West shootout scene where the director is quite happy with his own ingenuity (thus regular Godard comparisons ). <br /> <br /> Of course, as the movie begins, and who is being put to the test, never explains, but as we know, the French refuse to spoon their audience. <br /> <br /> Many passionate arguments have been made, but they are often rendered long-term, in a shrill monotone (one that is fairly easy to tune into after a while), and very light on details. The last point is the most frustrating of all, as there is a very well-reasoned specific case against the institutions here. Unfortunately, all we get in 2 hours is that the IMF and G8 are bad oppressors and forgive the blame for the third world. We no longer give the opportunity for the specific reasons why government organizations are guilty, but never a clear case. The mock-trial arguments and footage of the surrounding town make the suffering of these African residents clear, but one wonders why we have to sit for two hours when painting a much more accurate picture in a 20-minute news article. can be. , or Bill Moyer's episode. Ultimately, there is something very important to say about this issue. It is simply not offered very well, or very clearly, in this pretentious, indulgent piece.
