I've never watched a movie that frustrated me more than Lord Of The Dance. Frustrated because it could have been fantastic. Frustrated because the dance might have been amazing. Frustrated because the women could have been beautiful. How will I know? By the time your eyes moved to the screen of interest on the screen and were pointed to the spot, the insane editor moved the shot! I totally agree with the other comments here on the crappy lighting and horrible camera / editor work. It makes me misleading to watch just ten minutes because it will be a spectacular movie. <br /> <br /> Give me the opportunity to get a front seat at the live concert and I'll be there in a shot! <br /> <br /> Nicholas T
