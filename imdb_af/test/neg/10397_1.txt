Dante would be hurt if he knew that his masterpiece had acted! The actors who played the dolls are also sold out. Due to the fact that playing a puppet does not act, it does nothing. No one will really care who the puppet was. People just care about who plays an important role like a real movie. It's just annoying how you can mock such a wonderful man and his faith through this dumb little movie. It must be a crime and .... I can't believe you will ruin such a book. I thought the movie was absolutely ridiculous and had to be destroyed !! It completely ruins what you plan to read it. You just make it a big joke.
