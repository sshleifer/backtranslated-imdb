Why would anyone make such a movie? Why would anyone invest in such a movie? Why would someone in the movie business work on such a movie? Why would any theater show a movie like this? Why would any TV channel suggest a movie like this? Why would any critic want to review a movie so much? Why would anyone watch such a movie? Why should spiritual investigations not be made by the authors / producers / directors of a movie like this? Sometimes there are movies that are so bad they are good. It's a movie that's so terrible that it's terrible. IMDb should really set a "0" or even a minus scale to embrace works of this terrible pretentious horror.
