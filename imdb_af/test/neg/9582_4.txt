I can't believe the number of judges who price it realistically. I'm a million miles to be an expert, and I'll never climb a mountain; but even the basic knowledge of reading Into Thin Air, and watching Everest Beyond The Limit and a few other Everest documents meant that this movie became more and more ridiculous as it went on. There are some good climbs at the beginning; And when the millions of mission leaders early in the film ask, "How much do you experience more than 8,000 meters?", I was encouraged to hope it could be a harsh and accurate human-vs-nature odyssey. Instead, you have a bunch of climbers who gather a mountain without acclimatization; climb with the glasses in full sun, and they are hardly ever out of breath that perform miraculous achievements of endurance. Just near the cliff, a little fatigue was suggested to dramatically emphasize physical performance to climb such a peak, almost as an afterthought. If you have no knowledge of mountaineering, give it a glimpse: be prepared for a clich√© heroism (though it is no more clicked than a hundred other passively distracting flashes) and a click-out. I developed a slight fascination with high mountains and look forward to watching K2. But unlike an amazingly beautiful scenery, it was a deviation because it was so far from reality. I can imagine that some experts are employed by this movie, but then conveniently ignored in the pursuit of the heroic, and unfortunately fantastic, story. Also, you will sound like a bit of a tit if you have said "welcome to the death zone" at 200,000 feet.
