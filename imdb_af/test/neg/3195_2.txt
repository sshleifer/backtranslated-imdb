Wow. I looked at McCool's one night, and all I can say is, "Wow." <br /> <br /> Here I go. GREAT SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Want a summary of the plot, just to see how stupid and useless this movie is? I will never tell anyone to see it unless I was hurting them. Anyway, here's a glimpse (or a big piece) of the plot. <br /> <br /> Randy works for a bar, McCool's. He meets this woman, called Jewel, who convinces him to have sex with him. Her ex-boyfriend ends trying to rob and murder them. Randy and his cousin and the detective on the scene of the crime all fall for Jewel. She's the fool of stupidity, uses each of these guys to get what she wants, with a DVD player. Randy hires a hit to kill her, and eventually the detective is killed by the ex-boyfriend's psycho brother and the hit and Jewel. <br /> <br /> Serious. That's it. I almost left nothing out, except for a few more sex scenes and an almost pornographic scene by Liv Tyler as Jewel with a snake to ease her sexuality. <br /> <br /> What was the point of this movie? To be honest, I think it was so that producers and directors could show their male incentives. What I think is absolutely unashamed for and simply stupid. If I watch a movie, I want a plot. I want characters. I don't care about sexy women anything they may have. Something must be in a movie, for the sake of good. It's as bad as Fight Club. <br /> <br /> It's getting worse. John Goodman is the detective devoted to the higher being. I asked myself why Goodman would play in such a shameful vain, but then I remember being in O brother, where are you? too. His reputation just dropped. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler was a wonderful actress in the Lord of the Rings series. In this movie she is nothing more than a foolish slut who wants nothing but her way. Her reputation came to me seven or eight notches. <br /> <br /> I'm amazed, just AMAZED that people will work so hard to make something so stupid. The music is absolutely crappy (with a YMCA play while John Goodman's character is killed is not really fit), the characters are completely untouchable, the plot is one of the most stupid people ever imagined, it suits not even in any genre. The closest to it is pornographic comedy. If it was even supposed to be funny. Which was not. <br /> <br /> I think I've finished ranting. But just let me assure you that no one in their right mind ever wants to see this movie. Unless they want Liv Tyler as much as the characters do, it is.
