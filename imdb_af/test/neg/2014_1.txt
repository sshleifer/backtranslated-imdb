Dracula 3000 or Van Helsing "Dracula's Revenge" (Inexpensive money in another lamb Vampire movie) as I have seen it is a master class in how not to make a movie. A patchwork of fearless berger has a previously lost cargo ship "The Demeter" in the (Cough) Carpathian System (later upgraded to the Carpathian Galaxy) and waking up to a relentless evil (in this case, writing) . The movie is a bizarre bastardization of Event Horizon and whatever the lamest vampire film of all time. <br /> <br /> **** Spoliers Follow **** To an abundance of production company logos and a credit line Most of the budget needs to be inflated. We open up with a cheesy outline type speech by Casper (stupid name) playing Captain Abraham Van Helsing (sillier name) and instead of actual character development, describing the twisted, incomprehensible peculiarities that his crew constitutes. Van Helsing herself sports a spray on stubble and carries a body warmer throughout a kind of 80's tribute to Han Solo (I think). The Demeter Captain appears in some crazy video diary time and again to give us nothing in an outspoken German accent (unfortunately, subtitles are not included). Crewmember Mina controls the abandoned ship (alone ??) armed with only a firearm-shaped torch and thick Eastern European accent while talking to Van Helsing on his ship bridge (it is basically a single glittering wall). Mina carries a gas mask with rubber hoses glued to the front. It can only be described as a skateboarder in a black mantle that constantly slides through the camera. Why this happens if the Vampire is not yet made flesh is never explained. This leads to a shaky camera that Mina drives into the corridors until she walks in Humvee. It is possible that Will Smith may be writing to write Humvee's lines, as most of them consist of Humvee which reminds us that he is black every ten seconds and the word "ass" says enough for a Guinness book record entry while it's all in a "From DA hood" accent (that's the year 3000, the DA chop up?) One of the biggest issues with this movie is that it is insanely trying to propose its set in the year 3000 set. Unfortunately, anyone with healthy eyes does not "buy it because the Demeter looks suspicious like a Soviet-style ocean tanker. Perhaps the film crew thought it would be good to leave hammer and sickle symbols everywhere and a sexy Lenin poster next to a lot of lockers and explain it as a kind of futuristic communist comeback special. The crew's apparel looks as if they have been caught out of an Oxfam collection box (sealed since 1993) and they are armed against the teeth with the latest automatic weapons of the 20th century (with added 3000 firing added) which, of course, absolutely no use against vampires. Healthcare is a thing of the past (in the future) if the sympathetic professor does not only wear glasses but is in a wheelchair? My god who happened to all the genetic engineering. <br /> <br /> The professor is an interesting character because he is a direct rip from Alien Resurrection, who had his own rag-tag misfit crew with a man in a wheelchair (who was strange was not murdered). Fans did not go to Prof, as he was scared in many screens. If I were haunted by bad acting vampires in a non-wheelchair access Soviet ship, and everyone left me because I was such a whore, I'd be scared too. <br /> <br /> During the UN dramatic Mina backstage, the prof tell us (with feeling) "it's disturbing". The rest of his lines are also confusing, "bugger" and "We will all die". X 100 follows. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak appears as the Fish Captain (what happened to 1st officers?) in what I thought would be the tired, standard problem, stubborn, no ambiguity, "don't look me up unless I also told ", beat 10 stuntman at one time super babe, but it's a Z-flick so she basically wears a stiff low cut above and even stiffer leather pants. Coolio's performance boosts the ham factor by 90% and is campervan as a row of tents, but fortunately for us he dies soon enough. Although he appears to hold his heart on the right side of his body. <br /> <br /> After much running up and down in the same corridor, using clunky soviet style controls, and sitting in the Soviet style dressing rooms the crew find themselves stranded as their own ship buggers to become a more interesting crew. to find (probably). Why Dracula is even called is unknown, as the main bad man is called Orlock, who is Space Transylvanian for "crimes against fashion", as he looks in a big, puffy, shirty shirt, and even bigger, striped collar that Hammer Horror Vampires in comparison. Orlock stops explaining his entire back story (off camera) to Erica Eleniak, but fails to kill her in another rip-off turn of Alien Resurrection. His story is such a load of minced meat, it's not worth repeating. Since the budget can't afford fight coordinators, special effects, original music, writing (not written by a chimpanzee) and even proper end titles (the first list I've seen, are the same characters, but totally different and Italian names). To destroy whatever you started. The crew are fortunate enough to fight back with the help of a computer that contains dark, millennial references to killing fictional creatures and some handy 20th-century pool buttons found in the shipping room. The end is terrible and a little suspicious, or they ran out of money or the ex-soviets asked their ship back. I walked in this movie and knew it was bad but unaware of how bad it really was.
