The main characters of this slave drive, Mel (Ethan Hunt), say several times: "She deserves better than that!" The "she" he is referring to is Ginger, played by beautiful Brandy Davis, who does earn better than that. Brandy deserves better than this movie, its lame script, and distorts Mel. A man who is going to watch his dream girl, has sex with another man, even in the virtual world, does not deserve her ONLY. An A for simulated sex scenes, a F for writing.
