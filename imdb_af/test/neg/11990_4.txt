There is only one reason why this movie is viewable. To Schweiger. He is such a good actor, the movie is not quite terrible. Your Boll appeals. The special effects and action are acceptable. All the other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (an evening with ...) talked about Tim Burton, who never read the Batman cartoons and it showed. Your Boll has never played the video games he is making movies about. If you ever want to know how this is done, check out Andrzej Bartkowiak. Doom was one of the best video games to ever make adjustments. Some people may disagree, but if you watch the movie, you can see that the guys at ID had a lot to do with Doom. It doesn't seem like someone at UBIsoft was even close to this production.
