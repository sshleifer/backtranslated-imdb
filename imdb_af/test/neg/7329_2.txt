This movie is available as a special "bonus" feature on Horror 101 & Horror 102: Endgame. This has nothing to do with these movies, except that it proves that producers / directors are Dudelson and Clavell in a coil. Like these other films, this one has young people going to a building where they are trapped inside, and running down the corridors a lot while choosing one. In the end, one or more characters are revealed to have a different identity. This is by far the worst of the three. <br /> <br /> Here, people are invited to a Halloween night-only opening of the Museum of the Dead. The museum does not have many exhibits, and they are all kind of ancient central American relatives. There are also carnivorous, spreading zombies in the museum, as well as an old cannibal warrior and two female warriors. <br /> <br /> The movie is very repetitive. It kills people fairly quickly, to the point you are wondering who they are going to kill - after which some people appear without explanation so they can be killed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, one of the characters has a cell phone and can actually call the police, who actually take it seriously and appear at the museum. If one tries to catch up with the lock to come in, the other tells him it would be a "forced entry". If you got trapped in a damaged building, I think it is irrelevant. The police are also stupid when they shoot a zombie in the head, they go off, but then they shoot other zombies in the chest and they don't go off. They shoot another zombie in the head, and it goes down. They continue to shoot the rest of the zombies in the chest. Stupid. <br /> <br /> The opening credits and a nightmare series are done in a kind of animation effect on video, a poor man's Waking Life kind of thing, but not so cartoony. It's interesting, but parts of some of the attacks are done the same way, so there's no logic about it. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
