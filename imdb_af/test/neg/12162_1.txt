Firstly, the nature of the movie is beautiful, and there is a bit of Mongolian music. Well, the horses looked Mongolian and the camels, but it's about everything Mongolian was in. Oh, Borders is played by a Mongolian actress, even if it's a lame thing. But she's beautiful, which saves a bit of lack of performance on her part. <br /> <br /> But I completely failed to understand what was the point of this painful-to-watch piece of 1.30 hour fantasy created by Mr.Bodrov. The plot had no sense of belonging. There was no logic behind the development of the plot. In fact, there was almost no story, just a number of detached scenes with a lot of guys in "Mongolian" clothes, and talking a little pidgin that is supposed to sound Mongolian. Most actors were Japanese, Russian or Chinese, most scenes were shot in China, Kazakhstan or Russia and there were many disturbing pathos about what it should be as a "Mongolian". The dialogue is primitive and the dialogue screens are slow. The battle scenes are laughing. All the supernatural pathos are lame and of course there to make the lack of the story. <br /> <br /> The Japanese actor was like a wooden doll, and looking at him, one would have no idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes. For most of the film, he looked sleepy, soft, stiff and sad. <br /> <br /> And I don't even want to start with the historical relevance of this piece of film waste. To see Chinggis-khan half of the movie as a slave, to see that her two first children of other men are born, to see his wife sell her to the Tangut dealer, start boiling my blood. And where is the beautiful story about the friendship between Temujin and Jamukha? One can make a good movie. Where is the story of the rise of Temujin? From his childhood, from his relationship with his family, with his brothers, how he struggled to survive under powerful enemies of his family? where is Van Khan, what helped him a lot? where is the portrayal of life in the steppe, of the life of the nomads, of their traditions, of their relationship with the other nations around them? <br /> <br /> Where are the characters developing? We don't quite see what Temujin brought with Jamukha, and what made them apart and most importantly, how Temujin Chinggis-khan became, how he succeeded in unleashing an outcast without wealth and military power to unite the Mongol tribes and such an organized and effective war machine that shattered one nation to another and created the greatest landscapes in history. All of these can make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters, but unfortunately we have seen nothing in Bodrov's creation, not even a glance.
