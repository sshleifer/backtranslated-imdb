George Zucco was a fine actor, who often plays gimlet-eyed villains with a capricious intensity. But even he can't save this dull and flat-footed B movie. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays the usual evil scientist, dr. Lorenzo Cameron, who believes that wolf's blood injected into man can create an invincible. Army of wolf men who can win World War II (figure out!). Experiment on Pedro's maid (Glenn Strange). Zucco creates a werewolf that looks more like Dave Allen plays in his comedy sketches! Of course, Pedro is based on Lennie van Van Muise And Men, and you almost expect him to say "Duh, okay, George!" There is a frightening moment when the werewolf kills a child by going through the window and grabbing it, but mostly it is a routine and pedestrian - many pedestrians - 77 minutes walk through all the old clich√©s that are much better others are done. movies.We also get the vengeance of the devil's baton, which in itself is a loan from Son of Frankenstein! <br /> <br /> Zucco is wasted and you just have to watch him in movies like Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes, The Mummy's Hand and Dr. Renault's Secret to see how wasted. Some atmospheric swamp scenes are all it really offers. And the scene where Zucco demonstrates his wolf-man technique for those who doubt him (again shades of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) are inadvertently hilarious. <br /> <br /> None of the better 40's B movies.
