In 1970, feminists invaded the "Miss World" beauty competition in London and stopped the opportunity by peeling the stage with flour and eggs. Why? Because they felt right or wrong that the event was humiliating and humiliating for women. I do not criticize their actions. It is a free world in which we live. What I want to know is: why do their contemporary equivalents not fall into the studios where such shows are made and done? <br /> <br /> 'Sex & The City' is about four self-absorbed women from New York: Carrie is a slave in fashion who becomes a pussycat when a man bangs as much as his eyes on her , Charlotte Finding the perfect man (they don't exist, love) so she can use sex to relieve the poor devil. Miranda scares people by being unwavering like 'out of touch with my emotions' and lastly we have Samantha, the living personalization of the old Martini ad 'anytime, anywhere, anywhere'. Feminists hold these characters - especially Samantha - as a shining example of contemporary women. Well, if there are rude words written in busy restaurants, progress is, I think the feminists should take a long look at themselves and what they are supposed to represent. <br /> <br /> "Sex & The City" The Creation of a man, it would have been pulled from the airwaves because it was sexist. Instead, like 'Charlie's Angels' before that, it meant that intelligent women thought it was a positive force for good. There is something very clinical and cold-blooded about the show. "The Benny Hill Show" was also sexist, but at least it was funny.
