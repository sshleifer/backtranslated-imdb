Anyone who complains about making Peter Jackson movies should sit by this CBS event for too long. There are about 45 minutes of the story filled with 2 hours of unnecessary subplots, with a spectacular TV drama click. Bad science is a staple for crappy weather disaster movies, so I'm not going to complain about it. Dumb science can be fun to see if it's done in an amusing way. What kills this movie is that it's 10 subplots ... which can all be cut out without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot. The one character that is entertaining to watch in Category 6 is Tornado Tommy, despite being a very annoying stereotype. <br /> <br /> Please note that I do not bother with the comments on special effects. Their quality should not be surprising. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
