I got this movie in a package called "50 all-star movies" for $ 18 (45 cents each). Many are good. This one was terrible. It was a hackneyed retread done 1000 times before and every time better. A disabled ex-jock is risking to divert a team of young criminals. They learn from him that they can do this if they play through the rules. I'm sure the kids and locals were excited to be included in a "real TV movie", but I can't imagine what the people who launched and produced this project could add to this already skipped box . I kept waiting to see a new twist or a new angle, but honestly, it didn't come. Avoid this movie. Forget the 45 cents, I want to return the 96 minutes of my life.
