I'm trying to find something of value here. The best thing I can gather is that Truffaut wanted to make a movie so annoying, painful, puerile, annoying, illogical and brainless as the experience of being in love. If it was his goal, he succeeded, but the solution to his practice is really a sign to look at. <br /> <br /> There is one scene screaming for a ghost: Belmondo compares the characteristics of Deneuve's face to the features in a landscape. All I could think of was "glacier", "ice floe", "two lonely fishermen carrying army surplus on a frozen lake in Minnesota." <br /> <br /> The only other point of interest was the resurrection of Buffoon's theory of climate determinism. The tropics are presented as paradise, and things are getting worse as they get colder, hell is Calvinist French Switzerland. It was kind of funny.
