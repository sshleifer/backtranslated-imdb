The only reason I classified this movie as 2 is because Channing Tatumis is beautiful, but the whole movie has no emotion and was boring to watch. Usually I love a good romance, but it was just a waste of time, I didn't scrap a tear, though it contains sad content. It was not very good at all. I'm not a film critic, but I only recommend girls to really avoid it, unless the only reason you're watching is to see Channing Tatum, lol, the rest of the movie is garbage and if he doesn't was not (not that his acting was good) I would have stopped watching much faster. This is a pity, because if the right actors were chosen for this movie, it could be the potential to be a real tear. .. If you are looking for a good cry or a movie for a glittering night ... give this one a miss !!
