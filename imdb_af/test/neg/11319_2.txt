This is probably a story in which a GREEN MAN tells a story about his youth. Yet you see things like personal computers, e-mails, faxes, etc., which are items used in the late 20th and early 21st. <br /> <br /> So when should this man tell this story - by 2020. Give, I wonder how advanced we are then. How is that telling us. <br /> <br /> There are also several legal issues that don't make sense either. In the courtroom scene, the story falls into the ordinary lapses of surprise evidence, which is inadmissible in any court in this country. Also, grandmother must be missing at least seven years in most states before being declared officially dead. <br /> <br /> Congratulations Elmo Shropshire. You are now officially a sale.
