Awful. Totally terrible. Long, confusing and uncomfortable. After about three hours of this painful mess, the end is really the last nail in the coffin. Not even the beautiful, sexy, beautiful goddess Francesca Annis can save this poor adaptation of Agatha Christie's work. The plot drag and drop and time go slow and suddenly you realize that you don't even have an idea of ​​what's going on. By the end, even with the usual explanation by the villain, are there many things that are inexplicable and then? It's over. A complete waste of time and no doubt one of the worst adjustments to bear the name of Agatha Christie.
