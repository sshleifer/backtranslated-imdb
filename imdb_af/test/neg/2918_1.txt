If one were to return to the beginning of the talk photo, a bright future for Harold Lloyd would be predicted. Unlike his rivals, he was a comedian actor trained at the legal stage and not performed in the piano of the music hall or vaudeville circuit. He had a good voice that suited his image. In addition, from 1924, she included "silent" films sequencing based on audience gossip sounds (eg, The FRESHMAN's Fall Frolic's clock series and THE KID BROTHER's monkey series). Yet Lloyd's sound features have consistently failed at the cashier's office as soon as the novelty of WELCOME FARER has ebbed. Lloyd blames her for many external sources, but never realized that the glass character's enemy was not healthy, but the Great Depression. Pre-depression audiences, uncomfortable with optimism, can have rooted for this ambitious go-getter in whom they have seen their surrogate; Depression audiences despised him as the person likely to shut down on their bandage and throw them into the gutter. To put together this problem of character choice, Lloyd's perception is as a sincere, happy handler. Sincerity, of course, is a subjective assessment, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic education, could never play a convincing and complete conviction. Maybe it's because he feared to return to that state permanently. The CAT'S PAW fails for these reasons, but it suffers only from the revelation of Lloyd's pro-fascist agenda. Many film scholars believe that Lloyd was asked to make this film because he saw the FDR presidency as a dictatorship aimed at softening the rich and the gentler on the crime. We must remember that he was not alone in this feeling. DeMille targeted this day and age, a pro-police state drama, the previous year. We also need to remember that America was founded by a solid taxpayer and is still motivated by those who want something without paying for it. TCP suffered because it lightly dealt with fascism in a "comedy" and because its release was particularly poor, given the events in Germany that year. The Production Code of 1934 will ultimately limit the glorification of vigilante justice and re-establish the rule of constitutional law cumbersome as it may be. The ideal of the benevolent despot, the prospective almighty leader that resulted in a utopia that was previously freed from the control and balance of this omnipotence, dates back to classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter, although it serves as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film demonstrating the democratic experience of the country of origin, shows that FDR's America was safe enough to accept criticism. One sees no parallel criticism in Hitler's Germany, Stalin's USSR, or Mussolini's Italy. But can one laugh at the gall humor of hanging fascism? Lloyd's unpublished movie has been moved to the right and may have been written by Dr Goebbels himself if he had a sense of humor. It offers an alternative history in which a chosen order is restored and lost through any essential, and doing with good nature and fun. The threatening fascism approached by the left is, of course, Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR. The latter movie has the advantage of being in another country and based on a sparsely populated person and event. THE GREAT DICTATOR is still low-yielding today because it estimates the extent of man's evil, but it succeeds despite its relentless and inappropriate speech, as it has the clear advantage of being justified by history. However, Lloyd must be credited for two things. First, he made no further pro-fascist films, nor did he produce any hypocritical pro-allied films in the War. Second, he never sold TCP to television. The world of post-1945 saw the face of fascism and it was not amusing.
