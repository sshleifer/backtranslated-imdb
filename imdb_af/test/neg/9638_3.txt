This is one of the so-called "Hollywood Social Commentary" movies that want both. And believe me, in this movie, both ways are split and stereotypical. STOP-LOSS is a 21st-century John Wayne movie dealing with some anti-war sentiments, but it is clear that "If you are a MAN in today's society, you get your act together and draw you In many ways, the movie was a great successor to TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE, as it depicts an army as crazy and out of control, a quasi-FRAT PARTY / ANIMAL HOUSE extravaganza mixed with a Texas Red Neck world of suppressed gay erotic evidence of masculinity.This movie has it all in one scene after another of clich√©d images, and then the rebellious military despair, Ryan Phillippe, is a "Road Trip" with the best friend's girlfriend, an artificial storyline manipulation to visit families of dead soldiers, murdered soldiers in military hospitals, etc. and ultimately break the issue of flight to Canada or Mexico, but male honor and patriotism eventually win as everything is scrubbed and pretty, he drives in the sunset on a bus with his friends back to Iraq and a world a few minutes before he assured everyone he could never tolerate again. FULL METAL JACKET meets SANDS OR IWO JIMA. But in the end, John Wayne is driving again! And a Hollywood Blockbuster finally gets both sides of his audience in the palm of his hand ???? At least it would like to think. As for me, just take me back to the more convincing reality of GARDEN OF ELAH.
