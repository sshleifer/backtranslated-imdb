The movie is beautiful. Well pictured, but not originality. <br /> <br /> This movie is copied directly from "The Hitch" where Salman plays as a Date Dr. like Will Smith and Govinda like a little jerk, who is desperate to fall in love with her boss at the end, the movie comes to an old Indian Flimi style, the bride's father doesn't like the bride's lover and gets other bridegroom, and Govinda, the bride's lover, finally comes up and saves her from the new groom and fancy dance and stuff. <br /> <br /> The comedy was really good, no doubt when the gate met, Hindi would be more fun. <br /> <br /> Finally worth a watch, but when it comes to TV after a few months ...
