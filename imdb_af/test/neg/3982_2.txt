This movie had an interesting enough plot on clones and organ consumption, but it failed because the main actor was so annoying and clever that you wanted to kill him. Not that anyone else is very good at it, but if you hate the character that is supposed to give you sympathy, the movie just fails to work. Strangely enough, a movie seems to be coming out in the near future, with a plot reflecting this one with more action and a better role, though I can't think of anything else, but this movie was like watching it. This movie has a super stupid clone that is somehow clever enough to see that something is wrong with its camp where people ride one mile per hour and struggle for no reason. The counselors tell them that when they're ready, go to America, but our "hero" has doubts, so he prunes around and teaches the awful truth that drives him bad guys, which the man repeatedly shoots. He looked out for the man he was cloned on. Peter Graves is in it and so is Dick Seargent, but they add nothing to this movie that looks like something made for television. On the positive side, although "The Island" comes out, the makers of this movie can proudly say, "We first thought about it".
