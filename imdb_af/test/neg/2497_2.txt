Six stars for Paul Newman's depiction of General Groves, four negative for the inclusion of a highly fictional event where truth is well documented. Michael Merriman didn't really exist. His character - or at least his fate - is loosely based on that of Louis Slotin, a Canadian physicist who did not come to Los Alamos after the war. He performed his deadly "dragon's tail" experiment in May 1946. It's a critical point. The effects of hard radiation on the human body were not known until they were observed in the victims of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki storms. If someone died before the Trinity test at Los Alamos, radiation poisoning, it is quite possible that scientists would suddenly stop their work and change history. Whether it's better or worse, we can only speculate. Someone should ask the producers and the director whether they have Merriman's character for dramatic effect or deliver an anti-core message. For a more equal and accurate treatment of events at Los Alamos during the Manhattan project, see the TV movie "Day One" or better, read the Peter Wyden book on which it is based.
