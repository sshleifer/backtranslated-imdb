Cage plays a drunk and gets high critical praise. Elizabeth Shue should actually do a love seen with the most unappealing and overstated piece of meat in Hollywood. I literally lifted up while watching this movie. Of course, I had flu, but that doesn't mean that this movie didn't contribute to the vomit in the camode. <br /> <br /> Why can't Nick Cage play anything he can really distract like a bad actor. Nick Cage who is brilliantly in a role as a bad actor. Heck no one can do it better. <br /> <br /> The search started with Nick's contract with Lucifer or was it Lou Cipher of Night Train To Terror.
