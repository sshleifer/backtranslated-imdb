Not to be confused with Michael Ritchie's nasty 1975 beauty stocking gown, this "Smile" is a downward example of the good intentions the road ends up in hell. <br /> <br /> The film parallels two stories: a poor poor father sacrifices his wife and son a gift-conscious orphan, called Ling (Yi Ding), and a Malibu family raised by Malibu. feed, "Gidget Get Birth Control." Katie (Mika Booram, the third Olsen twin) plays a pampered, self-absorbed high school deviating from reality. Her teacher (Sean Astin) opens the way for a school trip to China aimed at showing students how to work with distorted children. <br /> <br /> The movie uses deformity as a tension team to treat Ling like the Frankenstein monster. . Kramer constantly breaks her deformity through hats, hoods and camera placement. This approach uses the freak show quality inherent in the material. She may be uncomfortable with the way society sees her and Kramer's answer is to cover her up to the great revelation. Why disturb your audience with such unpleasantness? We see her face briefly at the end, and just a few minutes before her closing credit photos after the operation, a swan indicates the harelip. It's not good enough to give the girl a reason to live; What is necessary is Ling as hot and popular as Katie. <br /> <br /> Funding for the film came from a trust created by the late Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. They have presented a legacy of quality family movies. Give me 'Son of Paleface' any day.
