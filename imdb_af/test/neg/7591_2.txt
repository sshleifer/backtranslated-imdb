I saw this movie one midnight and I can say it's worse than other horror movie about a haunted house. Alexandra Paul is not one of the best actress, but she can do the role better. The girl gets worse, it's an example of a Bad actress, she doesn't have the future in the big world of movies. CENTER FOR DAMNED HOUSE: BAD
