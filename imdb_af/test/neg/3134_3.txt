Bardem is wonderful. Actresses are wonderful. But Amenabar doesn't have to do this. It's good that he defends his position on euthanasia, an extremely delicate matter. But to do this, he loses his point: the movie is fake, offensive to the intelligence, full of tricks and even extremely boring. Some scenes are advertising material, more than a movie. Women are incredibly attracted to this sensible sick man who wants to kill someone and not understand its implications. He doesn't care for anyone and thanks them for their caring, love and attention. I think Amenabar might have reminded people of this matter in a different way, but the way he decided to do so, I believe is not correct. He could make his point stronger and exposed the other side of the coin without mocking it.
