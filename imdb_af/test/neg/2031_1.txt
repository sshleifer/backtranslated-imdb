Somewhere in the US, the young Clair manipulates her friends Mic, Billy and John, who show a letter that Bob will send to her and the group of cowardly bats. Bob and Mic kill him with a piece of wood in the forest. Mic feels sad and decides to tell his mother what he did, but John and Billy threaten him with tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> I believe "The Wind" is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The horrible script is ridiculous and it is almost impossible to write a summary, since there is no story or plot, only rows of disconnected scenes. The amateurist and acting are incredibly poor and terrible. It's amazing how producers invest money in such garbage, distributors distribute this crap worldwide and viewers like me buy this DVD. I waited until the last scene because I was curious to see how bad this movie could be and I was impressed because it was worse than I could imagine in my lowest expectations. Eventually, I wonder why IMDb doesn't offer zero in the voting system, as the garbage really deserves this vote. My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Força Invisível" ("Invisible Force")
