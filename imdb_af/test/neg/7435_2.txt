LTL is the kind of formal, hopeless comedy that is enjoyed by the kind of sheep that stop and listen when they play a band playing in a mall. <br /> <br /> I remember Murray promoting LTL on Larry King's crappy CNN show, where he said something like "if this movie is not a hit, I will stop movies (or comedies)" make". He was not as jovial as one might think; he had felt that the LTL was a sure fire and that his failure would mean his status as a star fell noticeably - thus a kind of ultimatum live-on-air to his fans for their hard-earned money on a stupid elephant comedy. (The comedy is stupid, not the elephant.) Or maybe he only realized during the shootings (or when he saw the final cut) what a turkey it was, and he desperately tried to convince everyone how much optimism he had had about LTL's quality. "Go see it, it's really good!" Actors are prostitutes sold with brothers. <br /> <br /> LTL is the kind of fun project that comes from the "Comedy" school's comedy; Their motto: "If you ever run out of ideas - or if you never had one in the first place - then keep an animal in the plot and it will at least be an element of sweetness." Cuteness = a sad replacement for the lack of funny gags. The other motto "Friends" was: "Always include senseless, dull sentimentality," ending this film so predictably, when Murray rather pathetically says, "What they forgot to tell you is that you never forget an elephant not ". Maybe not an elephant, but I managed to easily forget this turkey, which I saw years ago. Suddenly I was reminded when I saw a scene on TV today (this equally senseless review). <br /> <br /> Murray wastes his talent on this turkey (disguised as an elephant), but he's not nearly as uninteresting / bad as McConaughey (or man's name is spelled); one would think that M.M. would have had an easy time playing himself, that is, a hiccup, but he is so painfully unfriendly and unconvincing that I can hardly stand to see him making such a jackass out of himself. It was unbeatable. To round off this nonsense, we have that generous X buffoon, Garofalo, in a rather useless role. Then again, everything about LTL is useless ... After LTL, which was so famous, Murray became more and more of a "serious actor". What about these comedians and their inferiority complex? Is this all about awards, ie "recognition of their peers" (read: voices of their moron colleagues)? This piece of crap made the end of a string of good and good movies Murray made in the early and mid 90's, such as "Groundhog Day", "Quick Change", "Mad Dog & Glory", "Kingpin", "What of Bob? "and" Ed Wood ". Recently, we had the immense pleasure of seeing him in garbage / mediocre like "Hamlet", "Lost In Translation" (you just can't get away from these "talented Coppolas") and "Broken Flowers". Compare the two bundles. <br /> <br /> One man describes LTL "funny as heck". Now it's the kind of audience this movie hoped for ... Shopping centers and trailer parks ...
