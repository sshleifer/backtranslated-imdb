I was invited to release an early movie release in four months before it was released. I had to watch the film and then fill in a packet on my mind. It was the hardest thing to sit on earth. The show just crawled through, and you quickly began to wish you were dead. The thing is, there are two types of Mormon movies. The good ones with real good stories, and the crappy ones that simply stink. Saints and Soldiers, now there is a good movie. But with these wannabe comedies, the authors and the actors are just trying too hard. Basically, they try to be funny when they are not. No wonder why there is such a small target audience for these movies; They are filled with "inside jokes" that aren't funny to start with, and they just try to have fun on average things. It's the story that makes the movie, and the stories for these movies are just bad. I'm sure you can guess how my parcel looked when I was told to fill it in the movie. ;)
