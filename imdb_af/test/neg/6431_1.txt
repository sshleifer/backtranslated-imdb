11:11 a.k.a. Hell's Gate (2004) is another bad horror movie trying too hard to be something it isn't. A young girl has an imaginary playmate. One day while playing in the veld with her friends, a few refugees visit her parents and skip them without a clear reason. The young girl walks away and hides from the bad men. Years later, the girl grows in a woman with problems. Losers at her school (resembling oppressed homosexual men) mocked their masculinity before rejecting one of them. The girls hate her and life in general is miserable to her. A secret of her past returns to visit her. Who or what is this? Why does everyone hate her? What is her Guardian's problem with her? To find out, you need to see the Hell's Gate. <br /> <br /> The new title makes absolutely no sense. I don't know why people get money to make such bad movies. This movie is not even good enough to make fun. It is a pain caused by a pain that confuses a little. Not worth it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
