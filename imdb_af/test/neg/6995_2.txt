The film made here in 1980 is not the movie available at Something Weird Video in their "Driver's Ed Scare Movies Vol. 5". For one thing, the 1980 version is in color. SWV has an earlier release (1972) of the film made in B&W for WLTT television channel 5 in Cincinnati on this disk. Anyway, this movie is notorious. However, unlike most other drivers' films, it was broadcast and watched by the general public. So the level of massacre was cut off. It's still a bit of grim practice in exploiting the bloody death for an alleged educational purpose. I live in the Cincinnati area and I remember this thing being shown around prom time every year on Channel 5. If you are looking for a movie that shows the tone of this unique American motion picture, "The Last Prom" is quite typical - morose, hyperbolic, extremely didactic, heavy on melodrama. Whether it's really a teenager's drive, anyone's guess.
