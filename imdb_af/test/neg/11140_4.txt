Yes, it is pure trash. It might be interesting for every guy who wants an experimental theater (like me) to chat low-life and do nothing for almost two hours, but it becomes very painful when you realize you've actually paid for it. Probably, this is one of those movies you love to watch for its complete emptiness and nihilism. However, I accept it for its shock value, decades before Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction.
