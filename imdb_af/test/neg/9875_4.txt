When HULK hit theaters in 2003, it was not long before DVDs of the old Incredible Hulk TV show attempted to enter into the fool. We saw a similar appearance a year when Spider-Man cartoons appeared on DVD to coincide with the hero's big screen debut. Companies are leaping on the opportunity to drive the financial competition of a hot brand. <br /> <br /> The fact that this photo never went up on the shelves of Wal-Mart cloned the heroes in the summer. of 2005 says a lot. I think everyone involved will just forget about it. To be honest, the FANTASY FOUR is not as bad as everyone says. Let me repeat this. It is not as unpleasant as any of its negative reviews may suggest. <br /> <br /> Veteran television actor Alex Hyde-White (no, you don't remember any of his roles) leads the way like Reed Richards, the brilliant scientist who, with his crew, gets bizarre powers after outer space accident. He is left with the ability to stretch and twist his body to far-reaching lengths. His future wife, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab), may suddenly become invisible, while her brother Johnny (Jay Underwood) can now turn on. Then there is poor Ben Grimm (Michael Bailey Smith), the sweet air whose body morphs into a mass of crazy orange rock. <br /> <br /> Just as the friends get used to it, they are called to save the world of some chaos. It seems Reed's old colleague Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) is experiencing his name, and the evil jeweler (Ian Trigger) not only helps old ladies across the street. Can our heroes save the day? Of course they can; Like any superhero movie, it's just a matter of how and when. <br /> <br /> What is striking about THE FANTASTIC FOUR is how amateurish it is in virtually every aspect. The dialogue is so lame and tired, it sounds like it was written by a junior high drama class. The play is so unpolished. It makes a third-night noon soap like Shakespeare. The special effects are surprisingly good in view of the tiny budget, but there are still some positive embarrassments. For example, when the human torch ignites its body fully, for example, the whole movie becomes a cartoon. I can only hear that production meeting. "Oh no one will notice. They'll be too much of the action!" I really mean a cartoon? Give me at least a mannequin on fire that is held by a rope! Before that is the scene in which the foursome come to earth after their spacecraft collapses, pure teens are in the backyard. The crew simply found a field and set a vague spaceship object on fire. This is the only remnant of such a great disaster? <br /> <br /> Of course, there wasn't much to do with writing. There is a fairly coherent story here, but it's all so simple. When Reed and Ben decide to go into outer space, they just fall to the Stormers' house and ask if they want to attend. Is it really that easy? Don't need these kinds of things, oh I don't know, years of training and expertise? Not in the world of these writers, apparently inspired by the underestimated genius displayed on the screen in VOLHUISRERUNS. But as bad as it may be, nothing compares to how painful Dr. He was drawn straight from the terrific superhero cartoons from the 1960s, laughing to the evil and punching his pinch fist on the table to distinguish his remarks. No comic book, the least of all Fantastic Four, ever saw a villain so obscene one dimensionally. <br /> <br /> Finally, the FANTASY FOUR is saved from a complete turkey because it is just as innocent. You can really tell the people involved, try as little talent or experience as they have. They didn't know that the final result would be so shy. They were under the impression that it was their big break, that people would stream to the theaters. It says they had virtually no money to work with (and I'm sure half of that was eaten by the cool Thing costume). All the things they have considered have done well, and for the many mistakes, the final product is a great fun for fans.
