There are no - NO redeeming qualities for this movie. They didn't check a single fact - NOT ONE over ... anything. I feel sorry for Larry Miller, and even sorry for his agent that he is no longer able to find him a more suitable place. <br /> <br /> The adults are all idiotic. The effects are cheesy and without any sense of reality. The music is honestly cheesy. The plot is out of faith. <br /> <br /> I want to see something with your family, see anything else. Take a moment and look at mold on your attic. My ten-year-old mocks this movie when we see it. Unfortunately, he learns that not every movie is worth watching.
