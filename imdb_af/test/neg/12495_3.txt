CyberTracker is in the near future in Los Angeles where bodyguard Eric Phillips (co-producer Don 'The Dragon' Wilson) rescues Senator Robert Dilly (John Aprea) from a murder attempt by a group known as the UHR, the Union of Human Rights , who is angry at Dilly, issued the computerization of the computerized legal system in the route called robots CyberTrackers to determine and convict the conviction. Anyway, Eric saves Dilly, who is very impressed and decides to see if he can trust Eric in his shadow as the cold-blooded murder of a traitor. He is the fine-hearted man that he is Eric, is not impressed when Dilly kills a woman & he is asked to keep it quiet. Eric escapes and sets Dilly down, but Dilly has many powerful friends. He used his influence to frame Eric and his CyberTrackers sent out to search for him. <br /> <br /> Co-produced & Directed by Richard Pepin I think movies like CyberTracker give movies a bad name, I didn't like it that way. The script of Jacobsen Heart is pretty predictable, it doesn't excite, it steals most ideas and themes from other better sci-fi movies. The happy mix of martial arts action and sci-fi fortunately not so good. There are a few battles, a few jackals and some shooting results, but all is pretty dull and forgetful. The film has no imagination as the film is set in the future and it is about robots, technology and the way society runs and that is especially the legal system. Speaking of which the fantastic Robocop (1987) is mixed, it is violent action and clever social commentary brilliant, but CyberTracker does not even attempt any relevant social statement or attempt to portray a meaningful moral message on law enforcement. The script basically uses the concept of having robots and shooting outs that Robocop did, but also managed to include a good story. There is very little in CyberTracker that I can say, was entertaining and that's what the movies are right about? <br /> <br /> Director Pepin is doing OK, but nothing sticking out, it's all rather forgotten and it's not very exciting. The sci-fi elements are nothing more than the robotic side of things and the movie doesn't look so futuristic. The action scenes are good, there are some explosive cars and some shooting outs, but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> Technically, CyberTracker is average because a movie that is thought to be in the future already looks dated and the special effects are poor. The acting was bad, I wonder if Don 'The Dragon' signs Wilson with that name? <br /> <br /> CyberTracker was a waste of my time, there is nothing original or exciting here and the action is immediately forgotten. Poor and that is all that has to be said, not recommended.
