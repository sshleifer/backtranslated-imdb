This whole movie is just as horrible, it's a complete mess. The story is just as stupid I can't believe someone actually sat down and wrote about it and thought it would make a good movie! The acting is probably the worst of any b-movie ever made. I've seen many sci-fi type b movies before, and some of them are pretty good, some of them, but of Venus, never had to be made. <br /> <br /> Some filmmakers just think this is because they put something together and somehow got onto the shelves of a movie shop, that they've achieved something - it's good and should be looked at by people. This is not always true, and it is certainly not true of Van Venus. This movie loses on all accounts: terrible acting, dumb plot, very bad special effects, ugly costumes ever, non-realistic dialogue, bad direction, etc. You could just say this movie just took about $ 20 to make, and I might give it too much credit there! I urge you to stay away from this movie wreck for your own good!
