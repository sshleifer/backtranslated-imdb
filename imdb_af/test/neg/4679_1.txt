The use of the term "comedy" in relation to this documentary is an insult to the art of comedy, and even worse is the pain attributed to the viewers of this production. Almost nothing was funny. <br /> <br /> This documentary followed a small group of stand-up comics on the road as they traveled from town to town to play in small clubs. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that their conversations and behavior beyond the stage and on stage are indistinguishable, but unfortunately, equally indecent. <br /> <br /> It is possible to understand the self-esteem of grandeur that the well-known 'comedians' possess, but it is more difficult to understand the sounds of the laughter heard from their audiences. Perhas these are the same audiences for whom the lame sitcoms are meant for TV. <br /> <br /> It was possibly the worst movie I ever watched in my 50+ year movie show.
