It is a pity that many of the other opponents of this film seem to be due to prejudice. (that is, anger at the gay characters, think French speaking thrillers are bad, etc.). I will admit that I am unfamiliar with the novel, but as a movie, after about 45 minutes, I threw my eyes. Hopefully I can state my complaints in writing enough before I get sick to spend more time on this movie over the 2 hours of his hard length. (2 hours that feel like 3) don't get me wrong, I can sit by the hour and half silw movies, 3 hours epics, I don't have a short attention span, and I'm not so worried about the mtv -generation that I cannot appreciate a subtle and slow-build movie. Going here, my grocery list of complaints. First off, the end. Yes, it has a scooby-doo-esquire, character explains everything at the end. Now I actually think of this movie, it was necessary. The film has so many plot-twists, emotional revelations, new facts emerging and discovering. One reviewer said it well: ".. this is a very logical story, but without the essential back story (their children's stories, the relationship between the 3 parents, the relationship between the two love birds and the grandman's son), it feels. Just not right. Don't throw too many spoilers here. I could mention specific revelations I thought were unnecessary, but according to the reviews here there are many people who really like this, so I don't want to give anything. The complexity, and turning and turning, for me, had any impact that could possibly produce the final revelations, but by the end I did not care, there was no gaping plot holes necessarily; seems to make a good book, in WRITE it's quite logical, but if I'm supposed to believe it's REALITY, don't put something right with the pieces that happened randomly, too often I felt important characters we never knew e, was thrown in to complicate the plot, raise the emotion and develop the secret. The acting I had no complaints, directing, eh, not bad, but the plot, and especially its development, is completely lacking. Sorry for those who felt it was a perfect thriller, but I couldn't succeed. I gave it a 3 because I didn't want to look completely unfair, and it had moments of minor intrigue and excitement. <br /> <br /> * LARGE SPOILER * and I have to mention it ... but when the dad makes his revelation for Alexander and just when you think the plot could not fit in another twist. "your dad did not die a hunting accident ......................... you are serious !! Like the already complex plot of characters of all families and their relationship to each other, was it not enough? does the protagonist still need an emotional whallop as he has been feeding? sorry I had to throw such a spoiler, but it just as much bothered me as I ever touched any movie.
