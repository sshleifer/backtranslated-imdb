Screening the Comic Broadway Success "The Gay Divorce" (a title that is considered scandalous for US movie makers, although used in the UK) relates to a husband and wife (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) who gets embarrassed while in the process of separating her husband; they dance, argue, make up, dance, argue more and dance more. Betty Grable is very attractive in a short bit (singing and dancing in the song "Let's K-nock K-re" with openly faces Edward Everett Horton), but the star couple looks throughout and unhappy. The environment is screw-sophisticated, but the characters are no more than one-dimensional. * 1/2 of ****
