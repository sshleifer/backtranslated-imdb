Ramsay ?? the kings of comedy (or was it horror, whatever) wake up after years of hibernation. And yes, I was scared. No, not because of the horror element (of course, it's not that bad, of course), but because rats are constantly dancing on my feet in the khatmal chaos theater (where to run such movies). <br /> <br /> That's how the storyline goes. A man is repeatedly stabbed, killed, filled in plastic and poured into a pool. But he returns to take revenge. Now the movie was a thrill or a horror? It's the tension you have to discover. And the end seems to be another mask secret. Remember the trademark Ramsay shelter agents ?? men wear some silly horror masks. Only here is the mask of a human being. I suppose it's no longer necessary to skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Amarr Upadhyay tends to be dramatic and theatrical, forgetting the difference between theater and TV soaps. A cheap and slenderly dressed Aditi Gowitrikar in her typical pink lipstick looks like ??. (You know what). <br /> <br /> The background score is a straight lift from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Not a single section of the film, whether technical or creative, is worth commenting on. Newness is lacking both in story and performance. <br /> <br /> Dhund makes sure your senses are busy.
