<br /> <br /> This movie is so incredibly unfunny that someone is crying, the clich√© is placed on thicker than 5-year-old peanut butter and in such a way that it sucks humor from your heart, every single joke was bad timely and would not have been funny if it was scheduled correctly. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie, there's a real chance you'll never be able to come back to comedies ... ever.
