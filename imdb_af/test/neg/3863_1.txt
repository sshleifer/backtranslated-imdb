Film Noire is a genre that requires a certain level of tact, cleverness, intellect and images. This movie has nothing of it, though they really tried hard with the images. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie your cousin Marky will make the truck driver, who is always talking about how he'll make the movies one day. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is wood and lifeless. The visuals, while of course expensive, are the work of a director who tried to be clever and failed because of a serious lack of cerebral palsy. The acting ranged from subpar to just bad. The story could be saved by a real writer and director, but I suspect that such people would not have touched it with a pole. <br /> <br /> About 1/4 of the way through, I noticed striking similarities. With the scene in Sim0ne where Viktor, desperately to get rid of his actress, makes the world's worst movie. I thought I'd check IMDb to see if a similar effect had occurred in this movie and to my surprise. I'll almost be tempted to give a 2 out of 10 just because it has exposed the pretentious groups, but I won't. It's so bad.
