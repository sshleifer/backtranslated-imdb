I don't really consider myself conservative, so I wasn't personally offensive to this movie, but it was pretty clear that the plot and characterization in this movie were secondary to the message. And the message is that all conservatives are either angry or stupid (or both). The characters are one-dimensional - either good, freedom-loving Americans, or brainless, greedy, evil conservatives. There is nothing smart or creative, just anti-conservative. I don't really care for the political bias itself, but it shouldn't be the only purpose behind the movie. And that's clear. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the role play is wonderful and Chris Cooper's impression of W is funny the first two or three times, but after that it's just the same old joke being told and so on. <br /> <br /> So if you really hate the Conservatives, you'll probably enjoy this movie, but if you're looking for something with realistic characters and a less black-and-white story then you'll be better off to look something else.
