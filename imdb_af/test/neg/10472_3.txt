In Sweet Water, ambitious entrepreneur Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) builds a resort in the middle of the desert under the protest of the Katonas. When three workers get Indian remains and bones in a ditch on the site, they accidentally release the giant skeleton like an animal known as Bone Eater. Their bones are swallowed by the monster. Half-breed chef Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner), including Running Wolf, is in charge of investigating the disappearance of the workers, which is being squeezed by Krantz to arrest the protesters. But the Bone Eater attacks and kills other residents, while Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) is looking for an old Tomahawk who can destroy the evil creature. <br /> <br /> "Bone Eater" is a lame and stupid movie, with one of the most ridiculous script I've ever seen. The characters and situation are not well developed and things happen without any further consequences. The conclusion is probably the worse part in this movie, with the typical white North American Bruce Boxleitner dressed as an Indian. In the story his grandfather Indian, his own wrist cut (why? And where's the blood later?) And throws the ax in the chest of the Bone Eater, and destroys the monster and my last hope for any improvement in the story. My final question: If the Boneeter is eating the bones, what happens to the flesh and clothing of its victims? My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Devorador de Ossos" ("The Bean Eater")
