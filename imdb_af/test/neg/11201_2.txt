Has it ever happened to you? I go to my local video store and see some new arrivals in the "film noir" section. I spy a copy of a new coming of a movie I've never seen, called NAKED ALIBI. It is from one of those mail order video companies that (mostly) "dupey" offer copies of difficult titles to find. The description on the box sounds good. The movie has players I want (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame, and Gene Barry). So I take it home and watch it. About ten minutes into this movie I started getting second thoughts. About half through this movie I didn't get it. By the time the movie ended, I didn't just keep it, I despised it. The film begins with police questioning Al Willis on suspicion of robbery. Unlike being drunk, the police have nothing on him. When he pushes a police and demands to be allowed to go home, the police strike him up. Detective Conroy arrives, letting the police finish the beat and then announcing that Willis is in the clear. Willis swears he'll get revenge. Later, one of the police officers was shot dead. With no evidence that Willis has hurt the beat, Conroy Willis makes his only suspect, despite the fact that his boss calls some of the suspects as suspects. Conroy arrests him, but Willis is released due to lack of evidence. The next day, two policemen were killed by a bomb. This time, Conroy goes to the Bakery that Willis owns and tries to beat a confession from him. Conroy doesn't know, but a local new man whose newspaper has been accused of Conroys's police brutality, understands a picture of Conroy, who is trying to choke. Willis and Conroy are fired. But Conroy will continue his quest and Willis flies to Mexico where Willis has a lover. Conroy succeeds in convincing his mistress (who will deal with Willis rather roughly) to help him prove that Willis is a murderer. What this film lacks is a compelling script. The disc seems to have just been drafted and launches a shoot before completing a completed script. Things happen, characters change personalities, plot turns take place for no real reason other than that the script asks for it. Unlike the fact that Willis would like to and now want to get a glass, there's nothing in the early part of the movie to make us think he's a crazy killer cheating on his wife. He treats his wife, child and employees well. Early in the film, one gets the impression that she is Conroy the one who is a loose cannon. He seems to be illegally approving of the brutality of the police. Conroy, without any reason, is convinced Willis has a criminal past. He seems to be working on the motto of the old Communist Bulgarian secret police; "Everyone is guilty of something, we haven't figured it out yet." Later, Conroy shows kindness to All's mistress and young boy, now we have to love him. Sorry! The early impression I got from Conroy kept me for too long. And he is also a stupid man. Only after being fired and going to Mexico, he runs a background test on Willis and discovers that a warrant has been issued to him in Maryland. Why didn't he think so before? Because this movie didn't have enough time. The throw is good. Gene Barry thinks well how poor his pregnant Al Willis role is. I'm a big fan of 40's and 50's crime generators, but I didn't just think this movie was good, it left a bad taste in my mouth (something many modern movies do, but older movies seldom do).
