After completing the sad novel, Heart of Darkness, I went further to see the movie, which was a complete and absolute disappointment. At the start, I expected the movie to help put the puzzle of a book together. Although I read the novel, the movie didn't make sense at all, so I can't imagine how lost I would be if I skipped the book completely. It seemed as if the authors had chosen their favorite parts and placed them in the movie, and left nothing out that allowed viewers to understand the meaningless plot. This horrible movie didn't make sense at all, and I would strongly recommend not to look at it, as it will do nothing more than make you completely astonished and confused.
