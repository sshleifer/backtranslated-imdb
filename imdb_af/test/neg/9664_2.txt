I don't think it gets too much about the story of this movie. The most important thing you will see is the extreme amateurishness of the whole production. The acting is what you would get if you chose people randomly from the street. The sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a shoot in your ear, while the dialogue is also one fifth as hard. Various sounds dominate the soundtrack to a great extent, with a far-back seated dialogue. The theme music sounds like it was about a quarter past when the movie was released, as much of the movie didn't have music at all. Camera work can best be described as a messed mess, with near-shots where a medium angle will be much better, walking around cameras and viewing the camera in every way, absolutely no attention to setting up any scene, they everything shot everything. From whatever position it was convenient for the cameraman to stand. If the cameraman is a foot higher than the actors and you end up looking at the top of everyone's heads, well, so too. Editing is just a butcher work; Everything is thrown in the most abrupt manner, nothing flows or transitions in any sense. I don't know if it's shot on video or maybe a rented video camera, I tend to think it was the latter. <br /> <br /> I just made it through this thing about three quarters of the way before turning it off. I was just as bad about the low quality of the production I couldn't take anymore. It's like a ninth grade audiovisual class project.
