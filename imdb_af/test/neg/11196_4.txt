The summary was promising, but watching the movie was a big disappointment. Nothing happens in this movie. Plot is linear and without surprise. Normal characters stay normal until the end of the movie, strange characters remain strange until the end of the movie. There is not even a single preliminary to dirty the viewer to think that the bad guy is someone other than the obvious candidate. On the positive side, actors play pretty well, and there is a little bit of atmosphere in the movie, but far too little to be meaningful. <br /> <br /> People who vote for this movie also don't see it, or are a member of the movie production team! 4 is well paid.
