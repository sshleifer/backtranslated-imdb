There is no way to say in words just how badly, how formless, impeccable and unfathomable these "fishing academy" films really are. You must experience one for yourself. For the third time in a row, writer-director Rick Sloane does not even show a gram of writing or director of talent. There is nothing about a person above the age of 5 believing or laughing, but the (very short) nudity and other "plot" elements make the movies inappropriate for children. This leads me to believe that they are really aimed at adults with the spiritual abilities of 5-year-olds. Elizabeth Kaitan is a welcome substitute for Linnea Quigley. She is bubbly and cute, and her wonderful big smile is about the only thing that can also make a viewer smile. But looking at her and the other girls in this movie are like watching a bunch of flowers in a desert-covered desert. (*)
