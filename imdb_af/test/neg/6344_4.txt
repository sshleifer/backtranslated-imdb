Gene Hackman is a former Marine Corps colonel who gathers a handful of private Vietnam veterinarians to return to Laos and save some Americans who have been traced to a failure. Hackman suspects that in reality the half-dozen or MIAs are secretly kept in a remote camp by Laotians to be tormented and provide more hard labor. Hackman is paid by rich Robert Stack, whose son, like Hackman's son, is supposedly under the MIAs. But the circumstances are such that Hackman can only buy old and outdated weapons, though he can pick up the help of a fiery anti-communist loatian and his two daughters along the way. <br /> <br /> I don't think the movie is deliberately motivated to endorse the myth of Vietnamese that our MIAs still hold for propaganda purposes. The myth was really enough. If anyone remembers, there were many bumper stickers in 1982 and 1983, BRING BACK THE MIA. Instead, I think the movie was made in part to pay for the myth. It was absurd on the face. Why would our former enemy refuse to return MIAs? Propaganda? Where is the propaganda value in something kept secret? To add the labor supply? They need a hundred extra workers in Vietnam and Laos? The motives behind this movie - with its triumphant music and high body numbers - were scary. <br /> <br /> But what about the movie itself? Disabled by its theme of saving mythical abused MIAs, it is a routine paramilitary action, no better and no worse than many others that appeared in the 1980s. Gene Hackman's performance is the only one that manages to keep his head above water. He is almost always reliable. <br /> <br /> Of the others, as it is a formal plot, derived from "The Dirty Dozen", I continued to guess which gang would sacrifice themselves for the mission. Of the three anti-communist Asians, I thought one or more were dead meat. That's why Asian helpers appear in such movies. (I was twice out of three.) I also have Patrick Swayzie as the ex-officer, the youngest of the group, who would never have earned the respect of others, because he never had a fight should also be in " go heroic mode. Wrong. He becomes a hero, true, but remains intact. I thought there was a fifty-fifty chance that Hackman had to go too, but he did well. The formula doesn't really stretch for originality either. Charles Bronson's claustrophobic POW escape from "The Great Escape" is here in Fred Ward's ex-tunnel rat, a claustrophobic crawled into a drainage pipe with a snake in it, so he has a stretch in the Laoist POW camp can do. <br /> <br /> The title, "Uncommon Valor," is a tribute that Admiral Nimitz made to the men at Iwo Jima. "Unusual bravery was common that day." Nimitz was definitely right about that. Whether or not the men who fought in Vietnam were equally brave is far from the point. Anyone who fought or even came close, put their lives on the line for the guys in the line next to them, heroically enough. This movie, and the way it uses our bitterness over the Vietnam War, doesn't really make them right.
