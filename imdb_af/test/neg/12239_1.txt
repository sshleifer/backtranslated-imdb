I'm sorry for myself, you know why. I feel pain from the performance of this movie. I went to the theater with friends to see this movie, and still haven't seen it satisfactorily watching it as a whole (I left about 20 minutes ... hoping it would be for me) would be comfortable for a moment.) Most movies now, even these bad people ... when I watch them, there may be a small role in the movie where I sometimes get pleasure from maybe a strange joke or a good line ... this movie on the other hand made me feel uncomfortable all the time and angry at me, especially because I wasted money on it. It was poorly written, poorly directed, poorly shot and definitely acted poorly ... <br /> <br /> please, for the good of humanity, don't see this movie, even if your guy wants to say he has as every movie ever seen ... just not ...
