And I may be generous. The overwhelming majority of the movie consists of charged footage ... the kicking monster, two women who are exercising again, the kicking sample again, a lot of people in the pool, the kicking sample again, nobody is the worse to wear, though it was injured. You get the picture. I kept myself from shouting "GET WITH IT ALREADY" several times. <br /> <br /> And it doesn't help that the materials they use are poorly produced. The sound is disturbing from synchronization with the picture. And in the one scene where they tried "artistic" with the lighting and camera techniques, the lighting child who saw the flashlight, which was the only relief from the scene, was clearly seen in the lap. <br /> <br /> My hope is that the production was the victim of a terrible disaster in which the original soundtrack and most of the footage were destroyed, but they decided to undo it anyway. from the room for the editing room in memory of the heroic crew members who have tried their lives to save the * real * movie - one with the plot and the interesting dialogue. Unfortunately, there is no evidence of this, and I am forced to deduce that they do not care only in the immortal words of Joel and the Bots. <br /> <br />
