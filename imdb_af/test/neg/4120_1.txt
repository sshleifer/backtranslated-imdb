Tedium if only the French can do it. I checked my watch for the first time for 7 minutes, and with 143 minutes left, I also considered going out. I won't even try to discuss the coherence of the "plot" or the inability of the characters, because at about 1 hour I realized nothing of this matter mattered. It was not just self-sufficient or pretentious, it was a vacuum. A soul-sucking vacuum. This film has no saving grace, no enjoyable character, nothing funny, and nothing sad. It's not smart enough to be drama and there's no moment in the slightest bit over. The most interesting thing about this movie is how it has managed to get mostly glowing and positive reviews. I was cheated by the reviews, but you don't have to be, gentle reader. All I want for Christmas is three hours back.
