I really wanted this movie, because it is refreshingly different from the horde of everyday horror movie clones, and I appreciate that the filmmakers try to make something original. Unfortunately, the plot did not hold together and none of the characters was nice enough for me to really care for them or their fate. <br /> <br /> Visually, the Toybox was pretty interesting. The director has taken quite a few somewhat risky movements, such as adding flash-looking animations into parts and cherishing many of the special effects (such as the light of a certain amulet). Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't, but it earned kudos for the effort, and cinematography was generally of high quality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, when the same approach to throwing many things into the wall to see which sticks were applied to the plot, the results were not very good. The movie never really finds a tone he intends, schizophrenically moving from black comedy to family soap opera to 80's witchcraft movie to childhood nostalgia to sex families. On their own, pieces of each of these elements work pretty well, but nothing ever closes in a satisfactory whole. In addition, large pieces of the plot are never really explained. I'm not one who likes to spoon everything for me, and I like movies that make things for the audience to decide, but the parts left out of The Toybox just seem to have gone out of money before. has. they could explain to them whether they didn't really think about things. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the next project by the director, as I think there is a lot of talent that lies beneath the surface. I can't recommend The Toybox on its own merits.
