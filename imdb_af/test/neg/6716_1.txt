Mr Seagal even lowered his (already low) standards and now surprised him to make bad movies. The foreigner has no substance in the writing. It's the director has made an even worse job and the music and the score is so cheesy and wrong that you just don't know if you have to laugh or cry. Already 10 minutes in the movie, you just want to turn it off. However, if you look at Steven Seagal's past movies, you think "Hey, there are some cool action sequences that are worth watching ..." ... you're wrong! It just gets worse when the movie progresses. Everyone (with a few exceptions) seems to kill every person they talk about, good or bad, innocent or not. The only good thing about the movie is that it has an end and it has a fairly short running time. Summarize the movie in two words: Stay away!
