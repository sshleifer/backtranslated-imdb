Despite the excellent cast and the potential of the story, this movie fails on many levels. I was convinced that the director was a beginner. The movie is very poorly edited, shows many non-important and annoying flashes, has very visible flashes and has no exciting atmosphere at all. The question that has repeatedly emerged in my mind while it is being watched was "so what?" I can't care less about the main character and what happens to him. It's not that the story is not compelling, it's just the way it is told. The movie tells the story. Period. It's like an actor mumbling his lines without knowing what he says. The movie simply tells the events that happen without any soul. And the director has to blame. He doesn't know how to make something interesting or exciting or enjoyable. (And believe me, I'm NOT someone who wants to see the hard 8 or 2 fast 2 crappy. On the contrary, I especially like slow-paced movies.) So I was convinced the director was a beginner. But to my surprise this man has years of experience and worked as a film or camera assistant on many wonderful productions. Guess he then had a bad year.
