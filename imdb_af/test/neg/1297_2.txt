This film was total rubbish. I sat down and it was absolutely furious that it was funded. They definitely spent all their budget on the special FX, rather than the author and director AND some of the actors. <br /> <br /> First, the play was dirty and junk. The story wasn't related to the audience. Rather than being from the people's perspective of the storm, the story is more told of government figures and the army, which really aren't a way to connect with them, since most of us hate politicians anyway. The author tried to add a human element to the unrealistic characters by adding the tiny subplot to the father and son, who had completely failed. <br /> <br /> As for directing ... o God, his techniques of trying to create tension and discomfort are repetitive and over the top. The speedy movements of the camera and then suddenly the sudden flash bolt on a characters face when something terrible happened, is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched it to the end was to see the special FX. What a bad thing, since special FX shouldn't make the movie, just make the story and experience worse. There was no story. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't really bother it, overall rubbish and an embarrassment to the British film industry.
