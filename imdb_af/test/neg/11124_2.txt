Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito), a "crypto-zoologist" (fancy term for one of those self-proclaimed losers who would like to scarcely read - read: non-existent animals) and his hunting crew succeed in a Chupacabra, a big, scaly, elusive, fast-moving animal. To get it to the continent, they smuggle it on a Greek ship and some idiots open the crate it contains, despite being specifically said. I think the strange growling sounds coming from inside were also not a good deterrent. The sample then thang the sample; (John Rhys-Davies), a square special agent who claims to be an insurance vendor for some reason (Dylan Neal), a wheezing blonde Tai Bo instructor (Chelan Simmons), a lot of guys with machine guns and others try to stop them. The main victims (which I think are supposed to be the comic relief, but it's hard to tell) are an old rich bitch (Paula Shaw) with a yippy terrier and a sneaky gold digger (David Millbern). Apparently the monster can be knocked out with a single tranquilizer, but can live through decades of dot hits. The Chupacabra design is acceptable (though original), but the rest of the movie is without tension, surprise or interest. A boring Sci-Fi Channel "original" movie; they have made dozens of films with almost changeable characters and plots, but with little change on the creature. That's enough!
