Beginning with a reverberation poem and images of American missiles, hungry children and mutilated Palestinians, I soon realized that it would not be an objective documentary. 5 young people convicted of gothenburg riots are interviewed and give a very confused explanation why they should refuse the city center and then (oh my god) actually pay for what they did. I kept watching and many questions were raised, was the hearing properly done and did the police have the right to do what they did? Many questions asked ... and then dropped. No interviews with judges or documents about the trial. Nothing. <br /> <br /> In short: nothing new about what every Sweden saw on television a hundred times - just bad propaganda.
