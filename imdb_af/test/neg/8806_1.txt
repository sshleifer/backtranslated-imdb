I can't believe Isaiah was Washington and Ice-T in this mess! The plot (and I rather use the term much more) centers around an army of rats that make an urban residential complex terror - at least I think that's what it's about. The writing didn't care at all. I couldn't have been about the characters anymore and the camera work consisted of repeatedly showing shadows of rats standing or running on their hind legs. Running was what I had to do. As an African American man, I often read the pleas of my brothers and sisters to support African American films. "I'm trying to help but enough is enough. No one should see any such reason for any garbage like this. Please, brothers and sisters, no longer produce video gears like this. Please!
