I was really ready to watch two of the best film critics mark this movie as a "laughing riot". But the movie is extremely disappointing. <br /> <br /> You will be advised to watch this movie to keep your brain at home, but you simply cannot ignore the mistakes and shortcomings. <br /> <br /> 1. The missile scene was total stupidity. <br /> <br /> 2. Katrina Kaif and Govinda couple look terrible. (He's 49 and she's just 24 ... more than double of her age). 3. Salman's comedy is less of acting and more of too much. <br /> <br /> 4. Songs are good, but interrupt the tempo of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5. Some scenes are deliberately attempted by the filmmakers to be funny, and 6. Poor and erroneous story. <br /> <br /> However, there are few pluses. 1. Govinda. Great Individual Performance. <br /> <br /> 2. Some scenes are actually pretty funny. <br /> <br /> 3. Katrin Kaif. Watch and Act continue to improve with each movie. <br /> <br /> 4. Rajpal Yadav's Don Series. Although underutilized but hilarious. <br /> <br /> So 4 good points, 6 bad .. this one gets 4/10.
