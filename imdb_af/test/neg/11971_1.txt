I can't believe I let myself rent that piece of garbage! The acting was so poor, my grandmother could have done better. The push thrown into the movies was nowhere near the character knocking the scarecrow on the floor. The movie has become a piece to watch! <br /> <br /> So, this group of baseball jocks decided to go out of bounds, even after they were not in command, they had to have coaching. So, of course they go anyway. They decide to link a loser to a post with the so-called "Scarecrow". When the loser's best friend finds out about this, he and his girlfriend go to save him. <br /> <br /> The child has been diagnosed with diabetes, and is hospitalized, while the jocks leave the beach next day. The scarecrow finds them there and kills them all pretty much. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you really don't mind. Anyway, the Scarecrow ends with a connection with 'Diabetes Boy' and the boy starts off with the scarecrow when the scarecrow dies. Yes, it's really very cheesy. <br /> <br /> It thought this movie was full of bull sh * t. Sooner or later, the only one who lives (of course) is the boyfriend and girlfriend who are the main characters. The evil is then transferred to the boyfriend, and he kills himself to break the curse so that no one else will be hurt. Touch him? No, don't waste your hard earned money on it, I'll give it a score of one since it's the lowest, otherwise it won't even earn so much.
