Did the writers pay people to come here and write positive reviews? I mean, it's really a little hackneyed, and Spike isn't that funny. He looks more like the serious man trying too hard to be funny. There are so many mediocre performances in this show; Like once, the opening sketch was "Talk show, directly applicable to the forehead," over and over. And another who has Spike and another man has grown high, and it wasn't even funny. They didn't even do anything, but sat around, laughing over and over. Ha Ha! And another who told Spike spoke to a Korean man who ate duck and told him he had a pet duck. Ha ha! I mean, Spike just gets funny guests on his show. That's why people like this show
