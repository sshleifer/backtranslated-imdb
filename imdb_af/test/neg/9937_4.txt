The first thing you should know about "Zipperface" is that it was shot on video. It therefore has the odd "home-video-ish" look that is very distracted and makes it difficult to take it seriously as a "real" movie. And "Zipperface" indeed seems like a lot of amateurs have come together for an attempt to make a "real" serial killer thriller. It's not quite, but it's not as bad as it seems. Having a wife as one of the two detectives is turning to the exploitation genre. Dona Adams gives an attractive amateur performance in her role - her obvious camera inexperience works in some way for her. Plus, she's set a big battle against the killer at the end. The red herring first looks ridiculous, but eventually they work - I guessed the murderer. And you have to wonder if Tarantino saw the Zipperface man when he got the idea of ​​"The Gimp" for "Pulp Fiction". (* 1/2)
