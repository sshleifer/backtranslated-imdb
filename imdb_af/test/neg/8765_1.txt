This movie was terrible. The acting was terrible. The writing was terrible. What was even worse was the camera shots and sound. Half the time, the voices did not match the actor's lips, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different colors. The worst part was when one of the actors was at the top of a large cross-shaped building. The building had to be 50 stories high, and probably 100 feet wide. But when the actor was on top of another shot, they "recreated" the upper part of the building. The building's width is reduced to about eight feet wide. How can a building be hundreds of feet high eight feet wide? I know the film was low budget, but it is inexcusable. The movie itself just printed ideas about a "rapture" and then actually had a storyline or point. This reduced the text to mere rubbish, and the characters sold ideas in their lines rather than transporting emotions and moving the movie in a direction. It was a total waste of time to watch. The movie gives Christians a bad name if it is one of the current best Christian films.
