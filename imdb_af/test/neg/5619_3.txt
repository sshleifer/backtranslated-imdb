With this film directed by Roger Avery and Quentin Tarantino, it is sure to be a gem. I was wrong. I don't hate this movie, but in no way do I like it. <br /> <br /> I love Roger Avery because of his wonderful direction of attraction and his screens to pulp fiction and quiet hill, but he made a mistake. I really need to comment on Tarantino, we all know a genius. <br /> <br /> This movie is just about a gang that robs a bank but fails because of stupid people taking part in the robbery. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed in Tarantino and Avery to do this movie, but don't change my mind about how wonderful they are. everyone makes mistakes ... 3/10 ........... j.d Seaton
