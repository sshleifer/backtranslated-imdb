As noted in other comments here, the camera is working badly. I am tempted to say that the director of photography is a 7-year-old, but that would mean - up to 7-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Good, but how about the subject? I was looking for some insight into the global wine industry, you know, Mondovino. What the film is about is a very close view of one plot in the world: the battle between Mondavi and the French and Italian wineries they want to buy. There is no enlightening narrative that will place the whole agreement in context, so we are left to the selective process of the director and the interviews with the various characters in these little psychodramas. There is no shortage of despicable characters, or even contemptible dogs, in sight. However, there is a shortage of equality. <br /> <br /> Is the director a Marxist? I wondered if I was trying to maintain some focus, as the camera dipped, swam, zoomed in a chaotic bloom. Small producer in France: good. Big US producer: very, very bad. Forget about the hundreds of small wineries in North America, Australia and South America. There is a dead horse to beat over two hours here. <br /> <br /> Learning more about the plot is better not to read elsewhere. And you will be able to taste your favorite wine without feeling sick. <br /> <br /> I propose a new award in Cannes for the best America bashing Diatribe.
