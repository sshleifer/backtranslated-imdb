Gaud√≠ afternoons can be considered a mediocre exercise. Marcia Gay Harden and Judy Davis played a good role (Juliette Lewis's new-year-old freaky character was taken incredibly out of reality, I know an American young lady who shoots like her!), But GA doesn't show much beyond her overhand plot. <br /> <br /> Although movies are all about believing, there were some noticeable screen game contradictions. Two monsters: you pay 14 euros to meet the chapel where Cassandra and Frankie met, never at 07:00, and you can't leave a terrace without paying the account (they will charge you on the spot if they give you don't know) or get out of a taxi so fast (your Americans always tip cabbies though they don't expect it, but the rows depicted in the movie are ridiculous). Don't believe me, reader: come over and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> If you have never been here before you may not care about it all, good movies should be credible if you are not of your origin. Nobody knows about GA here, and I'll make sure it doesn't change in the future.
