It must move the WORSE I have ever seen !!!!! It wasn't just boring, it was a spoonful of spoon. Where do you find the actors ... on a street corner? Who had the special effects ... Maaco? For God, I made a better movie with my CELLPHONE. And if that wasn't enough, you even had extras at the end of the movie so we could just see how stupid the actors are in real life. Who ever did the makeup for the strangers should have spent $ 5 at your local used costume store and called it a day. And whoever wrote in the world should shoot the movie description on the back of the DVD case. PUHLEEZ !! It's not even 1/8% of what it's described as. This description is just to suck people to buy, rent or pay a ticket. No wonder there was never a trailer for it. You would have driven them all away !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Bad actors ... $ 5 <br /> <br /> Special Effects ... $ 5.50 <br /> <br /> False fire .... $ 1.89 (cigarette lighter) < br /> <br /> Time spent on this movie .... total waste! (I have to sue you for my time to watch it)
