Don't take this movie seriously, hire it with a few people who want to play Mystery Science 3000, and you'll probably be laying your butt. The evil guys are not so scary, it's funny, it's like a man from the 7th class with a sickle in a scarecrow. The acting is hilarious. I occasionally love suicide with a poor horror movie and it really giggled me. I recommend it on this basis. Of course, recreational drugs will improve the experience. Oh, there is a naked group swimming scene that will allow some star dust on the 5 star system. The token black man is badly injured, but continues with his joke as well as the use of the injured body part straight. Enjoy these full and complete shame on movies.
