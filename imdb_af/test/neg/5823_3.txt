Do not include a cigar! - That's what my opinion of this movie is! TAG PURVIS both wrote and directed this script, which had to be shot by a rewriting previously. Sometimes, laughing because or a corn script, the flanker of the movie is Dan Mongomery Jr and the Director of Photography. Both of these talents are in the future to look forward to. My recommendation is to wait until it hits your local cable station and rents on classic use!
