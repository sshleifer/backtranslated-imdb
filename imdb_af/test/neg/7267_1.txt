Honestly to God, the outline says pretty much everything. The planet Andromina (not confused with aunt Jemima) is represented by a cheap L.A. strip club. There are no strippers, so the most recent male visitors go to recruit strippers. <br /> <br /> The men are confused or arrested for spying on women (although despite being a planet of women, we only get two women participating in any girl sex scenes) , and finally, as always happens in science fiction cliche films everywhere, the women are convinced that men are good for something. Well, not the men who made this movie anyway! <br /> <br /> But boy, we get a lot of that, in wonderful amounts of soft-sex and nudity. This one has less plot than usual for such movies, so change the channel if you don't like this kind of movie and type your teeth if you're in this kind of thing.
