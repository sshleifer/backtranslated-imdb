This must be the worst case since the silent era has passed. Not just one or two actors, but almost the entire cast. Lee Majors and Bo Svenson were good, but the rest of them look like their first action. <br /> <br /> So the budget wasn't great. Many of the costumes and seats were credible, but there were many things that came out of the viewer to let us know that they could not double the props or get all the props to change the period. <br /> <br /> I can't think of one aspect of the movie that I liked or shook my head. Your time will be better spent by burning ribbon collected from your stomach.
