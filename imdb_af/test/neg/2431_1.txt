This view is not, in my opinion, good. Then I haven't had a Disney Channel cartoon yet. Except for the "Proud Family" because it's about a normal female teenager. This show is very similar to the way I feel about Lilo and Stich the Series. It was a mistake to make the movie in a cartoon, because the movie was excellent, the cartoon was terrible. Disney Channel did just fine before all those stupid cartoons like Dave The Barbarian, Brandy and Mr. Whiskers, Lilo and Stich the Series, American Dragon Jake have been together for a long time, and where it all started: Kim Possible. The shows would have been better if they came to PlayHouse Disney! As for this particular show, Kuzko will never come out of school, just as Dave The Barbarian's parents never go home, and like Brandy and Mr. Whiskers will never come out of the jungle.
