Alright can break it down. Why is this one of the worst movies ever? Because there are so many answers to that question, I have a headache. Come on ... Cracker World? Mr. Honkee? The sharing with the Arab man? It's just awful, I didn't really care about the whole white racism crap, but when they did that thing with the Arab man, I wanted to get the names of all the writers. It's really not worth watching this movie after 3 seconds. It's not even funny-it was my first interpretation. I hope the person who directed this movie does not commit suicide, but it probably looks like I do not see any other options. Never watch this movie. If you see it, you can't say you're dead without regret.
