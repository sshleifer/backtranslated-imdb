They used footage of a few real protests split with a woman talking about a society with no men to make it appear that these people were cheering on the "gendercide" of men. The funny thing is, you can see a man cheering on his own death in the background. <br /> <br /> OK, the plot. Some women say there should be a society without men, and the crowd in front of her (which some men contain) thinks it's a good idea. So then all the men are killed or something. So there is no more. <br /> <br /> Then this blond scientist creates a man but removes some chromosomes so he can't be violent. The male grows very quickly and soon is an adult man. Not long after, he took the blonde's Volkswagen beetle and drove into the city where he was discovered. Now you'd think the one man in a city full of lesbians would be the happiest guy ever, but no way. Police chased him. <br /> <br /> I didn't watch the rest, but it'll probably end up running out of the clock and some people going bad. Somehow the man ends up in a stadium with other men who want him to lead the uprising. These brave warriors hiding in a stadium might have had some sort of plan detailing how they could one day get rid of a planet full of women, but I didn't look. And neither do you. <br /> <br /> If you let up and navigate and it happens to continue, don't look. Look at anything other than that. You'll find those ads for Bowflex or those with women in swimsuits asking you to pick up the phone to meet women like this. There will be more entertainment in your area. <br /> <br /> (Oh yes, this is the funny thing when they enter their cars. I don't know what they did. They seem to have been driving very slowly and carefully, but trying to speed up the movie to reimburse, but it looks really strange.) <br /> <br /> The blonde girl was cute and I feel so nice, so ... 2/10.
