A boring attempt by not yet director Boett Boetticher and beautiful but non-indifferent actress Nina Foch, this movie is, as one of the other reviewers' notes, essentially a certain type of B movie. It's just not the good kind. And a promising premise and an overactive mismatch are being wasted. <br /> <br /> Basic plot - Nina, a nurse-on-duty nurse leave, has a nightmare. She met a colleague at the resort where she breathed her nerves and realized he was in the dream, even though she had never met him. In the meantime, our pounding man seems to be working as a spy and is about to do an extra secret, hush-hush mission that should not fail. <br /> <br /> Of course there are Nazis. A plot gate. And smart people who act in a way are likely to get them completely unnecessary, so the running time can be rinsed out in an hour. In the end, the movie becomes a match between which group of spies can be more foolish. If the FBI and OSS acted like this crew, we would have lost the war in '42 '. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was rather shot flat (despite the best efforts of the mismatch) and the play - as it appears in many of the Columbia Bs TCM lately - is strange enough disconnected. It's less styled than you can get from a similar budget Warner Bros movie, but also less fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Of course, Boetticher's strength is similar in style to the strong stories and acts of his Randolph Scott Westerns. Perhaps the problem here is that such a style will not work if the script is fancy and that the actors are tired of an annual program of their five films.
