Lucille Ball's version of "Mame" is, in my opinion, one of the worst shows ever saved on film. Having seen Lucy in her various sitcoms more than an astronomical number of times, I can tell you that I really like Lucy, but this movie is a fiasco of incredible bad casting, music and dancing. Robert Preston is the only saving grace with a portion small enough to miss when you cut. I don't know what she thinks, and I can't imagine how she was advised by the studio or director, but I actually clipped to see this embarrassment. I can really be cruel and suggest watching it for a laugh, but it's too pitiful to qualify for it. Don't waste your money or your time.
