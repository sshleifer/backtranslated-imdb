I have no idea how accurate Flynn's painting appears in this film, but even as a work of fiction, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is everywhere and left. you wonder how he got from one scene to the next - you just don't get the minimum information needed to maintain continuity and understand his current situation and it's hard to get Flynn's and other characters' motives behind some understand their behavior. br /> <br /> Add to that a range of stupid and impeccable situations and you have a movie that comes over as one of your dreams that makes sense while you are asleep, but when you wake up and you try it Remember, it's just strange, unfounded and totally unrealistic. <br /> <br /> There are many long, boring musical sections of the film that are bad for me or a bad director trying and not artistic. /> <br /> None of the characters are equal and the Flynn character appears as a self-controlled liar, scoundrel, thief, assassin, killer, jogger, gigolo and cheater who will do everything and strive to anyone to increase his own dreams, and somehow it seems that great opportunities are miraculously collapsing. <br /> <br /> This movie is not entertaining or satisfying in any way, and not all historically accurate, so why does it even look? To blow salt into the wound, the DVD has one of the worst transmissions I've ever seen, it wasn't even in the wide screen or Dolby 5.1, it has terrible telecommunication work and lots of things that look like a movie has collected dust and crab somewhere.
