This horrible piece was (loosely) loosely based on a true story involving two of my relatives (played by Jack Thompson and Jacqueline Mackenzie). <br /> <br /> This movie is offensive; In addition to the fact that it was not a very good movie anyway, it did not in any way affect what it was like to lose such a close relative and leave it entirely to those who were really affected by the truth. <br /> <br /> As for the director; He managed to pay in cash on a family's Porsche prize. <br /> <br /> If I could give it a zero, I'd have it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
