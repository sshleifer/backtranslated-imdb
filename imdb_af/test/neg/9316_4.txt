As long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it doesn't contain any historical fact at all, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> It's on par with Sam Raimi's "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys", so far as plot, acting, humor and production values. You will see the similarities on multiple points. However, most of the scenes aren't as good and the movie suffers. Jack Palance recommends the screen as well as ever, and at no time do you have the impression that he is giving something less than his level best. Same for Oliver Reed. The problem is that their strong performances make the square jaw. Don Diamont's inferior acting skills seem even more uncomfortable. Perennial bitter player Cas Anvar was also very good and plays a character like Salmonius in the aforementioned Hercules. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed the low budget sword-and-wizard movies of the early 80's, you're probably going to enjoy this show too. It's actually a shame they've attached the Marco Polo name to it. It really has nothing to do with Marco's life, as opposed to the expectations of most people who want to see this movie.
