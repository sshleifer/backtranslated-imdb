I made it in "Steel Frontier" about 8 minutes before turning it off. Then, for the punishment I'm for, I watched the next day more. Today I had to put a lot of clothes on, so I decided to finish the movie and it was his own punishment. Here's what I don't understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth each spent $ 7,000 on their debut features and created two remarkable movies. But here we have two directors with probably more money, and they make a big, steaming heap of shit. Let's see if I can figure out the logic: "It's Road Warrior, but it's like a future Western. We get the cheapest" actors "we can find, we'll write my mentally challenged cousin, and the writing, we will spend the budget on a lot of explosions, we can't lose! "<br /> <br /> Serious. I don't think even the MST3K guys could improve it. But if you insist on watching it, I recommend getting drunk first.
