I remember all the hype around this movie when Aaliyah was murdered. To be a fan of me. Rice's novels were my first thought: "How can they do the Queen of the Convicted without first doing Vampire Lestat?" <br /> <br /> After finally seeing the movie, I can now see how they did It. When you read these books, imagine that you take up the greedy parts of Vampire Lestat, march Marcus and Marius in one character and remove everything that has to do with Lestat's beginnings (the wolf hunt, his violin, Theater Of The Vampires, and also Louis, Claudia and Gabrielle), then in the last 15 minutes in Queen Of The Damned. <br /> <br /> What we lose is a very important piece of Lestat's character. His inner distress to kill to live, the fact that he was carefully trying to choose killers as his victims, and his love affair with Louis, Armand, Gabrielle and all the other vampires. <br /> <br /> Also important to the story is that we are the "Story of the Twins", which is the Genesis of me. Rice's vampires are lost. And while I was sure, the cannibalism was too intense to show on the screen, they could have done something closer and showed us more of ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> Worse still, we've put this love interest between Jessie and Lestat. The Vampire Chronicles are basically a US Yoni story. For those who don't know, Yoni is another form of Hentai (Japanese Porn Comics). But in Yoni it's about gay-male relationships, told by a woman. Although many people object to the "gayness" of the characters, in this movie they have gone the far opposite. Instead of Lestat offenders, he goes to young female groups. <br /> <br /> And the other errors in logic and storyline are great. Initially Lestat came from a century-long sleep, and later asked Marius how he made it in red velvet in the 1950s. Marius has no idea who Elvis is, and says he slept over that period. Wonder how Lestat knows about 50's fashion and music, as he slept at the same time. And nothing is ever mentioned about Louis, Claudia or Gabrielle. I think it's a great shame. Is like to see "Snow White and the 3 Dwarfs". <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie I was thinking was really bad. The only good thing was the soundtrack. Most of the acting was poor, the accents ran me on the wall and all the many were removed in depths of the book, and we just left with a hollow shell, like Enkil after he got dry. /> <br /> If you want to see a good modern vampire movie, get Lost Boys, the original interview with a vampire, or even some old episodes of Dark Shadows. Let this one rest in a piece, with a game through the heart, garlic cloves around the neck and a bottle of holy water in the mouth. <br /> <br /> In the end, remember that before Aaliyah was murdered, this was meant to go straight to the video, no theater release was planned. It is now clear why it was. It's just sad that someone will be as talented as she is for this dog of a movie, instead of something she can really shine. <br /> <br /> I rate it a 2 on a scale of 1-10.
