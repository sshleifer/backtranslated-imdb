"Jaded" offers a premise with potential as it looks after a woman's rape by two other women and asks the question "when is rape not rape?" Unfortunately, the movie seems to be suffering from bad direction, as it strikes by legal minutia while trying to weave some sort of story with a handful of dirty mouths and poorly depicted characters to just end suddenly. 'Jaded' is just for the blue potato potato in the mood for some dark drama.
