A team of amateur journalists and tree crawlers catch a secret government project, Project Carnivore, on a remote South Pacific island. The scientists there produce huge-sized wheat, but the genes spread to other species, which create abnormally large Komodo dragons and a cobra (one that is spotless and submerged). With the help of the scientist's daughter, can they escape the island and tell the world? Even if I didn't see this movie on the Sci-Fi channel (I did this unfortunately), it would scream Sci-Fi Channel with its low production value, poor performance and some of the worst special effects in history. The effects here are comparable to another creature film, "Raptor Island", though not so bad. I would suspect there should be at least a handful of people working on both movies, but I didn't bother confirming it and probably wouldn't. It will be a sad day when I see one of their movies again. <br /> <br /> What not to say is not nice. I watched it with my sister's boyfriend two hours ago and I can't speak to him, but I thought it was a good time. The bad thing is it is a fun picture if you want to enjoy movies and the scientist's daughter is attractive enough to wear the movie. I believe the actress's name is Michelle Borth. Michael Pare also appears as a ship captain, and his poor choice of roles here really makes his work on 'Furnace' respect (even if the movie is unacceptably bad). <br /> <br /> I can't stand hard on this movie either, because it was more or less exactly what I thought it would be. Bad effects? Low budget? No-name actors? I had no higher hope. However, this does not mean that it is also wonderful. Getting in pairs is nothing to be proud of and this one will slowly fade into the distant memory section. For the one fan who likes this movie (and call it "KvC"), keep up with your copy because you'll have plenty of time to get a replacement.
