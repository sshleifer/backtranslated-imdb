My mom took me to the movie when I was about seven years old, thirty years ago. She had no idea that a family movie would be so violent. My clearest reminder was of the boy's father's face of pain, as he was stabbed in the stomach and murdered. This image spooked me for weeks. I learned that I lived in a world where one could hide my dad at any time. How could I stop them? How can my father protect himself? You have to realize that this sting is not a seven-year fantasy. It is as real as seeing a real event, and has no place in a child's innocent mind. It is sad that we still do not understand the impact of violence taking place in the lives of our children, both on our children and in our society. If only parents would protect their children from images of violence with the same power that protect them from images of nudity and sex.
