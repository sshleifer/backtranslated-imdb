It's a boring movie. The real villains are the bunch of adaptations (it is shockingly easy to say that the source material was a novel) and relentless script. <br /> <br /> On the credit side, the budget was predominantly stiff because of wartime, the appearance of the movie is not bad at all. And the performances are largely OK, except for Phyllis Calvert, who is awesome - a miracle that sees the potential for profit, a well in which she certainly does not fall. Ms Calvert, with much less to continue, is as perfect as Olivia de Havilland in Gone With The Wind. <br /> <br /> The one absolutely unbearable aspect of The Man in Gray is the terribly pregnant portrayal of a black servant boy. No matter that he is meant to be a sympathetic character. It is impossible to play this example of condescending racism by the white boy. <br /> <br /> Grim.
