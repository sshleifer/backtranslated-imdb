In an effort to make a somewhat comical, yet serious film about the art of marijuana, Stephen Gyllenhaal (director) had a few bong rips short of a good movie. While the cast is nothing more than wonderful, this movie is very difficult to go through. The play by Billy Bob Thornton, Ryan Phillipe, Jon Bon Jovi, Hank Azaria and Kelly Lynch couldn't even save this movie of failure. It would be wiser to flush three simple dollar accounts into the toilet, then watch this movie at the local video store. <br /> <br />
