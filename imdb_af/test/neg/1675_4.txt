When this film was made in 1980, I was a teenager in the soccer world playing as part of the audience. This was done at Mooseheart, Illinois. The big letters spelling out "MOOSEHEART" at the top of the stands are covered with a banner in the movie. The director will tell us to brave aloud on certain points, as if a touch is made. St. Charles Youth Correction Center is a place less than 30 miles from Mooseheart, although I think it may have closed recently. During one scene, they show a black woman and a white man in the audience watching the game. Just below them you can see my sister Noel's head (she was 11). In the VHS version I can only see the top of her head, but when I saw it on television in 1981, I could also see her whole head and my sister Jacqui. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie itself was OK for a TV movie. Since there is already a description of the movie here, I don't have to repeat it. It is worth seeing at least once.
