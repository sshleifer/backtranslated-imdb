I can't get some of the scores this movie gets on the IMDb website! Am I issued with the special version naff version? Edited by Dewhurst, produced by Bernard Matthews, this film should be hosted in Battersea. I am sorry for all the British central references, but if you are elsewhere and you have no tricks to cut or you have not cataloged a beer mat collection, this movie may be just 90 minutes of your remaining value. life span (as long as you do not have paint to look dry). The plot has more holes than a pair of fishing nets and the direction and editing are amazing. What on earth does Irons do in this movie?
