I don't care about the strange art film. But when they are cut with arcane symbolism and dark dialogue and it is clear that they are done for the filmmaker's ego rather than the viewer's benefit, I am upset. I'm not a stupid person, but I just don't understand what this movie is trying to say. Or do it. Film is a wonderful form of human communication. Why do some filmmakers use it rather than eclipse?
