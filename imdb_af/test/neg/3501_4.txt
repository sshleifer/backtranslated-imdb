THE GOOD: The acting was especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard had to be nominated as best supporting actor instead of Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> THE BATH: I'm a visible minority (non-white) and I've experienced some form of racism in my life. BUT despite my life experiences and the film's subject, I will definitely NOT say that this movie is the best of the year, it is actually far from it. I have problems with this movie, both from the point of view of a filmmaker and from a visible minority's perspective. Some of my problems with this movie are: <br /> <br /> (1) Poor character development (or not at all). Just because we've seen extremes in a character, for example, Matt Dillon is a racist policeman and a good caregiver for his ill father, doesn't mean the character is well developed. Yes, I admit that in a large cast ensemble like this movie, it is difficult for every character to develop well, but that does not mean that none of the characters would be so. <br /> <br /> (2) The dialogue is really confronted to the point that I was really surprised to have won this movie for the best original script. They should NOT show this movie in a scriptwriting class, because it is good, but to show students and future scriptwriters what NOT to do. I just felt that I was hit over and over by how bad racism is. I'll get it. <br /> <br /> (3) The plot looks so coincidental, it's laughing. What are the chances of a black car robbery going over an Asian man who is also a human dealer while entering his van, and the same black car robbery left the Asian car's car several hours later when he took him to hospital Just to find out that the various Asians are hanging inside the bus to show you that the black car rider has a good side? Or how about the scene where a biased white class of the higher class who dropped the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred disappeared into the air? If that was so simple, why not throw every racist in America on the stairs so they will have a change of heart? <br /> <br /> (4) I think my biggest concerns about this movie are the unrealistic view of racism. As someone who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face. I was refused to enter a supermarket because I was not white. Did the shop owner say I wasn't white? No, he said the shop was closed, though there were many people inside. Did he shout racial orders? No. Racism in America is more hidden. Some taxi drivers will probably not stop picking you up because you're not white, but that doesn't mean they'll try to cross or get out and say racist slurries. If a Chinese woman left me, I would not say, "Blake! Blake! Learn an English bitch!" On the other hand, if I was a Chinese woman and I accidentally left a Mexican woman, I wouldn't say "Mexicans are bad drivers" in front of her face. That's not how things work. Instead, I will send out my insurance information, sorry, and go home and tell my fellow Chinese friends and family that Mexicans are poor drivers and behind them. This is the real racism. It is hidden and not in your face. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Crash isn't original, unlike some people might say. The interlocking and interweaving story lines, plots and characters were previously done. "Magnolia" is a movie that does much better than Crash did. Yet it has never been nominated for the best photo of the Oscar. It had a star role player - Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who recently won the best actor), Tom Cruise, etc. It worries me how Crash was even named for Best Picture.
