This film is bundled with "Gli fumavano le Colt ... lo chiamavano Camposanto" and both films leave much to be desired in the way of their DVD prints. First, both films are very dark - sometimes it makes it difficult to see exactly what happens. Secondly, no movie has captions, and you are forced to watch a baptized movie. Although 'Il Prezzo del Potere' has a better double. Personally, I always prefer subtitles, but for the non-purists out there it's not a problem. However, these DVD issues are not the fault of the original filmmakers. Just the indifferent package is being marketed four decades later. <br /> <br /> Regarding the film, it's about the murder of President Garfield. This is a big problem, as Van Johnson looks much like Garfield like Judy Garland. In no way does he hear like Garfield. He misses the beard, has the wrong hair color and style and is not quite close (trust me, I am an American history teacher and we are paid to get to know such things!). The real life, Garfield, was a civil war general and looked like the guys on the Smith Brothers cover. Plus, with the help of another actor to give the voice to Johnson in the dubbing, it's just surreal. Never before or this year did Van Johnson sound like such a macho! He was a good actor ... but certainly not a convincing general or macho president. <br /> <br /> In addition to the stupidest decision, President Garfield's death was by no means like this movie. It is clear that the filmmakers are actually paying into the crazy speculation about conspiracies on the death of JFK, not Garfield. Garfield was shot in Washington, DC (not Dallas) by a lone armed man with serious mental problems - not a group of guns. According to most experts, however, Garfield (more than two months later) killed incompetent doctors - who investigated and investigated and tried to retrieve a bullet, and never bothered to clean their hands or tools in the process . In other words, as George Washington (who was actually killed by repeated blood loss if he suffers from pneumonia), he died due to malpractices. In the movie they did nothing. Unlike indeed President Garfield was shot. <br /> <br /> Because the movie has almost no resemblance to real history, it is like a history lesson learned from someone from another planet or someone with a serious brain injury. Why not also ninjas, fighting robots and the Greek gods while you're there?!?! Apart from some decent acting and production values, because the script is a complete cowshed, I do not recommend anyone to see it. It's just a complete and total mess.
