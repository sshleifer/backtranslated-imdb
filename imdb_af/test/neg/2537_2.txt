Sharp Indonesian action movie of the legendary Arizal rogue triumphantly a template for future Cinemax porridge such as "China O'Brien" and "Do or Die" with Erik Estrada, while simultaneously burying the poor, rising action star Pat O'Brien with a hackneyed backyard script and three tins of hair styling to allow his impressive 1984 mule. This man's physical skill looks like a more feminine Mark Gregory and his next credit will be Chris Mitchum second as 'Tom Selick'. Powerful. At least, the action is unceasingly and non-stop with some daring Asian stuntmen risking their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed movie by teenagers and / or meth addicts with no concept of reality. One arm extra is destroyed by an electric fence, and much more is killed by being struck in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box. Classic rape scenes are tasteless and valuable and quote dialogue like, "I'd rather trust a rattlesnake!" is given with such exuberance and diligence of the two-day polycystic agents. Random highlight: some crazy men eating live lizards. Film also holds the record for most cars driven by walls. 10/02
