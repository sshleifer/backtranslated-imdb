Why did they change the cute Rugrats television program that we all know and love in a lame attempt to target teens? They don't have to. All ages look at the regular Rugrats. When I heard about this, I thought, "Hey. They made a TV series about the movie. Besides, they're really big like a teenager! It's going to be better." When I saw it, it was as if I was looking as ginger-marked, except that it was sucking it. Great work. <br /> <br /> In the Rugrats series, tommy is a director? Never. Basically, all the episodes in this series of attempts are about Tommy's love of directing. I do not like it. I'd rather look at plots that change every episode. Not the same thing over and over again. Also, when in the old series each character has its own sides of the story? Never. This series did it. I didn't like that everyone was divorced. I don't want to see Angelica's side of the story. I hate her. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this show if you like as told by ginger and the rugrats.
