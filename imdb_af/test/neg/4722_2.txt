Award-winning Argentine horror director Emilio Vierya leads a screenplay by Jack Curtis and Antonio Ross. Cheesy and ridiculous in the mix for the madness method. A doctor's son is reaching his early death until his desperate father transplantes a monkey's heart into his chest. As expected, things will get strange; when this young man becomes a mask wearing monster and spinning around, the beaches are looking for fine girls to make his slaves. When injecting heroin, she becomes the beauty of zombies. The monster begs his dazed minions with strange organ music. So bad ... well ... it's just bad. In the film: Jose E. Moreno, Alberto Caneau, Mauricio De Ferraris, Gloria Prat and Gina Moret.
