SPOILER Wolfcreek meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre .... if you've seen it, don't waste your time with this one. Typical slasher movie, nothing new here except for the SPOILER "visions" that just add fluff to an already poor plot. I would recommend this movie if you have absolutely nothing to watch and it either sees this movie or looks at a bare wall for 1.5 hours. The only semi-interesting part SPOILER is when the chick starts drinking in the empty sheriff's office, I say it's interesting because she at least used the drink well instead of using stereotypically to start a fire around the bad man kill, though she went that route to the end. All in all, lame, bad, and not worth it.
