The film itself is just a compilation of scenes that have no inherent meaning to anyone living outside Russia. I will not deny that some of the images and techniques at that time were fairly revolutionary (filmed in 1928), but the problem with the film is that it has no interest in the intellectual or general person. We are just looking at a regular form of pictures, ranging from a single-arm horse-beating to a toothless soldier in the war. Everything in between is uncomfortable, haphazard and unnecessary. It would have been possible to find a forum that would keep the viewer interested, but it would not be, although the director's method is very brilliant. <br /> <br /> Overall, one should see this as an art student, hallucinogenic drug, or pre-Tarkovskian theater student.
