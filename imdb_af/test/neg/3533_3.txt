A scientific experiment designed to create a super human being has gone wrong. The creators are trapped in a remote desert outpost. They are pursued mercilessly and mercilessly by their own creation. James Stockton, the scientist whose research was used despite his protest to create the monster, has called the outpost to help extract the horror that now enters the dark halls. James, along with his son and daughter, soon finds themselves trapped with others, desperately trying to survive. And with the outpost sealed from inside, there is no way out ... "The Outpost" / "Mind Ripper" is highly original. The sets are pretty claustrophobic and there is a bit of gore. But as an abomination, it fails miserably at almost all levels. There is zero tension, the writing is poor and filled with big holes and the end is extremely predictable. So-called Master Wes Craven produced this one. I wonder if he is happy with this garbage. Joe Gayton directs without any style. The play is terrible, only Lance H Enriksen can do anything. OK, I'm a big horror fan and was bitterly disappointed. Feed it like the pest - it's just the same old boring crap again!
