These miniseries / movies were sometimes so terrible that I almost broke down and turned it off. I'm a big fan of the novel, but this movie suffers from numerous problems. The costume is poor, and many of the more emotionally charged scenes are blisters. The deviations from the novel are poorly chosen, meaningful nuances are missed or rewritten. <br /> <br />
