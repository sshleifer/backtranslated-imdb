It was made in that beloved age known as the 80's and shot in my hometown New York. Actually, it has become one of my favorite b-sci-fi movies. Oh, sure, it's really stinking at the high hell, but there's so much fun to laugh at, and it will be more tolerable after each show. <br /> <br /> Like: <br /> <br /> Try to find the similarities between this and .... Well, OK, there's nothing as bad as that. Well besides FuManchu Castle. <br /> <br /> Socks can be dangerous to your health. <br /> <br /> Create background by describing through voice over rather than showing any images <br /> <br /> Leader villain "Valeria" (played great by Angelika Jager) delivers some of the most sounding lines ever! <br /> <br /> Many men and women in post-apocalyptic fashion (aka learning bikinis, loincloths, and dead animal fur) <br /> <br /> Don't be terrified at the end! <br /> <br /> I'm having a salad. Toodles !!
