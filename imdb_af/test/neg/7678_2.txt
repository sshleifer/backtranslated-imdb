This movie is sometimes frightening, maybe no more than when a naked George Kennedy tells his hooker friend, he wants a little more sugar. Fortunately, his nudity is covered with a blanket, but the image is even more frightening than you will probably find in, for example, Schindler's List. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this movie was inspiring; It inspired me to watch another movie. In one scene, when a flight attendant notes about male pilots, Kennedy asks, "Why do you think it's called a" cockpit "?" Charming. <br /> <br /> And yes, unlike some, this movie is very, very bad.
