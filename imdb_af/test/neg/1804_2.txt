If you're looking for a movie that lets you sleep, Heart of Darkness is the movie for you. The book wasn't what I expected it to be, and the movie made me even more disappointed. The cast list was unfortunate, and the whole plot was pathetic and not like the book except for a few scenes. I understand that everyone has their own point of view when they read Heart of Darkness, and they create their own movie in their heads, but directors cut important scenes and add meaningless. If there was someone in the movie who was supposed to be from a certain culture, they had to use an actor who was of that culture. There are actors from every location, and I'm sure they could get better at fit the roles. Joseph Conrad was a respected man and created a book that would entertain you as it looked, but the movie was cheap and useless. And someone who could make the film as respectful as the book had to do it. If you want a movie dragging you in the dark, Heart of Darkness is the movie for you.
