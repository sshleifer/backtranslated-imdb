This movie may well be a propaganda movie for the North American Falangist Party - or a similar group. The strong man (Kersey) places him above the law (but not beyond the law) and frees rebellious citizens by killing worthless trash. . The only thing that made me think it was not made by the KKK was the fact that a Jew considered a good man. Try to consider it again as a propaganda movie for an extreme right-wing group. And you will see what I mean ... <br /> <br /> It's a tragedy that Jimmy Page actually made music for this movie ... :(
