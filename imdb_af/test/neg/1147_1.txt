Why, why should they try to make a sequel to one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time? The movie is a train wreck at every level and never had to be made. Randy Quaid's cousin Eddie's depiction is a top caricature of his past trips as cousin Eddie. Also, the Eddie character is not interesting enough to carry a whole movie. Even "eye candy" Sung Hi Lee couldn't leave this holiday holiday. Please do not waste your time on this move, just look again at the original.
