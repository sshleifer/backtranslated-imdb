<br /> <br /> I was thrilled to read the variety of views on `Circus 'of` incredible, breathtaking, brilliant' and most things right down to 'Golden Turkey candidate'. I find myself in the latter camp. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the producers thought that if they had an abundance of violent blends with four-letter baroque blends, they would hold another "Lock, Stock" and two Smoke Barrels. Sorry they forgot to include white, style, charm and flair. And it was definitely a mistake to visit Welles's classic "The Lady from Shanghai", so we remind ourselves of how much better cinema can be. <br /> <br /> John Hannah gets his shirt on every occasion, a great US drive in a Mini Minor as 'Circus' becomes pathetic for cult status and even the beautiful Amanda Donohoe can't add any class to these proceedings . <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Briton movie try the sublime 'wonderland'
