Zombie Planet looks like an example of good ideas and laudable ambition overlapping budget. I thought the explanation for the zombies was truly original and gnarly, and loved the dog in the exhibition scene. The rest of the gore was on a low budget, but also in filming the movie. The problem was that it was too long and anti-climate. Sure, they have an intriguing, as a derivative plot line, and a similar well-known but cool environment, but a low-budget zombie movie should really be aesthetic to make an impression and there wasn't enough red moments in it. I think there was also a surplus of cheap search and bloodless struggle scenes, especially, especially since generally minimal horror. Plus, for a two-hour movie, there is very little closing at the end, and although it makes me, I want to find Zombie Planet 2, I feel a little cheated. So probably worth looking for the two of them.
