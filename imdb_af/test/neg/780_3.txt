Strangely, I have very little to say about "The Box", so it will be pretty short. I have never read the Richard Matheson novella "Button, Button" from which the film is based, but considering what I saw in this "adaptation" could not have been the work of such a legendary writer. . "The Box" is about a family who finds a strange contrast on their doorstep that has a button on it. Frank Langella points out and explains how they will get one million dollars when they press the button. The only "catch" is that it will kill someone somewhere ... ?? SPOILER ?? They push it ?? END OF SPOILERS ?? The whole concept was intriguing in itself, but somehow they managed to extend the movie to a winding Stargate knock-off that made it a pretty decent ending with a fairly profound message. While trying to be as fair as possible, I still have to say that it was not my cup of tea and it was very boring to me. I think it's from the same director as "Donnie Darko" I remember when I saw it years ago. "The box" would have worked well as a short movie, but as it is so lifeless, I can't get close to recommending it.
