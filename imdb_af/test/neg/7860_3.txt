Although much is recommended for Maetel Legend, both in concept and finished product, it is ultimately a poor film. Plot shows this is a re-declaration of Maetel's early life, which is usually unclear; At the same time, the authors take the opportunity to tell the story of the machine power. And since Leiji Matsumoto is having problems not including his other work, we get a starting point for Emeraldas, her sister, Her mother: the Queen of La Metals and a little Galaxy Express 999 to splash out the movie. <br /> <br /> In short, Maetel is a princess on the planet La Metalle, a planet with an irregular orbit. This means that the cycle around the nearest sun reaches a cold and it is artificial. Sun dies. The planet is becoming increasingly colder throughout the story, which increases the sense of punishment. To protect her subjects and family, the Queen decides that mechanization is the only way to ensure the survival of La Metals people. Enter Lord Hardgear, a robot / cyborg that provides the means for the job. Through the film, the characters are left to question mechanization, will they still be human? Can Hardgear be trusted? Will souls and hearts remain? So, for a fan of Matsumoto's work, there is a lot to enjoy, questions to be answered, themes being continued, except it is clear that the film is an introduction, as well as a fan of curiosity. The negative, especially the animation, while Galaxy Express 999, a TV series of over twenty years ago a crooked mouth animation and sometimes sketchy character design, has Maetel Legend all the worst features of modern animation and thus earns an air of respect for the Milky Way. Express 999. The design is well-detailed, but unfortunately the animation suffered from moving well-drawn characters, such as moving in the background or the camera zoom, a quick way to animate. But the few, yes, very well-animated scenes are used over and over in dream series, repetition and extra scenes. Anyone who looks at the movie will wonder how many times Lord Hardgear can drink the same glass of wine. <br /> <br /> Next the story. In concept everything is fine, the end product is actually a series of repeatedly repeated talks, the number of times the same characters are learning and learning the same things, is almost insulting to the audience and the characters who seem to put much more into the earlier incarnations. Add to that a horrible character design, which looks lifeless, over-exaggerated, and the audience is writing a movie so badly, as good as another movie, at least the newcomers won't be stunned. . <br /> <br /> And yet it really does have its moments, the end is at least surprising. The state of La Metalle's citizens was reasonably affected and at the same time disturbing; I think I find the whole man-machine theme disturbing. It is hard to recommend to recommend Maetel Legend as it is not well animated, written or performed, plus confusion as soon as Leiji Matsumoto's mandatory cross-references are introduced. However, I can't help but if the wonderful entrance of Three-Nine takes place, it's now a good theater. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars out of 5, 2 if you're a fan.
