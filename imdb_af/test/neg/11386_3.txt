Somehow, this documentary about Miles can include very little music and no complete songs. Although Miles appears in the film, 95% of interviews are other people, not Miles. There are huge chronological gaps, many aspects of his life (his childhood, his drug addiction) are skipped or gleamed and you will learn little about what made the man and his contribution to music so pioneering. Skip it.
