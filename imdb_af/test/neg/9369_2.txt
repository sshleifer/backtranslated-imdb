I usually don't write reviews for shows unless I've seen them in full. However, there were so many positive views of this show here. I felt it was necessary to balance it with some realism. <br /> <br /> This show is hysterically bad. I don't think it was meant to be, but it is. I see a lot of praise on the show, and I honestly understand why --- this performance has been so poor, the dialogue is so terrible and the sites are thin around their holes. <br /> <br /> I think this show is interesting because it is a definite litmus test of your standards. Some elements of the show work, and perhaps these elements are more important to some people than those who do not work, making the performance almost unshakable to people like me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy having fun on a show while you watch it, and it's a fun show to mock when you have that time. <br /> <br /> The pilot is a great example of the whole show. If the nonsense sarcine clich√© ends, do not leave you in a stupid shock, then it may be a representation to you.
