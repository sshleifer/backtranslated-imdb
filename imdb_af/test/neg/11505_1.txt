Of course Sadie is by far the worst show I've ever seen, it's such a piece of sh ** and loaded with full bullsh **. I didn't get any of the gags to be funny or somewhat clever, they were all terrible jokes. <br /> <br /> The play sucks, many of the characters sucked into acting are Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) such a terrible actor, the other characters also suck (Magaret, Rain, Hal). <br /> <br /> The plot is not unique and creative and the performance is so predictable. It's one of the worst shows of all time, it shouldn't even be made. The idiots responsible for writing this garbage should be discharged (if they have not yet done so). The fist season was actually viewable, but the second season was just a disaster, it's too difficult to watch this show, it's over.
