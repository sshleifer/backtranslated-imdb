Talk about false advertising! What did it do in the comedy section of my video rental site? I think there might have been one laughable role in the movie. I can appreciate black comedy, but it only had the blackness without any comedy. The movie was generally disturbing and rude. Yes, Kevin Spacey was good as Buddy and the rest of the role was also good, but overall the movie fell apart because we didn't really see enough reason for Guy (Whaley) to lose his mind so badly. The end was also disappointing. What would Buddy's motivation be to leave Guy with what he did? This is not really explained. Why would Buddy plan such a plan? Wouldn't it be more like Buddy to screw Guy completely by letting him go to the police? The end didn't feel much to me, no matter how I looked at it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I didn't like the movie despite the good acting. Spacey, in most cases, weighs beauty, but in the end, he needs Buddy a little to humanity. The story just wasn't as good as the cast.
