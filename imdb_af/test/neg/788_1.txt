Quite possibly one of (if not the) worst film ever developed, thrown and acted in the history of the theater. Who on God's green earth will ever think of throwing Cameron Diaz and James Mardsen as a couple? She looks like his mother. God forgives me, but I'm just honest. And that was the least of the many problems this horrific apology made to a movie. It was a terrible statement against women, but at least if you blame women for the problems of the world, tell a decent story, with so many annoying loopholes and pathetic excitement for excitement and excitement. Everybody needs to get their money back that watched it in theaters or bought the DVD.
