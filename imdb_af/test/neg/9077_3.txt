Bronson took the money and ran with this movie; He needs home payments like me! This low budget film made in Mexico reminds me of some of those Italians who stink from across. I heard, I don't know if it's true, but companies make these films overseas for tax purposes. I believe it, because otherwise they would make this movie, it certainly wasn't making money. We had many of these Canadian stinkers, because the government has given tax breaks to create a film industry. I wonder if it paid in other countries like Canada. Anyway, back to the subject, this movie was poor in every aspect, I believe they grabbed Charles Bronson to sell this stinker. that dead body at the end looks very ominous. 10/03
