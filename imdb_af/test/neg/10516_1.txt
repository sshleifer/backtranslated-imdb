In a world full of movies, like "You Got Served" - which raises your mind with its huge number of mistakes, you'll never notice that there will be worse movies ... until now. Ron Hall's "Vampire Assassins" do more than you cheeses. It KNOWS you are angry. First, there are no assassins in this movie. In fact, there is only one good guy fighting in the whole movie. Second, the location ... is basically one place: a house of Jackass (or basement. It's up to you.). Third: The special effects (bluntly) can kiss my ass. Fourth: The acting beats "Plan 9 from Outer Space" in the worst acting category. Ron Hall can't act to save his life. Finally (and certainly not the smallest problem): EDITING. The person who processed this movie hopes I'll never get him. The cuts and shots are HORRENDOUS !!!! Other issues: Lighting (virtually none), the fact that the man on the cover is not even in the movie and the fact that this film exists. <br /> <br /> To summarize this movie, let's just say I tortured the DVD copy before I took it back to Hollywood Video (don't worry! I used the MVP membership, so it was free!). Never see this movie !!!!
