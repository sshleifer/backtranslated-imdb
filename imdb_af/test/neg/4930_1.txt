It's about as stupid as it gets. <br /> <br /> A classic case of two-dimensional characters that always behave exactly to what a healthy person would do in the same situation. It reminds me of a scene in 'Scary Movie' where Carmen Electra flees from the killer. There are two signs, one marked "for safety", the other one "to death" (I read from memory). <br /> <br /> And just like in Scary Movie, the characters always go in the direction of "Sure Death". <br /> <br /> Why, why did the girl start the fire in the cashier and KEEP THE SHUT? Did she prefer to die in the fire, instead of being killed by the man? Why, why, after the driver cut and overcame, did they put him in the seat and watched him through the wounded man instead of suddenly shooting him or at least beating him? He ran over their friend and killed him for a moment, but they have scrapes? Why o why a hundred things more ... <br /> <br /> If this movie was a road, you couldn't drive a single yard because of the holes. Everything is so far-fetched, it sometimes begins to hurt physically. <br /> <br /> Add mercilessly overpowering "actors" and a small budget for it and here's what you get. Looking at the review and the comments, I get the feeling that people are watching a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> The one thing that is really missing is the infamous "While She was out" toolbox - a movie about similar in unrealistic plot and stupid character of the characters.
