Danny Lee's performance as a wisecracking cop is the only place of interest in this film, although it is an excellent movie including Chow Yun-Fat, Carina Lau, Andy Lau, Shing Fui-On and Alex Man. CYF plays a triad boss who wants to live on a life of peace and enough, but Alex Man, a total psycho who has a big grudge against CYF, will not allow him. CYF tries to escape to Malacca, but to no avail. After his family was blown, his cronies died or shielded, wounded and broken, CYF came back to Hong Kong to get serious revenge. <br /> <br /> It sounds much better than it is. CYF is well-dressed and attractive, looks painful, grimace and cries, but somehow you just don't care. Andy Lau looks good, but it's about it. Carina Lau has a small, tiny little piece that was nice, but she gets a bullet in time so it ends. Alex Man is a cartoon villain who is so overwhelmed that sometimes intrigues, but the writing here is so flat that he just comes across as a garden variety nut. <br /> <br /> Danny Lee is wonderful though - too bad he is just a little blip on the screen of this dark (literally) and essentially boring movie. <br /> <br /> Rent it, don't buy it. Or keep it completely over. <br /> <br /> This is the successor to Rich and Famous, though apparently filmed simultaneously; It was first released due to CYF's boxing power.
