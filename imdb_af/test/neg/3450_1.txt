It was one of the worst movies I've ever experienced. The cinematography was boring, with long boring shots (like a camera on a tripod that filmed a play) between "dramatic" angles that made little sense on the content on the screen. The editing was terrible, scenes were associated with the delicacy of a butcher. The plot is familiar to the viewer with the historic evening in which Mary Shelley wrote France's Stone. The acting was forced, with the kind of character development that left you with an intense interest in seeing each of them die (the sooner the better).
