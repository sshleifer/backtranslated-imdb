I thought there might be some value for this movie, and put it through the whole thing. I can summarize by saying that it has left a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> The movie started. I think the initial characterization of Herc was true for myths. Both as a child and a young adult, he started strong but not the brightest bulb. But later he somehow changes into a charismatic speaker, loved by everyone. Huh? <br /> <br /> Another problem: terrible CGI. The satir looked good, but the rest of the cattle just looked terrible, especially the heart, the finest looking animal in the movie. And how does Leelee Sobieski's skin sometimes get faster, sometimes normal? The worst part for me - and everyone has to cringe this - was the twelve labor of Hercules. Because the producers obviously didn't want to cover everyone; Perhaps they thought we couldn't count primitive screw heads looking at this garbage. Instead of the TWO work of Hercules, we have the FIVE work of Hercules. Yes, the five work! WTF?!? He didn't even finish the last one, so it was really the 4 1/2 job! Not terrible. I'll take Hercules: The legendary journeys on this piece of shit every day of the week.
