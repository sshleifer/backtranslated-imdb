I'm looking forward to this movie. I like road riders. I like sex, drugs, youth, action and a good soundtrack. And I was especially interested in the film tour of Europe to see if I recognized my own travel points. <br /> <br /> However, this movie was not available from the first scene. What drove Guy on the wrong side of the road? What could possibly blow up the wagon that rolled gracefully at a shallow grass slope? If they are such a bad driver, why should they take delivery? And that's just the first scene! Not even bad enough to be camp or stupid. Just awful! Awful! Awful! Waste of time. Move to something ... anything else!
