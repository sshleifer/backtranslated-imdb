Something strange happens in remote areas of the Arctic. An airforce station is found, its inhabitants are missing. An Eskimo village is destroyed. A fishing vessel disappears. Curious track lines are found in the snow. A four-footed living organism is found near a destroyed aircraft. The piece looks like half the claw of a giant Alaskan crab. The army (Craig Stevens as an air force officer) and his experts are astounded. A leading scientist (William Hopper) and his fine assistant (Alix Taltan) are handed in in New York. Hopper derives from this thin evidence that they are dealing with a monstrous praying mantis. He's right. The beautiful assistant happens to look out the window of the office and see the horrible face with his bulging eyeballs staring at her. She dropped what she was wearing, clapping her hands on her cheeks and screaming in horror. <br /> <br /> The mantis starts south-south along the Gulf Stream, occasionally waiting to attack large population centers such as Washington and New York. reverse buses and eat people. Military weapons do not affect it much, but eventually Stevens enters into his jet plane and dies the animal, which comes to earth and damages the Manhattan Tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey. <br /> <br /> Stevens, who survived the collision, led his team into the tunnel and killed the big mistake with "3RG mines" despite his fiery appearance, threatening behavior, and earthquake roar. Stevens and Taltan kiss in front of the body while hopper chuckles and takes their picture. <br /> <br /> Ho hum. <br /> <br /> Like the deadly mantis itself, the formula by this time was panting and sneaking for the air, flipping around, searching for prey not people but anything in the way of a fresh or original idea. As it is, they overlooked one clich√©. Hopper had to find out in a hurry a Super Duper DDT who can only defeat the insect. That's what the 3RG mines needed to be filled, rather than ordinary explosives. <br /> <br /> The model work is pretty good, considering what the budget should have been. Not much money could be spent on anything else, because everything is quite routine. Craig Stevens is slim, a face and style for a TV show. William Hopper looks straight and silver haired - but his instrument has just one note. The beautiful assistant is fairly simple, taking into account her role. The part asks for Joan Weldon or Laurie Nelson. They also could not act, but with their small but clear intimacies. Anything would have helped this fragmented movie. <br /> <br /> I wish the deadly mantis didn't stir as hard and so often because you couldn't roar - you couldn't even whisper - if you didn't have lungs. However, I didn't think when the monster met its downfall in the tunnel. A praying mantis is a graceful insect in its own way and it is wonderful to have them in the garden because they eat caterpillars and what is not. But when you get there, they're not really attractive. The male mantis is smaller and weaker than the female, as in humans, and when the couple is almost through copying, the woman bites the head of the male, as well as in humans. But at least human men know when to stop. The male mantis remains co-operative for a few minutes, though now without head. Our people do not have senseless men who copulate with goal-driven women. Do we?
