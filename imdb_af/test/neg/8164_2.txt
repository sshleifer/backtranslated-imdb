I love movies, all genres, and big dollar glasses to small indie projects. But even to prevent this rubbish from being 25 years old and its attempt to pay tribute to the 1950s, it is only in almost an aspect that we judge films. <br /> <br /> During the film I was reminded of several "student movies", I have a chance to watch, efforts where creativity is needed to fill gaps where funds are needed. <br /> <br /> Overall chances are that you will have much better use for 90 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> 2/10
