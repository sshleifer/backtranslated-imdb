I am very diplomatic in my reviews, and as an academic writer, try to give creative license to TV writers to try to portray a true story. This story, about Karen Carpenter, could have helped so much, but because of directing and editing, it doesn't. <br /> <br /> The story, in this case, is not fully addressed unless one reads psychological journals. While Cynthia Gibb portrays a realistic Karen, it is sad that so many have been edited. Louise Fletcher portrays her mother, and does an excellent job, with limited material and dialogue. In this case, I give the actors credit to survive this project. <br /> <br /> Why is the audience not allowed to see causal factors? .... American audiences are pretty skilled and if they have cable, usually educate. <br /> <br /> I feel I could write a better story, the truth would not have worked out and allowed the actors to project reality. <br /> <br /> Richard Carpenter, as director, seriously underrated and insulted American audiences. Karen's story is important, and it's sad we'll never hear it.
