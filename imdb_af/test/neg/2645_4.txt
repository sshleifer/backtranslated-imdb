It was one of the most mixed movies I've ever seen. Everything in the film seems to be attached to justifying another element. There is even a talking buffalo who wants to rub his wet nose to make the magic happen. Even the brutal father seems to just excuse the children for flying away in a wagon. It was laughing, but uncomfortable because of the serious subjects that seem to be used just to set up the plot.
