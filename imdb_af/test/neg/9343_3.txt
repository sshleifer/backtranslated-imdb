I do not understand the exaggerated critics of this movie, except that many people from Venezuela are understandably excited, based on the fact that the Venezuelan theater really knows a bit about which other countries in the region are. <br /> <br /> The movie is, in the first place, repetitive, many scenes are almost identical to each of the two main roles, so you get the impression that it is a time-consuming one. A time filler is also a good point, as this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes, you will get tired after a while and watch the watch. <br /> <br /> All actors are very bad, except for Venezuelan man Edgar Ramirez, who brings in a little slapstick and plays the role of the Venezuelan site "Pedro". <br /> <br /> By the way, it's not a representative movie about the people of the region (Caribbean zone), it tends to mock them.
