Have you ever tried some kind of food that your friend made, and then said to yourself, "Wow, it wasn't a good mix"? Well, so I felt after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Many viewers will be left very uncomfortable with this strange mix of crime and very, very funny comedy. It's almost like watching Mr. Rogers plays a relentless gangster, very strange. Some things just don't mix and this movie shows it clearly. <br /> <br /> There are some very good performances here, as Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle and Alec Baldwin are all excellent, but Jonathan Demme did great work in films such as Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia but apparently from its element with this one.
