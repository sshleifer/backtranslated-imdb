I thought this movie would be good. It was absolutely not, despite the Oscar-winning main actors. I laughed once, and I never laughed at anyone else in the theater. Ren√© Zellweger's pancake makeup was very uncomfortable. Everyone looks so hard in this movie, running around in slapstick imitation, but doesn't pull it off. I think the movie may have evolved well in development, but something has been missing in translation. Were the roaring 20's really that way? I do not think so. Everything looks a bit artificial. Randy Newman's score was annoying. The film is shown in sepia, just like any other movie that takes place in the 20's or 30's. There's just not so much originality here.
