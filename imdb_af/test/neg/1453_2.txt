It's a very strange Hollywood product. Apparently, it hasn't been well tested, as actors who have footage in the credits have been completely eliminated from the movie, which means a quick cut has been done. It feels like it's been thrown out of the skilled Demme's hands and just thrown away. On the other hand, it is so completely lacking that it can save nothing. It has no real center, either confidential or time-wise. Although it says the run time is 92 minutes, it seems to end suddenly, about 80 minutes. It is over before it even goes. This is pretty unrelenting. <br /> <br /> The merit of the "Matthew Modine Picture" was as elusive as the Luke Wilson picture is now.
