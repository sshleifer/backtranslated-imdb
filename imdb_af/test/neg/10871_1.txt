Larry Bishop directs, writes and leads this gentle core porn, plot less biker movie about nothing to do with anything. Calling this one of the worst movies of 2008 is similar to the garbage I spent money while in the theaters. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I felt sorry for the girls mostly, who presumably think they are making a feature film, when in reality they make a porn. They walk on the set for four days, say some sexual lines to disgusting old men - thirty years older than them - then pull out their patches and run around naked for the four days they're going on. I can only assume it was Larry Bishops, the only way to be laid. You see shot at the shot directly on a girl's ass. Shot after Bishop's shot walks up to a random chick and grabs her most intimate parts, as if shaking her hand. How this madness is even funded is beyond me. Why Tarantino got his name on it is beyond me, but he has slowly disappeared since 1994, so I can't say I was surprised. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes you get that horrible feeling that just awful (and I mean terrible) movies gives you. If you see it in theaters, the pain you feel becomes stronger. After 15 minutes I wanted to cry because I was so stupid and wasted, not just my time, but my hard earned ten dollars. There is no reason for quality, or one moment in the movie that creates any kind of response or any kind of tendency that these people have any idea of ​​what they are doing. If you don't see naked women so often, then I think this movie will be for you. If you are eleven, you will probably like it. You can't even laugh about it, because every idiot makes it laugh about the shit they've made. The play is terrible, the writing is terrible, the production is terrible, and the direction is terrible. It's not even worth your time to rent the car accident. Stay away, stay very far away. Don't even read these reviews. I don't even have to write one.
