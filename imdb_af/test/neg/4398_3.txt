Jeez, when I heard this movie, was a NATIONAL LAMPONS. I thought it would be great, but I really did say it was a disappointment. I saw most of the movies they made, from Christmas holidays to Van Wilder, and this movie is the worst movie in their name, really bad actors and a very intense movie. this movie is probably good to see if you see it with a crowd of people who have acted and the ability to laugh at it, but if you are in good comedy like me, I do not suggest this movie, I will Rather, Van Wilder watches a second or third time to watch this movie ... you're warned.
