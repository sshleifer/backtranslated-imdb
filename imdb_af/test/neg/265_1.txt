Ocean's Twelve: just stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two. <br /> <br /> An artifact. 10 well-known actors, at least. A weak script and a very slow developing idea. That's why I characterize a movie. I only saw at least 20 minutes of it. Don't get me wrong, you might like it. But I just love the Ocean movies because of the Heist theme. If Ocean's 12 isn't about Heist, what's the point? Glad Soderberg saw his main error and saved himself by making a movie that is much better than the first one. Kudos for that. <br /> <br /> Steven Soderberg is not really a good director. Apart from his hit "Sex lies and videotapes" ... nothing else happened so much for the career of this director. Sorry for him. But just his fault.
