A low budget can be an excuse for poor-performing talent and pathetic looking fake gore. However, this is not an excuse for poor writing. It is a talent for writing dialogue without forcing it and mechanically sounding it. The dialogue in this movie was on the same scale as most instructional videos shown to training fast food workers. <br /> <br /> I also understand that one should make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent if you only have $ 20 to spend on it. Having said that, no serious director would have looked at these scenes and said to himself, "It was perfect". I see a better character acting on Canadian television. <br /> <br /> This movie had a paper thin plot, bad play, poor dialogue and no intelligent ideas. It just proves to me that some independent movies are for a reason. If you are looking for a quick scare, rent anything else. Even the "Cable Guy" was a rare movie. After watching this movie, I think I'd have been better off seeing a re-run on the X files.
