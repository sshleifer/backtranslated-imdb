I really had a 'Candidate Camera' with Dom DeLuise and I was surprised to see Suzanne Somers become the show's co-star after years. But it was the only positive side of the show - the whole studio, the intro, the hosts - all that gives the new meaning to the word "pompous". <br /> <br /> Well, it would be good if the material wasn't so cr * ppy - I mean come on, the best thing you can do is show that there are few people having trouble ketchup get out of the bottle. Suzanne Somers walks with Halloween basket in July, ice cream selling just vanilla. ...? I saw few episodes and each time it was terrible. They thought it was the biggest show ever and then filled the time with scenes so dull that I was really shy to watch. Even the people in them got bored and it just can't be good.
