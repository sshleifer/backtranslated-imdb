The earth was destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Well, parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy a group of adult survivors - those without radioactive contamination - are thrown into a massive house surrounded by lush grounds and are waiting for the next opportunity to hunt for those with polluted blood. The final executor is the story of one of them being victims, Alan (William Mang, who doesn't seem surprisingly much like Kurt Russell) and his efforts to take down the legally wounded hunters, led by Edra (Marina Costa) and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr.). Alan is trained to kill by former NYPD cop Sam (Woody Strode), mostly hanging around to give his pupil moral support and to look for cans of meat. Straw is by far the best aspect of the film, although he doesn't look good at all and only appears about a third of the running time. Regarding the story, it is a blend of elements of better movies and stories, including ten little Indians, the most dangerous game and escape from New York. The Final Executive moves at a reasonable rate and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminatory action fans.
