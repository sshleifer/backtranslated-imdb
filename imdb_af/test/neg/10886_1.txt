I can't make it easier, it's a terrible movie. I worked in the industry and made several (short) movies myself, so okay, my standard is pretty high, but seriously, I totally hate this movie. I haven't made a comment on IMDb yet, but I hated this movie so much that I literally had to warn others. This is a piece of sh * t. The author / director is an idiot who has no idea how to make or write a good film and has the writing skills of an adolescent teenager. The characters are unrealistic. (The main lady doesn't think the policeman's gun is but inventive enough to improvise a Molotov cocktail?) And not even good, hell hated and cheered me when she died. I don't understand what the director was trying to do with his demon redneck idea, but it looks like messy writing and comfortable bullsh * t with no real thought behind it. It's officially the worst movie I've seen ALL YEARS. Congratulations Shiban, you are now standing up with such sizes as Micheal Bay in the coveted "shouldn't waste millions of dollars to make a movie club. I hope you read it, I really do. And for the 163 idiots who watch this movie rated, 10 out of 10 BWAHHAHAHAHAh, my God, I hope a redneck demon will easily appear behind you and torture you.
