Yes, age has a habit of making the male species look foolish. And this soap opera doesn't joke when they make Perry King, presumably a well-known medical doctor, do not hurt him. Put your trust in doctors, huh? How can anyone not see what is going on? Is he so stupid? And the evil woman, with a horse-like face, is going to kill his whole family without a trace. How does she get all the drugs? This is not explained. How is she leaving as a secretary in a hospital without any credentials? I think the director, Don FauntLeRoy, asks us to believe it. I didn't. I shouted on the screen of the stupidity of king, with all the rights in front of his face. If the woman was attractive, maybe, maybe, I would accept it. But she wasn't even so. Shannon Sturges is the perfect woman and I tell you she has a horse's face. I will not cross the street for her, but do our perfect man and quickly. After everyone was beaten in the throw, I was not happy with the upcoming pennies given to us scoundrel. She deserves more than she has. William Moses plays the doctor's brother who unfortunately knows his outcome from day one. Enjoy seeing at least one nice face in this vowel. This from Lesley Anne Down. She gives the movie a 2 score just on the relief to see someone fetch in this mess. Perry King earned his fate. What a swap.
