It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen, it was terribly done, it didn't flow, it was a lot of choppy, because many people didn't understand the movie at all. I had to watch this movie a few times before I get an idea of ​​what happened. OK, like this, a child stole someone's car and while he was running from the police, he made it up. For some reason the police dropped him off and he had to deal with it. his parents who sent him to stay with his uncle in the desert, he meets a girl who loves to climb, and he goes into the sport and begs his uncle to get him into a game to climb. It's like I said a horrible movie.
