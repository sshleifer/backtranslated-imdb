The Golden Arm Man (the movie) is a great career for Frank Sinatra, but abysmally fails as a good adaptation to a fantastic book. You always hear how books are changed when they are made into movies - things are cut out, dipped, and so on. Well, you can't even say they've changed something with the movie - they just have a completely different story. The characters and the institution are all the same - but not the ambiguous characterization, the depth of the men and women of Chicago Chicago in the book. As far as the institution is concerned, it is just a stage stage, complete with the unnecessary supporting role-players who are too busy for the claustrophobic, inside-out streets. The movie is a dumbed-down, totally different on Frankie Machine and drug addiction. When that happens, Zosh, Frankie, loses Sparrow's psychological edge. Frankie's drumming, a modest dream in the book, becomes his full passion in the movie (probably because Sinatra is a musician). And drug addiction is treated as a safe, mined. The play is decent, especially the playful Louie, who is more threatening in the movie than the book. But it's just a shame that this kind of movie can be reminded of a classic, alongside the book on which it is based, the true story of Frankie Machine. The movie just goes to show that Hollywood can do something without immersing it and adding a happy ending. In this case, they have completely changed it, and made an important and realistic story in Hollywood fluff. I'm probably so biased because I first read the book so I can't really handle the movie by knowing how good the book is. I actually thought to turn the movie off (and I never do it), so I won't be confused with the beauty of the book. But this is an overestimated movie, and while it's not that bad, the book has to be first because it was the first. And it had to remain the only story of Division Street and Frankie Machine.
