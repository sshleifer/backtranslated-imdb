Given the subject of drug addiction to the bone can hardly help but rather be a depressing movie. But depressed need not necessarily be bad. Unfortunately, in this case, it's actually pretty bad. The film has good things, especially the quality performance of Vera Farmiga in the central role of Irene, a working mom struggling with cocaine addiction. But there is not enough good to overpower the bad. The film's failures lie mainly with the story, which doesn't come in hand and never really looks like. Irene goes home and comes home to an indisputable man who has no idea how to support her endeavor. Irene grows close to another addict addict, a male nurse from her rehab center. Complications occur. But the story never really blows life. It doesn't look like the movie really goes back and forth. You can say it is a sharp, realistic look at the day-to-day battle of an addict. Perhaps, but in this case it does not make for an interesting movie. The whole thing has a very "blah" feel to it. The minimalist cinematography doesn't matter, and adds another low to the incredible killing process. And none of the other shows meets Farmiga's. Hugh Dillon is OK as Irene's male nurse friend, but no one else in the throw adds anything to the proceedings. All in all, this movie is a dark, depressing and rather dim ride.
