As the scientific fan of what I am, I was always curious about this movie. So I was excited to see that the journey to the Far Side of the Sun is finally released on an affordable DVD (the previous press got $ 100 on eBay - I'm sure those people wish they had their money back - but more about it in a second). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the prospect of this movie (like Twilight Zone's "The Parallel") is that there is an undiscovered planet that looks like the Earth on the "other side of the sun" . Of course, this planet is exactly the same as ours, except it is inverted. It basically means that their letters are being overturned and people are driving on the wrong side of the road. <br /> <br /> Sounds intrigued? Well, that's basically all there is to this movie. The first hour or so is dedicated to preparing for the journey to this other planet. These are just boring scenes of switches that are pushed, banal dialogue, etc. There is no point about it. Gerry Anderson managed to find the most boring British actors in the history of the theater to play the most roles. I mean they're so dull. I'm surprised the crew was able to stay awake to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as soon as the crew definitely land on the planet (following a volatile sequence of astronauts sitting and literally sleeping in the cabin), Roy Thinnes believes the copy is all backwards on a bottle of cologne and hop back on another ship to tell people what he had discovered. Oops he never gets to do it because he falls and dies. The end! Oh wait, there is a bonus scene of one of the space officials moving himself into a mirror in his wheelchair at the end. I think he also wanted this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised with a movie like this, even in the 60's it could even be made back. Rent if you need to. DO NOT BUY.
