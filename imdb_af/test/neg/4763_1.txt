The movie is promising enough, the use of images and simple short cuts carries the larger story, which usually requires a much higher budget than the one. But it started to worry me, as it continued, combined with another exaggerated Max Payne-type voice over the movie, didn't look that good. I was hoping it was just the introduction to the story. <br /> <br /> The story is what really caught me and took me to this movie. The idea that a research scientist created a virus that actually protects the cells that infect it from other infections was an interesting scientific idea. Then those subjects that had the most bizarre diseases sought and offered the scientist to be his human experiments. I thought it could be a very good little movie. Yet the introduction didn't go well. <br /> <br /> There was apparently a tempo change as the film was turned on recorded interviews with the four main characters in the film, the test subjects. Although the play was not excellent, there was plenty of room for character development throughout the movie, and the recordings were pretty good with a variety of characters. But it faded through the film. They were not reused after a few short tracks and I felt there was a missed opportunity to give a great character development by reflecting back on them, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> The imagery is increasingly disconnected from the story, often repeated to suggest something that's still going on. This decoupling and repetition is reflected in the annoying and distracting comments. It started to read words one by one. Short, meaningless sentences and do not mention too relevant or interesting scientific ramblings. If there was something to be described, four or five words would be used, it was too long, repetitive, circular, loopy, ... you got the idea. <br /> <br /> Now it could have been. to reflect the confusion and the character, slowly getting caught up in his own mind, because he was not affected by food and water. What it actually did was to completely eliminate me from the voice and at the last stages of the movie I found that I hadn't listened to some of the ramblings. <br /> <br /> A number of times an event occurs, the camera shows all the characters one after the other for their response, appearing somewhere between confusing and thoughtful. There has been repeatedly fading from the same scene to the same scene. For example, a character sleeps to black, then falls back on the character who is sleeping again. Look, we know the character is asleep, we know the time is over, please continue. Overall there are just too many atmospheric cuts and long hanging shots to fill time. <br /> <br /> The acting wasn't bad, and the characters were good but not exploited and developed. When interacting, there were a few really momentous moments. For example, when one of them asks if they are hungry, look at each camera and return to a group shot, they break, look at each other, turn back to the camera and say slowly "No". It raised a snail or two. Their dialogue was slow, glossy and completely or totally unnecessary. There was no middle ground where the dialogue was spotted. <br /> <br /> However, there were some good scenes, but they were really hard to find unless you saw them separately, and that's how it almost looks like this movie happened. The movie was viewed as a series of scenes and not as a complete story. <br /> <br /> Nowhere is it seen more than in the main story. The characters are infected with the virus that killed the animals, the one designed for them. We are told that it is developing something dramatically in stages, and so is what we expect. What we get is the characters together, everybody throws together, water that jumps out of their mouths into unconvincing streams, then everyone falls asleep. These are the stages that really happen early in the movie. Then they all say "Good" together when asked how it is, and that is it. That's the virus that's been done, nothing else happens. <br /> <br /> So much more could have been done with this movie, so much more developed with the virus and it protects them from all possible damage. This could have been a serious change to these characters as it was infected and taken over. It could have developed these characters, making them decisions and doing things related to their characters that appear in the feedback to the interviews. <br /> <br /> The end is not even confusing, intrigue or thoughts. It just shows something that is happening and that is it, although it has long been chosen with the annoying voice above it. I really struggled with this movie and watched a number of press releases going out (including one well-known TV critic who leaves within the first twenty minutes). I stayed but regretted the lost time.
