How senseless, boring characters and boring movie. Saved by short sex scenes, crazy witch, beautiful desert island and Brooks body. The plot is tough, the characters are flat and unpleasant. To say that I could see it all, mainly because I was completely transferred by the jiggling and kind of hope that her character would eventually come well. The movie was well shot, well directed, but perhaps the casting dropped it in some ways. Disappointing. In fact, the review summed up in the first line, but this site dictates that you have to write 10 lines of minimum. It would be better to spend the time watching another movie.
