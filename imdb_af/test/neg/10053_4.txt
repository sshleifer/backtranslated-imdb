WARNING SPOILER: At the end of the movie, it is announced that the bridge had just collapsed for a few days after being caught. The impression is that the attack was all for nothing. In fact, the Remagen bridge was the last major victory for the Western Allies. It was the crossing of the Rhine trying to reach allies for six months. Because the Remagen Bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks. <br /> <br /> The bridge should last only one day after it has been caught. It was enough time for the Americans to send out fighting engineers and a great protective force on the other, and they could then start building a series of pontoon bridge. The use of the bridge was a complete success, and meant that the end of the war was close and would not last through the summer. Contrary to the cynical nature of the film, the victory by the troops that did so resurrected. They knew how important the fight was. <br /> <br /> This movie has little to do with real history. It was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time it was produced.
