probably the worst creature ever, boa vs python was a million times better than this and it was also not nice, bad plays, bad effects and guess what the DVD is one of those with 3 hour previews in front of the main menu. probably the least scary film ever, no blood or violence, people are stupid and continue to use pistols when they have no influence on these animals. The only cool part was the radioactive leaks that were nice, I mention the island is just a rip off of Jurassic park boring and not worth even watching, but I suppose the characters are stupid pretty funny, so it would make a good comedy movie, but definitely not a thriller
