If you are wondering if Disney can broadcast a show with a character more pampered than Paris, more level than Britney, more vapid than Jessica and more narcissistic than THE GIRLS NEXT BY, don't wonder. The great thing is that Selena Gomez is supposed to be the heroine. She is also supposed to be from the spoiled, shallow, dull narcissistic "popular" girls at school, who is no longer credible here than it was for Hilary Duff in LIZZIE McGUIRE. Plots range from recycled WITCHED & I DREAM OF JEANNIE to "parodies" of HARRY POTTER. The older boy ranges from a magical genius and is unable to master the complexities of his own shoelaces. The younger boy is just one of the smart-mouth "wisecracking" brats that multiplied on TV like cockroaches in New York (and with the same appeal). The father is the stereotypical stupid TV dad, and the mother ... well, she's not quite terrible. But all of them highlight the frightening, cruel, yet terribly fascinating (like a bad car accident) spectacle of me. Lopez's alley, confident, snotty performance. And again, she's the HEROINE.
