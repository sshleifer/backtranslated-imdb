Be very scared of anyone who likes this movie. They may have inhaled too many paint disks as a child. It's so terrible I refuse to relive a plot. Oh yes, there wasn't one! This movie is a true definition of what Hollywood creates for people who don't want to think of a theater. Earn the bad guys? Do the good guys earn? Who cares!
