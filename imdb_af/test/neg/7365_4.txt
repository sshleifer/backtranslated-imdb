Many can be forgiven in times when we ask to recall important historical events and love them enough to keep the story. BATTLE OF THE BRAVE tackles the 18th-century struggle for the control of Quebec (a whole Canada) between the British and the French with sidelines of the new America. This has been the pursuit of an exciting epic fascination, but unfortunately in the hands of writer Pierre Billon (whose writing deserves the Razzie award for the worst of the season) and the scattered, uncanny and confusing direction of Jean Beaudin this movie is a dud - a two-and-a-quarter boring debris of a movie. <br /> <br /> Even a good actors role play - Noemie Godin-Vigneau and Marie-Loup Carignan with David La Haye as François le Gardeur. Bianca Gervais as Acoona, the venerable Gerard Depardieu as Le Curé Thomas Blondeau, and like Irène Jacob, Vincent Perez (ridiculous in periodicals), Tim Roth as William Pitt, Colm Meaney as Benjamin Franklin and Jason Isaacs as General James Wolfe. - does not help. Veteran actors like this have to be curled at the rough lines written for their characters! Cover the whole mess in a juicy musical score by Patrick Doyle and the result is a long film to be avoided. Sad to say such bad things about an expensive project, but be warned .... Grady Harp
