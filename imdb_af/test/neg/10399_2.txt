I was surprised to discover Michael Moore whether Bill Maher was not involved in this "movie". An American left-hand car wash list to grind, with a clear slump of democrats in hell. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx did not appear in hell, but Ronald Reagan is in the same room with Hitler? Maybe we should wait for these California spin doctors to butcher Paradiso for them to show all their pet ideological political figures. <br /> <br /> Cheap shots at religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists, Fox News, even SUVs. All the radical left-wing points were over-covered - while remarkably leaving the references to the "other side of the path" violation - had not been a deliberate attempt. The simple exception I noticed is that JFK should have sex with Marilyn Monroe for eternity in the hour and a half: The token inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt to appear non-partisan.
