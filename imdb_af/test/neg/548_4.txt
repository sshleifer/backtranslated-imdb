Enchanted April was one of Harry Beaumont's last movies - he just directed a few to this one. He made the Maisie movies in the 1930s and 1940s. In the opening credits, it says: "From the novel by Elizabeth", and completely separate from the author's name ... rather strange, but since it was von Armin, they might not have wanted the German association at the time ... Sad to hear it was a flop when it was released, with fun names like Frank Morgan (the wizard) and Jessie Ralph, who played the toilet. Fields' refusal mother-in-law in "Bank Dick". Two gals in London (Ann Harding & Katharine Alexander) decide to rent a castle to host two of their friends, but things aren't as they planned. Reginald Owen plays the man with various personalities. Apart from a few funny moments, it moves fairly slowly. Ralph is the only bright spot here, as the remaining take-charge type, and the picture is pretty vague and out of focus for much of the movie. The view of Italy is all obvious. The only saving grace here is that the Turner Classic version is only 66 minutes long. Too bad they didn't give Frank Morgan a bigger role. It was made in 1992 by the BBC as a British film.
