I understood before I watched this movie that it would be a low budget gore movie. But even through the low standards, this film doesn't cut it. <br /> <br /> The problem is not so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had poor performance, writing, directing, audio, music and editing. I expected it all to be bad, and that is. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is that it hasn't even done a good job on the gut. Most of the 'action' takes place on the screen and all we see is the offspring, which looks very fake - even according to the low budget standards of the films. <br /> <br /> There is really no excuse that the gore is doing so poorly. Peter Jackson made the equally low budget 'Bad Taste' at about the same time and he somehow made much more convincing tears and gore than was shown in this movie. <br /> <br /> A failure at about every level, I can't recommend this movie to anyone. Make it clear. <br /> <br /> <br />
