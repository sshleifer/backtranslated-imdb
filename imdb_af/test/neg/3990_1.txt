The posters lied to me again. <br /> <br /> The marketing of this movie was deeply inconsistent with the content; An explosive? When I read the synopsis for this movie, I expected to see a village of grotesque, every man of them had bloodshot and blown up by alcohol, plucked by heroin needles and double bent with chronic masturbation; In such a "compassion" would come the cleansing, glittering Gabriel. Instead, the film was the opposite of what I had expected to expect. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes of the movie showed us that Middletown is a simple little place, full of poor people doing the best they can, or holding a little to meet the ends. to forget about the pain, or to see how cock (chicks, penis) do not leave the boredom. In other words, the townspeople were desperately ordinary. <br /> <br /> The only (deliberate?) grotesque in the play was Gabriel, the brain-held Presbyterian preacher played by Macfadyen, whose face was built to represent a permanent air of tangled anger. If I were kind, I would suggest that the Pisleyite rites of the preacher were a witty commentary designed to despise Gabriel and his faith. Unfortunately, Brian Kirk is so indifferent to a movie maker who you all despise in the movie, and let the audience eat through the eighty and twenty minutes of dark hackneyed tedium. My only postponement of this celluloid waste was a game of "guessing the accent" broken up with rounds of "spot the place." Are we surprised that Gaybo eventually steals his brother's child and suffocates his father? Of course not; He is a Bible-bashing preacher and therefore psychotic. All the residents are standing around looking shocking at the end of the movie, but I suspect they just realized what a turkey they gave their names. <br /> <br /> The Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission has a budget to spend, but there are better projects than this poor company. The only kind of thing I can say for this movie is that it has replaced the "Superman Returns" as the 2006 worst movie. one hell of a performance. <br /> <br /> v1: 20061114 v2: 20080107
