It's sad that some are worth watching this movie. I'm Russian, and I'm disgusting. There is nothing in this film that deserves praise, except cinematography. However, I am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. I think this movie is poorly designed and targeted. There is nothing more annoying and even scary than shameless art speculation (if you can call this garbage art). Balabanov wanted to shock the viewers through pervasive anger, and he managed to create a hopelessly dark film. But the biggest shock is Balabanov's primitive legal services. I will never recommend any of my friends to see it. Great disappointment!
