I read each of Baroness Orczy's Scarlet Pimpernel books. By counting this one, I saw 3 pimpernel movies. One with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews, I chose a lot about this. It goes for violence and action, which sometimes completely violates the book's spirit. I do not expect movies to live directly on plots. I have risen that ideal for a long time, but if an excellent movie of a book has already been made, you should not recycle it with a TV movie that includes excellent actors and fun costumes. but scarcely decent writing. Stick to the 80's version .... Rahne
