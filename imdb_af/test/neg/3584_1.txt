Awful! Awful! Awful! Death, unimaginable, predictable - and with all the usual suspects. Exactly the kind of movie that the Irish movie industry shouldn't make. And with the added bonus of a treacle-coated ending. A sickly example of how talent and originality is passed in favor of an almost aggressive mediocrity. Yes, the children are sweet. Yes - it almost seems to be done professionally. But it is film production by numbers, a direct smash and grabs what the director obviously thinks "success" is a film that despises and despises the audience. It is quite surprising that the job title will cost Â£ 3m in this litter. But then they paid Love Actually. Don't waste your money.
