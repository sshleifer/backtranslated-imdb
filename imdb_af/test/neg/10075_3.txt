I've been looking forward to this movie since Lost World came out. It didn't bother me that Lost World wasn't as intellectual as the original, and here I was just hoping for a good movie. It was all about "Dinosaurs eat people." However, it was disappointing, even at that level. <br /> <br /> At first, there were not enough people to eat, and while I kept it a secret, how many people were eating, it wasn't enough. Also, while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community, there were not nearly 'enough' dinosaurs. And many dinosaurs, like the spikey-back-and-have-a-club-on-the-tail osaurus, just made it comos and didn't do much to think how cool they were. <br /> <br /> START SPOILERS Then there were the Pterodactyls. The figures I read have put their body weight about 15 pounds while the film looks closer to 300. Worse, they didn't find anyone or even looted on the rocks by dropping them off high. There was also no end to the movie, and it was just sudden credits. (END SPOILERS) I'm still wondering if the issue I saw was missing 40 minutes of film. <br /> <br /> My only conclusion is that they've learned the Pterodactyls to hold and get their long bills in your pockets. your $ 7. Rent the Carnosaur series; at least you will not be disappointed.
