Aliens with candy overwork in all the wrong context, the situations are just not funny with the cheesy voices and the bad low forehead comedy timing. The clear attempt at dry / black / dark humor is obvious and it fails on all elements of a good joke. <br /> <br /> With a high cringe factor and low lag ratio, I was shocked. This show passed the first season. I personally like Scrubs, The Office, 30 Rock, Trailer Park Boys, Pulling, Peep Show, Simpsons, Family Guy and I know what your thoughts, these shows are not strange, so some other good performances I've seen is Jam, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, The Book Group, Asylum and Snuff Box which is originally with dry / black / dark humor / satire and is all at least 5/10. <br /> <br /> Garth Marenghi's Darkplace is especially cheap, over-worn and strange, but the context is thought through and working to make it really there and entertain as well.
