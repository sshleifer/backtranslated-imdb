* Spoilers in this <br /> <br /> Where do I start with how stupid this movie was? 'Mole-size people, under the garden who attack residents of a large house' !!! When I first sat down to watch this movie, I was not aware that the protagonists where not poltergeist, etc., but 10-inch tall goblins that look powerful, easy to kick and go. I continued to watch it because I would like to see movies to the end, even horrible. this movie was terrible. My girlfriend, who went to bed within the first ten minutes, except that it was a good tool to sleep, thought it was hilarious that I had this plague. <br /> <br /> Small goblins, even in large numbers (the idea is stupid, I know) is about as scary and threatening as flat cola. They just managed to "kill" one man and kill a cat before being blown up, The End. I said it sucks right?
