Let me say this about Edward D. Wood Jr. He had a passion for his work that I wish more people had. If we all had the optimism and prospective hope of Ed Wood, the world would probably be a much better place. To disclose Ed Wood's story and see the most wonderful biopic "Ed Wood" (1994), I admire his boldness and his pursuit of the work he loved; I still admire his never-ending attitude. He had a love to say I wish more people in contemporary Hollywood. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't make his movies more fun to watch. And Glen of Glenda, his first and most confessional film, is probably his worst. <br /> <br /> "Glen of Glenda" is a deadly cult film about a cross-dress named Glen (played by director / writer Ed Wood himself), despite his love for his fiancee Barbara (Dolores Fuller) can't overcome his desire for transvestitism, dressing in women's clothes and wig and thus becoming ... Glenda! Glen / Glenda's story is told by a doctor and he is also spoken and looked at for a mysterious character called "The Scientist" played by veteran horror star Bela Lugosi. Oh, and there's also a sub-story about an Alan / Anne character who becomes a transsexual based on the Christine Jorgenson story, on which this movie was originally titled "I Changed My Sex!" was previously based. <br /> <br /> Did I drop your jaw? Well, as much as I want to warn you of this picture, if you have never seen it before, I would never tell a lie about a movie and there is not one word of lies in the plot synopsis I don't give you did not give. Every thing in this is true. It's a movie about cross-dressers and transsexuals, a topic that doesn't look very attractive is to get started and isn't done in a very attractive way. I'm sure with a good script, and a good director (it doesn't) that "Glen of Glenda," despite the subject, could have been a very moving picture. This is a confident movie on Wood's part, as he was a real life and on-screen transvestite. But again, it doesn't make a good movie ... or a lookable one for that matter. "Glen of Glenda" is a dumped, disorganized mess of a movie sinking into new trenches in the realm of a bad theater. It makes no sense if his infamous stupid mockery where Bela Lugosi shouts "Pull the rope!" about inexplicable footage of bumping bison. The majority of the movie is told in a monotonous voice, reminding me of some very bad short insightful movies I've seen before. It's like one of those very bad short films expanded to a seventy-minute feature and twice as dull. We have been sitting there for centuries waiting for the plot that never comes. There is no real effort to build even energy with the camera locked in one position for very bitter minutes and long moments where nothing happens. The only moments worth anybody's time are those of Bela Lugosi who are able to bring some light into these dark trenches. I think Lugosi is supposed to be like the deity of the movie, but personally I can't care less about who or what he is supposed to be. I'll tell you what he was: a gifted actor who stops making waste. But he and Wood were very good friends and wanted to work with each other, as well for him. <br /> <br /> I'll always be Edward D. Wood Jr. admire his passion for the theater, but I will never admire his movies as long as I live. A film critic once called Ed Wood's "innocent fun" movie, but I think it's even questionable. Innocent? Yes. Fun? No, sir. And if "Citizen Kane" is the Mount Everest of the movie world, then "Glen of Glenda" is probably the Mariana Trench.
