Ha ha! First, if you've never seen a "Dimension Film", you'll have a great surprise! Known mainly for SUPER LOW BUDGET Horror / Slasher movies, "Beowulf" was no exception. <br /> <br /> However, this video was more in the style of ultra-cheesy. I missed the K-R-A-F label on the side. <br /> <br /> Consider the Anachronisms! <br /> <br /> We have: candles, weapons, swords .... <br /> <br /> However, we have seen: telescopes, soled shoes, cigarette lighters, loudspeakers, electricity, body bags, aluminum foil cans , and spoons / forks. <br /> <br /> Not bad for something that happens in the 8th century! <br /> <br /> It's not a horror movie, it's a horrible movie. It's a lot of laughter. It's really a comedy that looks like a horror movie! I can't stop laughing! <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert ("The Highlander Series") really should have a tumult in his career working for Dimension Movies. <br /> <br /> I've already learned my lesson. I now look at the movie studios on the videos, much closer. <br /> <br /> NO RULES FROM FIVE. If you still want a good laugh, it's hard to succeed on this piece of work! <br /> <br /> This move had some splits in spots. I especially loved the blonde bimbette! <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
