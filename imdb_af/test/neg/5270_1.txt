After the general, a movie that made the life of Dublin gangster romantic the romantic life of the Dublin gangster, the general made such heroic relationships that made the average Dublin person sick. Kevin and his attempt to portray Mr. Lynch or Martin Cahill, also the general, so bad that this crime drama is a comedy for native Dub, and a tragedy for the Kevin Spacey fan. In short, the movie is worth it. No, if you're not bad with hilarious 'proper Irish accents, be sure to'. The story is cut off from the commercially successful 'The General' which, despite the glorification of a well-known Dublin animal in Martin Cahill, is worth a household scale, because it shows real working class Dublin and internationally because he casts true Irish play and killer, including John Voight. All in all, 'Ordinary Regent Criminals' is nothing but a decent movie. Avoid.
