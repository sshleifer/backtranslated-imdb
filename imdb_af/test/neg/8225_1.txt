Garden states should be considered one of the most confronted and pretentious films of all time. The plot is a simple one, with a young man returning to his mother's death and discovering love. But really, the plot is not important. What is important to Zach Braff - author, director and star? is that he can hang all the necessary outfits from an 'indie' or 'arty' movie from the plot. So we are presented with endless cute and peculiar characters and scenes that do not exist for plot or character development, but just to give some artistic credibility to the film (Ã  la West Anderson - or Braff Hope). Unfortunately, Braff didn't just cleave much on IMDb, but also critics who really had to know better. <br /> <br /> Of course, Braff's free use of the peculiar alone doesn't make Garden State a. bad movies. What really makes Garden State a stinker is Braff's script. He simply does not have the writing skills to perform this film, and the dialogue and characterization is abysmal. Braff often has to resort to refuge and fraud and symbolism to achieve what he cannot achieve through writing. For example, the numbness of the Braff character is shown to us by his indifference to a threatening plane crash (it cannot be incorporated into the plot, and so it must be done in a dream!), Later he is shown back to to fight against his circumstances by screaming in a bottomless abyss (life = a bottomless abyss, very smart Mr. Braff). These two scenes should be among the most ridiculous and confronted ever seen on a theater screen. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the play is sensible despite the lack of material that the cast can be worked on (through which I mean a manuscript), and I admire Natalie Portman for her efforts as the love interest - a character so badly written and indescribable that she is a little more than a senseless doll that Braff forms in his fantasy wife. <br /> <br /> It apparently took Braff 3 years to write the writing for Garden State (3 years to write such a script - he's really inactive!). Hopefully it will be time before he makes another movie.
