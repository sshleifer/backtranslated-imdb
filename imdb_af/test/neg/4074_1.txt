This film was embarrassing in his clich√©s, poor acting and generally low production values. It starts badly with the long-haired 3-star general who calls the hero, masters, "great", if of course he wears the silver oak leaf of lieutenant colonel. But what was the greatest need was the crew of soldiers on the Neptune Atoll. How out of touch with any kind of reality can you get? They were all experts to fly a 747 and the scenes of the soldiers digging the trench were out of comics. WARNING: THIS MOVIE IS DANGEROUS FOR YOUR INTELLECTUAL HEALTH! Look at your own peril!
