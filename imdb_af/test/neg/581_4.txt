"Maybe there are spoilers" Unfortunately, Lou Costellos' last film made a distinction from something better than Abbott & Costello's latest movie "Dance With Me Henry". This movie is not terribly horrible, it is an amusing career blunder. Dorothy Provine is nice to look at and makes the movie somewhat portable. You can't blame Lou Costello for this because a large studio has released it which means someone should give it the "green" light. In my opinion, Lou Costello has lost its own problems a few years earlier and the unjustified attacks by the IRS. If you watch the last 3-4 Abbott & Costello movies, you can see that the magic is gone. Check out "Dance With Me Henry" now it's a painful movie to watch.
