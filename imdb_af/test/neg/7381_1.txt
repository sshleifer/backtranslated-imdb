I rented this movie because the DVD cover seems to be a ridiculous college comedy like wilder or animal house. I took it to my girlfriend's house to watch for movie night. We finally stopped it for 15 minutes and watched Koperberg. I don't know if any of you have seen Copper Mountain, but it's not nice either. However, I have to say that the Alan Thick Jim Carrey Duo made it a more enjoyable watch. <br /> <br /> Later, I finished Puddle Cruiser. This movie was slow and the humor was forced. This movie reminded me of some stinkers I saw in some of my previous production classes in college. I was over the shoulder. "Was it the movie that Broken Lizard could make Super Troops?" Also how can this movie suck so badly? Supertroopers were good and Club Dread was decent. Don't see this movie!
