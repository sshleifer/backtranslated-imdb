Not just as good as the "Guinea Pig" movie is inspired by ("Flowers of Meat and Blood" or "Devil's Experiment") and does not convey true philosophy, this video feature, which is barely characteristic, adds hardcore sex at (with mosaic censoring) to his inspiration. The special make-up effects, which include gastric fragmentation and disembowelment, are fairly good if overshadowed. The amateur feeling of production is a distraction. Everything looks cheap and lazy. The lighting is loud and the sound and editing are sloppy. The simple story involves a porn actress who eventually comes out in a real sniff movie. Only when she gets tired of being abused will the actual abuse begin. In the film's hero scene, an actor cuts open the woman's stomach in a graphic close-up, fills in her member, and continues to do his thing. I didn't shock "Psycho - The Snuff Reels". On the contrary, I found it to be a desperate attempt by amateurs to have a "Guinea Pig" and his bloody ilk. Interestingly, it is distributed by Aroma, a leading fetish producer.
