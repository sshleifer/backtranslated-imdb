I'm a big fan of sleaze and horror movies, if you bring it along, it's my lovely place: horrible sluggish. But you're not going to get it in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are definitely sleaze, in the form of girls being kidnapped and tortured, tied to different things. However, the sleaze is not very sloppy. It did not register very high on my slow meter, mainly because none of the girls was at all attractive, nor did they try to act as if they were even threatened. They seem to think more about what was for lunch, or maybe when they could get a bit cracked. <br /> <br /> Forget about the effects, they were in the extreme lamb. The lameness was contributed to the bad acting; Bonds are harder to believe when even the actors and actresses don't buy into it. <br /> <br /> Camera photography was pretty bad, they could have rented some porn movies and did better. In fact, this can make the sleazy factor enough to make it enjoyable. As it is, there are many dark shots where you can't see very clearly, and what you can see doesn't look too good. <br /> <br /> The horror factor is zero. Zero. Zero. Nada. Zip. Nil. I saw children's movies that were more scary. There is no camp here either. It's just a movie that tries to be shockingly sleepy, but doesn't even come close.
