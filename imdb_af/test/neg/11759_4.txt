This movie really starts. We know Roberts sent an Atlanta hotshot to Australia to solve Coke's marketing problems. We also know that he is an eccentric genius. Roberts' fine play convinces us of this fairly quickly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the plot is so dirty that what characterization has achieved is denied by voids, inconsistencies, and straight boring movie series. <br /> <br /> Usually I'm a sucker for fat and distant plots. Examples I like include: "Dark Star", "O.C. & Stiggs," and "Popeye." Along with the fact that I have to admit that this movie was well done, it even surprised me that I can't recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The full feature of this movie is about halfway through the movie. All comedy is lost immediately and the movie gets dark. Then the movie goes along. The film's attempt to make the comedy roll again is not successful. More surprises await the viewer and they are darker. <br /> <br /> To be sure, blending drama with comedy can be a formula for success. But with this movie the result is about as successful as "new coke."
