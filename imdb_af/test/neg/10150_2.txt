So someday I was in the video store looking for a movie. I came about this and hired it because it was a movie I haven't seen or heard yet. <br /> <br /> Now I like slasfilms in general, but it's just tired, not even good to laugh. Apart from being ultra ultra inexpensive and containing all classroom snaps and having horrible acting, I have the most incompetent and dishonest direction I've ever experienced. Sometimes the aforementioned features may be present in a movie, and some enjoyment may still be, but not here. Painful example of homemade horror.
