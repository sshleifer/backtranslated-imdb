The final entry in the On The Buses trilogy views the usual wasters dealing with their business in Wales. I am sure the franchise could have continued, but Harold Pinter complained that the screens had made him worse and therefore no longer made it. <br /> <br /> It's actually less than two minutes before we get our first pop up sexism. A woman walking for the bus finds her breasts out of her dress for no reason whatsoever. Yet at least it makes Stan (Reg Varney) laugh - but then what does that mean? He and Jack (Bob Grant) spend the whole movie restless with little or no provocation. You get the impression that they are watering themselves to look dry. <br /> <br /> As before, the only funny element is the really amusing Stephen Lewis, hilarious as Blakey. However, he is on his own, with a cheesy, dated script that even wastes leading talent such as Wilfrid Brambell and Henry McGee. Yet, it seems that Lewis just understands how to stop the shaky material, and even the weakest lines laugh. Describe how her daughter fell in a river, Stan's mum complains "I hope it's not polluted." "Well, it will be now." Blakey quips. <br /> <br /> The plot - if there is one - sees Stan after a young girl, but is constantly being neglected by her dominant mother. It is a recipe for its division. I'm sure you'll agree, and whether it's on a stormy boat or swim, Stan and Mavis's exploitation always produces the same result ... boring boredom. Later conquests include Maria, an Italian stereotype, and an associate co-worker. Even Stan's mother gets a one-night stand, reminding Stan to remind her to "put on your chores." <br /> <br /> When one of the comic "highlights" is Arthur Mullard is overheating olives trying to detect a light link in the dark ("I can't find it") and she thinks Talk about sex, then see why this work reaches the upper levels of literary sophistication. In fact, why it didn't get in the BFI's Top 100 movies is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Other rib-tickling shenanigans include Olive (Anna Karen) who breaks her glasses. I don't know what is more surprising, the lame predictability of the setup, or the underdeveloped installment. The short-sighted Olive follows a man in a kilt in the men and thinks he is a woman in a skirt. The next shot saw her blowing out by Blakey and pointing to the ladies. And that's it. Then she ends up in another man's bed and is ordered by his wife. And ... no, that's all there is in that scene as well. <br /> <br /> When watching Holiday on the Buses on British television, there was a breakdown in the transfer. It actually came as blessed relief.
