OK end of the story - all death was a joke on the main character and no one is actually dead. Yes, I know Cry Wolf did it and did it well, but it's not "Cry Wolf", it's "Scream Crap"! Although the "characters" do not die, we see that they are being killed (and other ways in which they are killed) although this "murder" does not happen as anyone can see them. Mr. Director, if you are going to show that people are being killed, someone should see it, if they are off the camera and the character is killed, it is alone, it does not work - and to the end I had some scenes but your end has destroyed the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible (especially the child at the beginning who really thinks he has walked his friends to believe that they played with his dead grandmothers brain) if half were baked (though you half baked, you can keep the movie). The only reason I gave this movie is 3 because they actually made something. b) They released it. c) They shot on film. Yes, you read. Right, they messed up at least $ 5,000 on movie stock for this crap. Sad, if they shot DV, got their cash for a better role and another writer to go through the writing and make it good. <br /> <br /> I admire the fact that the director made something (as most do not), but HATWE the fact that he is coming to IMDFB talks about how "original" the movie is. <br /> <br /> Avoid the movie if it means buying it to watch, if a friend has it It might be a funny movie to borrow.
