Wave to the wave of aimless nausea - this film wants and initially promises to be strange and original, but is actually obvious, solipsistic and marked in clich√©-driven dialogue that builds to the end of a crecendo of horror and cheese. Throughout the film, we presumably meet with the wall characters, which are actually very boring, and just don't quite work out and which, through the horrific screenplay like men in armor suits, drives jeeps by homes and spraying preppy existential obviousness, accompanied by Coldplay's Whinings. The movie occasionally has funny episodes, often not harder than a dog playing with its genitals, which happened twice (an index of the slapstick, the rudimentary humor of the film in general), but finally the film falls into an 'infinite abyss' of the complete detritus and the director's ego-synthetic ramblings that let me protrude my eyes. Watch this movie at your own risk.
