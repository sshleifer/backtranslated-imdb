On my constant quest to find the worst movie of all time, my friends and I stumbled upon this jewel. It's hilarious through and through, especially if you don't know (like us) it's a semi-sequel to another horror series. <br /> <br /> I won't go into the plot except to mention that everyone is complaining about the terrible snowstorm coming there (it was similar to the characters just shouting a "FORESHADOWING!" at the camera and their arms blow), and in a strange twist of fate the snowstorm ever happens. Budget problems, I think. <br /> <br /> Add it to a magical front door that is open or closed, depending on what frightening the director wants to create and cut off the electricity until the gym teacher decides to shower a lot of soap. I will admit it; I had difficulty breathing at points. <br /> <br /> The only real decent part of this movie, as it turned out, was from the original Slumber Party Massacre movie. It's so much nicer when I know it. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * The end, where it is revealed that the gunman did this because her drunken friends fell on her and made up a female friend and then the friend driving in a train or Something is probably the funniest psycho-killer origin ever, enhanced by the fantastic use of fading and stockpiles. I am glad that all the shooters' friends have completely forgotten the incident until a look back was needed. <br /> <br /> Walk, don't walk, pick it up, and see grace. Of course, the continuity editor must get an award for all these things, if they just aren't caught up in that terrible snowstorm ...
