Every movie made by Quentin Tarantino has become increasingly worse. I would like to believe that most people agree with the statement, but as 'Inglourious (sic) Basterds (sic)' has an 8.5 / 10 out of more than 100,000 ratings, it doesn't look like the general movie has. Even his best work, Reservoir Dogs, was not a "masterpiece". The problem is claiming that you love Tarantino's work, has become trendy. Once that happens, you get bootloads of people ready to jump on a different train ramp. They will ignore terribly acting, completely self-sufficient writing, just so that they can be part of the exclusive club called "everyone." This movie is so terrible that I swear it should be a kind of twisted joke by Tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him. As another reviewer has said, "Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy who fell in love with other movies. This one is from a man in love with his own writing." I couldn't agree anymore. This movie is nothing more than self-sufficient and in-joke riddled writing accompanied by the acting ability right out of high school. But, thanks to the general movie going public, it's sure it will still fall as one of the best movies ever made. Bravo, Tarantino. You've drawn one of the best practical jokes of all time.
