Generally speaking, political messages are made on television, so if you are a big fan of environmental correctness, look at your heart's content. Most people go to the movies to be entertained, not sell some poppy cock political nonsense. The hook here is the big name. Unfortunately, the sum of the performances equals a whole movie that has gone nowhere. The two best performances, Chris Cooper and Richard Dreyfus, have minimal screen time. In short, "Silver City" should be avoided as entertainment. It is nothing more than a non-documentary, winding political exposure to illegal immigration, pollution and any other causes that do not belong anywhere on the small screen. - NOTE
