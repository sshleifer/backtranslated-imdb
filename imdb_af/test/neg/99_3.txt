Four things inspired me about this movie. First of all, it is Carly Pope (of "Popular" fame), who is always a pleasure to watch. Secdonly, it features brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen. Thirdly, it is filmed in conjunction with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourth, a friend recommended it to me. However, I was totally disappointed. The whole storyline is absurd and complicated, with very little resolution. Pop's acting is good, but Owen is unfortunately unused. The other actors and actresses are all fine, but I'm not familiar with them all. Apart from the beautiful puzzles that are broadcast throughout the film (and Pope and Owen), this movie is not very good. So the moral of the story is ... don't look unless you really want it.
