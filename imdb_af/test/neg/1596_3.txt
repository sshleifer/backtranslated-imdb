Someone told me that Pink Flamingos was in a word "insane". Now I doubt if this man had ever seen it, because that is not the way I would sum it up in one word. Disgusting, absurd, um, more disgusting ... will do it. Every time you think it can no longer get dirty, it means. One of my special favorites was when Divine had her birthday party and when police got it, they were slaughtered and eaten by the guests. I admit it is one of those movies where it's so grotesque, you just can't look away, but it's not a creative artwork at all. It's a beautiful shock value. <br /> <br /> On the front it makes the Jackass guys like a lot of pussies.
