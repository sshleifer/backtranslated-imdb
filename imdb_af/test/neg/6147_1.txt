Scarier than any horror movie ever made because you're in control of this festival, making it more scarce than watching other people doing it on the big screen or on your television screen. This game has two CDs that make the game much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> Each CD has a different character with a complete different story line that makes the game much more fun. I recommend buying this game and the first game too (not as good as this game, but still fun) <br /> <br /> **** <br /> <br />
