If you like the early 60's of The Time Machine, don't waste your time; As with last year's "The Planet of the Apes", it was "reimaginated" and not for the better. And as with the "Planet ...", his chief actor is badly mistaken and led; Guy Pearce, a huge actor of great variety, is wrong for this role and gives a one-note show that does not produce any sympathy. He is so brave and serious and lacks in the awe of the (presumably) incredible things he sees you do not believe for a moment he is experiencing it. Even worse, whose idea was it to look like David Spade's love child and Calista Flockhart? A beautiful actor, here he is sickly guy, who believes it or not, a great distraction. Honestly, the man looks seriously ill and is cruelly photographed. He shares absolutely NO chemistry with anyone on the screen, a direct result of a performance that is not synchronized with anyone else. Unfortunately, even with a decent front man, this movie is not a chance, as it is a deadly burden of both a totally improper director. The whole scene goes nowhere and is poorly understood. And a script that is completely inferior, distributed and sometimes inconsistent. - Not for a moment, give yourself to anyone in this movie, for the only fact that there is no sign of character development! In the original you got to know the Eloi, so you felt for them, and they felt their fear of the Morelocks; Here, as the movie stresses a few times, they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly. Unless you are a member of PETA, sheep are scarce, the stuff of entertainment! <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba does her best in her movie debut, but like everyone else in this mess, especially Jeremy Irons (if he is the leader of the Morelocks (which looks like "The Mama Returns" ], why does HE look like Edgar Winter's lost brother?) Wasted completely. Also, wastage was the money spent on the endless 'special' effects, spending $ 70 million on the film, uniformly slim, clear and unconvincing, and then there is the appearance of the film: poorly photographed, his artistic direction and set is right there and his costumes are typical in design, there is no original idea or idea expressed behind or on the screen Most of all, it's not even fun! (The filmmakers use the now-ubiquitous Orlando Jones as "comic relief", but as usual, Jones is annoying and just how she survives electric-driven character in a world that seems to have electricity ? <br /> <br /> Already with Even if it is an empty, lifeless, boring, sterile and confused thing: haven't they repeated the "planet of the monkeys"? (At least it has the fortune of some strong performances!) <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! * The final insult (above a frightening, non-comfortable, ending)? Not only do they have the changing clothes shops, they even make the time machine itself an anachronistic, diligent glass-n-chrome drill! (If "The Sopranos" had a time machine, THIS is exactly what it looks like.) Pathetic ...
