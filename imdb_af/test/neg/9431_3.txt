"Shadows and Fog" is certainly one of Woody Allen's worst films, with "September" and "Hollywood Ending" (though nothing Allen did, is equal to the horror of "Anything Else"). <br /> <br /> "Shadows and Fog" is Allen's tribute to the German expressionist style of cinema, all sharp and stylized light and shade and ... you guess it ... much wrong. But you can say that Allen was caught in the technique and the parody and forgot to make a movie anyone would care for. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, he made men and women the same year. A total was for him. <br /> <br /> Degree: D
