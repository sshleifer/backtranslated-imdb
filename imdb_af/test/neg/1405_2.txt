=========== BIG SPOIL ================================= This is a horrible movie with no characters. So many clicks and senseless scenes. It needs a good editor, but then there may not be a movie left. Please save two hours. The only decent and unpredictable scene in the movie was when the younger brother refused to stop his brother killing himself. The description reads "moments of dark comedy". Maybe I missed it when I shone. The terrible characters start right with the funeral. The funerals laughed and complained about the food at the funeral of a very young man who committed suicide? Then the dad digs at the only boy who's gone? Right at the funeral? How is it that the neighbor neighbor whose husband cheated on her with Sigourney Weaver's character is the bad guy to tell the man? The father does not even know that his son can play the piano, although everyone else seems to know he is a great pianist. The film tries to chase every dramatic clich√© into one movie: a father's exaggerated athletic son to succeed, dysfunctional family that loses a chosen son for suicide, the boy has been lost and alone, drugs, marriage, child pregnant affected, but lifted like man's son, incest, homosexual tendencies, bulls, possible terminal illness, etc., etc. DO NOT REMOVE YOUR 2 HOURS.
