I can't remember a more trivial, sensible and shallow movie, in other words, a real chick spot of the worst kind. How can anyone see this movie and recommend it to others? Just if they don't like to admit, they made a mistake. It seems to be the worst of female aspirations. No real content for it all happy and level. Yes, it will please the masses. Well, not this member of the masses. What a trivial cargo drive. I wanted to leave the theater within 5 minutes from the start. And to think I paid Â£ 7 to see it! However, I think this represents the dumbing down of the theater like that of most media. So I like a bit of reality in my musicals, call me sad or what?
