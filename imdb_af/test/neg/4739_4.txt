I loved the blood and gore. The kind of violence is what Alien and Predator movies are that no one is spared. It really answers the question of how it would be if strangers were on earth. The answer is simple. We're screwed. The effects were beautiful. Anyway, there are real problems with it. <br /> <br /> 1) The acting was terribly on the side of the human characters witch, I almost slept because it was so dry and boring from the movie and was very annoying. The authors could have done SOOOOOOO much better. The good part was the Alien and Predator actions I thought were done very well. <br /> <br /> 2) The size of the Predator ship was much smaller than it was in the first AvP movie. I scratched my head <br /> <br /> 3) Predators put on their mask while they were still in the ship. These upset people and I don't understand why. It's not a plothole as most people make it. So I tell you people calm down hell. This is not a big problem. If it will make you feel better, remember, they get bored of face scrubs so it can be a good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Predator makes its plasma watering can in the ship. I thought it was pretty stupid on the Predators section. But then I started thinking if it was a younger Predator who was panicking. <br /> <br /> 5) The hunter and his son arrived almost immediately at the scene of the accident after a few miles. At least they didn't carry us by running through the bush for 30 minutes. so be happy about it. <br /> <br /> 6) Why did just a Predator go? I thought it was strange. But then I thought it was because he thought it was just one Predalin he had, and not an outbreak. 7) Why did the predators not destroy the ship? Well, if people pay attention, one has done, but he is dead before he can fully activate it. <br /> <br /> 8) The unlimited blue melt goo. I thought it was pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> 9) Predator hides testimony with the goo, but pours a policeman. It was also stupid. <br /> <br /> 10) The Black Out. Well, come on people, an Alien and Pr challenged it at a power station. <br /> <br /> 11) Predaline is half the face hug / queen. It really rejected me. I'm an Alien and Pred fanatic. I know for a fact that Aliens don't! Just as they do not give birth like a human, they do as in Alien4! From all the comics, games, books and movies 1,2, and 3, CLEARLY shows their behavior. They need a queen to lay eggs, the eggs hatch in the facial, the facial's infection host. The parasite jumps out and kills the host and grows in a drone if it infects a Predaline with a Predator, and Runner with any kind of four-legged animal. And then, after years of years of living, they grew into a Preatorian (a mini-queen who doesn't lay eggs). I can get on and off, but I get used to it. But that scene alone ruined the movie for me. If the directors are smart, they will go back and change it by infecting a visor with the pregnant women. <br /> <br /> Any way you see this movie is just for the aliens and predators. . And when the scene comes up where the Predaline infects the pregnant women ... Make your eyes so that you shouldn't see that insult to the Alien and Pr universe.
