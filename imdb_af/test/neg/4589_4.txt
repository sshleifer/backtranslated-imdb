Another horrible movie about hockey. I never watched hockey and saw Hollywood version, but I hate the game. This movie doesn't make Canada look so good either. I can laugh at it and not take it too seriously. All this movie is terrible, with every thing you can put into an 80-year-old movie. Eventually it doesn't even look on TV. 10/04
