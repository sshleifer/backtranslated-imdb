It's Jonas Quastel's debut as director and to be honest, show it. He seemed to have thrown every kind of camera trick he had learned in film school to try and add a style to a poorly written writing that he helped write! Film has Lance Henriksen and a group of others looking for the northwest in the northwest for a plane that crashed that his daughter was on and also a special machine that his company built, which he also wants to pick up. The first 5 minutes of the movie is vague or shaky or out of focus! Quastel tries to capture the "Blair Witch" with these shots and they are very tiring. And there are also POV shots that are right from "Wolfen" and "Predator". These shots are from the point of view (POV) of the Sasquatch. The editing is sometimes scary as a scene moves in the middle. I heard that this movie was shot in about 12 days and I suppose, instead of "Starting Back to One", they just started again without holding and editing the scene. And the rest of the movie is fade-outs from one scene to another. They are so many scenes that have disappeared that I have lost. Now, the latest scene with Andrea Roth. It's not her. you can easily see her double body. And you know you're watching a bad B-movie if you decide to have a hot chick in the middle of the Pacific to go to the nearest hot spring and bathe! ******** SPOILER ALERT ******** <br /> <br /> And the Sasquatch itself isn't bad when you don't really see it and it's just a vague image behind some trees. or bushes, but if you finally see him, you're naturally disappointed. First of all, he's not that long. The actor playing Sasquatch is only hairy in some places on his body. It's a partial pack! And he's naked! I heard a make-up person died during the filming and maybe explain why the costume looks like a hurry. Some of the sound effects coming from the Sasquatch are nothing more than the well-known lion roar we've all heard in other movies. I must admit that Henriksen is not bad. Yes, he works with bad material, but he has one of those interesting faces that can actually improve some moments from the movie. People still say a good Bigfoot movie has never been made, but I disagree. I always said "The Creature From Black Lake" is a good movie and I strongly recommend it. I'm a sucker for a Sasquatch movie, but this one is just amateur.
