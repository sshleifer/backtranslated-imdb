If this movie had a point, I never discovered it. A very depressing film allegedly about the final evacuation of the residents living in a dam area on the Northfork River in Montana. The problem is that there is no real Northfork river in Montana. There are several northern forks, but they are branches of other rivers that are divided into northern and southern forks. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of the movie is a coffin that bends to the surface of the lake, but the scene is never bound. In the story and the viewer must speculate about its meaning. But much has been left to the viewer's speculation in the movie. Another example is when a team of dam employees responsible for evacuating residents at the headquarters arrives at the dam, another group goes away. Some remarks that are almost inaudible are made about these people who do not make sense and there is no follow-up in the film to explain it. <br /> <br /> The movie is slaughtered in various stories and the movie is back and forth between stories that are quite disturbing. And the stories are strange. In one of them, residents of one property refuse to be evacuated because they live in a house built like Noah's Ark. <br /> <br /> Another senseless story centers around a sick person who dies and somehow he shares his presence with a house full of ghosts and in an orphanage with a priest at the same time. If anyone can find out what the ghost story is about, the author must have explained it to them. <br /> <br /> The scenery was slim and the sun never shines. There are snow mountains in the far distance. I think the purpose was to set the mood. The duration is determined by the fact that the evacuators all drove Ford sedans from the 1946-48 era, although events in 1955 would occur. The acting was mediocre. When I saw the account for this movie, it said Darryl Hannah was in the picture. If she was, I didn't recognize her, but I suspect she was the ghost lady.
