Totally brain-dead action in the Philippines. It belongs to Filipino movies that are trying to overtake themselves as American films on the international market. After a rather dull start, the movie starts and never disappoints. It's actually a rip-off of the worst movies Chuck Norris ever made. An American prisoner in Vietnam is brainwashed by the Soviets, who implant a microchip into his brain, so he is programmed to kill the pope, then the US president. One of his old friends (played by B-filmmaker Max Thayer) is sent to stop him. Totally ridiculous action scenes, indifferent acting (Nick Nicholson's performance as the evil Soviet commander is a must-see!) And undeniable plot make for one of the baldest action photos ever donated in the general public.
