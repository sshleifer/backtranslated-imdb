First, it is NOT an adaptation of a Stephen King book, short story, novella or anything else. Van EW's website, and their review on the show when it first broadcast, "... he never writes to his audience, and he never despises contempt for his subjects. His first original work for television, Stephen King 's Golden Years'' (CBS, July 16, 9-11 pm), is no exception. "<br /> <br /> The series was apparently (as others mentioned) a continuous series, and so we never seen The end of the stone hanger left us. But it has never been made clear to the viewers who left it all. <br /> <br /> When the series came out on the videotape, it considered itself a "never before"! "It must have said," the end should never be seen! "<br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> The only end was the only important part for the video has been changed (although parts of the whole have been left out), and it has been changed that has destroyed the story, for example, rather than our two fearless FBI agents who realize they are now bad guys and on the run of evil Jude Anderson or The Shop (as originally aired), Jude simply goes to them, and they shoot him, scared, dead, and no real emotion to speak of the scene, it's on the bit with Harlan and his wife while the original end left us with a spectacular rock hanger, they simply come out of the cock-a-doodle car. <br /> <br /> *** End Spoiler *** <br /> < br /> It was a sad ending to a fairly well-made mini-series, and not making the video quite worthwhile to buy or even rent, yours to save you money your time.
