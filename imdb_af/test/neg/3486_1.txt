This movie has the language, style and attitude ... plus great rowing from Occy (a world champion) and big Jerry Lopez. John Philbin as Turtle has pidgin surfing, and the surfing screens are still the best ever. A true classic that can be seen many times. Nia Peeples is a babe, and Laird Hamilton shows the early things that made him the world's number one extreme surfer.
