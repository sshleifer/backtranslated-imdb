Dear Readers, <br /> <br /> In my studies of movies, I found that when Michael Bay made a movie, people panic and hate it, but they'll still see it and make it $ 100 million somewhere. Why? Because Michael Bay is one of the top five directors of all time. Standing alongside Ridley Scott, Spielberg, Kubrick and Miyazaki, Michael Bay has ratified himself as Hollywood's best action / adventure director. This point is proven with his most breaded film, Armageddon. <br /> <br /> An asteroid, the size of Texas, is making the planet and the only way NASA can think of it is to land a team of men. the asteroid drills to its core, leaving a nuclear war inside and blowing up the asteroid. Only one person is sufficient enough to do this: Bruce Willis. Willis portrays Harry Stamper, a grizzled hardened oil drill that tries to keep his family together. Not helping, his daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler), has a relationship with his best drill, AJ (Ben Affleck). Forwarded by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), head of NASA, Stamper and his team of Roughneck drills practice to become astronauts and save the world. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is a two-film. First, there are the funny parts where we meet the gang, and wackiness is abundant. Then they come into space and all the comedy is sucked out of the window and is replaced by special special effects, cool music and great serious acting. Murphy's law becomes insane in the second part, which means that anything that can go wrong is indeed going wrong, increasing the tension of the film to outstanding levels. <br /> <br /> With a cool role and crew (Michael Bay as director, Jerry Bruckheimer and Gale Anne Hurd as Producers, and JJ Abrams as one of the screenwriters.), tons of special effects, good humor, great music , and an intro by Mr. Ben-Hur himself, Charlton Heston, Armageddon stolen great time. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector, Matt Macleod <br /> <br /> Older Warnings: This is not a movie for children. The F-bomb is used several times and many other swear words are also used, plus there is a strip-bar scene and the extremely intense second part can be too difficult for a child to handle.
