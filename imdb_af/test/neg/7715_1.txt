I worked in a video store. I saw this title in the horror section and took it one night as a free rental home. <br /> <br /> This movie was really horrible, there is not a redeeming quality about it, because it actually takes a respected subgenre of movie and is just about destroying it. If the first movie wasn't low enough, this movie really takes the cookie, mostly indoors and at night. Therefore avoid the scenic cost setting of the first movie. In the first 5 minutes of this film a college lecturer walks comically over an attractive student. Rather than being killed, the lecturer apologizes half and the girl calls it despite being thrown over the hood (he got up as he approached her) that there was no need to worry. Then he touches her with a crow and kills her! If it is not strange enough, he wants to do an experiment on her, bring her back from death .... and so feel the need to remove her clothes to do so. <br /> <br /> Soft core female nudity (and hairlessness) is completely through the film and is frankly the only real thing to keep the average male viewer interest ... like the swim scene in the first movie ... but even said that film goes from bad to worse with its bad character acting, crazy dialogue and absurd plot turns .... why suggest a central character that survived 29 days of summer attack to kill them only within 10 minutes. It's just a very bad movie
