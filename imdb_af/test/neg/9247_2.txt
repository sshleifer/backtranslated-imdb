I can only name a few movies I saw that were bad. This movie has a lot of everything: the dialogue is grainy and clich√©, "the play is mostly poor, with a few exceptions, the cinematography is nothing to cheer and the plot is stupid." A woman's wife stole a suburban family because her daughter didn't make the soccer team). It's so bad, it's funny to watch. If you can catch it at a lifetime, I would highly recommend it as a comedy. As if it's a serious movie, I'm afraid I should judge it a 2. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie if you're a serious movie fan and look for an interesting and challenging story, or good acting. There is no one to be found. <br /> <br /> Edit: Hmmm ... I think a group of people working for the lifetime had to write some horrible reviews and write down all the negative voices. Don't believe them. It's a very crappy movie.
