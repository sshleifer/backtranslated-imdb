Unfortunately, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> Clicking, hackneyed, stylized dialogue and acting make it almost immovable. <br /> <br /> The feel-good final is laughable. <br /> <br /> There's a reason. Judge Reinhold's career has disappeared. <br /> <br /> If you don't live in New York and aren't Jewish, some of the jokes will be inexcusable. <br /> <br /> I also found the need for the unknown lesbian daughter to be completely offensive at the end. <br /> <br /> I just can't understand how this movie was so popular with movie festivals. <br /> <br /> This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I've seen for some time.
