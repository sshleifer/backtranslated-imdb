Uwe Boll returns in his film skills to again present a scifi horror story of mercenaries and reporters who take super soldiers on a remote island. Boll throws a nasty roll of cunning under the excellent Udo Keir, making the worst of the writing that had to work. The crazy scientist investigated by a reporter was killed, but this writing is almost enough that the plot worked. In addition, the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some creepiness, but Boll somehow succeeds in rolling everything into a rounded path. It's as if he can't be bothered to actually figure out what will work, but instead of the camera's positions, he walks away. In addition, the composition of scenes has no spark or life, I suspect Boll shot only one or two and only used what he had. It really stinks. Boll is evident in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything he has ever learned about film flourishes. The last movie he made was bad, was a series of killer movies that are one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not that bad, but it's just because it should have been better. Then Udo Keir is good enough to see how his scene is worth it and make it almost as bad as his good movie. I will succeed unless it is late at night and you take it on the cable.
