However, I said it was difficult, if not impossible, to look at, and not because of the horrors it portrays, but incidentally it was portrayed. Imagine what Costa Gavras could have done with this true horror story. What I object to is the idea that the need to deny, for which I am subscribing, is enough. How about us with the power of powerful cinema. I feel that the eagerness of the filmmaker, perhaps even the righteous anger, did not enable him to see it clearly from a biographical point of view. Or if it was a cinematic point of view, I mean, a choice, then I didn't like it at all. I was more disturbed by the way the movie was shot than by the movie itself. Well, I'm sure, but unfortunately it's not nearly enough.
