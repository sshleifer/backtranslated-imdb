A crossover film, a brush-old screwdriver, designed to show Madonna's comic features. She goes far on the proverbial limb here and plays an extraordinary parole trying to prove she's been murdered. (A body was found in the drum of her car after running a red light ... big laugh). After an energetic animated credit series - which is much more fun than the rest of the picture - we have nothing to look at, but Madonna's black mascara and red lips are cut off by her platinum hair and pale face. What else is there? Griffin Dunne seems defeated to play Maddy's custodian, while the poor choice of supporting throws struggles to laugh with lousy dialogue. It is an unfortunate setback on the talents of director James Foley, who unconsciously ran his star in the spirit of the 1930s note-like pop-stick movies (but even Katharine Hepburn in "Bringing Baby" had a human side). Wretched. * of ****
