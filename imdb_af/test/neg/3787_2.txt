Each character is stereotype or archetype. The good man in a bad situation, the struggle between older and younger priest on acceptance and discipline, the oppressed, sexually / emotionally deprived woman returning to the small town after he was not in the big city. , the irreconcilable bad guys, two "lost boys" looking for a sense of family - they are all here, and not one of them with even the smallest spin of something new.
