This film brought a whole new meaning to the worn phrase, like to look dry, because it was 'like dying dry in the middle of a monsoon'. <br /> <br /> I was attracted to the film by its location on the west coast of Portugal I visited. It's a beautiful place for a while and the black and white has a whole new dimension to the beauty. That was the only good thing. The story was terribly banal and frankly you should have a story. <br /> <br /> A movie person runs out of film and the whole crew then has to wait. Well, a guard is a guard. I can wait for a 15-minute bus on Princes Street in Edinburgh. I can spend hours at a remote train station in the middle of nowhere on cold winter's Sunday afternoon. But a guard is boring and yes, this guard was also boring. <br /> <br /> So the leader goes to America to remake with the movie provider who decorates him not to color the whole thing. After a number of arguments, two blessed bullets call out where and the expected end finally arrives, and not ahead of time. <br /> <br /> Yes, I will see this movie again if somebody shows me some of my movie tins of color film so I can screen them on the screen.
