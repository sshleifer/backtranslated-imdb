I have never heard of ONE DARK NIGHT until someone recently mentioned it on a horror message board, and I got interest because of Meg Tilly's involvement and admitted it was an early concert. The 13th VI: JASON LIVES director Tom McLoughlin. Unfortunately, sad to say, it's nothing special. The point of departure is that a college girl has to survive in an old mausoleum in the morning to attend a girl. This girl is a young Meg Tilly, who wants to prove Julie to her dearest, caring boyfriend, Steve (David Mason Daniels), that she can make his brutal, fucking ex-girlfriend, Carol's (Robin Evans) painful, regardless of tactics. She pulled to see her fail. Along with Carol's gang is Kitty (Leslie Speights), always with a toothbrush in her mouth, and Leslie (Elizabeth Daily) who doesn't really want to cause July that much trouble. While Leslie insists on leaving Julie alone while staying in the mausoleum, Carol and Kitty are planning to torment the poor girl. Meanwhile, Steve is looking for her while Julie, Carol and Kitty experience an evil that cannot possibly be imagined. The body of a recently sick "psychic vampire", whose telekinesis was of a dangerous mighty degree, will attempt to drain them from their lot. vitality. The only one who can help these girls is the daughter of the dead, Olivia (Melissa Newman) equipped with the same psychic power. <br /> <br /> I think what will be very exciting is the unusual evil that threatens the girls in the mausoleum, it's definitely different from what you normally see in the slashers that were out of this time. Like Adam West's character (... he was the cynical man of Olivia who found the idea of ​​her father's power ridiculous), I had a very difficult time adjusting to the tough plot and I never got anything in it the movie not found to be excited about. The mausoleum for me was never really so haunting. It does not actually capture the same ominous quality of PHANTASM) and the bodies used to attack the girls are ridiculously unconvincing (there is one big scene where a Light's face melts away). I have a soft spot for low-budget movies of this time, but I could never really find a reason to get involved when you have this unsatisfactory shit that shoots electric bolts so other bodies can break their cribs to obey they master. It's just too stupid to take seriously. Carol is your typical blonde bitch who wants to punish a pretty girl who is a former flame. Steve is your typical, wheezing, clean, all-American boyfriend, attractive and gentle, who becomes the hero who wants to save his girlfriend from whatever sinister forces are playing. To make up for the small budget director, McLoughlin tries every trick in the book to excite the audience by using a series of yoga bow effects, such as corpses that follow young girls, shaking and shaking chairs, doors that and objects that are shaky in themselves. Of course, the movie has its fans, and I'm glad I had the chance to see it, but I was a little disappointed that ONE DARK NIGHT wasn't the horror sleep I was hoping for. Adam West has a very small role as the worried man who hopes that his wife will find out about her father who has nothing to do with her. Melissa Newman is the upset Olivia and admits to stopping her father once and for all, otherwise he will continue to prey on life. Donald Hotton is Dockstader, an associate of Olivia's father who tells her what he was. I wasn't particularly blown away by Tilly's show here (she was most of the time), but she would get the chance to prove more from now on. It will undoubtedly be of value to those who looked at it at that time. For nostalgia, it can deceive the fans of movies of this era.
