Tarzan, the environmental awareness leader, has four hikers abducting most of the unorthodox animals to get them to Zoos. Tarzan has a mere but sexy enough woman with an impeccable haircut and a child. Nobody should be guilty of Tarzan because he is saddened by the evil conduct of the hunters. <br /> <br /> This Gordon Scott Tarzan movie is one of the silliest, totally and unnecessarily stupid. For some reason, the team didn't find anything special to support the movie, and so it's just a folly. Tarzan and his family are being threatened by a group of evil kickers, as Tarzan's environmental awareness brought him into open conflict with the malicious people. The child and the chimpanzee, both of whom belong to Tarzan, are kidnapped by the malicious poachers; so Tarzan calls the unleashed animal forces of the jungle to release the child and chimpanzees with Tarzan leading the attack. TARZAN AND THE TRAPERS are stupid, unattractive, very uninteresting. Maybe as a child, would I like it? Now one has to be meant to be so dirty as those pathetic poachers punished by Tarzan for asking a Tarzan movie not to be stupid; I admit it. But one is also really entitled to ask this Tarzan movie, how stupid it is, to give anything and give a little gusto, even a little gusto. Some kick, a little excitement, a little fun. Now Gordon Scott Tarzan is stupid, just because he doesn't have any gusto because he's not excited. (Yes, I like the order of the jungle eating a snake. Which animal? Look at the movie, kiddos, here I just gave you one excuse.) For some reason the villains look somewhat pathetic and evoke mercy rather than virtuous anger. <br /> <br /> The books give the impression that Tarzan looks pretty bright in its own way; and if a decent bodybuilder or other sportsman is found to look smart enough, the role could be a too demanding, impossible task, but Gordon Scott was in any case too far from meeting that ideal. <br /> <br /> The woman chides Tarzan for books. <br /> <br /> The writing suggests that Tarzan was uneducated, almost illiterate and detrimental to learning; but the book says differently and we know that Tarzan has studied many things with his family's books before he even meets white people. <br /> <br /> And I didn't like it. <br /> <br /> (It's supposed to be dear kiddos, to be a real scream, not a missed yodeler.)
