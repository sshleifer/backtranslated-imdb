(Only light spoilers in it) <br /> <br /> Stable Sinatra is a half-sleepy comedy about deadly kidnappers, deadly victims, and a few other side stories that are thrown in to eat something. <br /> <br /> You'll see some poor performances everywhere in this movie. The drama is forced, and the humor doesn't make sense. Whether you watch the kidnappers, the victim who won't shut down or threatens a victim's father is threatening the criminal's death threat with "Care for some tea?", None of which is credible. It fits comfortably in the category "wannabe movie". <br /> <br /> You will also listen to the entire movie about a repetitive, tough music track. It's pretty unprofessional and doesn't add anything. It's actually just a sad attempt to make a painful unfunny film, which looks somewhat greasy. <br /> <br /> But if you can pass it all off and stop much disbelief, you might be entertained by the adequate storyline. <br /> <br /> I voted 4/10.
