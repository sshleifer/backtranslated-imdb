As a Bruce Campbell fan for nearly two decades, I was excited to have the opportunity to watch his latest movie on the big screen with the man himself. Unfortunately, the man with the screaming brain was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> In Bulgaria - where the Sci-Fi channel makes its original films on Saturday night, "Man with the Screaming Brain" is a curious mix of a 50-year-old B film, a body-changing comedy, a violent revenge flag and an exaggerated slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If it doesn't make sense, well, either "Man with the Crying Brain." Campbell plays a pharmaceutical company's chief executive who visits Bulgaria with his estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the semi-finished metro system of the former communist country. The two coincide with a former KGB agent to taxi driver, and all three eventually meet them in the hands of a shaky gypsy woman. <br /> <br /> A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and his governor assistant (Ted Raimi), who developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection, steal the bodies and place a part of the driver's brain in Campbell's damaged skull. They also put his wife's brain in a robotic body that they just have at hand. <br /> <br /> Campbell escapes, and with a hurried revived skull and the voice of the taxi driver - whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body - echoing in his head, sets the gypsy out and finds it dead . (His robotic wife does the same.) <br /> But first, there is an attempt to emulate Steve Martin / Lily Tomlin's "All of Me" as Campbell's two personalities dominate a restaurant dinner. Just as he plays his own evil hand in "Evil Dead II", Campbell is proficient in letting his body appear to be inhabited by more than one mind. <br /> <br /> Sometimes screaming comes closest to another Steve Martin movie, "The Man with Two Brains," as it also takes a foolish approach to a 50-year-old sci-fi clich√©. However, it tries too hard for too little result, and it is double for Ted Raimi's semi-understandable Bulgarian oaf, which gets far too much screen time. (Nothing against Raimi, it's just that he is better at smaller doses.) <br /> <br /> In the end, it's not outrageous (or funny) enough to meet as a ghost, and that's also not serious enough to be a B-movie pastiche. I was glad Campbell had already left the screen when it came to a standstill, because I was afraid to say, "Give, Bruce, it was really ... something." <br /> <br /> Perhaps the Best Praise that I can give it as a movie is that the photos are at least held onto the emulsion. And it was twice as good as "Alien Apocalypse."
