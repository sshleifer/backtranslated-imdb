Amitabh and Jiah Khan have been under severe pressure by their press conferences, although it was very easy for the critics, and the supporters too, for the Ram Gopal Verma Factory product to fall flat on its face. , in all probability! Why, because Jiah was so immature and childish, and Bacchan, was guilty and unclear. they did not even know what they were talking about, after the press, held with the mark line, that some love stories should not be understood, or such junk! Why is the title Nishabd? Ramu must refresh his knowledge of Sanskrit, as Vidhu Vinod Mahabharata must study, be in line, another glorious flop of the year, Eklavya! Compared to the sweet hearts, and Lolit's are inevitable, as the so-called plot line has to be inspired by them. but unfortunately, Ramu has barely made any effort to dive deep into the burden of aging and the young. is lolly pop sucking the ultimate indicator of innocence? And unlike the streak of childishness, the leg at the dining table, with a Vijay, which Bacchan is in that role, ceaselessly bursts into the wards. This girl is actually at her seductive game, which deceives Vijay into thinking, she is in love with him. The legs are also slim enough, and the act of placing the water snake through the legs is obscene to the right. It's beyond anyone's understanding, how can a girl who comes to a body's house as a guest be so worse, brash and overpowering? And why is the stupid woman, played by Revathi, remarkably good, though poorly written, characterized unrealistically, encouraging her own husband to dance with a sexy young girl? that part of Vijay, trying to get some refreshers in his humdrum life, is absolute nonsense. because it seems he is happy as he is, with a well-established life and a hobby to recreate. It reminds Blame on Rio, the older dad, and his young love, played excellently by Michael Caine. Bacchan looks terribly in close range, and about everything, where Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons looked so nice and handsome. Therefore, the young chicks are sometimes attracted to older men, for their beautiful person, compared to the vulnerability of young boys of their age. Only good thing about this movie is the green, vast landscapes, winding roads and pleasant cinematography. no dust, or even a sparkling display of emotions, drama or even intriguing, stormy sex like in Lolita, this leveled movie has no wonder, fallen flat on his face and had to be dropped off the screens during the first few weeks! The next time, before you copy such a Hollywood theme, Ramu has to do his homework, and Bacchan must think twice! You can't deceive the whole people, Mr. Bacchan!
