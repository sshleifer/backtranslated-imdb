This movie has one of the worst main characters ever. I say this because he is made up to be the hero, when everything he does in the whole movie scorches my life and causes problems. He can't do anything right, but the movie makes him look like the cool man who has to look up. He has all the wrong times of moods, he has all the wrong views on things that ultimately make people angry with him and to kill people, he is too sophisticated, too naughty, too macho, to accept all the wrong decisions and has no common sense. <br /> <br /> It's about a private detective hired by a successful painter to find the woman and boy he'd walked out years ago. The detective finds the woman and what he thinks she is her son. But all kinds of things happen to make this story full of crime, drama and twists. It's made for TV, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is pretty entertaining. Johnny Depp is very young in this one and has a terrible 80's hairstyle. He chews gums and throws a soccer ball for about 5 minutes and that's all we'll see from him. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the VHS version of this release sells for $ 40 in online auctions. . It should only be for Johnny Depp collectors. It can't be because of the plot. It can not be. <br /> <br />
