I'd like to say something else about this movie. I saw comments on how beautiful Russia is and the views from Russia were wonderful. Hey guys, it's not Russia, it's Bulgaria more specifically, the capital Sofia. So it's not Russia it's my country. About the movie - good in Bulgaria, maybe besides the Gray Zone - all movies of American directors are in one word terrible like this one of course. It's a pity that Patrick Swayze has to play in such a low budget film. Most of the actors are Bulgarians, but really this movie has no plot, I don't have energy. What can I say-weak and boring, a clich√©, no more. Hey people remember it's not Russia in fact, it's Bulgaria.
