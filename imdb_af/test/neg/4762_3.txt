If you suffer from insomnia, Radiant will be the best way to send you into a 7-year-old coma. The movie is so devastated and predominant that it is difficult to imagine that director Steve Mahone can so easily overestimate dull. <br /> <br /> The story moves a banned doctor (who we never see) in the desert. yes, just like that episode of Futurama). The vaccines do not work and the human test children are infected with a virus that kills within 48 hours. <br /> <br /> Not wanting to be caught by government's masks, the group goes into the desert for cover, hoping the sunshine will kill the virus. All this was told by Michael, the only one of the quartet immune to the infection. And this is the most boring narrative ever. They could have thrown someone with an interesting voice, but we'd rather get someone with less voting ability than Clive Owen. <br /> <br /> In addition, the editor insists on blurring more than half of the film, making it a strange dream-like feeling and the audience's desire to sleep. It's no surprise that half of the audience walked out of it, because I wasn't one of them for some reason. But I need the blood well. <br /> <br /> The end is supposed to be shocking and clever and prosperous. But it's simple and simple. A relief, yes, but not dramatically in the slightest. <br /> <br /> The extreme cheapness of this production and subdued sound that makes much of the dialogue make unintelligible cripples that could have been an interesting scientific storytelling if it were better actors, cooler places and a sense of urgency. As it is, Radiant is a snooze.
