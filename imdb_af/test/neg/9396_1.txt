This movie is probably based on a non-fiction book. I'm not sure what book the writer (s) read to write their adaptation, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the real life adventures of Frances Mayes in Italy. Instead, it is an uninteresting story that takes freedom to bash men every time. Note the following examples: <br /> <br /> *********************************** * **************************** <br /> <br /> DETAILS <br /> <br /> * *** *********************************************** *** ************* <br /> Bash Number One: Lane's husband cheats her and her marriage ends in divorce. <br /> <br /> Bash Number Two: Lane operates in a local Italian town and is promptly asked by every man on the street. <br /> <br /> Bash Number Three: Lane is rescued from the horny townspeople by beautiful men. She falls for him after completing an afternoon of love making. She later found that he had already attached and deceived her. <br /> <br /> Bash Number Four: You need to broaden your horizon for this one because the reference is definitely in the movie. Her lesbian couple friends decide to have a baby by invetro (SP?) Fertilization. I am told that in most lesbian relationships you have one person who accepts the female role and the other who accept the male role. In the film, after the woman became pregnant, the "male" lesbian decides to run on the relationship because she can't handle it. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie has nothing to do with the book on which it is based.
