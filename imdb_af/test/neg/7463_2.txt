The ATTIC is starting well. The somewhat arid story is largely helped by the two main actors, and there is a sign of a character study underway here, but the film is quickly declining when Carrie Snodgress's character buys a monkey. Not one of those cute little monkeys. She buys a really big chimpanzee! <br /> <br /> This sudden plot device kills the movie. It's just not conceivable for a woman like the one Snodgress play, because it's hard to do anything because of her dominant dad, for her, out of the blue, buy a chimpanzee. I mean, come on! Forget about it!
