It may have been an excellent movie. But so many other people think so. This was done poorly due to the transition from languages. If the whole movie is to be read, take it a bit away from the movie and become something else. It has an excellent score for me and I couldn't wait to rent it. But, as soon as I did, it was a real deviation. Here in Boardman, Ohio, I couldn't find an English version for any similar. This movie is also compared to Dark Hours and we will not see it in Boardman, Ohio. It is not available. So I think we'll never know how good the movie was.
