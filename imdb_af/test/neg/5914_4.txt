by Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this one. I enjoy Eddie Murphy and I love it as a star hand-make vehicle for themselves or when someone who writes decides to mark their own legal message. But if the star's head gets too big for the rest of its body, there is always a danger of a large-sized Hollywood vanity production. <br /> <br /> Will the filmmaker really keep it? Or will he waste the amount of money (the studios, ours) and time (the studio, ours and his own) for half an hour on the back? Unfortunately, this is the latter one. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really like is when someone breathes new and fresh life into a exhausted and dried out genre. Not one of them. The warring nightclub movies have become so worn that even the parodies of it are sad and killed. <br /> <br /> Murphy doesn't. He does the most clichéd: He connects in a routine conventional formula gangster photo and plays it as seriously as "The Godfather." It's like a script where the next concept, they are joking and new ideas. But it seems as if someone with a claw just looked at it and went: "No, it's good." <br /> <br /> Probably Murphy. He is credited with this. In the opening shot of beautiful white satin sheets, his name is called over five credits over credits. <br /> <br /> THE PLOT: A young orphan saves Pryor's life and Pryor takes on the small ragamuffin. <br /> <br /> Twenty years later, Pryor's dump became a first-class hotspot. They deduct big money and a gunman wants their action. He even had a dirty policeman in his service. But Pryor comes with a scheme, a la "THE STING." <br /> <br /> Murphy's script plays like an unfinished first concept that no one had the two to call him. The actors may not stand out much. Even the almighty Murphy seems to be on the car pilot. <br /> <br /> Pryor shows class and male ways as Sugar Ray (perhaps it would have been better to call his character BROWN Sugar Ray, further evidence that this one needed a Polish), but everyone here is basically just on vacation. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nomination that the film receives is richly earned (Joe I. Tompkins's best costume design), but the production values ​​are the only part that the 30s feel authentic. <br /> <br /> Some sets look a bit fake, but it's supposed to be a comedy of sorts. It's hardly a movie nominated for both a Razzie and an Oscar (unless it's one of Lucas's new Star Wars chapters). <br /> <br /> It's 1938 and everyone is talking like 1988, especially the comedians. This is a prehistoric white man's formula. And with all these black comedians and satirists, you expect them to skew the genre or at least bring new life to it. Nope. Murphy was almost pushed down here. <br /> <br /> The great Roger Ebert noticed it perfectly when he noticed in his review: "Murphy approaches his story more than a costume party in which everyone is going to look good while fumbling through a plot that's since 1938 was not fresh. "<br /> <br /> Jasmine Guy was thrown perfectly and looks like she's enjoying herself and Michael Lerner has all the looks, evil and ways of prototypical mobboss down pat. And there are moments where Pryor gives you an idea of ​​what a more interesting leader and authority would look like. He gives every scene a sense of dignity. <br /> <br /> Would it have been too much to ask Della to sing Resse? Or at least embarrass herself with all her "Kiss My Ass talks?" <br /> <br /> And the late Red Foxx doesn't get much of a swan song here. He has a little back and forth with Resse who could have been some good things. Nope. Murphy is wasting another opportunity here. <br /> <br /> Murphy's Quick is charismatic and delicious. But those moments are few and far between. Murphy has never looked better and never been duller. His character twice made me laugh all over the movie. <br /> <br /> Stan Shaw's boxer with a horrible speech restriction is not only painful and embarrassing, it's annoying. There is more comedy than just showing off. You should include some kind of light touch and funny situation. To emphasize him, even some of the easiest words, we just pity him and annoyed with Murphy. <br /> <br /> Can Murphy write a script? Good ?? There was 'Raw', but it was really rising. He probably wrote the outline for "Boomerang" and "Come to America". But she didn't have the last word there. Perhaps a team of ER-like doctors have revived this one. <br /> <br /> Murphy's direction is so slow and quiet, you will swear he was asleep from time to time. He has too many static shots and does not seem to build and release tension. At some level, I think Quick is real Eddie Murphy. Angry, young, hot-headed and ambitious. But sometimes charming. Now if he was just somewhere funny. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which Murphy has a femme fa story in bed that intends to love with him and kill him. You can probably guess how it comes out. Like everyone else in the movie, it could have been better, but ?? <br /> <br /> "Surprisingly," Murphy has not made another movie (he received a Razzie nomination). And he no longer writes the final concept for his movies (he has the Razzie for writing it!) <br /> <br /> It's great to watch and the music is beautiful and there is a some very nice scenes. But it just falls under the category "jewels under all the rubble". Not enough of them. <br /> <br /> Couldn't have been. Shouldv'e been. Wasn't. Oh, well. <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
