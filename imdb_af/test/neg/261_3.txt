When I read the reviews of Kahin Pyaar After Ho Jaaye, I thought, "Huh?" It was confusing. To be sure, I went to watch the movie and what do you know? It's a remake of "The Wedding Singer". Several scenes have been changed to fit the whole essence of Indian, but the rest is a direct lift of the 1998 Hollywood hit. Bollywood is no stranger to remakes, but it's so poor that it just hurt me to see it. I watched so much, and I realized I wasn't the only one to do it! One man actually walked out of the theater and never came back! Salman Khan must seriously stop doing comedy roles. He shouts and shines too much. Why can't he make it easy? He does not do justice to the role Adam Sandler originally acted on. He doesn't have Sandler's sense of comic timing. Rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites, but she is not Drew Barrymore either. The scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing her new saying ("Hi, I'm Mrs Pugalia") does not correspond to Barrymore's version ("Hi, I'm Mrs Julia Gulia"). I felt ashamed to look at that scene, although I loved the original. The music is not too bad. This is probably the only saving grace of this otherwise horrible movie! Avoid it at all costs!
