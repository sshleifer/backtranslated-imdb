Okay ... for the most part, and all its cheesiness, this movie was pretty good for a MST3K movie ... but then they decided to ruin what little goodness it had about fifteen minutes before the end. * Spoiler Alert * The movie is very basic ... a rich mama's son named Danny meets a bum named Bix, and they two travel to a small town where Bix meets a pretty girl with the name Carrie (which is so much). Now, this movie's basic premise was promising enough. All they had to do was follow the simple chemistry of any romance movie. Carrie loves Bix ... Bix loves Carrie ... a creepy man in the city's desires for Carrie. Now I know what you think. .. Bix fights the crawl and finally decides to settle with Carrie, and Danny returns home, and fortunately they all live ... right? WRONG!! Because Carrie is murdered by the town, because Bix is ​​too gay to commit. (There are so many homosexual undertones between Danny and Bix.) And then the whole town decides to line up Bix, though the village hint would easily be the first suspect. Then the village creep confesses to kill Carrie without much hesitation ... (must feel bad, the poor dope.) Then Danny Bix brings him home with him ... it's the movie's "happy ever." Sad, huh? All I can say is thank God for Joel and the Bots. Because they changed this horseshoe into one of my favorite MST3K episodes.
