I had the privilege to see this powerful play on Broadway with Kathy Bates. I only saw one other play in the 1970s that had an emotional impact like this play. I was really looking forward to the play that was made in a movie, but was very disappointed when I learned that Kathy Bates would not portray her role in the movie. She was not known at Broadway at that time and the producers had to be star power I suppose and throw Sissy Spacek instead. Sissy played an adequate role in the lead, but did not measure Kathy Bates in any way. I love Anne Bancroft, but she was too young for this role. The film was true to the play. Anyone who ever considers suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the devastation on those left behind.
