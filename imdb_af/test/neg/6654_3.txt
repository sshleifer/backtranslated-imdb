Well, the plot is entertaining, but it's full of goof. To summarize things, the policeman doesn't want to save his son from cancer, but the only way is to get the transplant from the criminal (Michael Keaton). <br /> <br /> Good criminal vote, but escaping in hospital while the transplant was in progress and police and police force may not be shot at the criminal to save his son. (dead criminal-no transplant-dead boy). <br /> <br /> Well, the police in this movie do not have a brain, if they have never heard of a TAZER knocking the criminal without killing him. end of the movie, as simple as that. <br /> <br /> But it's all crazy and stupid, including the death of 2cops and some doctors are badly burned.
