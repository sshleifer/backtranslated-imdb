This movie is so bad that I have wasted too much time, already talking about it. So bad ... really ... ... BAD ... and I'm not even so critical ... I'm almost ashamed to admit I've seen it ... Sandra's few minutes show you how far she is really made it ... I mean really anything next to this is really worthy of Oscar for her ... I think the only way she can see is there is no way but to this one ... I think she has to somewhere to start ... but really ... so bad ... ... terribly real ... bad is too good a word for this s ** t .... but I don't want to get meaning now. .. but really how can you not waste after 90 minutes ... 90 minutes of my life I will never return ... 90 minutes that I could have spent doing something better ... like fucking on my butt sitting and staring in space. It would have been better time ...
