The growth of tax funds and sales and repayment schemes has led to a series of unsalable films that accumulate dust in laboratories and cellars across the British Isles because they are made to fit the financial criteria rather than any potential audience. A lucky couple gets a week on a small screen in London before they budget their DVD, but The Riddle distinguished itself by bypassing cinema, TV or even the rental market as a free gift DVD in the Mail on Sunday too premiers. <Br /> <br /> It is too easy to see why it was literally given away. Apart from a few glitches (a tree is clearly visible in one shot), it's not particularly bad, and while Vinnie Jones overcomes like the modern British movie's version of Freddie Mills Mills as the greyhound reporter who wants to move to the crime desk and the supportive scroll from ham to vaguely sensible; Mediocrity is more the norm here. The real problem is that there are so many sales and repurchase tax fund films, it's a soft movie. There is no reason to see it. It exists because the circumstances existed to make it, but it has no tempo or forward momentum. It seems to be heard for the teatime Sunday (despite being shot in Scope), but it doesn't cut it. There are some exaggerated ideas in this definitely untapped story of an unpublished Charles Dickens manuscript and some suspicious deaths in today's Limehouse, but the mystery element is so painfully obvious - as the last minute supernatural You'll never guess who Jacobi's literate tramp really is. What do you guess?) - you almost expect the Scooby gang or the Double Decks to fix it. <br /> <br /> This is a very wrong movie For several reasons: a few role players play double roles when they don't even have to play one and the whole shock that shows the truth of the Dickens manuscript is completely stunned because Dickens was first told by the first person. as the supposed character of the novel. The main killings in the film are intricately integrated into the chapter. Characters remind Vinnie that he's already forgotten about the one who sees an increasingly desperate half hour seeing an evil developer. Jason Flemyng's secretary sits Rohypnol in Vinnie's liquor so she can have her wrong way with him and leave incriminating photos "to make you look with your girlfriend," which causes him a dream where he Talking to Charles Dickens ("You're Charles Dickings" "What's in a Name?"), suggesting the somewhat less than likely that: "You read too many books." But everything that is nothing like the final, which falls into absolute absurdity, with logic and common sense, goes completely out of the window as it plays like a bizarre Jacobean revenge with handguns on the banks of the Thames, with two -day gas stars Flemyng and Vanessa Redgrave seem to want to be somewhere else (Mel Smith comes in a one-day como, so it is clear that the film's names are mainly there for an easy $ 10k or to pay their maintenance payments). pay). The film's final image is so completely absurd and useless that it is worth looking at. <br /> <br /> One curiosity is a fairly prominent role in the first third for Vera Day, a kind of prototype Liz Fraser and one-time mainstay of the British films of the 50's - the barmaid in Hell Drivers, the barmaid in Quatermass II - promoted pub owner here, while the upcoming comedian Kenny Lynch briefly appeared to give the best performance as an old schoolmate. Oh, and late Gareth Hunt makes his last bow - oh the irony - a shoulder ... <br /> <br /> Just to round off the package, the freebie DVD also has a trailer for the director's other film included Vinnie Jones, Bog Bodies, a nude-looking British horror with Transatlantic scientists and Vinnie in Elmer Fudd duck hunter gear affected by a reanimated 2000-year-old victim from the nearest peat terror terrorist ("Wewwy , wwuiet: I am jealously joked "). I can hardly wait ... <br /> <br /> The one thing I can guarantee, however, is that every indie producer in the UK will spend the next few weeks finding out exactly how much the Mail has paid for the license to print the DVD (they paid Prince Â£ 250,000 for his new CD). With so many UK tax shelters on the shelf and with so much hard-to-find money at the moment, it can be an interesting UK movie retreat.
