For a movie seen most in South Korea's mother tongue in 2004, it was a great disappointment. Show that Hollywood is not the only place where people can make over-emotional, melodramatic films. The movie was over 130 minutes long, but not much actually happened and everything that happened was pretty much what one expected, the plot was transparent. Admittedly, if one were himself Korean, one might come in more of it, but for me it didn't do much. Suffice it to say that the plot, as usual, revolves around the Korean theater, turning the relationship between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula. South Korea decides to recruit an elite squad group and train the death sentence to kill Kim Il-Sung. <br /> <br /> A tricky plot doesn't make me very difficult if the characters are good, but unfortunately this is not the case this time as well. They are stereotypes and most of the plays are mediocre and too often just over, as is usually the case in Korean theater. Too much time is spent on the many settings and the characters stay far, one dimensional cardboard cuts. They had to spend more time establishing characters and less to show us how difficult and cruel the training and the soldiers are. <br /> <br /> One thing that reminds us is that a minor two errors are still. wrong.
