I don't think it's necessary to describe the plot for you, because the site and other users have already done an excellent job. That said, here is my take. This is by far the worst movie of 2005, and there were some really bad people. I don't even have to go into detail, because there is nothing a solution to this movie. Bad acting, bad plot, bad direction, bad special effects - you call it. If it's not just the worst movie ever made, it's tied up with another piece of crap. I would be ashamed to know my friends that I was in this movie. But hey, most people who see it will do it, no matter what reviews it gets, so more power for you. If you feel the gaping gap between your neurons two hours in your evening, don't be guilty of me.
