The movie starts with a dandy gunfight, where three bandits are quickly shot by a bounty hunter - a bounty hunter wearing more than just a superficial to the Man With No Names of the Clint Eastwood trilogy. (DIFFERENT DOLLARS, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE AND THE GOOD BATH AND HAPPY.) <br /> <br /> Immediately afterwards you see this man in a golden train full of Union soldiers. Of course, the shipment is attacked and the soldiers are all fighting like blind guys, so they are quickly neutralized. But in a twist, one of the bandits deceived the gang leader (Gilbert Roland) and drove away the gold. Soon Roland comes up and is about to find out where the gold is hidden. But just at that moment, the army came up and killed the traitor. Bummer. However, the man with a name's name thinks Roland knows about the treasure and maybe a medal given to Roland by the traitor is the key. A strange banker is also thrown into the mix. All three want the gold and all three look pretty macho. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a particular Western. Much of this is the plot, and some of it is that George Hilton (a Uruguayan despite the American sounding name) is not as interesting as Eastwood or other premier Spaghetti Western stars, but most of them are because soundtrack just suck. So often the music does not even come close to the play and it seems almost randomly added. Plus, it's just not very good stuff. This is clearly not the work of Ennio Morricone's music master of the Spaghetti genre. <br /> <br /> Overall, just a tighter - and not a particularly good one.
