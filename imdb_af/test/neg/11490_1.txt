I didn't see and hear the original version. <br /> <br /> I'm not Russian, but I'm learning now. <br /> <br /> I also have no preferences for Russia, Bulgaria, USA. etc. <br /> <br /> But what I need to mention is: <br /> <br /> In German synchronization throughout the movie, all Russians speak Russian accents. Americans speak "Hochdeutsch" (without accent)! I have never heard such stupidity! What's more, it's boring. <br /> <br /> I hope the original is better. <br /> <br /> The rest is a simple excitement, not really good ideas. Like a cheap version of a James Bond movie.
