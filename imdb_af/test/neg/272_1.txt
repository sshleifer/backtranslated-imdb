Like most people, I couldn't wait to see this ocean's 11 successor, but it really stinks, I have to say. It stins because there is no good script, it was just cheap. I hope the producers donate (or will make) all the money this movie made to the tsunami victims in Asia, so this movie will have at least one good reason to exist. It's so bad I can't even write a proper comment on it, but .... I still recommend the creators of this thing to make Ocean's 13. Ocean's 13 is about the same thieves trying to steal a script that's hidden in Hollywood. The 13th member will be a strange (perhaps Russian) scriptwriter who knows all the tricks to write a copy of this well-hidden script so they can replace the original they will have to steal. Or they have to find at least 13 people to write a decent movie for a movie in which not only Julia Roberts plays herself, but even all the other star's of the Ocean's movies. 13 People because it is the lucky number of Andy Garcia's character.
