Legendary pop star Steve Alaimo ("Do not Let The Sun Catch You Crying") stars as an unlikely stock car racer whose career hit the skid because he constantly crashes his car (or, like me, I'm tired of every fat apple behind) The wheel is coming, running "). He falls in a bad crowd of humorously unknown Nazi bikers, unlikely named Jeeter, Banjo, Fats, and Linda. Fats are the most beautiful of the bunch; he has a surfboard taken to the back of the skull and now communicates only by grunts, such as a Harley Davidson Leatherface. <br /> <br /> In any case, Steve is being deceived by the police to catch the deadly crooks in the middle. The gang only robs banks for "kicks, man." I think they give the money to charity. Steve continually fails, the cyclists get fatter, and the whole thing never comes out so much because it's so boring This movie looks like it's gone through a fat paper towel film is. Not since "Necromantic" has a movie that has trodden my soul. <br /> <br /> The guy who played Fats placed "Deranged," the Ed Gein biopic lead Robert Blossom. <br /> <br /> Anyway, summary: Wild Rebels: Hilarious on MST3K, terribly everywhere else.
