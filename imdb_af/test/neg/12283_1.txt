One of the worst movies I've seen this year. Everything about the movie shouts "AMATEUR". For a movie in the 1800s, everyone is talking like it was in the 1990s. The acting, especially the people who play the white slave masters, is terrible. After about an hour in this movie, I went out. What a waste of time and effort. For a much better movie on this subject, see Steven Spielberg's far superior "Amistad."
