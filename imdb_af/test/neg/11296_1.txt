One of the worst theatrical films of the year, if not all the time. Anthony Hopkins insults himself by even appearing in this joke. I can't believe David Mamet and Ridley Scott's name appears on this travesty. The best career movement ever made by Jody Foster was turning this one. Julianne Moore was as emotional as a female Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was, of course, his brilliant self. He is a lame victim of Hannibal and the makeup is so good, I didn't know it was Gary to the final credits. but eaten by trained pigs ??? Give me a chance! Rumors have it that he does not want his name even in the credits. And braai and roast his own brain to Ray Liotta ... I laugh at the absurdity, not the stupidity of this movie at this point. I haven't seen many people walk out of a movie since Who's that girl. <br /> <br /> Pay someone else to go for you if you need to, but miss this one ALL COST !!!
