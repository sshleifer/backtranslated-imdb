What distinguishes some of the 'Lone Star' films (and many others in the western and adventure films of the early thirties) was their lack of what we acknowledge as a formal narrative. To be sure, they are good at evil (the basic element of any Western), the boy meets girl and some stock characters, such as the old farmer and his beautiful daughter or big daughter, and sometimes the evil banker or other businessman, but the way the action played was often different to film after film. <br /> <br /> The Lawless Frontier turns Earl Dwire into his big star (not) as (for inexplicable reason) Pandro Zanti, half a Apache, half of US positioning as a Mexican that smoothes the language talk. "His biggest post as a Mexican was his outrageous mariachi clothing. The only plot seems to be Ruby, the granddaughter of "Old Dusty" (Gabby Hayes). When she meets her for the first time, Dwire gives her a long time over the eye that puts him in the big leagues with sexual predators. You might think, because the opening scene shows that Zanti John (Wayne) kills Tobin's father from the camera will play a bigger role in the film. That doesn't mean that. Too much hunting and back and forth between heroes and villains. <br /> <br /> We get very good stunts, though, from Yakima Canutt, including pulling Ruby on his horse as he drives, jumping on "apostates" and knocking them off their horses, a horse jumping from a wreath in a lake, and even the same slip along the sluice sequence that was in "The Lucky Texan" (1934), although this time the Mighty Yak uses a body leaf log instead of crossbeam a tree branch, and its inclusion is just as illogical as they are in a desert. <br /> <br /> The highlight is clearly John Wayne's measured and methodically well-photographed desert descent following the flight and stumbling Zanti with the fantastic basalt cliffs of the Red Rock Canyon (seen in numerous magazines, westerns and science fiction) moon 'movies' behind him. No final rifle game on fifty steps with the heroine running off the wooden steps of the pub to embrace the conquering hero in this movie! When John Wayne finally catches up with him, Zanti drinks poisoned water from a waterhole and dies. <br /> <br /> After a few too many pursuits, Zantai's gang is eventually caught up in Dusty's cabin, one by one. A twisted cabinet that apparently leads to a canyon is now blocked by being demineralized. No rhythm in sunset or girl compulsory: The last shot is Ruby, now Mrs. John Tobin, on the phone to the now Sheriff John Tobin, "What would Sheriff Tobin like for supper?" The film also has poor lighting and editing at the beginning, the pace is slow, some parts with the sheriff cause it to drag, and the hunters fill the film. Despite the different and unusual elements, it comes down as one of the weaker Lone Stars.
