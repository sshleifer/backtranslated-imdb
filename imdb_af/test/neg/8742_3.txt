Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother, Selma Lidz (Andie MacDowell), is experiencing a very serious illness and her self-proclaimed inventor, Sid (John Tururro), lacked a little in the emotion department. Unfortunately with the new home situation, their sensitive son Steven (Nathan Watt) decides to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny (Michael Richards) and Melvin (Lou Cutell) until his mother is good. Steven looks happier and even takes an interest in his strange uncle's living habits; He even decided he wanted to change his name to Franz. In the early 60's this drama is a bit comical ... change it to zany. Not a MacDowell fan assures UNSTRUNG HEROES my attitude; although I enjoy the movie and it is not a total waste.
