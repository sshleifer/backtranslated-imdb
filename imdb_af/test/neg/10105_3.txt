OK, the box looks interesting, the opening has good music and its kind original, and that's all good. But when the movie started. Well, it's not my first video movie, I watched Ghost Lake, and it's very similar to this movie, except it's even worse here. The story was initially interesting, but the whole movie looks like a movie shot by a bunch of college students, with special effect that I laugh, the blood looks like a mixture of red and white paint, the fire effect on the demon face like this was done with a program I could buy at my local computer store. All the movie was shot in the day (great for a movie that is supposed to be abomination) and there are no gore (only one scene and it looks so homemade and not credible) and almost no blood (it can be regarded as a good thing considering the appearance of the blood show) and 1 demon for the whole movie. The story goes nowhere, it gives you the impression that it never starts, there is so much useless scene just done to give the movie the average duration (when the devil searches the dog in the dogs for about 4 minutes) Too much, slow-moving things. Well, we can only say this movie is a Z series one and a very poor one. All cool ideas have lost themselves and you get a cheese film. It has bored me for a long time and I'm not the man who gets bored with horror movie very easily. Man, I even love death and alone in the dark of Uwe Boll and you probably know the name of one of the worst director but here it looks too much like some guys who would like to make a movie. Plus for our French speaking speaker (hard to understand English, I prefer watching movie in my mother tongue) there is the usual video shots bad translation. In the normal movie you can hardly see it not talking to the actor (you have to look at lips, etc.) Just listen and you know it. Very cheesy
