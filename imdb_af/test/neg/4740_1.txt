this movie showed me Paul W.S. Anderson's AvP1 and enjoy it! I won't even dream of comparing Requiem with any of the Alien or Predator series movies, it's a DIFFERENT TEENAGE B-HORROR FOOTAGE SET IN A US SMALL CITY, NO ONE CARE. <br /> <br /> AvP1 carved at least lots of handmade art in the movie sets, it had bags of candy that were not previously seen in any original movies, but was devastated by unconvincing characters / acting. <br /> <br /> Requiem badly behaves to the lowest level imaginable, and it also has so much in every other department ... it's a holiness to include alien and predator packs in this type of garbage.
