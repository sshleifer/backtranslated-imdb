Poorly acted and poorly directed, "Congo" tries unsuccessfully to recreate the feeling of "Jurassic Park". But the truth is, the book wasn't that good either. Yet the film's first problem is that Tim Curry's character was added; The second problem is that the voice alarm is added; The biggest problem, however, is that the cast members do not create realistic characters. I guarantee that this movie will not make you think that gorillas are murdered everywhere. Also with Laura Linney (happy birthday, Laura!), Dylan Walsh, Ernie Hudson, Grant Heslov, Joe Don Baker, James Karen and Bruce Campbell; I guess they don't want to emphasize this movie in their CV.
