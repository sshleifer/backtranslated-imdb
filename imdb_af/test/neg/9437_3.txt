It should appear as one of the best TV shows in a long time. <br /> <br /> Jose Ferrer played the title character, Nemo. He did the part justice and definitely watched the part. But nowadays, it seems to me that the Nemo has done more than a passing agreement with Captain Bird's Eye, of the TV commercials. Or maybe it's the other way around. <br /> <br /> His nemesis, Professor Cunningham, was brilliantly presented by Burgess Meredith. He never seemed to come across Batman's "Penguin" days. Although he does not do his Penguin "kwack" here, he is unparalleled as the manic professor. Only John Colicos, of Battlestar Galactica celebrity, had the landscape better than a manic despot. <br /> <br /> I never remember what the resentment between Nemo and Cunningham was, but it had to be heavy since the prof <br /> <br /> The effects were nothing special, though Prof. Cunningham's submarine looks better than Nemo's. It also had a crew of strange, fish-like amphibians who served Cunningham and did every offer. <br /> <br /> However, the most memorable aspect of the whole show was prof. Cunningham's secret weapon. The Delta Beam! He was forever "Fire Delta Beam!", After which a different crew member would deter the movement of the weapon with a full shoulder. Actually priceless! They no longer make them, and maybe just as well. But like other series of this era, for those who remember, it will always have a loving, as Cheddar-covered, place in our hearts.
