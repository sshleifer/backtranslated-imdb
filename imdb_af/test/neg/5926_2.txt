I have to say, it's not very good. Polly Bergen is good at this movie. The rest is like that. I'm gay and honest, there are so many clichés for this time in history that it's just sad. We started watching and then turned off, and then decided to make fun of the rest of the movie. But everyone said, the basic idea of ​​the movie is good. If it was rewritten with less complicated lines and was better acting, it could actually have been good. I wouldn't recommend it for everything. In addition, this coo coo thinking line is so low. In addition, the battle in the hair salon is funny because it's so bad. The lesbian sister in the room with them trying to tackle it is so weird, it's sad.
