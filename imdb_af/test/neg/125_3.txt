It's an average movie with a few semi-right action sequences that look like the plot, look a little better and remind the viewer of the classic Van Dam movies. parts of the plot do not make sense and appear to be added to use time. the end plot is that of a very basic type that doesn't make the viewer aware and any twists and turns are obviously obvious. the final scene with the batting tricks does not make sense as it is added and looks little relevant to the history of Van Dam's character. Not really worth looking at again, a little disappointed in the end production, although it is clear that it was shot at a low budget, some shots and sections in the movie are of poor quality
