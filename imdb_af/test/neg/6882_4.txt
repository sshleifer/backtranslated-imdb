I must admit, I love horror movies ... especially 80's treasure movies. Hell, I even like cheese like Sleepaway Camp and Night of the Demons. But I didn't think much about this movie. The dead scenes were not very well done, the CGI was terrible, and the acting was ho-hum. The worst of all was the story that didn't make sense at all. I'd say your money is saving, but chances are, if you want to see this movie, you're going anyway. I didn't hate it ... it's just not very good. Overall, it's just another vague, lifeless horror movie that lacks life (it's not surprising that this one was on Dimension's plan for over a year after it's finished).
