Oh, me. Oh, this is a * really * bad movie. The play is absolutely scary, the writing is god-fearing, and photography is simply scary. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie stand out, however, is that you never even care about a single soul - good old or bad guy, life, death or death - throughout the 87 minutes. "Oh, he / she is dead? Huh ... Look, they would" be the best response I could collect after every murder. Characters are so black or white that with the volume turned off, you can still find out who is who. While the cast of the cast had a strange monotonous quality, their faces gave the impression that you were looking at an old silent movie with lots of eyebrows, exaggerated frowns and a painful look. Each character is a humorous, passionate, one-dimensional one-time pony; As soon as they fulfill what their specific role in this fiasco requires of their creation, they are dismissed immediately. <br /> <br /> It made me vague to think what would happen if Thomas Borch Nielsen (director / writer of "Skyggen", American title: "Webmaster") decided to create a low-budget version of " American Psycho "to do and distracted a little under the road. <br /> <br /> It's not a particularly horrible movie; the cold, passionate throw assures it. It's not an offensive movie; the director plays so safe that no one can find it. It's just a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid it. We were not so happy and actually paid to see this bomb on Pay-per-View. As part of my fine, I write this review. <br /> <br /> Enough said.
