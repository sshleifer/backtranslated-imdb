I despise, despise, and hate this movie with a passion that the red hot gates of hell look cold compared. It is nothing but a camping, terrifying and totally unashamed journey to memory lanes after that cute time, the 70s, a decade, I was glad I was not part of whether this absoluteness was all that was offered! <br /> <br /> The animation is sickly dated, not least, because it is tough, missing frames, and characters with large, spherical heads, this film is an eye pain. Knowing, the parents with the freaky gay sea buck, and this is camp hand movements and kenneth williams-esque voice, to the incessant dronklid, High Cockalorum, this movie, I'm sad to say, is one who was a child forced me and I have never fully recovered from the terror that it caused me. <br /> <br /> This terrible display of complete horror must carry an R-rated certificate, so disturbing in its content!
