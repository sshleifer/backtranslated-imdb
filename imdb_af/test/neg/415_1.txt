First, I loved the book, more than the most popular Da Vinci code and although the DVC movie was not well received, I liked it and bought the DVD. However, there is no chance I will ever see the corners and demons again. <br /> <br /> The movie looks scarce like the book, but just the general idea of ​​the story is there. <br /> <br /> From the start of the movie I was disappointed. In the book, Robert Langdon received a call and fax from Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN. Who finds the body of Father (can't remember the name) and then Langdon requests to come with the super fast plane. In the book were the only people who knew about this technology who created the Father and Girls team. and the camero ... In the movie, however, there was a massive team involved ... so the tension was never there ... how did they find out, etc. <br /> <br /> Let it out or change it rather whole part of the story was a big mistake and was in my mind making it a poor movie. It changed everything that happened from then on, when the Camerlingo had to be confronted in the pope's closed room, it had to have been Maximilian Kohler shot the video of his wheelchair, the commander rushed to get the camera lingo, but was shot by Olivetti. In the movie it was the commander in the room and Olivetti was shot ... (I think I'm right, but I was bored and can't really remember the events in the movie) ... <br /> <br /> There was no love interest disputed a Vittoria and Robert and in the book she was not at CERN when he arrived and was indeed flown into her research work. In the book, all four of the preferratti were killed, but in the film the last of the four survived the fountain. In the book Vittoria was kidnapped and Robert had to save her. It was they who murdered the Killer at the Church of the Illuminati, not inflated as he was in the Camerlingo movie. The little where Robert was caught under a stone box was not there, saved by his Mickey Mouse watch alarm. OK in the book we were led to believe that Langdon drove out of the helicopter, justifying saying it was a bit far out, but it was important in the movie because he had to go back with the movie ... There was not mentioning how Vittoria and her adopted father became involved, it was also important to know the character of Vittoria. <br /> <br /> In all the worse movies I saw, I would have left early, but my brain disappeared and I temporarily lost the use of my legs. A really really reeeeeeaaaaaaallly poor effort and none of Ron Howard's finest, in fact, how he'll get work again, is beyond me !!! I want my money back !!!
