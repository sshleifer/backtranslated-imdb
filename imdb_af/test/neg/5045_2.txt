You know that mouthwash commercially where the man has a mouthful of Listerine, or whatever it is and he really tries to keep it from spitting it into the washbasin? This is a great metaphor for this movie. I kept looking, even though it was very difficult. But keeping a mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a slight fresh feeling. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I had to spit it when I had the chance. <br /> <br /> The starting point is wheat enough to be fun. For the first time in a thousand years, Gargoyles has returned to Romania, and all the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things have long since died. It's up to Michael Pare and some other secret agents to go to the bottom of things before the Gargoyles run amok. Unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in bad dialogue and less than enthusiastic about the human lead. The best play is done by CG Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie feels like a poor man's Van Helsing. Looking at your brain at the door can get you through a fraudulent Monday night. I gave it 3 out of 10 stars.
