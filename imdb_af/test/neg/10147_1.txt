Now I saw it all. Just when I thought it couldn't be more pathetic and cheese than "Woodchipper Massacre", just when I thought dialogue and acting couldn't be worse than "Nail Gun Massacre" just when I thought "Don't In The Waan Woods "retains his title as the Lousiest Slasher Movie ever, come along" THE LAST SLUMBER PARTY! "Somehow, this inexpensive, miserable mishap control success, but it remains awful! I couldn't believe my eyes - for once I can't complain about excessive (or in this case any) nudity in a slasher movie, but it still got me embarrassed to rent it. Never before have I seen such a terrible play, dialect, direction, writing. I could go with this list forever! Here's a quick run: <br /> <br /> A mental patient escaping somehow from the loony bin, dressing like a surgeon, finds out in a way where his doctor lives and breaks in while the doctor's daughter friends left over for the night. Then start the most stupid deadly spree (ripped off from other movies like "Slumber Party Massacre" and Halloween ") this side of the universe. The characters have negative IQs, indicating they are not human. Then I think they are again not because they have a tendency to blow up Kool Aid when they cut, as the shooter likes to show when he holds his shoulder to the scene too much on the camera. look at those sheep as it used to be in the whole movie? ... what I was supposed to be is not that bad of an idea in this case! There is one moment I may have thought, maybe the director will make it it was interesting (a second killer was added), but unfortunately it was not to be! And then to insult, there is a stupid, super-cop-out sub-ending and an even more stupid final conclusion Makes a lot of sense, but I hate to have the dumbest few scenes in film history on either or the other ee. Rid foolishly (like me) stupid enough to rent this sewer. <br /> <br /> I hope I saved it for 80 minutes of someone's life. I get on my hands and knees to beg that anyone still consider renting it: PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT! It's a fan of the slasher genre talking; I know what is good for you! The only true victims in this ruthless asinine nonsense are the poor morons who sat all over the toilet tooth! Zanatos score ... since there is no negative point scale, I have to give it a 1, but a lower average 1. Avoid it at all costs .... please !!
