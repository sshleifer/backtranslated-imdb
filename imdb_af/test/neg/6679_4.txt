STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> As a boy, Mark Goddard (C Thomas Howell) was powerless as his family, including his hero-cop-father (Jeff Fahey) was brutally murdered by malicious criminals whom he tried to descend. With an inner desire to punish unjustly those he sustained as a result of this revival, Mark uses harsh means when he enters the suspects and gets in trouble with his superiors. But then he learns from Justice Incorporated, a secret group of men and women led by a mysterious man (Ed Lauter), who serves to issue punishment that suits the crime outside the law. But then things get out of hand and get out of life can be more difficult than he thought. <br /> <br /> The Sweeper has problems with the offset because we've seen exactly the same chart before (and better) in movies like The Star Chamber with Michael Douglas and Magnum Force with Clint Eastwood. The title doesn't make sense either. But we also have to argue with the movie's total ridicule, including a scene where a daughter's headphones can drown out the sound of her family's generation, a final chase with a bad guy starting on the highway, Ending on a Wright Brother Airplane, as well as some of the most ridiculous plays ever made on the screen, and a very sounding, pretentious writing. But there are some cool action sequences here and the movie's unintentional laugh factor definitely keeps it alive with a wrist. **
