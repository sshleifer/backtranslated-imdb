Some unnamed aliens on a distant ship from a distant planet sent the giant robot Kronos to rob the world of his energy. They have a prototype sounded around Mexico for openers and if successful, more will be sent. It will definitely take a lot of time just to do this one Kronos. <br /> <br /> For reasons I can't explain the strangers even the thought of leading scientist, John Emery, who has Kronos at his first goals. Since Emery is later killed and the monster looks good enough without Emery as a controller, why the strangers needed him in the first place, is a bit bizarre. <br /> <br /> Anyway, scientists Jeff Morrow, Barbara Lawrence, and George O'Hanlon working under Emery are not misled about his nature. And of course they come up with a plan to deal with the furious metal giant. <br /> <br /> Kronos is a perfect movie for the fifties, the bad guys are never seen, they are just out there to undermine humanity. . It's a perfect movie for the Cold War. And Jeff Morrow assures us that we will be ready for them in the future. <br /> <br /> The players seem to have had a great time, and so many click cards that writers could put into writing. I get the impression that Kronos is the kind of movie Ed Wood did on a bigger budget, with a little more care.
