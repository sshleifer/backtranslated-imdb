Please - if you did not try to put this garbage on and consider seeing this movie / mini-series - do yourself a favor and find anything else to do. Floss your teeth, start learning to play the cello, beat your dog - anything you choose will spend time better than watching this litter. It's not a bad movie you can get - it just sucks in every way. Just boring from start to finish. <br /> <br /> And for those animal lovers out there, my comments above are insensitive. If your dog can talk, he or she will beg to rather beat than to look through. this mess.
