The depiction of Ichabod Crane's character was so incredibly unlikely, my wife and I hoped that the rider (or any other character) would not only cut Crane's head, but do it slowly and painfully. <br /> <br /> I mean this Brent Carver man played it over --- as he was on Broadway. And he was such a ruthless fox that we didn't have any sympathy for him. <br /> <br /> I could go on with specific criticism about how this movie failed, but I prefer not to use the energy. <br /> <br /> Just skip it and go for the Johnny Depp version. Either it's either renting the Ghost Pumpkin from Sleepy Cave (animated). It's pretty good - entertaining for kids and adults. <br /> <br /> Better still, read Washington's original story.
