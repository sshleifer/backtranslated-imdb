I was in Barstow Ca. in 1968 when the movie The Killers Three arrived at the local theater. The trailer was enough to get me to pay my hard earned money to see this movie. I really expected a Bonnie And Clyde movie and I had Dick Clark a shy, naughty man while Robert Walker and Diane Varsi made a poor effort to put Bonnie and Clyde out. Needless to say it never went well. Maybe that's why it never made it for video. Even as a kid, I left a little that was ripped off when I left the theater. After all the best parts in the trailer of the movie. The movie was boring and pretty much pointless. By the way, Dick Clark is murdered, so it wasn't a total deviation.
