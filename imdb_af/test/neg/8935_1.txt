At the Beaverview Cheerleading camp, the good-good two shows, the Lucky Ducks cheerleading team has to talk to The Demons' "bad" bad girl cheerleading team to win the deadly Falcon team that always look in this camp. This is a typical clich√©d '80s teenage (lame) sex comedy that you think will win? But what the film lacks in originality makes it more than mere horror. Oh and bad bad dance numbers and the compulsory Japanese businessmen who want to buy the camp (provided the male leader, Tommy Hamilton, of course stays at the camp). Simply awful, forgetful, and unfortunately a surprising lack of nudity. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: HBO Comedy <br /> <br /> My Degree: F (Yes, I did give it to them)
