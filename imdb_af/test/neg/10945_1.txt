Now, I love the Bollywood movies and I am very happy that they have recently succeeded in the UK. Suneel Darshan's latest attempt, however, is a deeply flawed movie from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a modern Bollywood performance on Amadeus was quite an exciting one, until the two supposed "musicians" appeared At the scene, they seem to have never been a piece of manuscript in their lives touched. Upen Patel is a very nice man, and the film plays its narcissistic sensitivity, but it is never once credible as a modern Mozart. In terms of acting, everything he can do is stand there and pout. His expressions, hair and clothes all look the same throughout, including the scene where he is supposedly "dead," when in reality he has nothing but a slight sniff. Bobby Deol, who plays the role of Salieri, does his best to live the little wood out there, but just as angry as he has to fumble with jealousy. <br /> <br /> Bollywood movies are widely known for their beautiful set pieces and color schemes, but Shaklaka looks like a dramatic BBC drama reproduction. In fact, the closest thing Shakalaka comes to is Hollyoaks, as it blatantly hides a very bad manuscript behind the beautiful people, good, beautiful. "He hasn't yet achieved mediocrity" - the same can be said for the completely forgetful songs. <br /> <br /> In short, Darshan's latest offering has no buzz, bang, mural or compulsion. Instead, it just sits with its head, and doesn't like getting your attention with a soft tap on the shoulder. And it's not good enough at all.
