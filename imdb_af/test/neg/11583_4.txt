Nothing will ever shrink KOMODO with the gorgeous Jill Hennessey (!), But KvC isn't quite as bad as I expected for a SYFY channel. Just make sure to watch it while it is drunk or stoned, or while trying to sleep. The unimaginable title basically says it all: A group of mostly unknown actors come together on an island where a government's experiment to grow giant vegetables has gone wrong. Giant creatures that came into contact with the vegetables took the island and ate it all. So now the government is preparing to inflate the island, regardless of the people there. The play is terribly fearful, especially a mustache general straight from the UNREHOLD TV series, but this is typical of this cable cable. The CGI creatures are on TV-level quality, which means you know cartoon monsters. However, two of the gals in the group are very cute and worth watching while running here and there in their tight little outfits. You just want to upload them!
