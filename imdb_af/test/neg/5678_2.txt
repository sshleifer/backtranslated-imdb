I was a great "SNL" fan back in the days of Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, Gilda Radner and many other memorable stars. But every time I tried it for more than ten years, I was very disappointed and sometimes even disgusting about it. Ten years ago I believed that the show might not have survived, as it became so much of the kind of humor I could understand, and yet it kept me upset and wondered how in the world somebody Can't find his lame humor at all. When I agreed in the past decade, I was never once glad that I did. Indeed, I have always annoyed myself to relax my time. For me, the absolute low point came a few years ago when a popular young male actor I liked was the host. At that stage he played a big star, perhaps himself, and in the shit the character "Mongo", which I think, played by Chris Kattan, thought I was finally sitting in the back of a car locked with him. What followed was Mongo up and down and on and on the actor's lap, shouting with him hysterically as he was presumably sodomized. The audience laughed and I shook my head, surprised that they could find it in a remote way, surprised that NBC would even broadcast something like that. In the years since, I have repeatedly tried to approach the show with an open mind, hoping to regain the sensible sense of humor I have been worshiping for so many years. But until a week ago it didn't do for me. Not even close. One exception: During the 2008 presidential campaign, I thought Tina Fey was fantastic, and she was the one artist who loved me. But the Sarah Palin sketch, while hysterical, was not enough to save the rest of the 90 minutes. and I will always regret not eliminating it as soon as I get the famous "It's" Saturday Night !!! have not heard "
