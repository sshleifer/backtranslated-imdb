Luchino Visconti was, and is, one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation, but Adam Low (the director of this thing) allowed the stronger vote to be Helmut Berger's! How can this be? What a missed opportunity! We come from this trial and know less about what the Master has made great and more about the things we do not have to give. The beautiful images belong to Visconti's world, embarrassing interviews with those like Berger and Zeffirelli to Adam Low's small world. A must to avoid!
