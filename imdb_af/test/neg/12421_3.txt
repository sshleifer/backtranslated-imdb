Wild Rebels are badly fun, but also frustrating because of the real good, or at least workable, elements of the story. It's about a racing car driver (Steve Alaimo) who gets into a group of bikers called Satan's Angels, who hang around a lot until they decide to rob a bank. Meanwhile, Alaimo is also being appointed by the police to report to them on what the Angels are and where to rob them next. It is not even that the movie really is too dated, although it obviously carries the considerable rough and silly music in the film (from the band on stage in one scene), to "perform" Alaimo if you can call that jerk , to the ordinary generic count). <br /> <br /> It's just that the filmmaker doesn't care to give a little more logic, direction and better actors to the parts. As I did, I didn't have a great dislike of the movie, as I did with the Hellcats, but it left me almost indifferent. What can be unpredictable comes only through stupid things like the name of the Florida village ('Citrusville' ho-ho). It is therefore not entirely indefensible because of its Mystery Science Theater 3000 status. The commentary is good on the movie, even if I would hardly hear one or two almost what the characters said on the screen if it might be worth it. Wild Rebels can be more of a good time if you have a six-pack and low expectations, but as it is, I won't see it again.
