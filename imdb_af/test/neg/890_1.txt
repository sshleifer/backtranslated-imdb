To watch this movie, just ask: What do they think? There are so many peculiarly bad parts of this movie, you may feel it deliberately poor, like a joke. <br /> <br /> I think the worst part of the movie is directing. There are so many bad uses of camera angles and other movie elements in this nice movie. The funniest example of this will be where the party guests receive their invitations by email. The same camera angle is used for each shot (which holds an uncomfortable 2 seconds each) and the same computer screen appears with the same desktop / window / program etc. It even looks like the thing is being shot at the same set every time. The whole series was also completely quiet, with no music or sound effects. Overall, it was a bad way to convey the idea that an email was sent all over town. <br /> <br /> Now listening, you can see that the music looks the same as other movie soundtracks. This is no surprise. Most songs, including the one opening the movie, are actually minor changes from other movie scores (see if you can guess which one). I also noticed that the music is not played by a real band. It sounds like it's written and played through a low-end midi keyboard. If you are familiar with the LucasArts SCUM adventure games, the timbre of every instrument sounds like something from the IMUSE engine. <br /> <br /> Everything else about the movie is just sucking. The acting is terrible. The writing is derivative (Ferris Beuller?). There is no joke in the remotely funny movie, unless you see the whole movie as one big joke, played on a paying audience. Don't rent it. Don't even see if it comes central to the comedy. Just forget about it - it's terrible.
