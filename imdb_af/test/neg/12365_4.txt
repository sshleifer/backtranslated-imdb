With David Arquette facing you, it will immediately be a stupid movie. Well, it's a silly movie with a terrible script. But the F / X, namely the eight-legged freaks, makes this movie a breeze to watch. A tribute, albeit stupid, to the great mutant creatures of the fifties. Arquette and Sheriff Sam (Kari Wuhrer) called in to fight the poisonous waste-induced giant spiders that caused their devastation in their small Arizona town. Also in the film are Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton, Leon Rippy and the beautiful Scarlett Johansson.
