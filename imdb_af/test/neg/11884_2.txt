My wife and I couldn't even finish the movie. Surely it was quite painful. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the historical accuracy is not so much compromised by the events themselves as the ridiculous one-dimensionality of the characters. For example, August takes the "burden" of power only with great reluctance. Indeed, he is portrayed as being some great humanistic and believer in democracy. <br /> <br /> Second, the camp! My lord, the dialogue is terribly bad. I remember the soap that my mother watched when I was a kid who had a better dialogue. The constant outline and pontificating stir on the ears like fingernails on the board. Ugh. (Okay, I'm exaggerating a little, but the dialogue is really bad.) The HBO series is for no other reason better, but its characters were at least credible, regardless of their historicity. <br /> <br /> Rome was also wise enough to know they couldn't set up epic battle scenes. The creators of this movie did not. When the Emperor Munda attacks, the battle scene is almost farkish. <br /> <br /> I will allow the costumes to be perfectly good. The sets are good, although their CGI wallpapers can sometimes be a bit. The sound is bad, though? Both in terms of the music, the fool work and the dubbing of so many of the characters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's not worth the rent. As a head of history, I was hoping for an alternative approach to August as HBO's Rome, which, I believe, did not achieve its overall "feel", as well as what they did Caesar or Antonie. Instead, I just had to hold onto my reading.
