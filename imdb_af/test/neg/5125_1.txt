I am a dance teacher and looking forward to good dance routines in this movie. How sad to have such a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I had a lot of trouble with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely repulsive. Beals's face is so young, sweet and innocent, and it's very uncomfortable with Alex's very disturbing resentment, especially in the disgusting restaurant. She also has a toddler's temper tantrums. It is very hard to believe that Nick will return to such a friendly teenager after her regular ravages and ravages, especially after opening the door of a moving car and choosing a stylet from him. He prefers to go home - in the middle of the road - with just one shoe !!!. And how about her idiotic behavior after night at the ballet. In fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - the 30-year-old man goes to a girl who looks around 16. <br /> <br /> As far as the dance is concerned, I'm afraid this 80's style is totally dated. What on earth was that TV dance series in the club? Who was supposed to dance? I wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in tow! And even the well-known final series is pretty disappointing, especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. The camera shots of her jump actually ruin this is the effect because you can't see what she is doing. And what on earth did she do when she passed each of the panels? And so many other comments pointed out, she would never enter a ballet company on the strength of the audition. Perhaps it's actually not at the end of her choice whether she was successful or not, the closure being the fact that she eventually conquered her fear. Of the 'Flashdancers' I actually thought was the best order of Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You can see that she was a true dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is of course if you can come alongside her terrible costume and makeup. <br /> <br /> There were two good pieces in this movie - the ballet dancers stretch when Alex first goes to apply for an audition - they look so nice and attractive, and at least that helps the difference to underline between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. The other good scene was breaking into the street. I also loved the parents of the skaters, they were funny. <br /> <br /> Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex get to know her? What was an 18 year old who lived alone in a converted warehouse? How did she afford that beautiful bar and all the furniture? Where was her family? Was that scene really needed in the 'naked club'? The person who wrote in their comment that it is something like a Disney movie should investigate their head. And anyway, what happened to the ice skating? <br /> <br /> Many people said the movie was poor, but they liked the message - don't give up, keep trying, and your dreams will come true. See "The Little Mermaid" earlier.
