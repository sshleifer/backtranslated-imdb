I was furious with girlish glee when I soon found out about this movie after seeing Spirits Within. <br /> <br /> After years of anticipation, they released November 2005. Well, November has come. And go. As a result, through December. Oh, look, today January 31, 2006. No US version of now. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I'm so glad I had a friend with a subordinate caption copy. ; D <br /> <br /> Well, the CG was great. Not as good as expected, but close to perfect. However, I clipped the unnatural movements the children made through the whole movie. I thought we had passed it now. Also, I didn't really care about watching the anime given to their faces. I was under the impression that they were shooting for a realistic look at the movie, yet most characters have bigger eyes than eyes, especially the girl characters. They had personality, but I will give it to them. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not a big fan of anime, I have to say I was impressed with the wild fight scenes. They were beautifully animated and hung on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> For about the first two. <br /> <br /> And here lies Advent Children's biggest mistake. It is mostly just a lot of hypermarket scenes. <br /> <br /> For years, an FF7 successor to epic relationships has been promised. Instead, they gave us a nice piece of cg, barely a plot to just let it run under two hours of running. <br /> <br /> Where Final Fantasy is known for its intricate stories, this movie falls short. You don't really know the characters. The only way you would have understood most of what happened in the movie would have been if you played the game. We barely got them before they challenged them with any current threat. <br /> <br /> What hurt the fans even more is the terrible cameos that most FF7 characters have given. They were nothing more than Cloud's. "I'll call if I need you, but I'll probably not work back singers. And, to add to the hurt, they threw each character individually higher and higher. This little part here was so cute, I almost switched it off. I would have been much more impressed if he just jumped on his own, got away from the walls to get himself higher. <br /> <br /> It suffered even more when they lowered the Turks. Just comic relief. It was good for the game, but it's cinema. People do not act like cartoon characters in a hard fight. They took away their dignity: / <br /> <br /> And spoiler (yes right, most of you probably know anyway). Who remembers that Darth Maul is included in the SW: Hip-up: Episode 1? Yes, now, picture it, but with Sephiroth. That's right. He might have had 5 minutes of screen time. Maybe so. End Spoiler: P <br /> <br /> If this movie is made for fans, then the way to go Square. If this is an indication of the direction in which you take the FF series, I doubt you will see much of my money. I played your games for the wonderful story and the excellent characters. <br /> <br /> You had a chance to make something epic. Something really beautiful, a masterpiece flying in the face of all the Disney CG movies. <br /> <br /> Instead, you gave us a nice piece of meat, with almost nothing to keep it together. Away to go. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure the rest of the fans stopped for a moment and just tried to pay attention to everything except the CG, they wanted to know what I'm talking about. Well, I'm going to rate it a 5/10, but after considering it, I give it a 3/10 because they could have done better. They did better. And it's just sad. <br /> <br /> If they are going to rebuild any FFVII, they must first do this one.
