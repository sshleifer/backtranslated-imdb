Not really so much on this movie ... either a stunt racer or a cattle racing racer has a flame engine in the beginning of the movie, goes to the bar, is approached by a gangster who ruins his chances with a very lovely woman , offer him a job, go back to their place, refuse, police ask him to accept you go! What spells out is a very annoying little film that the hero sees, not really so much and a bitch that can kill and for some reason police can't spray a crime on them. I'm not sure why the female cyclist did what she did at the end, but hey it's a bad movie, you always get scenes that make little sense. I still try to find out if I misunderstand it when they say the hero of the piece was a stunt driver. They might have said a motor vehicle driver, because why a stunt runner would be racing and I don't think it would be so unusual for a stunt car to crash. The actors are bad, and all the cyclists are pretty annoying and the hero is incompetent ... really this movie is not full of kicks, but it's the pits.
