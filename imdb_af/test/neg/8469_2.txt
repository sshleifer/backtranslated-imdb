I found this movie very interesting, but a little scratched, it is talking about violence and what is happening, I still don't see the point of becoming terrorists to stop the terrorists. We have similar people in the United States and other countries justifying the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right. Think of the Puritans, and the Christian crusades against the Islamic people during the Middle Ages. Many blood and deaths that exceed the violence of today have negatively impacted the Western world on religion. I do not justify their actions, but Western culture in the past had a very negative impact on some. But remember the majority of Islamic people are satisfying! People of any nation feel some kind of patriotism, but to start a war on being right and reconsidering your wrong. Again, I repeat that you cannot stop terrorists by becoming like them.
