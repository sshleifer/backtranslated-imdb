I was so excited to see the movie in this movie that I was completely surprised at how completely wrong this movie was. I love John Voight, but I have no idea what took possession of this travesty. The biblical accuracy was not at all and I could honestly not watch the movie with my children. My children are surprised because they even know that Lot didn't even think when Noah built the ark. I think NBC should be ashamed of themselves to enable producers to make a mockery of the Word and cause even more confusion in a world that hardly knows the truth as it is ... Please don't buy this movie !!! I considered burning my copy, but I have every intention of writing the producers and sending them the Scripture references that they had to read before making this movie !!!
