The boys were the most enjoyable things in the whole movie. the girls were lame and pathetic, i mean, how can they make their own clothes line, dolls, movies, studios and not smell this bomb from afar? In order to get some kind of responsibility, which I don't really see the sentence in punishment ... they are sent to Paris, far from home to live with the so-called strict grandfather who has an important status with Paris. I can't really remember what he was, so who really cares? the detail does not help, the girls are sent to Paris to learn something .. so, what do they learn exactly when they meet two French boys and manipulate the man they were supposed to watch so they can meet these guys on scooters? The typical pre-teen movie, with all the pre-teens who want to be improper and can afford the trip to Paris or a distant country of parents? I don't really like the olsen, they can never shake off the image of Michelle at full house. If you didn't see it, then you were happy from the beginning. (F F-)
