Michael Caine usually appears in very good ("Blame It On Rio", "Sleuth", "Without A Clue", "Gambit", "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels") or really bad comedies ("Noises Off", "Harry" & Walter Go to NY ") This falls into the latter category. <br /> <br /> TA is a two-story comedy: managing a role that includes Caine, Gambon and Richardson, all of which achieve comic skills and succeed in making Mission not to laugh the viewer.There is not a very funny moment here.The main reason is the lousy script; there were so many useless attempts to write an inexorable story that is simple difficult to follow (it's just a comedy) that the writer forgot to make the damn thing funny which, as far as I can remember, is what the whole point of a comedy is supposed to be. > <br /> I've never seen this Moron, some say even if you're a Moron fan, you'll love this blah blah. roving person really fans? A comedy written so badly because it requires a mega-talent to make a laugh or two of it, someone like Steve Coogan and not your average Moron. <br /> <br /> If you are going to make a comedy About the actors, they make at least the extreme morons they usually are. The characters of Caine and Moron are insufficiently stupid. <br /> <br /> The single most annoying thing about this dirt collection is the little girl. Just a really horrible writer will think it is a wise script to include a super-intelligent way of donkey. Smart-a ** children aren't even funny to Bill Cosby fans. In "Little Miss Sunshine" we had a completely normal child and she was very funny. This stupid uncle-the-child-smarter-than-the-adult shtick belongs to a century-old Marx brother movie.
