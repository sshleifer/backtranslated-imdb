At least some of the sitcoms knocking endlessly out of the US are honestly bad. However, this litter shows a "heart-warming" side to a clothing horse. Convenient with nice "learned" with cans and phrases presented in the "I'm so important and thin and beautiful" fashion. In the episode, I just confused, someone's "work" was in danger simply because a colleague placed a phone call, which turned off her abilities ... !! Really, it's the lowest of the layers. What kind of damage does it cause to the looking masses, as only glittering glam-puss people distort "work". Completely ill. When the titles rolled, I thought it was good for the boys. You know who you are.
