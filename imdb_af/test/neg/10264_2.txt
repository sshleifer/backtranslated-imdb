This movie SUCKS !! They seem to have chosen to place screens randomly. Good gore, but small plot. Sally whispers and complains about everything until she becomes a devil. I figured she had PMS. That was probably the case. The dubbing in this movie is terrible. One scene the woman speaks and a few seconds before we hear any sound. I knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the US. I tried to follow, but disappeared about halfway through it and found it very hard to believe, even for a horror movie. Some good characters, but not many. Not worth wasting your time.
