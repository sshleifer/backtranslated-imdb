Together with the super-sleazy classic THE TOOLBOX MURDERS (1978), it is considered the ultimate bad Cameron Mitchell horror attempt. It's a little too slow for my taste, it has zero fun characters in it and not much action to the end, but Mitchell's dedicated central psychic performance as revenge-sensitive cheek, Vincent Rinard, is fun. Not Anthony Perkins good, but you're definitely having fun. As a ghost of the Hollywood levels, it's just like that; As a horror movie, it is just fair as well. And just as a simple vintage exploitation, it's just OK. I am a huge fan of the unnecessary free dance series, so I was also grateful for the appearance of the Gazzarri dancers, who just reign. Five of them do a crazy hair-thrashin ', floor-slidin', hip-shaking 'go-go dance routine' Do not Cry, Look For the Rainbow 'by the T-Bones. Looking at these ladies, bouncing with big smiles on their faces in their bikini top and parachute trousers ensemble, is a decisive reason why I give it a slightly higher rating than usual. <br /> <br /> Former film-making man Vincent Rinard ("The best since Lon Chaney!") goes to people at Paragon Studios. A look back shows how Max Black (Berry Kroeger), a jealous and drunk studio executive, threw away wine in Vinnie's face when he was about to burn a smoke. He swallows in flames and dives into a swimming pool, but not in front of one side of his face and loses an eyeball (not to mention his common sense). Vincent is currently using a special serum (described as a mixture of truth serum, nerve medicine and special vitamins and minerals ... Look out of Center!) Up to the world-famous Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, California. paralyzed victims. They disappear and the dense detectives on the case (led by Scott Brady) act as "new" statues in the museum. Vince talks to himself ("I'm a very nice man!"), Chain smoke, mumbles, hoists and describes how he gets "excited" by the sound of a woman's scream. <br /> <br /> He also has to deal with a bunch of stiff rags and self-absorbed witches, most of which will earn what comes to them. There is also Nick (Hollis Morrison), a fascinating, turbulent museum guide who shines a 'statue', but does not go to the police. Aside from Max (a true Grade A count ... who doesn't even die!) And the stupid cops, the other two main roles are women and both are very horrible. Marie Morgan (Anne Helm) is not your typical innocent heroine; This tramp is no less than five different characters in this movie (!), Including Vince, Max and two of the wax dummies / missing male stars engaged (I think she never had time to make a turn at the one missing girl). For some reason she also begs Vince in her annoying baby voice to give her a copy of the head that he designed from the latest missing actor (and fiance number 5) Tony Deen (Phillip Baird). She does not know that Vince has already had a syringe in his neck, but I love it if Mitchell agrees dryly with her claims "so you can come back completely for reality." He also wants her to "mail" him, which means she is finally caught in a box. Unfortunately, the box has a hole where her head pierces, so we must be constantly assaulted by her high-profile cheeks. <br /> <br /> The other "woman" is Theresa (Victoria Carroll), one of the aforementioned go-go girls. She first saw that she was thoroughly rhythm-deficient by jumping on stage in a lime-green-fringe bikini. Theresa is tolerant before she speaks, but if you realize her eager presence, Lorraine Bracco's sloppy combination combines with the Landers sisters' airline mentality, wishing Vincent injects her with the serum as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we are first exposed to a scene of her making endless demands on the studio head honcho and running around in the museum to avoid Mitchell. She and the rest of the characters are totally unsympathetic, but function as a way to make fun of the Hollywood system in general, I think. And I probably give this movie more credit than it actually deserves. The pluses are few and far between, but include (except Mitchell and the dance routine), colorful, slightly stylized lighting and a bizarre ending that Rinard is severely punished for his crimes by spending the rest of his life. his own personal hell ... Married to Marie! ... Yes, now it's scary. <br /> <br /> Also in the film is director John "Bud" Cardos (also the production manager) as a police officer, James Forrest as film director, Virgil Frye as an image, Rini Martin and Kent Osborne as a bartender . Many of the people who worked on this one (also executive producer and writer Rex Carlton) also worked on the Al Adamson movie BLOOD OR DRACULA'S CASTLE and other atrocities. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 out of 10
