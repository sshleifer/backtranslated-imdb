Last night I sat in my TV room, beer in hand, a bowl of pretzels on the TV slide and I decided to put the movie "Monster Man" in my reliable video recorder. Expecting a fun, gory, crash & bash cheesefest from a movie. What do I get instead? One of the most stupid, stupid, fearless and predictable movies I've ever had the dissatisfaction to go through. And what's worse, all during the (and I use this next phrase loosely) "sex scene" the girl keeps all her clothes on! I will make this summary short and sweet: mix 'Dude Where's My Car' with a very watery "Hitcher", add a redneck version of the "I Madman" antagonist as the primary villain and finally some incoherent black magical mumbo jumbo and you will get an idea of ​​how far this movie is. It is also completely predictable. The only noteworthy factor for this girl movie disguised as a "horror movie" is that some of the moments between the 2 guys (though the "hero" is one big annoying geek and the other is a Jack Black clone), is funny (just moderately funny, like most of the SNL sketches). Other than that, "Monster Man" is a monster mess! 3/10 (This one I will hand out at Halloween - just hope after the person sees it, I don't get my house eggs or worse)
