I am a big Zack Allan fan and was disappointed that he had only one scene in the movie. It was also my favorite scene where he took a character's weapons and directed her to Down Below. Unfortunately, unlike Thirdspace & River of Souls, most of the station's action took place. I didn't organize much for Garibaldi after the first three seasons and think Sheridan is ok but not Sinclair. I like Lochley, but she only had limited screen time. If you like Crusade or Space Fight, you should enjoy it. Personally, I can only give it 1/10.
