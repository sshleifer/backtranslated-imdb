What do Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. Do this? Light It Up is a ridiculous melodramatic piece about low income area problems. While the subject is one to be addressed, the movie uses each click in the genre and comes out as a textbook popcorn movie. The characters are carved out of the inner version of The Breakfast Club or even the Faculty. Watch it with your kids when they are 13 or 14. With them, it can be an outcome for a lesson on current social problems. For anyone older, it will be nothing more than watching and spitting at 4 in the morning, as I did recently at Bravo. Facts, what did it do on Bravo?
