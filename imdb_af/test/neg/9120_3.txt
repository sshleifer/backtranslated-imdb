I suggest that if you have already seen the original American graffiti, you will not see this movie. If you didn't see the original, I still don't recommend it, but it would be much less painful to watch. The characters of the first movie are great, and by the end you had a connection with them. This movie shows how bad their lives have become. It's a choir to watch! <br /> <br /> Again in New Year's Eve in 1964, 65, 66 and 67, we have four stories about the characters of the first movie. In '64, we have John Milner (Paul Le Mat) who is now a professional drag carrier. He meets a strange girl Eva, and although his plot doesn't really go anywhere, it's the best of the four. In 1965 we got Toad (Charles Martin Smith) stuck in Vietnam, and more than anything he wanted. He tries to find ways to hurt himself or do stupid things to come out. In '66 we got Debbie (Candy Clark), the girl who picked Toad in the first movie. Now she is a pot that smokes a hippie, and I'm really not sure what her plot is about. It was her going to a concert ... not much of anything happened. Lastly, in 1967, Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) and Laurie Bolander (Cindy Williams) had marital problems ending in an anti-war rally and police action. <br /> <br /> None of these stories are very good. The script in some parts contains very, very bad dialogue. These poor characters I enjoyed so much in the first movie ended up where they were ... why? Why was this follow-up made? I think as a successor, it had to include the Vietnam War and hippies and police action, but the real thing is that this movie should not be made. <br /> <br /> The direction was stylish, but it only comes in a big headache. Each story has a different style. Milner's is just a regular (depending on how you see it) wide screen, and is filmed how the rest of the movie should be. Toad's plot is shot in 16mm, and it's a poor picture, which is the size of a small box in the center of the screen. Debbie's plot was shot in a multi-screen. At one point there might be one screen, but for the good majority it is anywhere from two to twenty screens at a time. Don't bother to follow the screens as nothing happens. Steve and Laurie's plot has the strangest filming style. It's style really means nothing and is stupid and useless. Instead of just a complete widescreen, it's a shortened widescreen that looks like a full-screen widescreen version. Although I do not like the others, I at least understand what they are going, this one just doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> The music is the movie's saving grace, not that it can save it. ! Bob Dylan, Simon and Grafunkel, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and dozens of others have good songs that appear here. They don't save the feature, they just make it a little better than it is. It's still bad! <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a senseless sequel. Any fan of the original should avoid this dull sequel! <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 from ****. 110 minutes. PG for language use, drug use and violence
