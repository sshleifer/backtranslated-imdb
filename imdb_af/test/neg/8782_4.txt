The unprecedented origin of the Lone Ranger. It shows who he was and how and why he became the Ranger. <br /> <br /> Legendary bomb. The idea was not bad - rediscover and introduce the Lone Ranger for the 1980s. Right of the bat, though there were problems. The studio ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to appear anywhere the Lone Ranger. This led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. I know of people who refused to watch the movie because of how Moore was treated. They also hired the awesomely untalented Klinton Spilsbury to play the Ranger. Spilsbury was very beautiful and muscular, but had absolutely no charisma and could not act. In fact, his entire vocal performance was reaffirmed by another actor! Also, she did not help off-screen antics (public drunkenness and beat people). Because of the action, the writing is vague and slow. Also the Ranger itself does not arrive up to an hour! There were a few complaints when the movie was too violent for a PG. But I don't think it was that bad. <br /> <br /> There are a few (very few) things done here - photography was really beautiful; Michael Horse was excellent as Tonto; Christopher Lloyd is fun as the villain and when the Lone Ranger finally arrives (with William Tell Overture coming out of the soundtrack), it's really exciting. But it's a tedious and awful attempt to bring the Lone Ranger back. It's easy to see why it bombarded. A 4 - mostly for photography.
