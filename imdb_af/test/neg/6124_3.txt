The dominant conflict is between some good actors (Huppert and Dutronc) and the terrible writing. Apparently, the actors were lost, as director / screenwriter Claude Chabrol eventually forced the leading couple to follow this worthless piece of imagination. Fortunately, the powerful performances of Huppert and Dutronc dramatically improve the overall quality of the movie, which miraculously improves the depth and humor. Regarding Chabrol's persistence to keep the film immaculate and illogical, the climax of the final scene, which is so incredibly poor, reaches out to you wondering which pills he took himself while directing it.
