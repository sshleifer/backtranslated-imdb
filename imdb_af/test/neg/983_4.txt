This movie would have been good, and probably excellent, if the directors had left the interviews and the concert material separately. "Into the Void" is a good song, and I hate to cut it off in the best way to get a mumble interview with Ozzy Osbourne. It should have been at the end of the movie, or in a special feature. The best part of concert DVDs is to turn them on and play the music, but "Black Sabbath: The Last Supper" is hard to play and simple to play because the music is constantly interrupted. Yet there are some strengths for this movie; The concert material, when it plays, is excellent. Black Sabbath returns to stage after a long break without Osbourne and this film holds it well: Sabbath basically hides supporters. Of course, the fans have a sweet advantage in the movie because of course they see the tape live, but they also do not have to solve the incessant interviews the DVD viewers have loaded. Sorry for Jeb Brien and Monica Hardiman (the directors) to make it to the movie! Also scan Wyatt Smith to change the movie.
