I realize this is a small statistical sampling (8 votes from this post), but 5.9 out of 10? I give this movie a 3 and even that is generous. I tried to watch this movie three times (the Saturday evening at 9:00 am, the premiere on SciFi Channel, and the Saturday night at 1:00 and Thursday night retransmissions) and I have slept three times before the movie ends. That leaves me with a laundry list of unanswered questions. For example, is Lance Henriksen trapped for cash he must keep playing, supporting roles in this god-fearing "Pumpkinhead" order? Is Henriksen contractually forbidden to do any non-Pumpkinhead movies? Can't the creators of this franchise do better than a monster resembling a geriatric, vast 'Alien' running like a stick, she caught a **? When will the characters in this movie realize that handguns and guns do not hurt the Pumpkinhead? Why don't they try to upload another stick, this thing is a ** instead? And finally, the authors of this movie have been challenged so creatively that they can't find the names of the two fathers' families that are more original than the Hatfields and McCoys? While you're on it, why not write a fictional president's script and call him George Bush? One day I can have the mental endurance to watch this movie completely without sleeping out. Until then, if anyone has the answers, please let me know.
