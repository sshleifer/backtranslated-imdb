This movie was really painful for me to watch. I understand that movies do not have the same sources as other mainstream movies. But there are basic elements of film making that you usually want to meet. First, jump tracks. There are many in the opening of the film 15 minutes. There are shots showing that two separate tasks of the same shot have been edited together. What I mean by this is a character will take half a line of the one, and the rest of the line is of a different kind. Secondly, the dialogue. I understand that many writers strive for a very realistic and true dialogue for their films. Because this film is very specific to its location, the dialogue must also be spoken in a specific tone (for example, a movie in Boston, but people use west coast hose with a Chicago accent). Even by understanding it, it is still difficult to put some of the lines that these actors present. These are just the two most lively issues I experienced with this movie. There were a few others. I don't want to sound like a hard critic who knows nothing. I have had years of experience in the film (more importantly the low budget in film). I also understand that with many directors there is often a method for their madness. I couldn't find this method used in this movie. It makes it hard to decide if I see this film as an example of unique style in filmmaking, or just a low budget, poorly composed movie. I honestly hope it is not the latter. If anyone has an idea of ​​why things have been done in a certain way, or any thoughts or views of their own regarding this movie, I'd love to hear it. Hopefully I can understand this movie more and my current opinion can be changed.
