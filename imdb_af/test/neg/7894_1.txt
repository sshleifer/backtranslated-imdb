With terrible movies, as this one is even considered, let alone make it, it is very easy to see why Hollywood is so difficult with bad plots and worse remakes all the time. <br /> <br /> I think the viewer is supposed to make their backs laugh about the 'black' jokes, the 'pimped up' and the 'Bling'. It's so amazing 'over' and so bad that it even past the 'So bad it's funny again' and plunged into 'totally embarrassing for anyone involved.' <br /> <br /> I'm very, very sorry for every minute I wasted on this one. I want my time back! <br /> <br /> Save yourself the fear, don't look at it. The only reason I give 1 point in the rating is that 0 was not an option.
