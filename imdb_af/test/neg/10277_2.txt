It is difficult to make a negative statement here after all these miracles about how great deeds are, how wonderful the actors did, and so on. I didn't like the movie. this is crazy! <br /> <br /> There are orgies, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister sex, brother-brothers sex, sex on drugs, sex without drugs, sex, sex, sex seem to govern their world.I think the director desperately needs a dismissal.) The story is just dirty and shy. I wonder what the people made up with this story. and above all: who cares? <br /> <br /> The technical stuff didn't satisfy me either. the sound is poor, so is the editing and the direction is absent. the actors are good, but guess what! it's their job! their job is to act! No need to jump from your seats if an actor did a decent job. Applause you when a bus driver brings you safely home? see? <br /> <br /> I gave it 2/10 because after all, this thing had something I couldn't put into words. b movie charm? camp fun? Nudity? I do not know.
