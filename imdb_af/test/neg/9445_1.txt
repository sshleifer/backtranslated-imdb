I have to say this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I can't believe I lost $ 10 at a blockbuster; this movie has to be burned and anyone who has ever thought of it has problems. Who actually spent money making this movie was insane = D This movie has TERRIBLE actors and some of the screens make absolutely no sense. Well, the whole movie doesn't make sense. Also the part where these "men" are coming to dinner (department of national bonds) which was the worst part of the film. How dare they call Frank Sinatra's name in vain? Also, what's with the glasses? When the man and the girl are in the car and she drinks water, you can tell that she doesn't even drink! Also, that goes with the freaky dinner guy. And everyone knows you don't tire, you cut them.
