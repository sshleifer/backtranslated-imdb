the actors can't act. all dialogue was plagued with bad accent and loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression ... EVER. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new. A little out of the street becomes involved in a professional world of dance and it changes his life. This, along with the entire incident involving the little child, is taken straight from You Got Served and the last dance store (I don't say that those movies were good, but that's to say that this movie is nothing new to the movie). brought table). <br /> <br /> And the dance ... There were only 3 dance sections in the whole movie and 2 of them were straight from the commercial. Perhaps I'm too critical because I'm a dancer, but maybe that's what needs to be heard. Channing Tatum is NOT in any way a b-son. his small solo on the parking lot had little style, technique or any wow factor, all of which are part of a street dancer's criteria. All the jazz and ballet in the movie has nothing to offer except the bad technique and some acceptable twirls, but nothing more. the grande finale made me think ... "OK, now they're going to be serious" all the way through the end when I realize it will never happen. <br /> <br /> I admit I'm sure it's hard to make a good dance movie, but Step-up is no exception to the rule. You served, with the exception of his inconsistencies with street dance culture, at least had the dance aspect. Rescue of the Last Dance was garbage, and so it was about a musical of the past 10 years (although I was impressed with Moulin Rouge) ... look at the Ballet Center, watch Beat Street for Hip-Hop
