This movie has nothing in everything. In addition to Bobby deol, who is mediocre in his own standards, no one in this movie came close to acting in a single scene. Kangana is completely fake in her acting. <br /> <br /> The big Anupam Kher has a guest look and is better in the 2 minutes than Bobby in the whole movie. The music complements the movie <br /> <br /> not so well. The contrast in Music between Bobby and Upen is not so well highlighted. Big concept went completely wrong. The movie doesn't have a proper end. Please don't waste your time as I did on this movie
