Ho humm - - - Nothing more. If you are a prolonged Rush fan, you know what this video contains: ominous past songs, the 80's "BIG 3" hits and their "last-ditch" attempts to stay contemporary. They succeed in enjoying themselves by striking the critics by portraying themselves as "dinosaurs". Unfortunately, they fail to protect themselves from embarrassment. Close-ups of their faces just add to the fact that these guys have CROP. <br /> <br /> If you have the band for a few decades of the 70's (as much as you can stomach) then you know there's no new stuff here. The same old, same guy: 1) Neil avoids the press, 2) no rights behind the scenes (Geddy loses his shoes?! Give me a break! Even he thinks it's absurd!) 3) No new insights. <Br /> <br /> A better video would have been to show the CREW setting for 3 or 4 hours? just run the camera. And stop changing cameras every 2 seconds! I understand the director wants to try to do something. But then offer a full concert version of 2 or 3 shots that the VIEWER can choose. We know what the group looks like? Let's see what we really want to see. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a BIG favor: RENT this movie first.
