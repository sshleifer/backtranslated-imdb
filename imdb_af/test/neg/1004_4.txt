Seeing this movie for the first time twenty years after its release, I'm not getting it right. Why was it such a big hit in 1986? His amateurity drips from every scene. The jokes are lame and predictable. The sex scenes are exploitation and on top (it's not to say Miss Rudnik doesn't have good boobs!). The song is "horrible". The only really funny scene is the big shooting when the gangsters die, dance dance, a feature that dates the movie firmly to the middle of the eighties. It is really my mystery how impossible I can understand the enthusiasm of the cheering audiences in 1986 (and apparently still today, reading my fellow IMDBers remarks).
