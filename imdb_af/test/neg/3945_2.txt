Stay Alive has a very similar story to some Asian horror movies that include technology on the story. Some of these Asian horror movies are One Missed Call, Ringu and Pulse. So, the idea of ​​Stay Alive is very clicked and obvious, but the filmmakers behind It didn't know how to make something new or interesting for the stay in Stay Alive. This movie is completely crap. But a very big crap. All the elements of Stay Alive belong to the worst class of 'horror' movies: level characters, nothing of tension, dumb 'horror' that makes laughter and light violence. It is easy to note that the director is not capable of creating something original or disturbing. I don't want to waste more time on this pathetic movie. I just give you a advice: don't see this movie. I really hated it.
