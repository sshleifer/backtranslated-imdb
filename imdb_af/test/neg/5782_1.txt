This movie is absolutely horrible ... Definitely a bull *** t story and even worse acting. Bad Charlie Sheen is involved in such a thing, as he is a decent actor. He did some very good movies. <br /> <br /> The special effects are a team standard with the classic car getting shot and then overtaking with a little fireball under the hood. <br /> <br /> Of course, the enemy is depicted as total idiots and dies as fast as they can say, "The Evil Americans." <br /> <br /> Unless braindead movies are you game, don't spend 113 minutes of your life on this litter. Instead, pack the 'Platoon' or 'Apocalypse' now.
