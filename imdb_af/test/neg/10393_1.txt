I'm not sure if it's a comedy or not, but I found it quite comical. Isobel is in possession of the devil. Somehow, a perforated priest and the gardener will fix it. Share exorcism and some soap opera, you'll laugh at least. There is the paranoid jealous father, satanic sister, the Valley of the Dolls mother, and then the cowboy boyfriend; everyone there to help the dress that the priest excites to fight the demons of dear Isobel. It sometimes felt like a Jerry Springer episode, but I actually paid to see it. Instead of the cool head twist, sailor and crucifixion, which Regan did in The Exorcist; You get a lot of Isobel reflecting on her bed, like a trampoline, hiding in her closet and jumping from a hay cage. Yes, it's Chuck E. Cheese went wild. So, if you want to see a quote that's not some laughter while waiting for the predictable end ... it's your movie.
