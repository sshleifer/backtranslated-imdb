Ego. This is the only reason this movie is made. This movie is so wrong in so many ways that it is under human dignity to write a lot about it. Each character was just good for self-pricing and starring (I use this term liberal as the director) emote in the parable of stone. The little story, if any, fails to basic elements such as logic, feeling and drama. Direction leaves much to be desired. blatant mistakes are everywhere (character motives are not defined, prospective men are found overnight, broken carousas smell amongst others) <br /> <br /> Let's see it, Himesh can't act. It also seems that Hansika Motwani can't. In her defense, she is still a chubby child who looks older than she is, thanks to tons of makeup. Raj Babbar Overacts and makes his small presence as false as possible. Darshan Jariwala laughs a bit too much. The actor playing Homesh's friend is the only natural. <br /> <br /> A few questions come to mind: how can such a movie cost R500 million? where did the money go ??? awarded that one haunted series was moderately well shot and Mallika Sherawat paid an obscene Rs.15,000,000 for her 15 minute appearance and 2 songs. but the mere stupidity of the film falls to the mind. (including 3 Mumbai Auto Rickshaws that pop up and jump on a police car) <br /> <br /> The good: Himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make its nasal voice and brand "topi". Let's give the devil his excuse: Himesh, as usual, gives good music. <br /> <br /> The bad: Direction, Story, Himesh's song is still hard to ignore. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: Dialogs and everything else! <br /> <br /> Final Word: Painful in every sense of the word! Just look at this movie if you loved Subhash Ghai's "Yaadein".
