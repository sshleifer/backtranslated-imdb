Sometimes when I hear an A list, it will be teamed up for 2 hours. I hope and pray that it is good, not for my 10 dollars or 2 hours, but for the sake of these actors' careers. In the case of "Cool" everything has disappeared. <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the film, John Travolta (aka Chile Palmer) and a music executive are playing James Woods. film prosecutions, and how most are not good. If you look, the fact that this scene was shot, in the same way that Quentin Tarrantino filmed his car scene in "Pulp Fiction", and listen to the dialogue you can't help but think about it 1) a indemnity for the audience is that it will suck film, or 2) an attempt to make the audience laugh at the mere humor of 2 people talking about prosecutions in a successor. Oh the irony! (If you're wondering, choice 1 is correct.) The cool and smooth Chile Palmer of the first and good movie, "Get Shorty", is revived to play a mobster-given music business. He steals a young hot singer (Christina Milian) from her ghetto, which the Jewish driver (Vince Vaughn) expressed, and transforms her into a singing sensation. Of course, an ex-mobster movie can never be completed without new people causing the cause of destruction. This time, the voters of choice are Russian, played by American actors who cannot act Russian if my entire family hits them with their Russian bare hands. <br /> <br /> As a Russian, I wasn't so much offended by the way these films depicted Russians, but as a writer I was more insulted by the terrible dialogue. This film tried too hard to make the audience laugh. It has become potentially good lines in excess. The Russian, black and gay jokes were the same, reformulating only a few hundred times. After playing The Rock's character of ***** (he plays a gay bodyguard to Vince Vaughn), and Cedric the Entertainer's character a ***** (he played a black rapper with an entourage to those who didn't play threatened his tracks with guns. I wanted to go out of the theater because it was painful to go through. If it was 'Get Shorty', it wouldn't even be necessary in the film to build drama, or a very bad laugh. <br /> <br /> What is missing in this movie not in "Get Shorty" was Chile's hot spicey attitude. He is a completely different person in this successor. For one thing, the old Chile would have had more dialogue. John Travolta does not have more than 20 speaking lines in "Be Cool", because he is exercised by repetitive lines and the hundred and two appeared by most peers. I will not ruin the shock by revealing all the cameos to those who actually intend to watch this movie (PLEASE DO NOT!) But I will say that it will always surprise me that these people agreed to in a film of such folly. <br /> <br /> What was even more stupid was the very lame dance series with Travolta and Uma Thurman (she plays James Woods's widow who is killed LUCKILY in the first 10 minutes of the movie). Tarrantino never made Pulp Fiction for an idiot like the director of "Be Cool" to turn around. This dance number was boring, long and just dripping. The Black Eyed Peas play in the club with a total of 10 people not making the scene memorable. <br /> <br /> There were so many plot holes I left to ask the theater, WHY? Everything about this movie was a big question mark. I didn't understand the point of anything. I couldn't even explain why the Russians were after all, or why this movie was ever made, because I'm surprised. All I took from this movie was that everyone in LA has a sidekick, and the only way this movie is probably funded was through all ads by Diet Coke, Yahoo !, Honda Insight Hybrid, T-Mobile, Trimspa (even the spokesperson himself is in the movie) and the bad author author guild. Plotgate, stupid dialogue, too many random cameos, terrible acting (even by the forwards), and a not-so-entertaining attempt to mimic "Pulp Fiction" make this movie the worst movie of 2005 and it's just the third month of the year.
