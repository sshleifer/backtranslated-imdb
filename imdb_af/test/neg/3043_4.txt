This movie has the potential to be a good little high school excitement. Instead, we have a bitter party about a bitter, spoiled brat babysitter. The problem was that there were too many unnecessary things. A fight with the boyfriend, random friends who are about to die, is killed. It was clear that they had just killed time. The main character was slim and uninteresting. Camilla Bell had no emotion during this movie. She was right there. Another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat. The children survive, so it is clear that they will survive Jill. The only reason it had a four was because the last ten minutes (when the killer finally comes out) is actually exciting. <br /> <br /> 4/10
