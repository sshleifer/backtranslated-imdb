Following on his role in the fine hijacker SEWE THIEVES (1960) - which I have been looking back on for several years - it appears that Edward G. Robinson plays older criminal mastermind types (apart from the strange juicy role as in the CINCINNATI KID [1965]. I previously watched the good Euro-Cult effort GRAND SLAM (1967) and in addition I have two similar titles from Italy to check - one of which is directed by future governor Lucio Fulci! Anyway, this is the kind of international production - with American and Italian actors and a British director - that was common throughout the 1960s. It is harmless and easy in itself, but almost unforgettable and definitely overlapping - especially since heavy equipment financing is needed for the elevator (such as a lower tank and an airplane!), The gang has to pull a variety of the smallest thefts. <br /> <br /> Of course, the gang is an incompetent lot led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his bimbo girlfriend (Raquel Welch) - the other is a "pacifist" black man, an eternal hunger Italian. and a little English man. They are trying to convert an ex-gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to switch their fortune to them, except that he is merciless ... but under the banner of Professor Robinson, he instead puts a platinum caper of 5 million dollars! Needless to say, the gangsters don't trust each other. (Wagner advises Welch to deceive De Sica to get their fence in Morocco - where they come back to the robbery), or otherwise work To keep a restaurant, Italian cannot sit at the table and a multi-day meal for ordering himself!). Entertainingly, in the face of similar failures, De Sica tries to show them how they used it in the old days - but apparently hold a petrol station, it seems the owner is a cousin of his and he just asked to borrow cash! <br /> <br /> The central lift range is typically expanded: while the gang, including Welch, transports the train transporting the platinum, Wagner kidnapped pilot Victor Spinetti and his plane. When the job is finished, he is completely planning to double De Sica - but his partners or Welch are not prepared to go with it either. From the time when crime did not pay, the gang is trying to lose all their bumps in the air if the plane's bombing doors are accidentally opened.
