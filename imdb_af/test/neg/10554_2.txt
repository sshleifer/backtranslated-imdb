Wow, Kiss the Bride wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either. It was probably no "later day saints." The movie in the center ... maybe turn off about 30 minutes, would have made a more enjoyable movie. But the movie is being turned over again and again by annoying subplots and discarded screens. The very golden outings occur. <br /> <br /> Although "Kiss" was made for theater release, it seems and sounds more like a TV movie. Each scene is illuminated like a departmental home. So many characters have been discarded. <br /> <br /> And dear Tori is actually a pleasant surprise. She steals every scene she appears in. <br /> <br /> One scene really irritated me. It was the rehearsal dinner in this larger room with many tables - all decorated. But only 5 or 6 people in a room for 250! Where did everyone go. <br /> <br /> Gay theater is sinking into a new layer ... but not as low as the horrible movies produced at the Here! Channel.
