I bought Jack-O a few months ago at a Blockbuster video sales, and then I didn't expect anything outstanding. When I saw this, I realized I had not only less than I could ever negotiate, but also much more. It seems weird, I know. And this is. But it is perfectly appropriate when you think the extraordinary strangeness Jack-O is. <br /> <br /> The movie follows a young boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow, through ancestral ties, he was marked for death in the hands of a demented, crooked Pumpkin Man. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's grandfather-uncle cousin. And now the villain has risen, Shawn's death is apparently critical for his raging mission of revenge. In any case, many "horrors" occur, as Jack-O hooks his way through several neighbors before he fights Shawn to the end. <br /> <br /> I'm not so much here to discuss the plot as I am to determine who might find any value in this movie. I can honestly say that Jack-O is one of the worst movies in the history of time. The play is deadpan (except when it should be), the script is apparently a 1st group project and the production budget should not exceed $ 150. Some of the most laughing deaths have been carried out in this anti-thriller, and they are increasingly humorous when you realize that director Steve Latshaw is really serious about his movie. <br /> <br /> And yet, I really enjoy the movie. I can call it a terrible horror movie, yes. But I can also say I had a good time watching it with my friends, and I've been watching it for a couple of times. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this movie unbearable and unnecessarily time consuming, and that is understandable. If you are like me and enjoy ridiculous horror movies that take themselves seriously, you'll find Jack-O an instant classic, which is also understandable. <br /> <br /> That's why it's so difficult to judge this movie. If I judged Jack-O's quality as a movie, I'd give it nothing. In fact, the studio would owe my star. But if I have a rating, it's pure pleasure, I give it an 8 or a 9. I'll give it a 4, so be somewhere in the middle. I recommend everyone go out, hire it and form their own conclusion.
