I'm not surprised that so many people have fallen for this one. When I watched this movie, a few viewers sucked at me when you were "supposed" to sob - or at least feel "touched". Like when Hunting said he didn't love the girl. Like Robin Williams's character (sorry for forgetting his role name), he repeatedly said, "It's not your fault" (oh Lord, just to think of that scene, I'll give the goosebumps). I couldn't care less about what would happen to the characters. Many people sniff for Hollywood-made characters they can't even tolerate (think Titanic, Yuck!) ... but it just hurt me and wanted to get out of the theater. I think I simply refuse to be psychologically and emotionally manipulated. <br /> <br /> People it's not me that is abusive ... those characters are for no good reason because they are unreal. Even worse, nothing is new or surprising. Even Robin Williams's character has all been clicked. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1 out of 10. This is probably not so bad; it's just pretty mediocre ... but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10, so I thought a single balancing voice would not be hurt.
