This P. or S. is highly recommended to me by two friends who have a good <br /> <br /> (similar to mine) taste in movies and have seen more than anyone I know. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they saw in this movie. Sadistic, cruel and repulsive is fine in an entertaining movie, but it is a wind-bidding effort to beat itself off as a high-blown film production. Or is this lowbrow highbrow? <br /> <br /> The old generation gaping "no salvation of social value" comes to mind. Bill Pullman tries, perhaps a little too hard, and besides the child, the rest of the play looks self-conscious and a little lame. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and look at a dual feature of "In Cold Blood" and "The Hitcher". <br /> <br /> As someone said, it would never be made if Jennifer Lynch was not the overstated David Lynch's daughter.
