My main criticism of the movie is the animation. I totally agree with everyone else, it was very poor. Some of the characters had darker skin signs than they did in the first movie, which is much better. Also the background colors look chased and somewhat static. It's also a pity that Michael J.Fox didn't sing Milo, he did such a good job, and James Arnold Taylor wasn't sure he should sound Milo or Aladdin. I also took into account the lack of a good story. the third story was confusing and clumsy, and the second story suffered from poor scripts. To make things worse, the first one I can't even remember, except that a fishing village is played or something. However, there were some good music, and good voice talents by John Mahoney, Cree Summer, Clancy Brown and Tom Wilson, who saved the film of total disaster. All in all, a disappointing sequel to a surprisingly good movie. 4/10 Bethany Cox.
