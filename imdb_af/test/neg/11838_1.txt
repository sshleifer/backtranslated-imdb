This movie doesn't even earn a 1/10 This movie was a scam. <br /> <br /> I swear that at least 30 minutes of the movie DELIBERETLY was copied from Carnosaur 1, 2 & 3. The whole movie "Raptor" was based on the movie and it was really a pathetic attempt to " be a "Thriller, Action Packed, Dinosaur" copy. I loved this movie series and saw it being put on a movie that couldn't afford or want it. COPY it without doing there is own models, is America coming to it. I recommend you see the Carnosaur movie FIRST (everyone) and watch it, and you will know what I mean. <br /> <br /> - Spencer
