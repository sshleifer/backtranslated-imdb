This movie is very modern and forward-looking. This is about 75% in English. It is aimed at English-speaking, multiple-young audiences. Basic plot is similar to DDLJ. Acting is below average. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they are displaying the wrong picture and setting a bad example for the young. Tanisha is shown to drink from a bottle, or tequila shots about 5-6 times in the movie. The director doesn't even acknowledge she's an alcoholic and has a drinking problem. During the film she only wears bikini tops whether she is at work, at a beach or at a wedding. The heroine of the movie doing it makes the young people feel that this behavior is acceptable. <br /> <br /> The less it is said about Uday Chopra's failure to do Shahrukh Khan's DDLJ role of arrogant girl hunter, the better. The movie is about gender equality. But equality should not be about making the same mistakes, instead of doing the right thing. If men, as a chronic Casanova, are shown in movies, this does not mean that women should portray the same behavior. <br /> <br /> Although the film is made in light spirit, it promotes so many wrong social concepts in the name of forward, the "fun" part of the movie does not impact. Not even in Canada do women dress like this, or guys act like they did in the movie. This is certainly not a reflection of Indian society or even of Canadian society. Perhaps in the beginning they should have an indemnity: "All characters and events in the movie are imaginary and do not reflect the real culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film." The only good thing about this movie is its length, 1.5 hours, thank you.
