I had high expectations for this movie. I even stood out for an evening to watch Stargate for this movie. I found it had a rushed feeling about it and many of the most important Biblical moments and facts were missing. I might have been a bit saturated and spoiled for the 1956 version as I watched every year for the past 20 or so years. I doubt this one will make it into the realm of the annual classics, like the other one has. If you haven't seen the 19546 version, you may have this one, but I seriously doubt it and encourage you to hit this one and rent or buy the classic one. It has some special special effects, but that's not what I'm looking for when I tell a movie like the Ten Commandments. I was looking at how they told the story, and the authors didn't do a good job with this one.
