... a movie comes together that really gets horrible from the opening titles through the studio logo signed at the end of the closing credits. It was such a movie - the type you can't stop watching is afraid of a moment of its ever-declining quality. <br /> <br /> Forget about the low budget indicated by a slow, monotonous opening sequence that shows Secret Service Agents running alongside a presidential motorbike without crowds, no traffic or space observable. Forget the printed logic needed to even remotely make the actual plot look. Forget about Roy Scheider delivering some of the hammiest dialogue, hiding his shame completely. <br /> <br /> This clunker is terribly paced, bombarded by a simple mimic count and seems to be edited by a third degree. All of the times, scenarios are turning into the most difficult thing about filming a presidential storyline on the cheap. He looks presidential. <br /> <br /> I feel honestly in the last line, and when I wake up, I run It is back so you don't have to miss a single impeccable frame. Try this drinking game: take a shot every time you see it, and try another better movie. You will also get rid of it. <br /> <br /> Not since the 'Man' with Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy, I saw such a wonderful irreconcilable project. I can give copies as Christmas gifts. Zero stars. A thousand laughs.
