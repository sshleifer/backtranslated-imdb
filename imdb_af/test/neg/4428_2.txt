Director Lo Wei was known to read the races and watch the set - tell us something about his "approach to film making, huh? The reviews I have read fall into two categories: 1) it's a movie so bad it's funny, or 2) it's a movie so bad it's boring. <br /> <br /> So let's get to the point where we all agree. This movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> I vote for category 2.) The story is almost incomprehensible complex and it is further reduced and distorted by the remarkably poor camera work and editing, yet Lo Wei was so in love with the fact that he slowed down the pace so we all Looking Away Whether We Want It or Not <br /> <br /> Perhaps Lo Wei was upset about the day (or two), this film was made - he just wanted to make everyone suffer, throw, crew and audiences alike . <br /> <br /> Save yourself the pain.
