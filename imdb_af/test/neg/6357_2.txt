<br /> <br /> As a fan of bad movies (and MST3K, and a member of MFT3K), I must say I've seen my share of them. But geez! Even the worst I saw had at least a soundtrack. As George Lazenby walks firmly around Hong Kong, who knows what, you can ensure that you won't be distracted by any of that background music that fills today's cinema. Or any of that music that fills elevators. I don't even think anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Now it's not quite true - there * is * a soundtrack. If you listen now, you will hear it in about half a dozen during the film. Of course, timing will be completely inappropriate, and it doesn't take long, but something that can be classified as "music". However, your best bet is to put your toddler with a wooden spoon in front of the TV with a collection of pots and pans while watching. The rhythm and flow will be better than the movie offers. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on Sammo Hung as a minor village in this movie. Are we not all happy to find Jackie Chan working together?
