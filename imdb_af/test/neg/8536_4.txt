After a problem in Chicago, the Solomon family goes to a remote North Dakota farm to start again, but their efforts to idyllic farming are disrupted as their teenage daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3- year old brother, Ben begins to see and is attacked by supernatural beings who do not allow them to live in peace. <br /> <br /> The Messengers are definitely starting to become a generic horror movie that is much more humorous than scary. After reading the premise, I thought it could be a decent movie because it sounded and it had potential. Unfortunately, the movie didn't live up to its potential, although I had expected it, as the trailer was terrible. The script was probably the worst part of it. It was full of dull rows and dull dialogue. The characters were not developed at all and most of them were like a lot of idiots, so it was hard to feel sympathy for them. <br /> <br /> The directors did a horrible job of building up tension. They relied mostly on cheap scares such as loud noises and random jumps. The music was really top and it made it easier for the viewer to telegraph the next "scary" moment. I also didn't like how they used almost one place for the whole movie. The house was the centerpiece of the story and that is where the majority of the filming took place, so it became a bit boring after a while to see the same area. I also didn't like the close-ups of the actors. During a conversation, the camera would continually push character to another in the five-second team and it became very annoying. The directors have created a decent atmosphere and they get a few points to make their movie attractive. However, as we come a long way in terms of style and effects, it's not really that hard to make your movie look good, especially if you're working on a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The play was horrific and if this movie was released in December, I'm sure he would have received several Razzie nominations. Kristen Stewart showed a talent in Panic Room, but you won't be able to tell that she has talent by watching her performance in The Messengers. She was okay to be scary and that's it. The rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing. Penelope Anne Miller was just awful when it was all. It sounded like she was reading her lines and she had some of the worst facial expressions I've ever seen. Dylan McDermott was just a lot of wood and he almost showed no emotion. John Corbett delivered the best performance and he had some good scenes. The twins played by Ben were also decent and managed to perform many of the adult actors. Overall, this lame horror movie is not worth watching because it is meekness and lazy movie-making. Rating 4/10
