Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back! It's a horror movie, not a thrill, not a thrill, a horror movie. Yes, this movie is an abomination. Terribly bad. After many years from here at IMDb, I actually moved to set up an account so I (like at least one other reviewer here) could warn people, DO NOT BE THIS MOVIE! IT WILL STAY YOURSELF, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes bad movies, or at least half an hour of your life if you're not wise enough to hit the fast forward button. <br /> <br /> I would like to hear the voice of the director on an "improved" DVD (there is another terrible thought) to see what the hell they think. The producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the Val Kilmer name to break this film at least, even in international distribution. <br /> <br /> I actually had the misfortune to choose to watch movies on demand, which did not provide any captions to the Russian dialogue. Not that it matters much. To hear the Russian, translate it into your head (if you can) just to find out how boring it is just offensive to injury. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie a "1" because I can't give it a lower rating, and because it has one remarkable thing. It somehow made an almost completely underground film, NOT claustrophobic. Now it's a dubious achievement. <br /> <br /> HERE IS YOUR SPOILER: And the finite, holy mother (no pun intended) is that they run out of money and just decided to film. The "climax" of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I've ever seen on film. Also practice your simple escape mechanism if you find it yourself - the button off.
