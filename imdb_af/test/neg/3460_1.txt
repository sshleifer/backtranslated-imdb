Let me predict this by going up, I'm a big George Clooney fan, and I love John Krasinski in 'The Office'. Well, I was and I did it. <br /> <br /> It was the world's worst nailer and it took 113 minutes to tear it off. The annoying boredom was only interrupted by my regular attempts to read and estimate my watch when it was over. <br /> <br /> Every funny scene was in the forefront. All three of them. There was no real story, no character development, and the writing was just bad. I had a colonoscopy that was pleasant. <br /> <br /> The title had to be SuperDuper Bad. This movie is a slot for a Razzie. It must get quite a few Razzies. I want my money back.
