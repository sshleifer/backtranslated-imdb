A better movie could be made to portray the tragedy of Bosnia. Some parts are very effective and the movie does well to give an idea of ​​the suffering of the people, especially the children, but in general it looks less like a movie and more like a documentary. Woody Harrelson is very good, but the rest of the role played well without being extra ordinary. Must be looked at to get a rough idea of ​​what the war did for the children of Bosnia. If you are expecting a great and enjoyable movie, Welkom ...... will be a disappointment.
