First of all, let me say that I do not deny the importance of the subject in any way - rather the opposite. I'm Polish and I've long become aware of the Katyn massacre (in fact, two of my relatives died there), so I'm looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem lies with the writing, which includes too many subplots and characters, none of which have been properly developed. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined but do not have overall meaning. In my opinion, the cast doesn't really have a chance to show their ability. The exception is Andrzej Chyra, who depicts Jerzy - the only interesting character. I wish the story was more focused on him. <br /> <br /> As a result, the movie has no emotion. Before I saw it, I thought I'd be moved, just for sentimental reasons - but I really saw it with a strange sense of debauchery, except for the final performance. It is well done and its placement is interesting and offers a climatic end. Although the idea of ​​the Lord's Prayer is being returned by unison executives, it seems a little far-fetched. <br /> <br /> Finally, I suppose The movie can have an educational value for those who are not familiar with the historical events, but I think it is not a work of a theater.
