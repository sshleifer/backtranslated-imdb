Insane really. Even if you did not see the original George Cukor movie with Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine and a thousand other star movie, you can reject this forced, politically correct, depressive comedy . Depress for many different reasons. Meg Ryan for one. What did she do to her? Her face can barely move. This alone sets her miles away from Norma Shearer. Annette Bening has to sue the DP and Debra Messing, what has she done here? Actresses without commitment in the public's subconscious mind to pass for friends are completely unconvincing. Eva Mendes in the Joan Crawford section is an outrageous piece of miscasting. What a terrible idea! Her character is like a trans-gender performer without any taste or subtlety. Bizarre to think that a woman adapted and directed these women. The only positive thing I can mention is a short but very funny look of Bette Midler and Cloris Leachman as housekeeper.
