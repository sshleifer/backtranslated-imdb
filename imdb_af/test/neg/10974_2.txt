One wonders how FLYNN failed in 1997 as badly as a movie release, with Guy Pearce starring in the lead. It is not often that the decisive sober of someone is so precise. FLYNN was a stumbling block in the box and didn't end up on screen screens in Australia ... even after LA CONFIDENTIAL ...! From a brilliant nude scene in the first few minutes (presumably by Guy Pearce), FLYNN is a fairly strong and interesting start. Unfortunately, FLYNN flows after the first 35 minutes of steam and with the entrance of hammy Steven Berkoff in a detour to New Guinea (watch and act like he wanted the Klaus Kinski role in FITZCARRALDO), starting the film like a tele movie rather than a big cinema biography. Believe it or not, with about 70 minutes it makes boring and you are happy to see it. But such a promise! Pearce IS Flynn! But the movie caused a mutiny at the box office and unlike The Bounty, it sank without a trace.
