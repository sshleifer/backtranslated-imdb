This movie is so predictable if you know the modern American dream: Do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly ... who! You are a genius and stupid and the world kisses the land on which you walk. <br /> <br /> And surprisingly, all the other smart people are losers. They know nothing and are bitter when we solve kids' problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult, but these professors can still analyze the results in less than 10 seconds. <br /> <br /> Any movie has anyway good and Robin Williams is in this one.
