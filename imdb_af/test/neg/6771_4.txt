I know we shouldn't expect much from a low-budget indie movie. But the idea behind it is healthy: an attempt to open America's eyes to the convivial relationship between government and journalists aimed at it. But somehow the documentary aspect of it takes away from his drama. The protest during the 2004 Republican convention in New York was not so compelling to make a documentary about it. This kind of compelling protest belongs to the era of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Staying at a drama would have been better. Perhaps a slow build-up where the young journalist's eyes are gradually opened for conspiracy.
