I suppose this movie would be "cool" for 1961, but look back now (45 years). It's charm, just as stupid as the entertainment value! Granted, the special effects do well on T.V. with the series that began in 1964, but for the BIG screen ?? I once had a fish tank that was equally exciting! I have to agree on the Octopus scene near the end where it connected to the Seaview. Of course, it's not well-behaved ... or trained! Overall, it's pretty bad with shady special effects and I still recommend it. It was probably one of Irwin Allen's greatest films and I think he thought a lot about it. Barabara Eden is on Gen. Television played. Micheal Ansara was her husband. Now it's a cool part of this movie! I always enjoyed seeing the real life. Man and woman teams star in the same movie. Neat!
