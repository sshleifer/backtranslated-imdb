Outside Sweden you are not expected to see this movie. Happy you. The film includes several actors in the modern film of Swedish film history. And still. <br /> <br /> Looks like Peter Dalle had just one idea that lasts about 20 minutes. Robert Gustafson is completely abused in this movie, and tries to copy a younger GÃ¶sta Ekman. Ekman, incidentally, is the only actor who meets the expectations. <br /> <br /> Credit that can be given is for the photo, beautiful idea to use black and white. Music is OK. <br /> <br /> But all over it is a waste of god actors and the time of the audience.
