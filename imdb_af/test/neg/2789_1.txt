According to the budget information provided on this site, Dark Harvest had an estimated budget of $ 130,000. Where this money was spent, I'm not quite sure. Let me see .... costumes ... no ... location and sets ... hmmm, don't think .... special f / x ... NOT ... acting lessons ... ah, no. Dark Harvest tells the epic story of a young man who inherits a family farm in the hills of West Virginia. His girlfriend speaks to him to take their friends there to look out of the place. Once there, our intrepid hero learns that his great grandfather used a unique method to grow his crops and now it's time for revenge. Killer scarecrows out for revenge !!! Eskom scary. Well no, not really. We all know there are some fantastic movies made with very little money, but it is not one of them. This movie contains a lot of the worst acting and dialogue I've ever seen. Terrible clich√©s with terrible delivery. All in all, don't be fooled by the halfway decent coverage and avoid at all costs. I would like to give the filmmakers at least a D-try to try, but I'm afraid they didn't even do a good job with it. GRADE: F
