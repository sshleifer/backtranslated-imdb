I watched this movie last night. Within 30 minutes of the start I was hoping it would end. <br /> <br /> It had a promising start; the first 10 minutes. The premise of this movie (friendship that goes nowhere after giving their days (and years) together in separate beds in hotel rooms is just unbelievable. He kisses her somewhere along the way, and she feels Ohh, so terrible . <br /> <br /> Very little stuff to grab your interest The play just doesn't stop, it's very passive, no matter how much of the movie is displayed, the viewer never develops any form of caring connection. with the characters on the screen, you learn that her next statement will be as boring as her previous one. ("Do you have a cigarette?", he does not smoke, he wants her to stop smoking. Doesn't she know now .) <br /> <br /> She calls him in the middle of the night To come to him after a year's absence, she comes through the door, they don't even have an emotional connection. not even to lift her suitcase to help her, this is not how real people behave, this is not how the best pals behave. > <br /> When he calls her in the middle of the night (she's one day in town), he shows little interest in seeing her face, acting more as if she'd be a burden for the night. At this point they had known each other for two years and he hadn't seen her for a year. Not credible, not really. <br /> <br /> He probably wrote a book on Entropy and Enthalpy, but we never see or read any of his interests in Physics with her, not that she can handle the discussion. We learn that a watermelon in L.A. $ 50 food (it wasn't the Silicon Type thought). He has no problem giving those fruits. We also learn that the airport is switched off when a few very false snowflakes fall out of the air. I'm sorry, but it was also in L.A. <br /> <br /> We never see how these two characters survive, we never see them at work. We never see them fighting, they are always on holiday. They have infinite time, they have no worries whatsoever. <br /> <br /> Nice life. Unreal life. Unreal characters. Bad Title. Bad movies.
