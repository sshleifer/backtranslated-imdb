Dr. Lucio Fulci (Lucio Fulci) is a director of gory horror movies that began to feel that he had filmed too many bloody scenes. He visits his local psychiatrist to see if he loses his marbles; It seems to be a bad idea, as the shrinkage is actually a crazy killer responsible for a flu of murder. To give the opportunity to make Fulci his fake man, the looser note doctor hypnotizes the horrorhack to think he's responsible for the recent series of murders. On the surface, Kat in the Brain looks like a fantastic gory of spaghetti plow god Lucio Fulci. Chock full of chain saw spread, ax attacks and several other bloody murders, the film definitely flushes enough for even the most hardened gore dogs. But if one looks closer, it seems that many of the horrific scenes of earlier movies are being lifted (mostly Fulci's own 'masterpieces'); remove it from the equation and one is left with a handy basic idea that has been completely wasted, some welcome celebrities and terrible performances by Fulci himself and David L. Thompson as the psycho-shrink. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, it develops into an incomprehensible mess, with the 'borrowed' image material randomly inserted, without any attempt to convince it in the story. If you've seen Fulci's Touch of Death and Ghost's or Sodom, or Mario Bianchi's Murder Secret, you've already seen the best bits of Cat In The Brain. <br /> <br /> After much blood loss, the film wraps itself up quickly and makes the viewer feel staggering and deceptive. Watch the movie if you are a Fulci finalist, but I suggest you look for the movies from which the "good bits" were taken.
