I remember years ago, Michael Douglas wanted his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones to be in a romantic movie because he felt his wife had all the goods. No doubt she does, but not in this movie. A colossal waste of time, no story, no character development, no chemistry, nada. It wasn't the vehicle we all hope this movie will be, boring and a great disappointment. Didn't even watch the whole movie, torture. Of course, Catherine Zeta-Jones was trained on how to work, move around, serve a dish, but it wasn't the food network, learned nothing here and once her peer appeared, presumably a romantic interest brewery, where was the chemistry. The poor slammed on the second floor of her building and tried to tie all the pleats and no character development there. The loss of her sister was poorly played because he knew there was a closeness. The sister's daughter was just crumbling here and there with something that had to move you in, NOT. Just a waste of movie time. The promoters have definitely done their job of putting this defamation movie on all the networks that you have requested with all kinds of teasers. Sorry to say, don't spend a dime.
