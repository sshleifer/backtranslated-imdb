I remember vacationing in Florida when this movie was sowing. I set up my video recorder to record it. The expectation killed me. I knew about this movie since it was announced half a year ago. We returned to Florida 4 days, Florida, and I immediately looked at it. I tried as hard as I could, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> I'm a BIG 3 stooges fan. And so I know quite a bit about them. So it wasn't like I expected the movie, and I didn't. I was more interested in the depictions and seeing how accurate their information was. There were many things wrong with this movie. The actors, the script, the reenactments, ALL could have been much better. <br /> <br /> Paul Ben-Victor is a terribly talented actor. But let's look at facts, Moe Howard was WAY out of reach. He doesn't look like him, he doesn't sound like him, and so he can't act like he does. Michael Chiklis is also very talented, but his cricket depiction didn't play well with me, but if Curly got sick, he did very well. John Kassir's portrayal of Shemp could be better performed. It was more of a bad impression than a portrayal. Worst of all was Joe Besser. They made him slender, and more annoying than he really was. It was just plain laziness. I don't like the Joe shorts because, as the movie illustrates, he hardly ever hit it. But he wasn't so annoying, and DEFINITIVE wasn't that thin. The best performance belongs to Evan Handler. He had the most accurate stubborn portrayal. The problem with Larry's character, his hair is AWAY too curly and AWAY too red. I know it's too technical, so I won't count it on my list of why I didn't have this movie. <br /> <br /> Back to Shemp, that's just my favorite sting. He was written as a whore, tremble, chicken. He did have many phobias, but he wasn't that bad. He did not leave the group initially because he was afraid of Ted Healy, although he did not like him, Shemp left because he received an offer from another studio that he simply could not turn off. Instead of the truth, choose this movie to make him water the bed, on Larry, no less, in a cupboard, and shamefully bend out of the group. Another problem is that Shemp made almost as many Columbia pants as Curly did, but only one, Fright Night, which was her first short, is shown. His career was almost completely ignored. Plus, bad editing caused a terrible and most unforgivable error. Shemp was born early in 1895 and died in late 1955. It would make him so old at death? Well, here's a tip, it's not 59 like the movie says. <br /> <br /> Now for the writing, which I think, was just flawed because this movie was rushing. Some of the lines are stupid and can be developed and / or much better presented than they were. The one line that really got me was at the end of the movie, when Moe showed the promoter how the eyepiece was done. <br /> <br /> "That's how we do it, make contact with the front leg, not the eyes, but look really like film." This rule was poorly written and poorly placed in the movie. It is meant to be one of the lines the audience says OH! Surprised and I'm sure it did with some people, but the end of the movie wasn't the place for this line. A better place you ask? What about when they first appeared in Columbia and introduced to the sound effects machine. At first I know there was no sound for the eyepiece, but Moe said, "What about this?" and eyepokes Curly or Larry. Jules White then says, "Are you okay?" or "How did you do that?" There were many misplaced lines in this film, which is a clear sign that the script is out. Another one is the origin of the name Shemp, although one is not so bad, and so I will let one slip. <br /> <br /> What does this movie mean? It illustrates how the eyeballs were screwed by Columbia, what they were. I'm not sure if Moe was an old boy, but it was the kind of dramatization stuff intended to sympathize with the viewer. I know this movie was a dramatization. I do not know everything is going to be sharp and clean and perfect. But some of the things they did and the right things they ignored were in serious conflict with each other. For example, Curly's stroke is not even close to the way it happened in real life. I know, dramatization, but the purpose of dramatization is to make real events more dramatic. Curly strokes in real life are more dramatic than they have shown in the movie. Here's what really happened. Curly put in a chair outside the screen while a scene was shot. They called him for the final gunfire, but there was no response. Moe went to fetch him and his little brother's head washed up, half paralyzed, unable to speak, and tears streamed over his face. Moe then said, "Babe?" and trying him out of his chair. Poorly curly falls on his knees. Then the ambulance was called. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie wasn't terrible, but it was definitely not good, or even OK. This film makes the eyesight helpless and inaccurate and sometimes it is about dramatization. There is a very, very long list of inaccuracies in this movie. If you don't believe me, check out a fella name Stooge's list at the threestooges.com news forum. It's about a page and a half long. Some things in the movie I can let go. But others were unforgivable. The Three Stooges were geniuses, and much of today's comedy is based on what they did. Don't believe me? Check out the Simpsons, and more so Ren & Stimpy. But this film fails to catch their genius. It's more inaccurate to catch their hardships, which is important, but if the title of the movie is to be the Three Stooges, it should portray their ingenuity and originality more than anything.
