Red glasses <br /> <br /> I loved Avalon. I think this director made some incredible demented visions of the future. However, this movie was boring pretentious crap. The opening scene has great promise for what the cover art and description promises, a surrealistic living action-amy style future noir. I feel I have this with Avalon. <br /> <br /> With Red Spectacles I was just driven to feel uncomfortable craving what hell was the point. The movie barely made sense to me and I couldn't care less about the people in it. It would all be good if the movie were effective art. While the opening scene was interesting and the scene with the giant robotic suits that kept the huge machine gun in the rain cool, it didn't see the film watching. <br /> <br /> Thumbs down.
