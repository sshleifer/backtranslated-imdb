Half of the movie is flashing light and shaky camera. The rest consists of predictable characters (think science against government, 'know-how' against authority, etc.) <br /> <br /> What is the worst aspect of this movie? Is it the cars that are thrown in the first 5 minutes, is the terrible 'Russian' accent of the 'cosmonaut', it's the uninspired characters, the poorly integrated Top 40 hits, or the 'US will save the world' ? No. This is the fact that, despite the "sad" end, there is very little tension in this movie. We basically know what is going to happen. <br /> <br /> The one good part of this movie: "American components, Russian components: all made in Taiwan!"
