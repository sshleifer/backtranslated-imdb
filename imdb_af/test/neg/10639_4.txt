This fourth installment of the series is the latest to get a theater release, though it feels like a live video movie. It's good, but nothing special. The play is the worst of the series so far. And like the third movie, there is not much in the imagination. also the sentence "directed by Alan Smithee" is never a good thing. Creation has been used by the pseudonym directors when they want nothing with the film. , it is an acceptable movie in the Hellraiser series, but not much more. This is a slight drop in the quality of number three and a large decrease in the first two. For me, Hellraiser IV: Bloodline is a 4.5 / 10
