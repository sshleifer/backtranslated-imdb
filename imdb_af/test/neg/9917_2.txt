I sat at home and put channels when I ran over which might sound like an interesting movie. I like Destruction type movies and decided to watch it. I don't know why, but I finally watched the whole 2 hours. We've seen this kind of movie I don't know so many times. <br /> <br /> Back in 1998 - 2000 there were dozens of films that somehow handled global destruction. The best one on my list so far is Deep Impact, which was more credible than this one. Here's my problem with this movie: 1) Cheap special effects, like something from the old computer. 2) No background information or weather pattern explanation. If you want to make a movie about the weather, you have at least some decentness to entertain the viewer with technical details. 3) How just 2 or 3 people come out that the storm falls on Chicago ... no more experts leave the field? 4) Where are some interesting characters? I really don't care for anyone except maybe the pregnant woman. I felt there was no character development. 5) No thoughtful moment so ever and factually wrong. And that's just the first part of the movie. I bet the conclusion will show some devastating scenes and a search and rescue operation, just as it has been done many times before. And by judging the special effects in the first part of the movie, I can only imagine what to expect. Of course, in the end, the main characters will survive and life will continue ... how original
