If you watched the series and love the league as I do, then make sure to be disappointed. I went to the theater with a group of hard-league fans and we all agreed that this movie wasn't as funny or dark as the three series. In my personal opinion, it was a money spinner. The writing was confronted and the plot confused. No confusion was just confused with what it was trying to do. It was self-confidence of the worst kind of writers who are far more talented than my pitiful criticism. I hope the league can at least be honest with itself and admit that this movie is inferior to the excellent three-series. I won't buy it, though I own most of the league memorabilia.
