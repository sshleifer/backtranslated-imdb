I was excited about this movie after reading other reviews. What a disappointment! There are so many ways this movie is bad. The computer graphics had the least. I found the acting stiff and incredible. Look at the sand as the lost "e-pods" (which is an original name!). Where did all the tracks come from? I immediately recognized parts similar to other movies, namely Alien, Pitch Black. Come on, one big ship to transport a prisoner? And what is the prisoner? Does he talk, can he talk? I kept waiting for something to tie the bits of the story together, but it never came. If this movie is made on a low budget, it is shown. The only part of the movie I liked was when it finally ended. I don't mean I stopped, I didn't. I just liked the fact that it was over. A trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable. In my opinion. Don't waste your time on this one.
