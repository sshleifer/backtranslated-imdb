Hitchcock's original classic largely benefited not only from the performance, but also from the look of Anthony Perkins. He projected a kind of rare innocence: a young teenage idol type of persona. He was not an actor who suggested bad things before; He was also not physically fit for the role that the public could suggest a psychopath to look at, especially in the 50's when this ultra-cold aspect of mental illness (cleft personality psychosis) was relatively unavailable in film. That's exactly why his deciding role as Norman Bates was a true Hitchcockian genius. Audiences were surprised to put it softly. <br /> <br /> That's why this reproduction doesn't work, even a little, despite an exact copy. While Anthony Perkins looks like someone you would never consider a serial killer, Vince Vaughn is easy to think of as one. He has the painful look of Perkins, and his acting torches are also clearly inferior, at least in this role (honestly - was there ever an actor able to convey nervousness as real as Anthony Perkins?). While this was a sensible recurrence to begin with, disregarding the main character of the story completely bothered this movie. <br /> <br /> As a lace note, I feel Hollywood's propensity to make movies again. Because 'young people' refuse nothing that is not filmed in color, it not only sticks to the high heaven of corporate greed, but is extremely disrespectful to the original work. What viewers can't see black and white - that's their loss. Hopefully they will find adults somewhere in the future and no longer need shiny colors to keep their attention. When they do, they will discover that sometimes black and white work much better. With the backdrop muted, the story and performances are so much more for and about. And in many cases, the mood or atmosphere created by black and white cinematography is just not feasible in color.
