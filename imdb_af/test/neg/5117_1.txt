What can you say about a movie that "The Erotic Hitch Project" looks like "The English Patient." Again, the plot and characters are secondary, but the plot is almost an exact copy of "TEWP." <br /> <br /> Four buxom sorority sisters and a goofy male guide go in a forest to watch the naked, and the women are sexually charged. The mere swallow leaves porn devices and an inflatable pop, just like in "TEWP." They are lost, the deaf is lost, and the girls find their way back to their hotel. There is the end of the "Blair Witch Project" resumed, as cameras drop and the guide is seen, playing hopscotch, a game integral to the thin plot. <br /> <br /> At least three of the girls' girls here have unnaturally large breasts full of dimples and stretch marks, along with the obvious operation scars. The one "natural" gall is humiliated by the director here. In a very awkward and long time, end credit segment, spending scenes where she couldn't get a line right, it is played over and over. <br /> <br /> Julie Strain is pounding at the bare tip. This one scene seems to be added later, as no one might be able to roll it off. In the background, like the women cavort and stroke, you can see someone's cock fence. This could be the director Jim Wynorski's backyard. <br /> <br /> It's just bad things. The lesbian love scenes are cooler degrees cooler than the "Erotic Witch Project". Most of the lovin consists of the four women who assemble their eight collective breasts. I think they are trying to form a silicon-based life form that will save them from this bad career decision. No luck. If imitation is the sincere form of flattery, then the creators of "The Blair Witch Project" must be really angry. <br /> <br /> It is unclassified and contains light physical violence, strong profanity, female nudity, sexual content and sexual references. <br /> <br />
