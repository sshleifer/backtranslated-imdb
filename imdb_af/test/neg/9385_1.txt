THANK YOU GOD YOU ARE HERE is painful, positively painful. The title is appropriate in a sense, if it is aimed at the large studio audience to laugh as if they are watching the return of the Marx brothers. And trust me, they are paid. <br /> <br /> As creatively barren as the entertainment industry, I refuse to believe that NBC buyers really have confidence in this turkey. On the contrary, I think THANK YOU GOD IS HERE who gets you all who didn't watch or didn't appreciate STUDIO 60, who earlier announced the Peacock Network's Monday night. You want to turn your nose into caviar, good. Here's a beautiful Alpo straight from Menu Foods for you to sneak in.
