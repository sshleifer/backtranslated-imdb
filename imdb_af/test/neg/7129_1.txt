Don't waste your time or money if you see or even rent it. This is by far the worst move I've ever seen. You never get his two hours (WAY too long) back. If you want to be scared, check out something else. We went with someone who still has nightmares over the Gremlins and she wasn't afraid at all. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that make this movie an incredibly poor attempt at making money. Now before I start, let me say I loved the first Grudge! The second, however, is something of a different story. The plot is very in-depth and complicated. But in the end you wonder: "What does it matter if it all goes." The acting will be considered poor in a B-porn movie. I can do a few examples, but I don't want to spoil it for those who are gluten-free, but I can summarize two terrible hours in two simple words .... it spreads.
