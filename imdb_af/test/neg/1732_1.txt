It was funny because the whole thing was so unrealistic. I mean, come on, as a pop star would just appear at a public high school and fall in love with the girl obsessed with him? Come on, people! <br /> <br /> Everyone except the head girl was absolutely horrific at acting. The dialogue was cheesy, the point of departure was stupid and the camera work was poor. I felt I had a bad home video. <br /> <br /> I feel like I have wasted almost 2 hours of my life that I will never return. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else to say except to face myself rather than to watch this movie again.
