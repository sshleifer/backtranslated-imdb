Oh my lord, what did they think about this one? It's not only extremely unfriendly, but worse, a very good original has been scrapped in the bargain. Jane Fonda, believe it or not, actually worked in the execution of her life in that one. Even better than where she plays the whore in the other so-called performance of her life. Maybe she's just flat like a crook. Any other time, wow, wasting time. But she and Segal are beautifully dressed, so if you even get a look at something funny in this baby, take the anvil on which it is hit in a pulp. Because very little of One remains over this abomination. Nothing in this baby is extremely funny, except for maybe a few moments when Dick and Jane are blown up like lepers and can't kiss ..... and uh ........ my lord, that's it ? Well, look like that. <br /> <br /> It's really such a movie.
