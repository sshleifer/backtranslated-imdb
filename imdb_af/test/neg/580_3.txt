Dorothy Provine does the opposite here: She continues to grow and grow. However, I didn't find any subtext. "The Incredible Shrinking Man" and other films of his ilk during the period were parables about radiation, nuclear war and other horrors. Provine's growth is the result of an improper computer / robot. <br /> <br /> And who works this computer but Lou Costello! I love his movies with Bud Abbott. But even though it is a very bad movie, he does well without him. And Gale Green is an excellent foil. <br /> <br /> Green plays the pope bounty. He's Provine's father. He plans to be elected mayor. So when his beloved daughter starts having trouble, he dumps her. He doesn't exactly dip her, but gives his fight against her long-standing fan Costello. <br /> <br /> It's pretty flawless: Costello is the local garbage collector. <br /> <br /> The special effects are minimal. And the subplot in which the army is involved is lame in the extreme.
