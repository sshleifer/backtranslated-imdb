Comedy is a hard animal to conquer. Ishimoto fails on all accounts, as author and director. Some things, like making movies that are funny, should only be left to the professionals. 1 out of 10. Awful. It wasn't funny. I tried to laugh, but it was just not funny. I wasn't the only one, no one else at the Chicago Festival laughed, at least on the show I saw. Simply very bad, sorry :(
