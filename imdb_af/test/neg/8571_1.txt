Overview: Nunsploitation films. They've been around forever. A few who keep in mind are the Mexican devil worshiping film Alucarda, Night of Demons 2, The Convent and of course Dante Tomasellis Desecration. Can't blame anyone for trying to use a religious / sacred image and turn it around to make it frightening. If done right, it works. Here's the most recent addition to the nunsploitation subgenre, called The Nun. <br /> <br /> The story is about this group of girls living in a Catholic school. In this school there is a nun that is particularly cruel to one of the girls. The girls who act in self-defense against the abusive nun accidentally kill her and then decide to bury her and not tell anyone. Fast forward 18 years later and the nun is looking for revenge from those who killed her. <br /> <br /> This movie was produced by Brian Yuzna's Fantastic Factory. You know, the company that makes horror movies in Spain. Need a reminder of the kind of movies this company looks for? Well, here's a little reminder: Arachnid, Darkness, Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt, Rottweiler. You get the picture. About the only good movie this company produced (in my opinion) was Stuart Gordon's Dagon. That's it. Oh no, wait, I believe they also manufactured the excellent Christian Bale vehicle, The Machinist. But that's it. So when I hired this movie, I knew I was not going to see anything that was well-despised. Yet, with all the mental preparation, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> One of the only good things this movie is about is its smooth appearance. The movie has some fine cinematography. It doesn't look like a cheap horror movie. The movies special effects were good, with The Nun traveling through water. Well, it was an image it made for a few fine moments that sometimes scratched the coast, but sometimes it was cool enough to watch. I dug that scene while the Nun threw her on people like a bucket of water. It's not a particularly deadly move, but it has made for a cool vision. There are a few gores here, but not many of them. One particular scene where a lift was dead was cool, but unfortunately the movie reached its peak with that scene. And it was only halfway through. Then nothing really cool, and the movie is being seduced in an incredible drill festival. <br /> <br /> The movie just gets stuck in The Nun every now and then to scare us. She'll kill someone and then cut it! We come back to the characters talking, going through the rooms, opening doors, getting the drill. And I personally hate it only when a horror movie changes through it. People open doors and go into rooms. Boring! And when the characters talk about their terrible dialogue. In a particularly silly scene, a character straight out of the blue decides that the nun turns into flesh and blood when she is in the water, so they can go to kill her. And everyone just says OK! And they all extend this plan to kill the nun in a water tank. Now, who gave the guy this information and why did the other just take it for granted? Who knows hell, but his scenes are so foolish that the movie looks stupid. <br /> <br /> And another thing that got in the way of my enjoyment of this movie was the fact that they used Spanish actors who had a very thick accent. When they try to speak English, it is very difficult to figure out what the hell they are trying to say. I prefer to watch them, then try to figure out what they say and get frustrated. The fact that this DVD has no English subtitles also did not help. <br /> <br /> Finally, this is a movie with a few slim statues, good sound effects, but a terribly horrible script. I think it just shows that you can have the biggest budget or special effects, but if your movie has a bad writing with terrible characters and situations your audience can't join, then you have another bad movie. So was the case with The NUN. <br /> <br /> If you want a little fun with evil nuns, hire one of the movies I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Now, as for the creators of this movie, they must say ten hail mares and light fifty candles to their saint of choice to see if they will be forgiven to make this sinful horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5.
