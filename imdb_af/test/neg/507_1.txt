Let's look. What irritated me most? The extra-long dance scene in the beginning to watch people spin like this has made me dizzy. Without showing where the music came from ......................................... Or maybe it was the fact that every scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than they had to. What a dress this movie is. And the most annoying aspect is the bad guys are so bad, so obviously terrible that the director seems to be making this movie for second graders. "These people are bad ... These people are good". When a movie has its agenda heart on it, I'm next to myself. There is a scene in a roller skating rink that looks completely out of place. Long stretched love scenes featuring the main character and a Russian prostitute who looks more like a rock star and his sexy group. John Hurt's character, which is part of the overall start-up scene, drinks and disagrees with the exaggerated villains. His death scene may well be the stupidest thing in history. And I hear everyone, even the haters of this movie, talking about how beautiful the movie is. I think it seems wiped out. See "Days of Heaven" if you want to see a beautiful backyard. This movie is even worse than the anti-hype. It's useless. The epilogue, which shows the main character in a yacht, was almost as stupid as the prologue. The battle scenes are boring and dizzy. This movie is really bad. Avoid it unless you love bad movies because it is the king of them.
