Companies seem to be paying for services following an unusual pro-movie comment on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible. The plot was stupid. The acting was poor. The jokes were not even funny. The film included minor nudity of what looks like porn actresses, but none of the other characters. <br /> <br /> It was clear from the first 15 minutes that the movie wasn't funny. There was a little slapstick here and there, but most of the humor had to be derived from the characters talking behind each other's backs and spreading rumors. It's not even done well. Every joke is obvious and you see it coming. <br /> <br /> The movie is faster or better, but don't look. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to watch this movie and if I were the studio and distributor for 1.5 hours that they were designing from me, I would.
