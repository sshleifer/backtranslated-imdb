A poor basketball movie. A gruff coach with a dubious background comes in the 1950s to a small Indiana basketball team in the mid-fifties and coaches the boys to victory by breaking them first and then building them. <br /> <br /> Not bad subject. Photography OK. But the plot is completely predictable. No real subtotives. Nothing added to make the movie exciting. You know what will happen from the beginning. Suitable for 4th graders.
