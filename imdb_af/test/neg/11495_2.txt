I just watched Icon on DVD and despite being a good book, the movie is a poor substrate from it. Those responsible for writing should be banned from Siberia. Why they crap the wonderful story with all sorts of C film that is totally irrelevant to the story is completely out of my mind. <br /> <br /> But the filmmakers and role players do the best to make something out of it, but in the end the movie was not at all satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Can someone please make a decent movie to show you how to do it. I'm sure the crowd will rally for such a masterpiece novel into a book, not in a cheap C movie.
