I watched this movie to see the direction of one of the most promising young talents in movies. Unfortunately, Leelee Sobieski with this movie chose a road that was not only well behaved, but totally free of any meaningful destination. This movie uses every hackneyed trick in the book to leave the screen, tap on the shoulder and kindly ask if it can have your passion so that it can give them a good tug. Romance can be done well, and when it is, the viewer is left to feel the love depicted on the screen. During the emotional climax of this movie, I laughed. Harte. To save you time and money, I suggest, instead of watching this movie, a Karostroop and Velveeta meal. It's about the same.
