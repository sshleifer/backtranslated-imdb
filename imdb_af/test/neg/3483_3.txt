This movie is a great stereotype. The acting (except Philbin & Harrison) is terrible and the terrible script just makes things worse. I have to agree with another review that the "local" characters sound ridiculous, so do the "Caucasian" characters. 3 stars out of 10 for 1) Philbin 2) Harrison 3) surf scenes. (1/2 * from ****) Watch "Aloha Summer" (**) and / or "Beyond Paradise" (***) for Hawaii, right, especially BP I found entertaining and brilliant.
