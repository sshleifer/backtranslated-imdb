I saw this movie because of the single positive review and I can only think that the man is a shill. <br /> <br /> The play of the female lead is actually pretty good, but the whole movie is just as stupidly boring, I hardly managed to put it through. This is the definition of dull. <br /> <br /> So far, this movie is considered to be 8 out of 10 out of 7 votes. This must mean that the director, director's friend, producer, actress and drinking friends gave their own film a 10. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you, who just want to entertain or enjoy a good story, avoid this. <br /> <br /> This man on the street will give it a 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> FDA Note: while this movie can be used as an aide to get a good night, no medical value is implied or offered.
