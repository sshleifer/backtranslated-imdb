It's as depressed as filmmakers are trying to be cool and it's so obvious here. It has an average acting, ridiculous dialogue, split-hard-to-watch screens, and lots of goofs trying to be a movie and autobiographical era. This film should be avoided at all costs. I was told not to watch this movie. I wish I had listened.
