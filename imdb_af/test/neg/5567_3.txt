In the early 00's, production companies had a short-lived maze for supernatural genre films in France after "The Crimson Rivers" and "Brotherhood of the Wolf" became hits. So there are several movies relieved or saved from their "direct-to-video" fate. France, unlike the US, the United Kingdom or Italy, however, has little tradition of fantasy B movies and it quickly showed that the "Samourais", "Bloody Mallory" or "Crimson Rivers" prosecuted were bad attempts to recreated. a kind of magic that never existed in the French film in the first place. As they walked, producers returned to their usual prize: derivative conquests or the umpteenth self-referring tribute to French New Wave by a former critic of Les Cahiers du cinema. <br /> <br /> "Brocéliande" could be green light during this brief window as it has no other noticeable purpose. It's your at-the-book slasher movie mixed with vague mythological elements and horror references and you'll find bimboesque female characters, a French University looks like an American campus and plot turns so lazy, you don't even care, because you guessed it. Even an hour before, even before the movie starts. <br /> <br /> These elements make the fun of a B-movie of a 70's or an 80's and you expect them to be in a 70's or 80's movie. However, we are no longer in the 80's and no one has warned director Doug Headline, as this tribute to the slasher movie genre is nothing more than a derivative movie. Capital letter itself is not a newcomer and has been criticizing this kind of photo since the early 80's, but as a first-time director he shows a lack of skill and ambition that Brocéliande drills. <br /> <br /> If you compile clichés from a movie subcategory and hand it to a skilled and resourceful director like West Craven or Quentin Tarantino, you get a "Scream" or a "Death Proof", movies which is imitating old guilty pleasure, but also enlarges these cliches and adds a lot to them. It is called 'talent' and therefore you cannot confuse these recent movies with their original inspiration shot decades ago. <br /> <br /> "Brocéliande" takes the lazy road and reproduces only the worst elements of previous movies (unfortunately For the male viewer, the free nudity is mostly missing). There are many similarities (presumably unconscious) between the plot of "Brocéliande" and the astonished "Halloween 3: Season of the Witch", as they both deal with supernatural Druidian evil rituals and some silly attempts to make the world on Halloween night take over. As even the plot of "Halloween 3" makes more sense than this one, it means something seriously wrong with "Brocéliande".
