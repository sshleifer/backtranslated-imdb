I would like to know who involved the producers of this movie to pay for its production. It is a genius of all kinds. This movie somehow kept my attention for about two-thirds of me until I realized it was going nowhere fast. I think the music managed to make it look like something was going on, but nothing really was. It wasn't scary. The dialogue was poorly written. The first 90 minutes had to be covered in about 15 minutes. It would have been a moderately acceptable Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode. <br /> <br /> At this stage I'm just crazy that I wasted that time. It's a few hours I will never come back. <br /> <br /> I hope these comments save someone to waste tonight. Take a nap or hit the gym instead. Or if you want to be scared, switch on a cable news channel.
