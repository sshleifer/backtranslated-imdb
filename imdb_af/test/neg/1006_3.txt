I will place Death Wish 3 in the same box as Stallone's Cobra and Commando. The box I sold for $ 2 at a garage sale with all the videos will sell. The story is about the main character coming back from previous films' success to destroy it all with this garbage rubbish. Why the makers wanted to destroy the reputation of the past 2 movies with this cheap junk. The story is such a lame that had to be a scandalous follow-up. I mentioned Cobra earlier because it has the same mood, that one man can kill 20 or 30 gangsters without a scratch. Both this movie and Cobra were bent to show that the hero fired his rifle guns and dropped the enemy into large numbers. Police officers spend hours on the shooting range, so why are they shot by gangsters, deliberately fired from their hips? This movie was so bad I thought it was a moment it was Death Wish 4.
