I never meant to write a review of this movie. Actually, I was just looking for the name of the star of the movie and then I started reading reviews ... I think I'll never learn. This movie is horrible! I'm not going to justify my comments with specific reasons, because I really find it hard to believe that anyone with any taste really looks like it. A guilty pleasure? All right, I think. But a movie that is bad that talent has been wasted so well (Caine, Gelbart, and Donen) is a cause for grief, not a pleasant distraction. A low point for everyone involved, except maybe Bologna, who has to spend nights trying to figure out what bomb was the bomb that destroyed his career.
