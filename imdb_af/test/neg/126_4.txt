Worth appreciating the entertainment of a rental, especially if you like action movies. This one contains the usual motor yacht, fighting with the great Van Damme kicking style, shooting battles with the 40 case gun rifle, and even terrorist style bombs. All these things are entertaining and skillful, but there is nothing that really blows you away when you have seen your share before. <br /> <br /> The plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a hare, who is smart, but hardly deep. Many of the characters are heavily stereotyped - the malignant veterans, the terrible illegal aliens, the ardent policemen, the indifferent evildoers, the naughty lady station chief, the crooked politician, the fat federal who seem to have been broadcast like the Mexican. A 1940's Hollywood movie. Everything went well, but nothing else. <br /> <br /> I thought the main villains were doing pretty well and behaving fairly well. By the end of the movie you definitely knew who the good guys were and were. There was an emotional lift, because the really bad people had their net deserts. Very simplistic, but don't you expect Hamlet? The only thing I found really annoying was the constant cut to VD's daughter during the last battle scene. <br /> <br /> Not bad. Not good. Suitable 4.
