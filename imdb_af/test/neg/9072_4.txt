Ed (Kel Mitchell) is a teenager who stands for his job at Good Burger, a small but friendly neighbor burger, while his friend Dexter (Kennan Thompson) is also working there, but not Ed's quirky commitment to his work, because he is there because he accidentally got the car from his teacher mr. Wheat (Sinbad) car destroys and needs to raise money to pay for the damage. When Mondo Burger, a giant footstool, opens across the street, it seems Good Burger history is until Ed formulates a secret sauce that brings hundreds of new clients to their door. However, the monomaniacal manager of Mondo Burger, Kurt (Jan Schweiterman), is determined to get his hands on the sauce and run Good Burger. Meanwhile, Ed and Dexter Otis (Abe Vigoda), the world's oldest fast-food employee, have to save the Demented Hills Asylum, and Ed may only find love with Monique (Shar Jackson) if he can think long enough of the citizens to pay attention to her. Good Burger is a comedy for kids, decent story, acting, and overall a beautiful, harmless child movie.
