If I were one, it was probably a brainchild at the moment to rent it. Anyone who actually buys it will like to use it as a coaster. Maybe a frisbee? This is a DVD I actually encountered where the kids could get there. Since DVDs are not in the position to be in the storytelling room with all the big boxes of the tires, I find it rather annoying that they are tied to a disney movie. Yep, going from Dinosaur to Erotic Ghost showed what we all think of Disney right? I didn't bend a bit. There is no action in this. The only thing interesting is the old 1973 movie fans for ollllld-old erotic movies that I was amazed at. They escaped to be burned to hell. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (if imdb is allowed, it will be 1/10)
