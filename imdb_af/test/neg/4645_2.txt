After reading both _River_God_ and _The_Seventh_Scroll_, I can't begin to express how disappointed I was with this movie. While I agree, a poetic license may be open. This film is in constant deviation with the books, and makes an incredible injustice to the exciting, probable and wonderful stories written by Wilbur Smith. I can only believe that the authors, directors and producers of the movie have never been to Mr. Smith did not hear, let alone his work. Smith's vibrant characterization is transformed into wooden stick figures, all historicity is ignored or discounted. The realism of the books has been changed to include phantom samples that are more suitable for a cartoon. And why does an Egyptian spokesman speak Spanish? Spirit, no wonder, the movie is made in a TV miniseries! Did Wilbur Smith have any input in making this movie? I can't believe he did it. Terrible, terrible movie. If you've read one or both books, don't waste your time or money looking at this money. You will be very disappointed, I assure you. <br /> <br /> Just a moment of supremacy persuaded me to give this movie a "2" position, and that's just because of the beautiful, sometimes spectacular photography.
