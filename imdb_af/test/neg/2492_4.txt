There are many other comments on how poor this film is. What I wanted to show is how this film took the biggest scientific project in history and made it look small. The Manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was great. Almost all the silver in the country made the wire for electromagnetic separators. If there was a choice between two alternative ways to do things, they just did both. The first sustained nuclear reactor was kicked off from the University of Chicago's soccer stadium at the outset with graduate students who were as scram mechanisms. It's a fascinating story that includes hundreds of sites and thousands of people who look like a small group of eccentrics in New Mexico. <br /> <br /> The other thing I really didn't like was the big moral debate about whether we should continue the project after Germany delivers. Well, we have thousands (mostly) men who have worked for many years to make a huge boom. Does anyone think they don't want it to work? At that time, there was a controversy over whether to use the device, but it was not so serious, clearly not the big debate this film makes.
