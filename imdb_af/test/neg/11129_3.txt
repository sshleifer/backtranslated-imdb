What a boring movie. While it had humorous parts, it was just boring and long (for a 90 minute movie). I believe the cause was a lack of action. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I expected white blood cells to fight the evil viruses, but no luck. It was more that the virus was thwarted than defeated. <br /> <br /> The film had promise, but as it was kept in mind for small children, it did not reach my potential.
