"Jefferson in Paris" is a really shamed movie. It offers Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) the most unobtrusive light, paints him as a liar, racist and pedophile, but does not yet condemn the sins. This is the way he was, the movie seems to say. The end of the sentence, the end of the movie, the door behind you. <br /> <br /> After arriving in Paris with his daughter Patsy (Gwenyth Paltrow), Jefferson continues to win the heart of Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the woman. from a homosexual English painter (the criminal underutilized Simon Callow). However, a birth event sends Maria to England, and Jefferson passes her with an astonishing speed for a man who only asked a few minutes from the screen to live with him in America. <br /> <br /> He's enchanted, you see, by Sally Hemmings (Thandie Newton), one of his slaves just arrived from America. Just why he is aware, it's hard to tell - although Sally is undoubtedly beautiful, she acts like a simple child to Jefferson. When she does not tell ghost stories in exaggerated "dark" speech patterns, she sharpenes his bedroom, and sniffs at her main mass. <br /> <br /> If her behavior is an attempt to excuse Jefferson's, don't make it work. Jefferson goes beyond Mary, tired of waiting for his letters, traveling from England to see him. I did not change to you, he says and offers poor excuses not to write. To her credit, Maria immediately saw through his false wings. When Sally appears, and she and Jefferson openly (and cruelly, in my mind) flirt in Mary's presence, the illusion is completely out. <br /> <br /> No one believes today that Jefferson, Washington and the rest were full. paragons of virtue and morality. Yet we have to believe that the scholar, distinguished Jefferson, will be attracted to Sally, a woman whose most intelligent conversation is about how a mass's French friends do not 'swear', and that rubs herself in front as she passes by , Right before Maria's eyes? <br /> <br /> Even if we slip it, it is followed by the terrible revelation that Sally was only 15 when this relationship took place (Jefferson was 41). Strangely, this fact just comes to an end when Sally's brother, James, is sensibly furious with her blasphemous announcement that she is wearing Jefferson's child. <br /> <br /> Jefferson was as blistered as he told Sally to carry his child. , and told her she would be much better off under his protection than free and in France with her brother. But, he promises, I'll leave her if I die and our children (including more coming, says Jefferson, in a different statement from Sally as * his *) when they reach 21. Oh, thank you, mass, you feel like telling the screen. Big deal. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is still to come, with Jefferson's daughter Patsy. She is already angry with him, first to break his vow, to make her mother on her deathbed, not to marry again. (It was clear that the woman is not just talking about marriage.) Jefferson also refused to allow Patsy to become a nun, regardless of earlier moralisation over religious freedom (ie freedom to agree with him). <Br /> <br /> After she promised Sally and her brother their freedom, Jefferson called in Patsy to see the bargain and promised to fulfill it if something happened to him. Sally's brother fades the approaching birth of the child, and Jefferson asks, "do you swear?" Paltrow's performance in this scene is brilliant, though she has almost nothing to say. Her face is almost in pain with this revelation, but she controls her sadness and whispers. <br /> <br /> If anything, and the filmmakers could have had something to emphasize this point, "Jefferson in Paris" is an indication of the status of the woman in the late 18th century, even by men like Jefferson as attractive property, pleasant but without real intellect or souls. We see that Jefferson sends a few tears over a letter from Mary, and of course he tells him where to go, but he soon laughs at a wild dance from Sally, with a split hair and hip breast. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it's an accurate portrait of Jefferson or not. I don't mind looking at it, but just looking at it. This Jefferson is no hero or even an anti-hero. He is a selfish, lying child molester - and one who gets away with it - not the kind of man I want to see.
