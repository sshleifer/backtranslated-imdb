It's just another of those "American finds romance with a charming stranger in exotic European country." This genre has been bankrupt since the 1950s, but they continue to squeeze them out. I told my friend to see it - bad idea, we both hated it. If everything you want to see is Tuscany, try to watch "Stealing Beauty" with Liv Tyler - a slightly better movie. <br /> <br /> These types of genre movies are very much Hallmark Greeting Card-ish.
