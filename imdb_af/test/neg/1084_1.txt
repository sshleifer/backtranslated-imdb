I'll say it again ... one of the worst movies ever made and made by the director who made one of my most favorite movies - "Excalibur". I was on the floor to see that it achieved a grade of over six. This movie sucks. It looks terrible. It looked like it was shot in 18 days and Boorman had to sleep when he directed it. Arquette did nothing. Just awful, rotten, unbearable and probably the only void in Boorman's famous career. <br /> <br /> 1/10 !!!!!
