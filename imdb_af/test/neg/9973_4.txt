I am looking forward to watching this movie and was therefore extremely disappointed when I found it completely and completely rubbish. Akerman's direction is both heavily handed and clipped (how much more clicks can you get as Paris at night?). The male looks completely selected for their revival to Egon Schiele's fearful self-portraits. Yet, the themes of jealousy and betrayal that had to be the primary focus of such a film were virtually untapped. What remains is a tedious melodrama that takes a lifetime to begin and even longer to end. The only advantage with this kind of movie is that it makes you realize how good Goddard and Truffaut really are.
