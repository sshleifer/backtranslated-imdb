It's a very bad waste of your time. I'd probably rather watch documentary than that; It's really that bad. <br /> <br /> The play is really awful and you can say that the producers have a low budget due to the terrible picture quality. It is by far the low end of the scale; Don't waste your money on it. <br /> <br /> I have a very hard time believing that the person who made this movie will do it well. I had to see it with the kids when my mother rented it because she thought it would be good for the children. Even the children (3, 4, 6 and 8) all thought it was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> I agree with the other comments, Spongebob will be much better looking than this. <br /> <br /> Overall: Don't look. Don't do it. Don't do it.
