With an interesting starting point (in the conflict between Europeans and indigenous people, the lines of battle were sometimes not so clear), it had to be a good movie. But the story is sabotaged by the director's overwhelming imagination with its own cunning that is distorted with a very poor writing. <br /> <br /> Yes, the natural environment is beautiful and yes, the film is authentic to the historic environment of the 19th century. . But the filmmaker keeps the lily over and over again, adding low on the lowest musical accompaniment, not a completely unnecessary voice over to the soundtrack, which eventually overwhelms the viewer and, by paying attention to himself, takes away from the story. <br /> <br /> For me, it was clear that the director, with his microscopic mimicry and the endless repetition of the musical motif of "Danny Boy" (of all things!) tried to create a New Zealand version of to make an epic Sergio Leone movie, in the order of Once Upon A Time in the West. But the seriousness of the story (most of Leone's westerns was tongue-in-cheek), not to mention that it's no longer in 1968, he manages to make a parody of one. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
