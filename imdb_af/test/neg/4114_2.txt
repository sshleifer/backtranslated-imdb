Ray Bradbury, run and hide! This tough film version of his 1950s short story about time travel and the effect it can have on depopulation is not known from the scene (did it have one?) And now exists as a DVD on the shelves being released during a slow week. <br /> <br /> What seems to be a fine sci-fi thriller of the opening screens makes us foolish as the computer-generated graphics move indifferently through a movie that is supposed to be different . travel back in time when a big company sold macho guys in 2055 the chance to hunt dinosaurs by paying excessive fees to return to prehistoric jungles in time. One glimpse of the foot / butterfly while on one of these businesses and the evolution course is changing with the resulting time waves that roll over the planet, which changes everything to eat plants and beasts. Of course there is a pretty girl who knows how to reverse the process and a brave man to risk his life acting on her orders and everything is OK. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's the story ... and the most surprising fact of this poorly written, abysmally organized mess of a movie is that it has attracted a fine talent to portray the comic book characters . Edward Burns (all buff and base) is our hero, Ben Kingsley is the required bad corporate man who wears a ridiculous white wig, Catherine McCormack is the expert all-woman creator and Wilfried Hochholdinger as an excellent and excellent actor. knew better than to be in line with this flop. And the saddest thing is for those who love this genre of sci-fi monster thrillers, the creative department chosen with some of the corniest animations to hit the screen for a long time. A must miss.
