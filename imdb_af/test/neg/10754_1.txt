I saw this film as a birthday treat at the London National Film Theater last night. It was the first time I saw it, and I think it took over the terrible Twister as the worst movie I have ever seen. Unsuitable for no reason, self indulgent and full of images that oscillate from the crass and clearly shot for the dark and incomprehensible, not particularly beautiful or grim, I really do not understand why it is considered classic, gay or otherwise. I usually enjoy movies that have boundaries or even movies that are difficult to watch because of their length or unusual cinematography. But it was really, really terrible.
