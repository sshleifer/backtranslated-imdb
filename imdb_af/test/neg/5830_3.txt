Final Concept - A scriptwriter (James Van Der Beek) joins himself in his flat and suggests psychosis in an attempt to write a horror script. Not a terrible point of departure, but execution is terrible. It feels like a first-year direction and writing, and probably is. The director jumps out of hell. It is meant to be disorientation. What this is is irritating. So much so that small pieces of film are unattractive. The writing is predictable and does not use the following on most of the ideas it offers (oranges). It's as if they were demolished and beaten for the Toronto movie festival. <br /> <br /> This movie is not jaw-droply "oh my god it's so bad it's good" bad. It is boring and annoying you for a long time afterwards. James Van Der Beek is not a terrible actor and barely holds the ship above water. But he is too normal for the kind of psychosis that the film is trying to offer. He is simply a withdrawal guy who someday sees people and hallucines things, then decides to be weak. Cause follows effect. Maybe there's something in the water. Now Darryn Lucio, who plays his "friend", is a terrible actor. He shares Chris O'Donald's likeness and is even more annoying, a superhuman performance. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere the movie offers is good (dull gray and gloomy), but that's the only thing the movie achieves. that means nothing. This film wants Jacobs Ladder or The Machinist. It's not even a secret window. This is the preppy girl in the class who decides to turn goth. <br /> <br /> Not unnecessarily terrible, but its mere stupidity will come to you. I've already thought of this idea more than the filmmakers did for this. <br /> <br /> D
