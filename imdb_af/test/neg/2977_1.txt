Although I recently tried to avoid German films, positive reviews prevented me from renting this one. There I was again let down by the German media who repeatedly provoked domestic movie. To me it is no wonder that no one abroad wants to see this crap. The idea of ​​making this movie is by no means an idea (I think a fool reads a female magazine article about speed dating). In short: the characters (which are nothing), dialogue and content are so surprisingly trivial, trite and cliché-driven, I continued to look, because I could hardly believe what I saw. VAT to name the flat theses that are mechanically delivered by the numbers (definitely from the mentioned journals) dialogue will simply not be correct. Acting is so over-the-top, I can't remember worse than it on the screen over a long time. You have to guess the director has / has no idea at all. Surprisingly, distributors and producers across the country are still wondering why German films (with exceptional exceptions) worldwide do not generate interest. Why? Because it's wasting time and money.
