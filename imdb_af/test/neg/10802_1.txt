But at least this movie it deserved was sent to the Satellite of Love to be mocked by Mike, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot of Pearl Forrester at "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" "Soultaker" is one of those lost, forgotten movies that is so bad you will have nightmares or depression later in life. Even though the film isn't that old, it's still a very forgotten movie. If it had never been to the intelligent minds of Mystery Science Theater 3000, the movie would not only seem like it was made, but the movie won't be very enjoyable by our movies. <br /> <br /> In real life: this movie is really bad. In the Satellite of Love: this movie is excellent!
