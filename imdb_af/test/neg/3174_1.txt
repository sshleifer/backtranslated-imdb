This movie is terribly bad. You can see that all the actors are ashamed to be associated with such a truly horrible movie. There are clear budget constraints, but with a little attention and attention to detail, the movie may have been so much better. For example, look at the scene where Mickey first goes to the mortuary and talks to his friend the pathologist while the murdered taxi driver is lying on the board. You can actually see the body's breathing! What can't they afford to rent half a decent extra that can hold its breath for a 2-minute scene?!
