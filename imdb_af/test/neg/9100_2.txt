Alain Resnais leads three parallel stories dealing with fantasy and imagination in the adult world. In one of them is a kind of operational bordello story where a rejected architect tries to manipulate a group of people in congratulations. Just his attempt misses the only real goal, the woman he is painful at. In the same unfinished castle he built, a group of teachers searched for love in a more modern story, as one woman undeniably believes in the role of romance and the cynical anthropologist tries to teach her a lesson through her with the biggest push. the group. Meanwhile, a lot of children are fantasizing a George Melies-like adventure of a prince who saves a girl in need of swamp, and then kills the evil king, who brings about the kingdom of love. The two primary themes? Life is a fairy tale, and life is not a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> What sounds better than the movie actually is. Resnais is the type of director where often the concept is good or bad, but is the outline that matters; here the concept is great, but the movie is straightforward to look at. Horridly songs, bubbly characters without an odd dimension, background of sickly pastel - instead of giving your inner child an ice cream cone, Resnais drowns it in a bucket of cakes. Add some French philosophy and you get a weird witch's bread, one that doesn't bump bubble and trouble, but just put a little wrong in your stomach until you want to relive it. <br /> <br /> Resnais is a risk director, and even in the worst you can see he is trying something that might not work with full clarity of action. If I want to go home, he manages to draw staggering characters and ditzy pieces by showing some real changes and stopping for a moment to breathe. Here, he immerses directly in a fantasy that doesn't really reflect fantasy, just the baby's room paper reference. The biggest problem is that he somehow managed to make a movie more flamboyant than an 80-year-old pop video, and more kitsch than the Golden Era Hollywood musicals. The fantasies are beyond childish and naive, but the film (with nudity and curse) is certainly aimed at adults, a target that he certainly missed. <br /> <br /> However, he now keeps his theme and never back pedals. Anything, this movie is impressive simply because it is unapologetic. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
