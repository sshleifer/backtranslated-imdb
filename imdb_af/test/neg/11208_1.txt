For many years I have seen this movie as a real movie of ninjas, but after learning more about this culture, I just think it's just another karate movie. A black shinobi and some weapons don't make a ninja, it's much more than that. The ninja is Japan's most dangerous warrior because they are trained in every aspect of life to survive and kill anything they try to stop. This movie is not about a ninja warrior, just about a clown trying to be something he can't even understand.
