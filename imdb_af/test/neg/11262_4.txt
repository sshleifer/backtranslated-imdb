I read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke's Robicheaux mysteries. When I read In The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead, it was filmed and Tommy Lee Jones starred. I was excited. After watching it last night, I finally left it with about twenty minutes, and didn't want to see people shoot or hit. Don't get me wrong, I don't care about blood and gore. I love 'The Untouchables' and 'The Godfather Trilogy'. Perhaps it was just that I had previously seen 'birth' and 'just happened'. I know that Burke's books are violent, lyrical, and especially in the case of 'In The Electric Mist', like the Cajun swamps he writes about, full of things that are never completely explained. In a book it is good. In a movie it is confusing. Many of the previous reviewers are also devoted fans of Dave Robicheaux, making it more understandable that they really like the movie. Or they are admirers of Bernard Tavernier or both. Even as a fan of all the actors (and especially Vince), I felt it was such a waste of their talents overall - they had good performances in a movie that didn't hold together. Now I say this after I just watched the US DVD and hope Tavernier's track will make a big difference. On the plus side: The soundtrack was great. The screens at Robicheaux's place were perfect - just as I thought the bait shop would look. Mary Steenburgen was excellent as Bootsie, as Walter Breaux as Batist. When you read the books, you know why Robicheaux is a smooth person at the beginning of the movie, and then wakes up with people with different instruments. Overall I wish they had filmed more of the 'Electric Mist and Confederate Dead' and left large parts of Robicheaux's interrogation methods, explaining Elrod's gifts and his ties to Dave, as well as Dave's to the general. Then I do not feel like I did last night when I switched it off, "What just happened?"
