The worst of the 'old' Star Trek movies, this movie suffers from a horrible script and clear budget constraints, especially in the ill-fated final. The legs of a good movie are here, and the director of Shatner is not as bad as usual, but the characters end up talking and acting out of style that the previous 3 films have carefully established. Lawrence Luckinbull is convincing as the apostate Vulcan with mierious and mystical powers to influence people and these powers are responsible for some of the best scenes, especially for Deforest Kelley who in this is his second final role as 'Bones' McCoy. But as good as those scenes, they are ultimately not the plot of the plot, and finally feel more of a distraction. A good score of the ever-reliable Goldsmith and some funny scenes in Yosemite between the head three is not enough to cover the gaping monasteries in the plot, and the first-class embarrassing efforts to serve humor only serve the harsh to remove drafts. All in all, a myriad of possibilities which, while it cannot deliver, has moments. Watch out for the pool table in the barbrawl scene ...
