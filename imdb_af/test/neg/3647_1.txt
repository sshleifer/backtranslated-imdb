Just do some research on making this movie. Something as simple as a Google search. It was funded by the US Army and promoted just in time for the election. It's a good idea, but I'd rather see a document, not something that was edited by the Bush administration and told it its reality. The timing of the movie's release, the tone, and the fact that MS & L promoted it, raised questions about the intent of the movie. According to Mr. MS & L MD Joe Gleason, he and his colleagues are also delivering important targeted messages on Iraq war to specific constituencies, "Eartha Melzer wrote." Was the leaning art house occupying one of those constituencies? Is Government Increasing Documentary Filmmakers To Propagate The American People? No one involved in the film is willing to say who initially put the money into the film or how they are eventually represented by the military's PR firm. "
