Red Sonja is a career-step-in-the-wrong direction for Arnold Schwarzenegger. After making some magic films (such as Conan), he played a role in slightly more serious role-players in films such as The Terminator and Commando, just to make a mystical return to the sword a "magic genre for this 1985 debacle. It's hard to figure out why he is bothering, as it is weaker than both Conan movies in every imaginable section. It was allegedly the third Conan movie, but for some reason the emphasis was shifted to the leading female character, the titular redhead, who left poor old Arnold to play an incredibly boring supporting role. Also save a thought for director Richard Fleischer, who has given world classics such as 20,000 underwater leagues, Fantastic Voyage, The Boston Strangler and 10 Rillington Place. In this - his penultimate film - Fleischer has also retreated a huge career step. <br /> <br /> Evil Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman) wants to rule the world, and she needs a valuable and powerful talisman to do so. She and her brutal army admire priestesses and steal the said talisman and defeat the helpless priestesses as they go. One of the deadly priests has a sister named Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen), a fiery redhead warrior, who hears the bad Gedren's revenge over the sister's death. Sonja drives across the country looking for Gedren's camp. Along the way she comes on traveling companions in the form of a son prince, Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his bodyguard Falkon (Paul Smith). She also meets the muscular warrior Conan - sorry, I mean Kalidor (!) - who offers to join her in her quest. Initially, Sonja does not want the help of Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), rather to prove that she can confront and defeat her enemies alone, but eventually she warms him and accepts his help. <br /> <br /> Red Sonja is a surprisingly poor movie, all the more when one thinks it was made in 1985 when the sword was a 'magic genre near its end. It seems so simplistic and amateur that you can easily miss it for an early example of its kind. The performances are poor overall, ranging from Bergman's embarrassment, OTT villain, to Reyes' incredibly annoying brat for Schwarzenegger's wood and unenthusiastic hero. Nielsen is a little better than the heroine - presumably full of enthusiasm for being in her first role - but she is very much dropped by the stupidity of Clive Exton and George MacDonald Fraser's script. The movie is hit with goofs, including a scene where Schwarzenegger is seen in the near future, but in a long shot in the same order there is no body in sight. Technically, it is also very unsuitable, with sub-standard special effects and terrible mechanical samples. There are a few compensations, such as Ennio Morricone's enjoyable music (Morricone spent much of the 80's and donated good music for horrible movies, such as The Island, Treasure of the Four Crowns and Hundra). Another remuneration is Giuseppe Rotunno's lull from the venues - much of the time being much more enjoyable to look at the beautiful scenery than the actors stand out in front of! There were very few swords' drama movies to Red Sonja, so in some ways it could go down in history than the movie that destroyed its own genre.
