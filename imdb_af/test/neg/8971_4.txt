It feels very stilted and condescending to a great extent. The whole plot is extremely necessary - especially the "gallant" effort to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic overtone (especially by the front lady) stirs slightly. <br /> <br /> But there are one or two comics moments that help ease the boredom, and the dance is really nice (especially for alleged amateurs - ha, ha!) <br /> <br /> The shop owner and young man doing spectacular dance were exceptional highlights. And I also like Peter Hayes' impressions of Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman.
