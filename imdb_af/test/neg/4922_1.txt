Movies just aren't worse than that. Terrible plot, terribly timely, pathetic characters and effects and yes, it uses the "B" standards. <br /> <br /> And for the guys: nothing, this movie is a terrible let down, some scenes that could have been good but you get nothing but build up without any delivery. <br /> <br /> This movie does not address anyone, terrible movie, it has been bad; plot, acting, B-flavor, special effects and everything else. Plus no nudity or eroticism for guys or girls.
