Like 'Singin' in the Rain, 'Cover Girl' has a trio of two guys and a girl. In 'Cover Girl' Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief. He agrees with Donald O'Connor's funny man section in 'Singin in the Rain'. In Cover Girl, Gene Kelly's love interest is Rita Hayworth and in 'Rain' it's Debbie Reynolds. This is where the equation ends. <br /> <br /> About "Singin 'in the Rain" is a classic American movie music, "Cover Girl" is mediocre incarnation. The story is not very complicated. Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) is a dancer in Danny MacGuire's low-rent nightclub in Brooklyn. Rusty decides to enter a Cover Girl game sponsored by a rich publisher, John Coudair, who made an unsuccessful game for Rusty's grandmother years ago. Coudair announces Rusty to Broadway producer Noel Wheaton who makes her star. Danny feels scarce when Rusty arrives late for rehearsals at the night club and decides to close the club and entertain troops with his sidekick Genius. At the last moment, with Rusty at the altar with Noel, she realized the mistakes of her ways and returned to Danny. They live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly has the least developed role in the movie. is that he owns a nightclub and is crazy in love with Rusty. Coudair and Wheaton act like contaminated teens in the direction of Rusty and Phil Silvers delivers a thorough goofy but unfunny shtick. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth's performance is the drunken scene. It shadows what happened to her in real life. Anyone who has read her biography will learn that she did not love Hollywood, who has chased away for a normal home life she could never reach, but eventually started drinking and eventually with Alzheimer's continued life in recent years. ended her life. <br /> Almost all songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful. Gene Kelly has just one very good dance number and it's the scene where he is dancing with his alter ego. Earlier, the trio has another number that is a light precursor to 'Make em Laugh' by 'Singin' in the Rain '. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way Rita Hayworth is put on a pedestal. A few decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem. Both actresses who later go into their careers will always try to find scripts that demonstrate their acting abilities. They wanted to be known as 'actresses' and not 'pinup girls'. Unfortunately, Cover Girl is an example of how Hollywood used women for financial gain.
