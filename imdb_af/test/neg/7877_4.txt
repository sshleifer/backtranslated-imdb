It's not a good movie. Flat and simple. Take out the hardcore sex scenes and what you have is a mediocre plot, average acting (at best), plodding direction, and dull dialogue. Add in the cave and you have mediocre plot, average acting, plodding direction, dull dialogue, with lashings of hardcore porn. Trouble is the porn is nothing special. So it's not a good movie, nor is it a good porn. It fails on both points. They can say that women made this movie and they wanted to do it with it, and so on, etc. But talking cheap, the end result is what counts, and what we have here is a mediocre movie with a little sex being thrown. for shock value to try to waste you to watch your time. One of those movies where you'd rather have the time you spent watching it back.
