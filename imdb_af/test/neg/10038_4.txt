I wanted to keep this movie. I really did. I was so excited when I saw the preview that scared hell out of me. But when I saw the real movie, I was disappointed. The acting is set, and efforts to comedy are out of place and forced. And I'm sorry, but a boy chased by a thirst in a bedpan is not funny or scary, it's just stupid. I grew up on the Bell Witch legend, so I know quite a bit about it. Many facts in the movie are right on the target, but this movie had to be much better. For example, the entire birthday party lasts about fifteen minutes, adds nothing to the plot or the story, and should be left on the cutter floor. A more heavy-handed editor could possibly get a decent movie out of this mess. <br /> <br /> Please understand, I'm not in any way, form or form involved with the other Bell Witch movie, and I'm not trying to attack this IMDb listing. I tell it just as it is.
