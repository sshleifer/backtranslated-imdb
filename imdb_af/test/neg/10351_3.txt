It's not too bad, but ultimately it's not the quality the Australian range has. <br /> <br /> The jokes are few and far between, the actors are attractive (it shouldn't be), the filmmakers think too much about cinematography (it's supposed to look like a home video) and it's just like a serious version of Kath and Kim. It's stupid. <br /> <br /> It's too normal to be Kath and Kim. . Kath and Kim are supposed to be two crooked, middle-aged women who think they are warm and wearing ridiculous clothes. There is no "Look at me Kimmy!" jokes. Kim's fat friend is not fat at all and she is not even stupid. She is a stereotypical black / latino chick. <br /> <br /> It's just not as stupid or funny as the Australian series. It doesn't compare. Nothing is the same. I admit, this show is sometimes funny, but it's not like the Aussie series. I was looking for an American bean family. They failed. It's supposed to be completely stupid and hilarious, but the actors don't stupid! For me, it's just a typical American TV show. This is a deviation if you want it to be like the Aussie show. <br /> <br /> 2 stars because it is an OKAY show, just nothing like it should be.
