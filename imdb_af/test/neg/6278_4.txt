I'm not a big fan of the Spielberg / Cruise version of this movie. And so I have to move in with the more humble Latt / Howel version. C Thomas Howel had more heart and more sympathy for Cruise (at least in my opinion). Now it's hard to imagine until you've driven everything out in the Spielberg version that costs more than a thousand dollars. There will be nothing more, no special effects, no sets, no cruises. Because I doubt anything costs more than a cool ground in the David Michael Latt version. So, to compare apples to rapeseed, I think I should go with the turnips. At least, it gives independent movies a shot at the epic science fiction disaster market.
