You have to be a fan of the little man, but I found Burlesque on Carmen dull, imaginative, and totally not funny. <br /> <br /> Chaplin tells the story of Carmen and plays a big role as Don Jose. This is a story about men and women they love, but it is unclear why one would love such a woman as Carmen, as she played the men against each other. <br /> <br /> As I said, I didn't think much about it. Chaplin has made dozens and dozens of better movies so you can leave this one on the shelf. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, I'm curious how the difference between this movie and the 1915 version is ... or is it just an IMDB error? <br /> <br /> Generally: 3/10.
