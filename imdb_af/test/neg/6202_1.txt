If you are planning to look at 'Partner' and on IMDb to read reviews about it, you've gone too much time on this stupid, idiotic, horrible movie. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible, horrible, horrible copy. of the movie 'Hitch.' I choose to ignore all the other warnings and bad reviews I've heard from this movie, and have wasted a valuable 20 minutes on it. I thought David Dhawan, who made everything, and it got Govinda, how bad could it be? But after 20 minutes of watching this nonsense, I couldn't take it anymore and shut down my computer. <br /> <br /> Overcoming everyone in the movie, stupid dialogues, total waste of time - I have a 1 star score because it's the lowest you can do. If I could go lower, I would have given it a 100 score.
