The Canterville Ghost (1996). The director made it too juicy a production. Maybe it's the generation, but I really liked the Charles Laughton version. There is a time and place for "emotional" and this production doesn't translate very well. Patrick Stewart, who was busy with Shakespeare, was very good, but still inappropriate. Will not recommend or watch again. The close-ups and stuffed text and subplots were lost to me. Adding strange material and scenes takes away from really good work. The author's writer has to find another appeal to misplace his talent, perhaps afternoon lunches will be a better place. Look at the really good version and give this one door.
