This movie was relatively good in the first part of the movie. <br /> <br /> We have a story, from 3 points of view. So let's find some clues and complete the story. <br /> <br /> Wait ... nothing of that matter, because the FBI guys are the bad guys! Although it was a big turn, it was almost a terrible turn. I immediately downgraded the movie of a 7 maybe 8 to 3, based on the last 10-15 minutes of it. <br /> <br /> Didn't anyone else see why the turn is so bad? Yes, it's a good shock. But it is bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the preceding hours and twenty minutes. There is no connection with the murderers. <br /> <br /> The killers are in about 5 minutes of this movie (as murderers) and the two FBI agents are only 15 minutes from the previous hour and twenty. /> <br /> We get it ... supervision ... Oh, the killers are voyeurs. WHAT'S NO SENSE, because they are only described in limited terms as just psychopaths. And the hour and twenty minutes we look at, go out of the window, because everyone is dead in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> All these things make the end even more ridiculous. Oh, in the beginning they killed a lot of FBI agents ... what FBI agents sleep together with? All in the same room. To be found by amateurs and killed by people who know nothing about FBI agents? A policeman who is 3 feet away, apparently can't hit one of the standard police commission pistols that can shoot several shots. I hate movies that try to make you feel that it can be if they make an absurd leap that they think we will believe. <br /> <br /> The other thing the movie ends about 10-15 minutes after being revealed as the killers with a girl standing somewhere in the field ...
