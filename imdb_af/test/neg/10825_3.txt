The frightening thing about this horror movie is that the end refers to a sequel. "The Cave" is really a disappointing action movie. A team of cave and undersea researchers go to Romania (one of these cheap places to make a movie now) and follow a destroyed church in a cave rich in underground monsters. Or are they daemons? The movie never decides whether it's action, science fiction or horror, it's a mixture of all without salt or fun, and acted on a wood species. The best thing about the movie is cinematography, but even the dark landscape of the cave gets boring soon, because the movie is not faster and the characters are simply not interesting. Waste of time.
