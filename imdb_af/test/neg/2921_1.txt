I think of a few things for this movie: First of all, it's really a very bad movie. It's really "Superbad". The movie looks very promising in the trailers, but has become flat ... Perhaps the original idea was good, but between a bad screenplay and a bad scene, the movie became boring and empty. My advice is not wasting 2 hours of your precious time. You're warned. This is the first movie I rated 1 star at IMDb.com ... Secondly, none of the characters are nice. You really don't care what happened to them ... Thirdly, the villain is very easy to identify. The grandson kills his father, sodomizes the friend's son, gets the daughter pregnant, blurs his grandfather ... As JT says, "If you want to get angry without retribution, it's your movie." Nothing more to say ...
