Although it makes it difficult for me to point out the comment board for this new series - mainly because I hate to give the false impression that there is actually any public interest - I feel compelled to throw in my slides on this one. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, I've never felt so much rooted in a TV show's fast and ruthless cancellation based solely on the merits of its promo ads. And if you're wondering, I'm a man. <br /> <br /> Listen, Comedy Network: Although your existing original programming already, we will politely say, of a "dubious" quality (I "I look at you," Girls Will Be Girls "). You really ignored yourself on this one. Anyone who makes this thing green can no longer be out of touch with what is right. <br /> <br /> Congratulations.
