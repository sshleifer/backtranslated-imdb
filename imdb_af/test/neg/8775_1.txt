Whatever the producer did, he completely missed. The Lone Ranger is not camp, but the "icon" for governors around the world. And this is a total violation of the spirit of the character that the only true Lone Ranger, Mr. Clayton Moore was forbidden to wear his mask in public performances when this movie was released. <br /> <br /> Help, long story Briefly, the single-saving grace of this brutal (and poor) distortion was that in that year I had the honor of Mr. Meet Clayton Moore in Columbus Ohio as part of a tour due to the bad pressure on Mr Moore's treatment. Needless to say, Moore's character, integrity and presence hid the film. <br /> <br /> Some things can't be done better. There is only one Lone Ranger.
