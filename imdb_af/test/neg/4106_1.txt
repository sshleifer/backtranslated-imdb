Bloody awful! There is no other way to put it. In fact, it is ** SO ** bad that the only reason I waste words on this is to warn other reasonable viewers who want intelligence entertainment. You will lose I.Q. points look at this. Think about it, it is not even suitable for sensible performance due to the irritation factor. There is no guilty pleasure to see something that is incompetent. <br /> <br /> Reasons to Avoid: <br /> <br /> 1) Terribly scientifically inaccurate, to the point where it is no longer sci-fi, it's just a messy, lazy fantasy . <br /> <br /> 2) This sports FX which is oysterless. Not even cheesy kitsch it's a wink and a wink, like vintage Doctor Who, but only cheap and scary to the point of being abusive. The FX is so bad they are not even laughing. They spent about a dollar-fifty on it. Not anymore. <br /> <br /> 3) The direction is so weak and unconscious that the only way the actors could make it to the end of shooting without being terminally depressed was to sleep through their roles, although Catherine McCormack anyway, attempted, probably in principle and in spite of the director. In addition, it is not Peter Hyams's only bad movie: his flubs hardly ever make much sense, of which Timecop was last, and it was 15 years before this writing. He had nothing fair, since (End of Days was just as slapdash, Arnold was the only draw, and he needed much stronger direction than Hyams provided). Hyams makes it more and more useless that anyone can consider giving him more work. <br /> <br /> And finally, <br /> <br /> 4) Ray Bradbury's stories deserve better treatment than this. Refuse to watch this movie, send the message, not that Hollywood especially listens. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk. If you do this and it completely disrupts you, you just blame yourself (and Hyams) for being more than adequately warned.
