I could have liked it if I didn't like Diane Arbus. <br /> <br /> Didn't really catch Arbus's unique visual aesthetic (as Stanley Kubrick did in "The Shinning", with the twin girls in the hallway, a direct tribute to one of Arbus's best-known photos, and one with haunting features, none of these movie films), and certainly not one of her character (outgoing), likeness (thin and Jewish, not Which Queen Kidman) or life save some very superficial agreements, she was a fashion that later photographed "freaks" and "outsiders". This film focuses on the "freak", as her symbol of artistic and personal empowerment, in a very level and predictable way. Besides, it might be an interesting movie about middle-class fetish, but I was too hard to care for. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if Arbus's name was turned off, it might have been less annoying, but it didn't have her name in the title. There would have been no interest in seeing me in the first place. A Letdown of "Secretary".
