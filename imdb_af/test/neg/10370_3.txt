I'm a big fan of the demonic puppets. Look at the surface of this one, it looks pretty good! You have Decapitron, the dolls, and a new villain in THE TOTEM! Unfortunately, the little punk this project does to create animations, inanimate objects, can't act. He stinks! His girlfriend is worse. If left out, it would probably be cool, BLADE VS. THE TOTEM. I'll see it for 2 hours. But instead, the movie role is played, and the whole movie suffered from it. The mystical skull man who created the totem is at its best, and Decapitron's appearance is long awaited, short and really disappointing. You'll be better off looking at the first one again.
