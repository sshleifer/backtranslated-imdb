I like bad movies, but this thing is a bustling hope. From the shaky cameramen to the horrible sound and devastating acting, don't fall for a moment on this heap. Fifth graders could have made a better film and first graders could have written a better script. Do you want a real summary? Ugly chicks in neon bikini dance too long. An independent plot has become worse due to ominous acting. The places in the place were not even wise. The church screens take place in a dance studio, and oh yes - what are the two tap dance numbers coming out of the blue? <br /> <br /> Oh, and the total number of naked breasts, which I didn't even save this movie - 0. Add this one to the trash.
