I won't deny that I enjoyed quite a bit of Japanese horror movies, but they all gotta get tired of seeing the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> The movie follows the story of resentment. Audrey, as asked by her mother, will get her sister back. But when she arrives, something strange happens to her sister and then her sister is killed. She wants to find out the truth behind the curse and later a photographer (Eason) joins her. On the other hand, something happens to a family and three girls, but it seems to be too late. <br /> <br /> In fact, I can't see the points for the three girls international school to appear in the movies, as it's not entirely related to the story. The reason why the woman holding the grudge continues to kill people is still not very clear (it seems to me that they are just telling the same things I saw in resentment). And the sudden appearance of Audrey before the boy is undoubtedly strange, which I suppose is an attempt to make the story about family-related. The deadly scenes are absolutely the mix of those in the Ring and Shibuya kaidan. The acting would be another bad point. As a Hong Kong, I would like to support Edison Chen's first attempt in Hollywood, but as a movie lover, I really can't find a point to support bad acting. Other actors like the father, although he only appeared in a few scenes, also had to do better. What's good is the atmosphere of the movie, especially when I watched it in the middle of the night. <br /> <br /> If you have time, really enjoy any horror movies and watch all the horror movies. Besides that, like me, you can try to kill it right away. But if you really enjoy Japanese horror movies of this kind, then you should spend time on the Japanese version of the Ring.
