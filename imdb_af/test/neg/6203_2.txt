David Dhawan copied HITCH and such an unofficial copy The movie is not even 1/2 as funny or amusing as the original it is boring with forced stories like the Lara track of a child and no hubby Plus there is a unwanted stupid Chota DON and David also try to reduce drama, but the film seems untouched, boring. Songs just come in, so make romance and everything a few funny Govinda scenes, the dance before interval, nothing else. The last few scenes are very funny, but there is too much too much <br /> <br /> David's direction is as bad as CHAPTER YEAR KYUN KIYAA, he has to change his style or try something good. Music is gracious, some songs are good, but the situations seem forced <br /> <br /> Govinda looks overweight and looks too loud and screams his lines into initial roles, but he comes in the groove and gives his best in the office and the scene with Salman in his cabin and at the end <br /> <br /> Salman just plays himself and his nasal tone plus his fake acting style is a headache <br /> <br /> Lara is avoidable, Katrina is as normal falling. <br /> <br /> The child overworked
