Oh, another movie with motorcycles, hell's angels and Steve A-Lame-o as the not-so-cool driver. This movie does not relate to story, but lots of drinking, pot smoking, and many moronic acts. Steve's version of a dying cat during his "I love what I know" has chosen serenade for hours. Bike chick Linda (rrrr) does it with everyone! Fats are the best because he just makes sounds and sounds. I also dare you to find out what Banjo says. "You have a private private inventory." This is the writing of people. <br /> <br /> I like the end. What better place to have the climax than a lighthouse! You have to see it to disregard it. <br /> <br /> The Jeter dies !!!
